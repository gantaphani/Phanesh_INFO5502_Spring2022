an amended petition under welfare and institutions code section alleged that minor george julius made three criminal threats,hereinafter section.it alleged that mary was the victim in count,william rasmussen was the victim in count,and erin was the victim in count.after a contested jurisdictional hearing,the juvenile court sustained the allegations involving mary and erin but dismissed count.at the dispositional hearing,the juvenile court adjudged julius to be a ward of the court and ordered him committed to the juvenile hall for days.on appeal julius contends the evidence was insufficient to prove that he made a criminal threat within the meaning of section.alternatively,he contends his case must be remanded because the juvenile court failed to specify whether the offenses were misdemeanors or felonies.
mary was taking an honors english class at the santa teresa high school hereinafter santa teresa in the eastside union high school district in the spring of when julius transferred into the school from another school on march,he joined mary english class.there was one row of desks between mary and julius so that they could not talk in class at all.on friday,march,there was a substitute teacher in the english class.on that date,towards the end of class,julius moved to a vacant seat closer to mary,handed her three pieces of paper written in ink,and said,read these.the top page said,these poems describe me and my feelings.tell me if they describe you and your feelings.as he approached mary with the papers,he asked her,is there a poetry club here when julius handed mary the papers,he was not laughing or joking.he had a straight face and appeared serious.his face showed no emotion it was just blank.
mary read julius paper titled faces in its entirety while in class.the page she read was on lined notebook paper.in the space above the first line julius had written the words dark poetry.the contents appeared on the page as follows 
who are these faces around me 
where did they come from 
they would probably become the 
next doctors or loirs sic or something.all 
really intelligent and ahead in their 
game.i wish i had a choice on 
what i want to be like they do.
all so happy and vagrant.each 
origonal sic in their own way.they 
make me want to puke.for i am 
dark,destructive,dangerous.i 
slap on my face of happiness but 
inside i am evil for i can be 
the next kid to bring guns to 
kill students at school.so parents 
watch your children cuz i back 
the note was signed by julius aka angel.
after reading the note,mary became visibly upset and just wanted to get out of the classroom.she handed all three pages back to julius,who just put them away without saying anything.neither before nor after julius handed mary the note did he tell her anything like he was just kidding i do really think this.
mary found the contents of the paper personally threatening to her as a student because julius described himself as dark,deceptive,and dangerous and because he indicated he could be the next kid to bring guns to kill students at school.so parents,watch your children cuz i back.mary felt julius was threatening her life because his threat to kill students included me also.having taken the page entitled faces as a death threat,she left the school campus as fast as she possibly could to get away from julius and whatever thoughts he had in mind.she became very frightened and remained so throughout the weekend and the following week.she was afraid to go to school.based upon her fear,mary spoke to her parents within minutes after she came home from school on march,and her parents seemed alarmed.her father tried to call the school but it was closed.on the morning of saturday,march,mary relayed a summary of the contents of the paper julius had given her to her regular english teacher through.the only other person she told about the three papers between march and was her friend chrissy.
up until march,mary had had about three conversations with julius,mainly about what time it was.she never had spoken with him about philosophy or anything like that.she never had intimated to julius that she was someone who liked to do violence on campus or participate in any kind of violent criminal activity.julius never had told mary that he was really angry or upset at,or that he was thinking about doing violence to,a particular student or teacher.
during the weeks before march,the english class was reading the sun also rises by ernest hemingway.there were no poetry assignments in that class,and mary was not involved in the school poetry club.mary had noticed that the page titled faces had the expression dark poetry on the top when she read it.mary understood the term to mean a poem that was entirely about a ngry threats any thoughts that are positive.
on friday,march,julius also approached erin,another student at santa teresa.erin was with natalie at the time.erin had no personal relationship with julius,but she had spoken with him three or four times.on this occasion,julius handed erin one piece of folded up paper and asked her to read it.it was the same page entitled faces that julius had given mary.erin was late for her next class.she opened up the paper and pretended to read it to be polite,but she did not read it.she then put the paper in her jacket pocket.she forgot about it over the weekend 
on the evening of march,william rasmussen,mary regular english teacher,returned home and read her describing the threats julius had made.rasmussen called mary on the telephone.mary sounded shaky and very concerned,and rasmussen called police.
on monday,march,police were present at santa teresa.when asked about the paper that julius had given her,erin pulled it from her pocket and read it for the first time.reading that page made erin very scared.she broke down crying and was extremely in shock.when erin first read the note,she believed the words were a threat to her life and,at the time of the jurisdictional hearing,she still was scared by what she had read.she felt her life and the lives of her friends were in danger because julius said that he can bring guns to school and kill students.she reiterated that she felt the writing was a definite threat.erin was not a member of the school poetry club,she had no interest in writing poetry,and she was unfamiliar with the expression dark poetry on the page julius had given her.
the prosecution presented evidence of a death threat julius had made against kathryn,another santa teresa student.at the jurisdictional hearing,kathryn recanted her prior statements regarding julius threat,including statements she had made to her father,friends,and the district attorney examining her on the witness stand.kathryn admitted she had told her close friend erin that julius had said he was going to kill her.kathryn mentioned the threat to erin after erin told her she had been to court about this present case and that she had received a threatening letter from julius in which he said he wanted to kill people at the school.when kathryn had described julius threat to the district attorney,she had said julius was smiling and was s erious.when the prosecutor said kathryn would have to come to court to testify,kathryn said she was scared to do so,that she was afraid to face julius,and that she had lied about julius threat.at the hearing,she testified that julius never made a threat against her.she also testified that she was scared to come to court,that she had told the prosecutor she was afraid to face julius,and that they had discussed whether julius would retaliate if she testified.she said she still was concerned about retaliation from julius.
william rasmussen testified he did not teach poetry in the honors english class in which mary and julius were enrolled.he had spoken to julius for about five minutes since julius had joined the class.the conversation had involved clarification of an assignment.rasmussen had not had any experience with julius in which he felt personally threatened nor had the two ever had an argument.rasmussen described dark poetry as foreboding and having to do with death and inflicting major bodily pain and suffering.he read the page entitled faces for the first time on the day he testified.after reading it,he felt a solutely threatened and in fear for his safety and his students safety.rasmussen also said reading mary made him afraid that one of his students was going to come to his class and he could have a bullet whizzing past his ear.he interpreted the written words in faces to be an immediate and specific threat to him.
officer pach tran contacted julius at the house where he was staying with his uncle.when tran asked whether there were guns in the house,julius nodded affirmatively.patrick williams testified that his nephew julius and julius father were staying at his home in march.at that time,williams had a hunting rifle,a smith and wesson special revolver,and ammunition for both guns,in the house he was surprised to learn that julius knew about the guns.
tran testified that julius took a piece of paper with writing on it from his pocket and gave it to tran.on the upper right comer of the unlined paper were the words dark poetry.the unsigned page,which was in printing,read as follows 
faces in my head 
look at all these faces around me.
they look so vagrant.
they have their whole lives ahead of them.
they have their own indivisaulity sic.
those kind of people make me wan na puke.
for i am a slave to very evil masters.
i have no future that i choose for myself.
i feel as if i am going to go crazy.
probably i would be the next high school killer.
a little song keeps playing in my head.
my daddy is worth a dollar not even cents.
as i look at these faces around me 
i wonder why r they so happy.
what do they have that i do.
am i the only one with the messed up mind.
then i realized,i cursed 
natalie testified on behalf of julius as follows.natalie got to know julius by meeting him after school for an hour to an hour and a half.on march,julius gave her a poem to read after school.natalie took it home.the two previously had discussed the fact that julius wrote poetry.when natalie cleaned her room,she shredded several papers.she tore up julius paper and threw it away on the same day he gave it to her.natalie said she did not believe julius was a violent person she thought he was mild and calm and very serene.rather than viewing julius writing as a threat,natalie said it made her feel sad.at trial,a portion of the piece of paper julius gave natalie was presented to the court.the legible portion of that writing read as follows 
ns i created 
cause i really 
feel as if 
in stolen from 
taken to a 
place that you hate.you r 
locked up and when you r 
let out of your cage it is to 
perform.not able to 
be yourself and always 
hiding thinking would people 
like me if i behaved differently 
by julius aka angel 
in his testimony,julius acknowledged he wrote all of the pages quoted above.he conceded his words in the page entitled faces would be scary and frightening and would obviously threaten a fellow student if the recipient did not know him and did not know he was just kidding.
julius said he wrote faces on march,during the period english class he had with mary,because he was having a bad day.he could not find something he was looking for in his backpack and he then went without lunch because his parents forgot to give him money.julius said this was his first poem having to do with killing,that,usually,his poems were about lost angels or an imaginary character.that day,the only way he could get his thoughts out was by writing them down.he put in the reference to killing because he and his friends joke about the columbine killings,saying,oh,i going to be the next columbine kid i going to shoot everybody at the school.his reference to columbine in his poem was just a joke.he did not intend faces to be a threat to anyone.
julius testified he wrote the poem who am i during lunch on march and wrote faces in my head on march because he was trying to recollect what he had written in faces so he could put it in his poem file.he testified he did not give mary faces or any writing but acknowledged that mary to rasmussen referenced language in faces.
julius said he took faces outside with him after class on march and was about to put it in his backpack when erin and natalie asked about it.erin asked julius for a poem,saying she collects them.julius had faces and who am i in his hands erin picked faces and natalie picked who am he said erin was not truthful when she testified that he handed her the paper and she ran off to class without reading it.
julius said he did not intend either his faces or who am i poems to be a threat.he knew erin and natalie collected poems and that they wanted his poems for their files.he acknowledged the language in his poems would be frightening and threatening if erin and natalie did not know him and realize he was not serious,but he thought they would see the poems as a joke.he also believed both wrote dark poetry so they would not be scared by his poems.he wrote the words dark poetry at the top of his poem because he wanted the reader to know this was dark poetry.he testified that he believed dark poetry did not suggest that the writer was going to do what he wrote.
julius said he did not know either mary or kathryn,and he denied making any threat to kathryn.asked why kathryn would be afraid of retaliation,he said it was because she knows she lied and because,even if she had told the truth when she reported that julius had threatened her,she probably was scared of saying it in front of a young black male.julius also believed officer tran lied on the witness stand,possibly because he had been bribed by the school district.
julius believed the school district had been out to get him for at least two years.he had been in three different schools in the last couple of months,having been asked to leave other schools.in one school,he was caught plagiarizing from the internet,but he felt they were discriminating against him because he had only two weeks to do the assignment while others had had three months.he got in trouble at one school for urinating on the wall,but he explained that he had had a bladder problem at the time.julius also felt the school district was out to get him because he was kicked out of one high school because he did not live in the district anymore and because an english teacher gave him a lower grade than he deserved.julius added that he and his mother had caught one of the directors at oak grove high school in a lie.
ii.discussion 
sufficiency of the evidence to support section findings 
to prove a violation of section,the prosecution must establish that the defendant willfully threaten ed to commit a crime which will result in death or great bodily injury to another person,that the defendant made the threat with the specific intent that the statement is to be taken as a threat,even if there is no intent of actually carrying it out,that the may be made verbally,in writing,or by means of an electronic communication device was on its face and under the circumstances in which it was made,so unequivocal,unconditional,immediate,and specific as to convey to the person threatened,a gravity of purpose and an immediate prospect of execution of the threat,that the threat actually caused the person threatened to be in sustained fear for his or her own safety or for his or her immediate family safety,and that the threatened person fear was reasonabl e under the circumstances.citation.people toledo cal th,d.referring to the element subdivisions set forth in the toledo opinion,julius contends that,i n the present case,sufficient evidence of elements,and are lacking.
the juvenile court findings 
before turning to julius specific claims,we set forth the juvenile court remarks supporting its finding that julius had made criminal threats to mary and erin.the juvenile court prefaced its findings with the following remark,all right.i given this case a lot of thought as i been hearing the evidence.i did really have a conclusion until after i heard julius speak.the juvenile court explained that,with respect to the evidence,i think a very telling response of the minor was that his own she saw this poetry of his,would deem it to be a threat.she would be concerned about it.it would be something that would really,really affect her.so i think the language in and of itself is extremely frightening,very threatening,and certainly falls within the categories of the statute and i looked at the testimony of the witnesses and observed them.i observed the minor and his testimony.i heard his testimony.and i convinced in my mind that there only one rational conclusion,and that is that when he gave those poems to those two girls,that those poems were intended to be a threat.and i tell you why.you see,first of all we have his testimony that he was not upset,but he was depressed because he had a bad day.okay.we know he had a lot of bad days in school going back to his being rejected from two schools and now he in the third school.the other thing is,is it really critical when you look at the circumstances,the surrounding circumstantial evidence.look,if he been in the poetry class and there has been discussions about dark poetry involving killing,shootings,destroying lives,that would have been a different situation.that would have been circumstances against it would be innocent intent.but there nothing to establish that at all.secondly,the girls,they themselves the two girls,erin and both had totally out of the clear blue sky,they get this shocking document or documents just shocks them.it was so shocking to them that mary decided to write the to the english teacher and let him know that was really something.in fact,she was so scared she did even want to give her name,but because of the,her name was automatically disclosed.the other girl,when she read it,it really petrified her.there was nothing to establish that there was a relationship.there was nothing to establish that he was not serious.there was nothing to establish that it was an a poetry exercise.i think it reasonable to conclude that if somebody gave me that poem,except that they had the courthouse or this department,i would not conceive of it to be a joke.furthermore,anybody that did it and did have something to surround it,to explain to me that it was,in fact,a joke,my feeling of the evidence and the interpretation is that person intended for me to be afraid,to be a threat.
standard of review 
in considering julius insufficiency claims,we review the entire record in the light most favorable to the prosecution and presume in support of the jurisdictional order the existence of every fact the trier reasonably could have deduced from the evidence to determine whether there is substantial evidence to support each of the essential elements.people johnson cal d.
evidence of a threat to commit a crime 
julius first contends the evidence was insufficient to support the juvenile court findings that the words in his paper entitled faces constitute a threat as opposed to clearly the imaginative exploration of the inner feelings of a young person.he argues that his writing was simply a prose poem in which a fictional character says he is capable of committing criminal acts rather than a direct statement of personal intent.
in considering whether there was substantial evidence presented to support the juvenile court finding that the writing faces constitutes a threat by julius with the specific intent that his words were to be taken as a threat,we consider all the surrounding circumstances and not just on the words alone.the parties history can also be considered as one of the relevant circumstances.citations.people mendoza th,d.here,as in mendoza,the trier of fact was free to interpret the words from all of the surrounding circumstances of the case.id.at,d.the circumstances surrounding the threat include the mannerisms,affect,and actions involved in making the threat as well as subsequent actions taken by the minor.people solis th,d.section requires only that the words used be of an immediately threatening nature and convey an immediate prospect of execution even though the threatener may have no intent actually to engage in the threatened conduct.the threat is sufficient if it induces a sustained fear.the statute does not require the showing of an immediate ability to carry out the stated threat.in re david d.section does not require details such as a time or precise manner of execution to be expressed.ibid.
here,julius testified that he wrote the page titled faces,and he acknowledged that his words,on their face,were frightening and threatening.julius statements that he was dark,destructive,dangerous,that he can slap on his face of happiness but inside he is evil,and that he can be the next kid to bring guns to kill students at school,along with his warning that parents should watch their children cuz he s back conveyed a threat to commit a crime which will result in death or great bodily injury to another person.section.the statements were not made in the context of a poetry course or a poetry assignment,and the students had not been asked to show each other their writings.even julius english teacher,who was familiar with the concept of dark poetry and dark literature,testified that he felt personally threatened after reading the words julius had handed to two students at santa teresa.
the history of the parties involved and the context in which the threats were made provide strong circumstantial evidence that julius intended his words to be taken as a threat.here,julius was new to santa teresa and only had been in rasmussen class for eight days when he handed faces to mary.she had had no previous interaction with julius except to ask what time it was.julius admitted he hardly even kn e w her.as noted above,the class was not studying poetry.julius approached mary in class with a serious blank face and handed her faces to read.significantly,along with that page,he wrote a note indicating that his words in faces expressed me and my feelings.italics added.when she read faces,mary became visibly upset.she handed it and the other paper back to julius,who put them in his backpack without saying anything.
later that day,julius approached erin and handed his faces writing to her.erin had no relationship with julius he was just a student at her school.she pretended to read the paper to be polite before rushing to her next class.when she later read it,she became very scared and broke down in tears.erin was not a member of the school poetry club,had no interest in writing poetry,and never had written dark poetry.
the fact that there was no ongoing relationship between julius and either mary or erin and that the two girls were not studying poetry or involved in the school poetry club and that julius handed over the faces writing without any accompanying indication that he was joking or that its words should not be taken seriously provided evidence that julius intended his writing as a threat to be taken seriously.
additional circumstances support the conclusion that the writing faces constituted a threat and that julius intended it to be taken as a threat.julius had been in three schools in the past couple of months,having been asked to leave his previous schools because of behavioral problems.he believed the school district has always been out to get him,at least for the past two years,and that it may have gone so far as to bribe the investigating officer in this case.julius also believed the principal at one school had colluded with a teacher who gave him an undeservedly low grade.julius views of the school district and the schools he had attended in that district and his list of incidents in which he felt he had been wronged or discriminated against by schools in the district are part of the surrounding circumstances which support a finding that the words in faces were intended as a threat to get back at the school district and its schools.the evidence of julius relationship to the school district,along with the manner in which he presented his writing to mary and erin,support the finding that julius presentation of his faces writing to both girls was intended to terrorize innocent students,including mary and erin,even if he had no intention of carrying out the threats.
in addition,the juvenile court was entitled to consider as part of the circumstances surrounding julius handing faces to mary and erin the evidence that julius had threatened to kill another female student at the same school since her testimony strongly suggested that she recanted her statements because she feared retaliation from julius.the fact that kathryn had told her father and the district attorney handling julius case that julius made a death threat against her provided additional circumstantial evidence that the writing constituted a threat and that julius intended his words to be taken as a threat.
the fact that julius apparently had surreptitiously discovered there were two firearms and ammunition in his uncle home where he was staying during the month in question provide further evidence that julius intended his words to be taken as a threat.
finally,the juvenile court could take into account the fact that julius referred to killing in his writing because he and his friends kind of joke d about the columbine killings,saying,oh,i going to be the next columbine kid i going to shoot everybody at the school.the fact that the writing in question mentioned the student killings at columbine and was directly delivered to students within a school context constitutes an additional circumstance surrounding its delivery supporting the conclusion that the writing faces constituted a threat and that julius intended it to be taken as a threat.
we are not persuaded by julius claim that faces was written from the viewpoint of a fictional character in a poem since julius handed it to mary with a sheet of paper on top that said,in part,these poems describe me and my feelings.instead,we are convinced that the circumstances surrounding the delivery of the page entitled faces to mary and to erin demonstrate that julius made a threat to each girl with the specific intent that the statements were to be taken as a personal threat.
we similarly are not persuaded by julius claim that he had a first amendment right to communicate with his fellow students by choosing,somewhat unwisely in retrospect,to share his feelings of teenage angst with two other students by giving them a dark poem,in which he expressed negative emotions.in support of this claim,julius cites tinker des moines independent community school district,d,which held that it was a violation of the first amendment rights of students at public high schools to deny those students the right to wear black arm bands in protest of the vietnam war.in particular,he relies upon the portion of the opinion that held the constitutional rights of public school students are not confined to the supervised and ordained discussion which takes place in the classroom among school activities is personal intercommunication among the students.this is not only an inevitable part of the process of attending school it is also an important part of the educational process.id.at,fn.omitted.however,julius fails to mention that the tinker court recognized that regulation of speech of conduct of students would not violate their constitutional rights to free speech if it could be shown that such words or conduct would materially and substantially disrupt the work of the school.citation.id.at.we are convinced that julius written communication,which reasonably conveyed to fellow students,both on its face and under the surrounding circumstances,that their lives and the lives of fellow students were in danger was a constitutionally unprotected communication which reasonably could lead to substantial disruption of or material inference with school activities.id.at.
the recent decision in in re ryan th,d,in which the court held that a juvenile painting in which he is depicting shooting a police officer does not constitute a criminal threat,does not alter our opinion that the writings in this case constitute a criminal threat.in that case,a month after officer lori macphail issued minor ryan a citation for possessing marijuana,the minor turned in an art project for the high school painting class he was taking.the painting depicted a person who appeared to be a minor discharging a handgun at the back of the head of a female officer wearing the same badge number macphail wears.the painting depicted blood on the officer hair and pieces of her flesh and face blowing away.id.at,d.when confronted about the painting,the minor admitted he was the shooter and macphail was the victim in the painting,that he was angry with macphail because of the citation,and that it was reasonable to expect she would eventually see the picture.ibid.when shown the painting,macphail expressed concern that the shooting could be carried out.id.at,d.at the jurisdictional hearing,the minor testified the painting was an expression of his angry feelings,that he did not expect the painting to be shown to macphail,that he did not intend the painting to scare her,and that he turned in the painting expecting to get a grade or credit for it without getting in trouble.ibid.in concluding that the evidence fails to establish the minor intended to convey a threat to officer macphail and that,under the circumstances in which it was presented,the paining did not convey a gravity of purpose and immediate prospect of the execution of a crime that would result in death or great bodily injury to macphail,id.at,d the court explained that the ambiguity of the painting intent could be resolved by surrounding circumstances.id.at,d.the court decided that the circumstances of that particular case did not support a finding that the minor painting met the requirements of section because a fter completing the painting,the minor took it to class and turned it in for credit,nothing suggests the minor remained in a rage for the entire month between the incident which sparked the painting and its creation,the minor did not display the painting to macphail,put it in a location where he knew she would see it,or communicate in any way with her to advise her that she should see the painting.id.at,d.in light of the above circumstances,the court found that the evidence was insufficient to establish that,at the time the minor acted,he harbored the specific intent that the painting would be displayed to macphail.the court also found that,under the circumstances,as a perceived threat the painting was not so unequivocal,unconditional,immediate,and specific as to convey a gravity of purpose and an immediate prospect of the execution of a crime against officer macphail that would result in death or great bodily injury,in part because it was not accompanied by any words,on the painting or otherwise,such as this will be you,i do have a gun,you know,or watch out and,in part,because the school authorities,the victim,and the police failed to take immediate action against the minor upon observing the painting.id.at,d.by contrast,in the instant case,julius did not write his alleged poems as part of a school assignment or turn them into his english teacher for a grade or credit.instead,he directly handed his writings to his victims,and he warned them and their parents to watch out because he could be the next kid to bring guns to kill students at school.
in sum,we conclude there is sufficient evidence in the record to support the finding of the juvenile court that julius made a threat within the meaning of section and that he had the specific intent that his written statement was to be taken as a threat.section.
we similarly conclude there is sufficient evidence in the record to support the juvenile court finding that the threats in question were so unequivocal,unconditional,immediate,and specific as to convey to mary and erin a gravity of purpose and an immediate prospect of execution of the threat section.the use of the word so indicates that unequivocality,unconditionality,immediacy,and specificity are not absolutely mandated,but must be sufficiently present in the threat and surrounding circumstances to convey gravity of purpose and immediate prospect of execution to the victim.the four qualities are simply the factors to be considered in determining whether a threat,considered together with its surrounding circumstances,conveys those impressions to the victim.people stanfield th,d.here,julius stated without qualification that he was dangerous and destructive and then said he could be the next kid to bring guns to kill students at school.since julius gave the paper directly to mary and erin,each reasonably could believe the threat was directed at them as well as other students at their school,and the statement identified the means by which the threat would be carried out.the fact that julius wrote a note explaining that this writing in faces described me and my feelings belies his claim that the vehicle is a poem,not a statement of personal intent to do anything.the fact that julius made his threat near the end of friday classes suggests the relatively immediate prospect of its execution on the following monday.mary learned of the threat near the end of her period class on friday.she left school as quickly as possible and within a half hour told her parents about the threat the next morning,she her english teacher a summary of the contents of the threat,and the teacher called the police after talking with mary.regarding mary perception of the immediacy of the threat,she testified that,upon hearing of the threat,she decided to leave the school campus as fast as she possibly could because she perceived the writing as a death threat and she therefore wanted to get away from julius and whatever thoughts he had in mind.she became very frightened and remained so throughout the weekend and the following week.she was afraid to go to school.
the fact that julius threat said he can be the next student to bring guns to school and kill students rather than he will be the next student to do so is not significant.as noted above,the reference to an unconditional threat in section is not absolute.people bolin cal th,d.only those threats whose conditions preclude them from conveying a gravity of purpose and imminent prospect of execution people stanfield,supra,th at,d fall outside the statute.nothing in julius threat contained such conditions.
we are convinced that julius written threat was on its face and under the circumstances in which it was made,so unequivocal,unconditional,immediate,and specific as to convey to the person threatened,a gravity of purpose and an immediate prospect of execution of the threat.people toledo,supra,cal th at,d.
we next turn to julius argument that the evidence was insufficient to establish that either mary or erin experienced the reasonable sustained fear required by section.the phrase to cause that person reasonably to be in sustained fear for his or her own safety has a subjective and an objective component.a victim must actually be in sustained fear,and the sustained fear must also be reasonable under the circumstances.in re ricky th,d.defining the word sustained by its opposites,we find that it means a period of time that extends beyond what is momentary,fleeting,or transitory.people allen th,d requirement met where defendant arrested minutes after making armed threat to kill victim and her daughter.the victim knowledge of the prior conduct of the person making the threat is relevant in proving that the victim was in a state of sustained fear.ibid.
here,mary testified that she was afraid when she first read the note,that she was afraid for the entire weekend,and that she was afraid to go to school.when erin first read the note,she believed the words were a threat to her life and,at the time of the jurisdictional hearing,she still was scared by what she had read.she felt her life and the lives of her friends were in danger just the fact that julius said he can bring guns to school and kill students.the girls fear was premised upon the words written on the page entitled faces,upon the fact that julius did not do or say anything that would have led them to believe he was joking or not serious about the content of the writing,upon the fact that he handed them the paper despite barely knowing them,and upon the fact that there was no reason julius would have shared this writing within the context of a school class or school assignment.in light of the previously described circumstances which precipitated the threat,we conclude there was substantial evidence in the record that julius threat that he could be the next student to come to school with guns and kill fellow students induced in mary and erin sustained fear which was reasonable under the circumstances.
in summary,we conclude substantial evidence supports the juvenile court finding that minor george julius made two criminal threats within the meaning of section.
remand for juvenile court to declare offenses felonies or misdemeanors 
the people correctly concede that this case should be remanded with directions to the juvenile court to declare the offenses to be either felonies or misdemeanors.
section can be punished as either a misdemeanor or felony.welfare and institutions code section provides that,in a juvenile proceeding,i f the minor is found to have committed an offense which would in the case of an adult be punishable alternatively as a felony or a misdemeanor,the court shall declare the offense to be a misdemeanor or felony.this requirement is obligatory welfare and institutions code section means what it says and mandates the juvenile court to declare the offense a felony or misdemeanor.citations.in re manzy cal th,d.the determinative factor is whether the record demonstrates that the court actually exercised its discretion.id.at,d.
here,where the record fails to show that the juvenile court declared the offenses misdemeanors or felonies,the matter must be remanded for this limited purpose.
