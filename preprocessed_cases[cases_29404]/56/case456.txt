in this proceeding,we determine that the juvenile court does not have the authority to impose a fourth amendment waiver as a condition of informal supervision under welfare and institutions code sections and.accordingly,we grant derick petition for a writ of prohibition to vacate the fourth amendment waiver imposed as a condition of his informal supervision under section 
factual and procedural background 
on march,the people filed a section petition alleging that on november,derick had unlawfully driven a vehicle while under the influence of an alcoholic beverage and a drug and under their combined influence,subd.a count a misdemeanor,had unlawfully driven a vehicle while having a blood alcohol content of percent or more,subd.b count a misdemeanor,had driven a vehicle while being a person under the age of who had a blood alcohol content of percent or more,subd.a count an infraction,and had driven a vehicle while being a person under the age of who knowingly possessed and carried an alcoholic beverage within the vehicle,subd.a count a misdemeanor.after being arraigned,derick denied all counts and the court set a hearing date to consider a motion to continue the proceedings under section et.
on may,derick filed his motion to continue the proceedings and place him on informal supervision under sections and,which was opposed by the people.on may,the juvenile court granted the motion under section to continue the proceedings for six months with derick and his consent,ordered derick to comply with a program of supervision and set the matter for a later hearing on whether a fourth amendment waiver as a condition of informal supervision could also be imposed.
on may,after considering opposing points and authorities on the issue and hearing oral argument,the juvenile court ruled it had the authority to impose a fourth amendment waiver condition for section informal supervision in light of the allegations that both alcohol and marijuana were involved in this case.the judge specifically stated she was mindful that she did not have unfettered discretion in setting forth the terms of informal supervision under section.however,under the circumstances for the reasons previously noted in this proceeding,as well as at the time that the request was granted,the court believes it is appropriate in the rehabilitation of derick through section to impose a fourth amendment waiver.however,because section is a voluntary contract if he is not agreeable to that provision,then i will set aside the contract.when derick counsel responded that derick did not want to set aside the contract,but objected to the fourth amendment waiver,the court overruled the objection and imposed the waiver as a condition of derick informal supervision under section.
on july,derick filed a petition for writ of prohibition with this court to bar the juvenile court from imposing the fourth amendment waiver condition.after receiving an informal response to the petition,we issued an order to show cause why the relief derick requests should not be granted,noting that absent objection,the informal response would be deemed the return to the petition,a reply could be filed by august,and the parties could request oral argument by august.no objection,reply or request for oral argument has been filed.
discussion 
derick claims the juvenile court exceeded its jurisdiction by unlawfully imposing a fourth amendment waiver as a condition of his informal supervision under section.he specifically argues that the plain language and stated philosophy and purpose of sections and,which essentially provide for a diversion type program to keep minors out of the juvenile justice system and avoid true findings of criminal culpability,when contrasted with other statutory provisions for juvenile offenders such as section et,which provides for a diversion program that mandates a fourth amendment waiver as a condition in every grant of deferred entry of judgment,supports the conclusion that the legislature did not intend the court to have authority to impose a fourth amendment waiver where the minor is placed on informal supervision under sections and without entering a plea.derick analogizes his situation to the adult diversion program in penal code section et and a line of authority frederick justice court d.frederick,terry superior court th,d terry,scott cir,which has overturned fourth amendment waivers because they were not mentioned as a condition the court could impose under that statutory program.
the people take issue with derick claim,asserting the imposition of a fourth amendment waiver falls within the juvenile court broad discretion to impose reasonable conditions of probation on juveniles who are more in need of guidance and supervision than adults and whose constitutional rights are more circumscribed.in re antonio th,d.the people distinguish frederick,supra,d,on grounds it involved an adult offender and a statute that imposed specific conditions as a requirement of diversion as compared to the statutory provisions here that do not impose a specific condition as a requirement for informal supervision,but only the delineation of specific programs of supervision to address the needs of the minor.the people argue that the fourth amendment waiver imposed in this case was proper because it was not overly intrusive,it was tailored to meet the needs of a minor who had been driving under the influence of alcohol and who had a pipe in the car,which smelled of marijuana,and it would deter the minor from carrying illegal items in the car and help him avoid peer pressure.
as we explain,even recognizing the broad discretion of the juvenile court to impose reasonable probationary conditions upon a minor who comes under its jurisdiction,we determine the court does not have the authority to impose a fourth amendment waiver as a condition of informal supervision under sections and.
a.the pertinent statutory framework 
the legislature has mandated that minors who fall within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court as a result of delinquent behavior shall,in conformity with the interests of public safety and protection,receive care,treatment,and guidance that is consistent with their best interest,that holds them accountable for their behavior,and that is appropriate for their circumstances.this guidance may include punishment that is consistent with the rehabilitative objectives of this chapter,subd.b see in re th,d.consistent with this mandate,the legislature enacted section,which this court has explained authorizes an informal supervision program for a minor who in the opinion of the probation officer is,or will probably soon be,within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.the purpose of the informal supervision program is to provide assistance and services to the minor and the minor family to adjust the situation and avoid further involvement in the formal juvenile criminal justice system in section was enacted to permit the court to order a section informal supervision program for a minor after a section petition has been filed.in re adam th,d,fn.omitted in re abdirahman th,d.
the underlying purpose of section informal supervision is to avoid a true finding on criminal culpability,which would result in a criminal record for the minor.in re abdirahman,supra,th at,d in re adam,supra,th at,d.by enacting section,the legislature intended to further address delinquency at its inception,indeed at its earliest signs,within a less structured program,even after the filing of the petition.to meet this objective it gave the courts more authority to deal with minors before they become habitual criminals.section created a new power in the juvenile courts by allowing them to order informal supervision after a petition had been filed.this power is in addition to the probation officer already existing prepetition discretion.citations.in re armondo th,d in re adam,supra,th at,d in re adam th,d.
in other words,section provides the court with discretion to order informal supervision postpetition but before adjudication of the charges alleged in the petition,rather than continuing with the petition proceedings if under section the court orders the minor to participate in a program of informal supervision as set forth in section and the minor satisfactorily completes that program,the petition must be dismissed.if the minor does not satisfactorily complete the program,there is no statutory provision for dismissal of the petition rather,the proceedings on the petition continue.in re adam,supra,th at,d,quoting in re adam,supra,th,d.
concerning the program of informal supervision,section provides that it may call for the minor to obtain care and treatment for the misuse of or addiction to controlled substances from a county mental health service or other appropriate community agency.section also states that t he program of supervision shall require the parents or guardians of the minor to participate with the minor in counseling or education programs,including,but not limited to,parent education and parenting programs operated by community colleges,school districts,or other appropriate agencies designated by the court if the program of supervision is pursuant to the procedure prescribed in section.moreover,a ny minor who is placed in a program of supervision set forth in section or for a violation of an offense for violating section or of the vehicle code,shall be required to participate in and successfully complete an alcohol or drug education program from a county mental health agency or other appropriate community program.
in addition,in,the legislature added section which provides that a program of supervision pursuant to section or for any minor described in section shall include constructive assignments that will help the minor learn to be responsible for his or her actions.the assignments may include,but not be limited to,requiring the minor to perform at least hours of community service,requiring the minor to repair damaged property or to make other appropriate restitution,or requiring the minor to participate in an educational or counseling program added by stats,ch.
if the program of informal supervision is not satisfactorily completed and the petition continues,after adjudication of the charges alleged in the petition,t here is no procedure for converting a section,subdivision a formal probation disposition into a section informal supervision program they are two separate,mutually exclusive programs.the section informal supervision alternative is selected prior to adjudication of the petition allegations and the jurisdictional hearing is continued for at least six months.the section,subdivision a alternative is selected at the dispositional hearing after adjudication of the petition allegations in which a finding is made that the minor is a person described in section and probation is ordered.in re adam,supra,th at,d.although informal supervision is no longer a viable alternative at this stage of the proceedings in re abdirahman,supra,th at,d,supervised,subd.a or unsupervised,subd.a probation are available dispositional alternatives,even when a minor is adjudged a ward of the court under section.in re trevor th,d.
in,another alternative disposition in juvenile cases was added by initiative measure,approved march,eff.march,to provide a diversion program or deferred entry of judgment dej.et dej may apply n otwithstanding section or,or any other provision of law whenever a case is before the juvenile court for a determination of whether a minor is a person described in section because of the commission of a felony offense,if certain listed circumstances apply,subd.a.essentially,this dej program provides that in lieu of jurisdictional and disposition hearings,the court may grant a deferred entry of judgment with respect to any offense charged in the petition,provided that the minor admits each allegation contained in the petition and waives time for the pronouncement of judgment,and that upon the successful completion of the terms of probation,as defined in section,the positive recommendation of the probation department,and the motion of the prosecuting attorney,but no sooner tha n months and no later than months from the date of the minor referral to the program,the court shall dismiss the charge or charges against the minor,subd.a.if the minor fails to comply with the terms of probation or any of the rules of any program the minor is directed to attend for the dej program,the court may,after motion,enter the judgment that has been deferred and set a dispositional hearing,subds.a b.
the terms and conditions of dej participation specifically include the requirement that the minor be subject to warrantless searches of his or her person,residence,or property under his or her control,upon the request of a probation officer or peace officer.such fourth amendment waiver,which is essentially an express waiver of a fundamental constitutional right to be free from random searches,like one imposed as a condition of formal probation,is a supervisorial procedure related to the probationers reformation and rehabilitation in light of the offense of which he was convicted and is designed also to serve as a deterrent for probationers.people kern d.
as the above statutes reflect,in addition to the juvenile court broad discretion in selecting appropriate probation conditions for the reformation and rehabilitation of a minor under its jurisdiction after adjudication of petition allegations in which a finding is made that the minor falls under sections or due to delinquent behavior see,it may also impose certain specific statutory conditions as programs of supervision under the two mutually exclusive diversionary alternatives to the juvenile justice system already mentioned.
specifically,sections and provide a program of informal supervision for situations pertaining to statutorily qualifying minors under section and section et provides a program of supervision for situations pertaining to minors qualified under that section.although both alternative statutes contemplate diverting minors from the juvenile justice system by avoiding full adjudication of the charges in a petition,they present vastly different approaches for treating separate classes of juvenile offenders.generally,the program of informal supervision under sections or applies only to first time minor offenders who are alleged to have committed no more than misdemeanors or infractions and is available only before any admission to those alleged charges or a court determination the minor is within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.such program also precludes minors who have previously been in informal supervision,who have had a prior wardship judgment and who are over the age of and are alleged to have committed a felony unless the juvenile court expressly finds the minor case unusual and imposes the informal supervision in the interests of justice.in essence,the informal supervision program provided for under sections and is reserved for the least experienced delinquent minor whose rehabilitation is thought best handled through various programs involving the minor and his or her parent or guardian without further involving the juvenile criminal justice system.
the section dej program,on the other hand,applies to minors years and older who have committed felony offenses and who have not previously been declared wards of the court for a felony or been committed to the custody of the youth authority,subd.a.such diversionary program is available only after the minor admits culpability for the crimes alleged in the petition.when this slightly more seasoned minor offender is found eligible for the program,judgment is deferred while the minor is placed on a type of supervised probation,which includes a mandated fourth amendment waiver as a condition of every grant of dej.
that no fourth amendment waiver condition is similarly included in the statutory language defining the informal supervision program under sections and is clearly reasonable in light of the difference in the status of the minor offenders to which the diversionary program applies as well as that program stated purpose to divert minors away from the juvenile justice system before admission of guilt or a finding of jurisdiction and wardship.a minor who has be
