michael is a student with disabilities within the meaning of the individuals with disabilities education act idea,et.that act grants rights intended to lead school districts to provide disabled students with a free appropriate public education fape.id.a.michael and his parents brought two federal lawsuits to assert rights under idea.both suits were dismissed sua sponte by the district court because the parents proceeded without counsel.we hold that this was error and reverse.
michael was a middle school student in the plymouth school district from to and then became a high school student in the regional school district after.in both school systems,he and his parents sought due process hearings under the act regarding michael individualized education program iep and the procedures employed to develop and implement it.dissatisfied in each instance with the findings and decision reached in the hearings,the maronis then sought judicial review under idea.they instituted suit in federal court,without counsel,against plymouth on december,and then against on november.in the suit against plymouth,the caption of the complaint included michael and his parents,and in the suit against,it included michael and his father.in each suit,michael parent s purportedly sued as his next friend.neither school district objected to the parent s bringing the cases on a pro se basis.nonetheless,a magistrate judge for the district of new hampshire,performing a screening function in pro se cases,concluded that michael father could not sue pro se as next friend under in the case.michael father then sought to amend their complaint to assert what he claimed were his own rights under idea.opposed the motion to amend,arguing that michael father had no individual claim under idea.the magistrate judge denied the motion to amend without discussion except a citation to collinsgru palmyra board of education,cir adopting the magistrate judge reasoning,the district court then dismissed the complaint without prejudice on january.
michael father filed a motion to reconsider on february.in the supporting affidavit,he admitted that the maronis did not meet the financial need criteria for counsel,but indicated that they had been unable to find a lawyer who would take the case on a pro bono or contingency basis.the court denied the motion on march.
on the same day,the same district court judge held that michael parents also could not proceed pro se in the suit against the plymouth school district.the court stated that parents could not appear pro se for their children in idea cases and that the case would be dismissed if michael did not appear with counsel by april.michael parents,acting on his behalf as next friends,then filed a motion for the court to appoint counsel based on michael lack of financial resources.the court denied their motion without discussion.on april,the court dismissed the case because no appearance had been filed on behalf of michael by an attorney authorized to practice in this court.
the maronis appeal the dismissal of both cases,arguing that the district court erred in prohibiting them from pursuing claims for procedural and substantive violations of idea without an attorney.in their brief,the maronis also request that this court reverse the denial of appointment of counsel if it finds that they may not pursue their claims without a lawyer.this court consolidated the two appeals.
michael is a minor,as are most children with idea claims were michael an adult,he could proceed pro se by virtue of,which provides that i n all courts of the united states the parties may plead and conduct their own cases personally or by counsel as,by the rules of such courts,respectively,are permitted to manage and conduct causes therein.because of his minority,he is disqualified from representing himself.here,his parents seek to do what michael age prevents him from doing.
the maronis advance two themes as to why they should be permitted to proceed pro se.the first theme,which we will call a statutory joint rights theory,is that idea itself grants parties aggrieved the right to bring suit in federal court asserting statutory violations and that parents are parties aggrieved.if parents are indeed parties under idea,they may then proceed pro se under.the second theme,the common law theory,is that courts should create an exception exempting idea cases from the usual common law rule preventing parents from proceeding pro se on behalf of their minor child 
the issue is one of first impression for this court.without addressing the issue before us,this court has referred to parents as aggrieved parties entitled to judicial review under idea.in providence school dep t ana,cir,we stated that u nder the provisions of the idea,all aggrieved parties,school committees and parents alike,are entitled to judicial review.id.at see also rafferty cranston pub.sch,cir after a due process hearing,a ny aggrieved party can appeal the findings and decision of the hearing officer to the state educational agency.if the parent remains dissatisfied,she can bring a civil action in federal district court.citations omitted emphasis added.this court has also treated parents as having rights under idea.see maine sch.admin.dist.v,on their own behalf and on behalf of their son,cir p arents ordinarily must exhaust their administrative remedies before appealing to a federal court weber cranston sch,cir finding parents claims to be within the zone of interests protected under idea and citing idea statement of statutory purpose,which specifies the statute mission to ensure that the rights of children with disabilities and parents of such children are protected kathleen.dep t of,cir assuming without discussion that parents can be named plaintiffs in their individual capacity in an idea suit.these rights have included not only procedural but also substantive rights.see maine sch,at referring to parents rights in the context of a compensatory education claim,which entitles a child to further special education services under idea to compensate for past deprivations kathleen,at involving judicial review of substantive claims raised in a due process hearing.
although this court has not directly considered the issue before us,the legal landscape is not empty on this question.two circuits have interpreted idea as granting parents the right to sue pro se for procedural violations.collinsgru,at idea clearly grants parents specific procedural rights,which they may enforce in administrative proceedings,as well as in federal court.wenger canastota cent.sch,cir per curiam the parent of a child with special needs is,of course,entitled to represent himself on his claims that his own rights as a parent under the idea were violated by the school district failure to follow appropriate procedures.collinsgru further held,over a strong dissent,that parents could not sue pro se for substantive claims,denial of fape.we read wenger as not discussing this latter issue,although it does prohibit parents from proceeding pro se on behalf of their children as next friends.see wenger,at relying on the rule against parents representing their children pro se in civil suits.in addition,two other circuits have held without analysis that parents may not sue pro se on behalf of their children under idea.see navin park ridge sch.dist,cir citing without further explanation cases in other circuits devine indian river county sch,cir stating without explanation that there is no indication that congress intended to allow parental representation in federal court for idea claims.conversely,one circuit has assumed,without discussion,that parents may bring their own substantive claims in district court.kirkpatrick lenoir county bd.of,cir treating parents as within the parties aggrieved requirement of idea because i a provides that a party that is unsatisfied with the state review officer decision has further recourse in either federal or state court and the parents were dissatisfied with the officer decision regarding their claims that their daughter was denied fape 
courts have also,without discussion,almost uniformly permitted parents to sue pro se under the predecessor statute to idea,the education for all handicapped children act eha,et.see kruelle new castle county sch,cir parents may proceed pro se under the eha,with the court noting without further explanation that the statute allows any party aggrieved by a due process hearing to sue in federal district court susan indep.sch,cir pro se parent may bring suit under the eha,without discussion gregory longview sch,cir same schreiber ridgewood bd.of.same muth central bucks sch,cir parent may proceed with pro se appeal under the eha,without discussion,rev on other grounds sub,dellmuth muth,d rettig kent city sch,cir same.idea employs the same party aggrieved language as the eha regarding who may bring suit.compare e superseded,with i a.
for the reasons that follow,we conclude that parents are parties aggrieved within the meaning of idea,i a,and thus may sue pro se.we also conclude that they are parties aggrieved regardless of whether the rights asserted are procedural or substantive.in so holding,we acknowledge the legitimate interests of the school districts,which never sought the dismissal of these actions but chose to defend those dismissals on appeal.the school districts take the position that parents may not sue pro se for either procedural or substantive rights under idea.they are concerned that permitting parents to proceed pro se will mean more meritless idea suits will be brought,requiring school districts to hire counsel and placing a considerable burden on their already stretched budgets.the concern is real still,there are ways to lessen the risk,discussed later.in the end,it is congress that makes these policy judgments.our view is that congress,in enacting idea,thought that risk an acceptable price to pay to vindicate the aims of the statute,which seeks to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education that emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs and prepare them for employment and independent living.d.
statutory text of idea 
the provision of idea,i a,provides that a ny party aggrieved by the findings and decision made in a due process hearing under subsection f or k,and any party aggrieved by the findings and decision regarding attorneys fees under this subsection,shall have the right to bring a civil action in a district court of the united states.the initial question is whether the term party aggrieved includes parents.we view this as a pure issue of statutory construction.if congress included parents within the term parties aggrieved,then the issue of whether parents as next friends under the common law may be parties under is irrelevant.
on a plain reading of the statute,we conclude that parents are parties aggrieved.in idea cases,federal courts review the outcome of due process hearings.idea grants parents the right to invoke those due process hearings under subsections f and k whenever a complaint has been received,the parents involved in such complaint shall have an opportunity for an impartial due process hearing id.f.if the child parent disagrees with a determination that the child behavior was not a manifestation of the child disability or with any decision regarding placement,the parent may request a hearing.id.k a i.other sections of idea also refer to parents right to a due process hearing.see id.e a ii requiring that mediation not be used to deny or delay a parent right to a due process hearing.under idea,states may permit parents to transfer this right to a due process hearing to their child only after their child reaches the age of majority.see id.m b.because the statute enables parents to request due process hearings,they are parties to such hearings and thus are logically within the group of parties aggrieved given the right to sue.
this reading is buttressed by the provisions of idea that allow appeals to the state educational agency.when a due process hearing is conducted before a local educational agency,g permits any party aggrieved by the findings and decision rendered in such a hearing to appeal such findings and decision to the state educational agency.in interpreting section g,this court has treated parents as parties aggrieved who may bring appeals to the state educational agency.see frazier fairhaven sch,cir describing section g as providing that if the due process hearing is conducted at the local level,the parent may then appeal to the state agency.other circuits have done the same.see,cudjoe indep.sch.dist,cir bd.of educ.kelly ex rel.nancy,cir.if parents are parties aggrieved by due process hearings when seeking to appeal to a state administrative agency,then,logically,they are also parties aggrieved by due process hearings when seeking judicial review.we see no reason that the term party aggrieved should have a different meaning in section i than in section g.
this interpretation is further supported by the requirement of administrative exhaustion.generally,the right to bring an idea action under i a is subject to the condition precedent that an aggrieved party must exhaust administrative remedies,although there are exceptions.frazier,at.by statute,it is the parents who may invoke those administrative remedies.see f.it would make little sense if the parents who are explicitly permitted to invoke those administrative remedies and to exhaust them could not be parties for purposes of bringing suit.
the school districts argue that if congress had intended the term party aggrieved under idea to mean parents,it would have explicitly said so.congress did explicitly say that parents could bring due process hearings,and so,the argument is made,the rule of expressio unius est exclusio alterius means that congress did not intend parents to be able to sue.this rule has no application here.congress needed to include several categories of plaintiffs and so used a collective term.the statute does not refer to child aggrieved as it easily could if only the child could sue.nor does i a refer to school districts,even though they may seek review under it.see manchester sch.dist.crisman,cir reviewing a federal civil suit by a school district under i a maine sch.admin,at noting that the school district could have appealed the due process hearing as part and parcel of judicial review provided under i a.the more likely explanation for idea use of the term party aggrieved instead of parents is that congress sought to confer the right to judicial review of due process hearings upon all parties involved in such hearings school districts,parents,and children.
the school districts also argue that the term party aggrieved does not include parents because the attorneys fees provision,i b,refers to the child as the prevailing party.to put the phrase in context,the award is expressly made to the parents of a child with a disability who is the prevailing party.id.if anything,that language suggests parents are aggrieved parties who bear the costs and benefits of a successful suit.indeed,idea attorneys fees provision also uses the phrase prevailing party to refer to parents.see id.i e providing that an award of attorneys fees and related costs may be made to a parent who is a prevailing party in certain circumstances.this dual usage undercuts any argument that the attorneys fees provision requires the term party aggrieved to exclude parents.
the more significant argument raised by the school district is that because congress provided a means for prevailing children and their parents to recover attorneys fees,congress wanted to preclude pro se pursuit of idea cases.while plausible,this interpretation of congress intent would lead to perverse results.it is one thing to say congress intended to encourage attorneys to represent plaintiffs in idea claims by allowing for attorneys fees.it is entirely another to say that congress intended to preclude plaintiffs suits from going forward pro se without counsel.that congress tried to remove one impediment to the bringing of idea suits hardly means congress intended,sub silentio,to erect another impediment by forbidding pro se suits by parents.that is not how attorneys fees provisions in the other civil rights statutes have been viewed.although many civil rights statutes provide for attorneys fees,see,americans with disabilities act,title vi,and title ix b title ii k title vii b rehabilitation act,none of these provisions has been interpreted as indicating a legislative intent to prohibit pro se suits.for these reasons,as well as the larger statutory scheme of idea discussed below,we reject the school districts position that parents are not parties aggrieved under idea for any purpose.
that leaves the question whether parents are parties aggrieved under i a only for purposes of pursuing claims of procedural violations,but not claims of substantive violations.this is the view of one circuit,see collinsgru,at,and perhaps another,see wenger,at,and is certainly plausible.the core reasoning is that parents are aggrieved only to the extent that they have rights under the statute and the only rights they expressly have are procedural.the school districts,notably,do not adopt this problems created for them by permitting pro se suits do not go away by creating a distinction between procedural and substantive claims.further,the school districts are likely mindful that the distinction is often far from clear they probably do not wish to spend their defense dollars litigating the issue of what is procedural and what is substantive,or what consequences follow from that determination.
again,this is an issue of statutory interpretation are parents parties aggrieved for purposes of asserting substantive claims of denial of a free appropriate public education under idea the statute,we conclude,leads to the interpretation that they are.
first,the parties aggrieved provision does not make a distinction between procedural and substantive claims.as a general rule of administrative law,parties can be aggrieved by both substantive and procedural injuries.see cella togum constructeur ensemleier en industrie alimentaire,cir fec akins,d history associates the word aggrieved with a congressional intent to cast the standing net broadly.in determining whether a party is aggrieved by an administrative decision and may thus seek judicial review,the issue is usually not whether the injuries are substantive or procedural.
rather,the issue is usually whether the party satisfies the constitutional and prudential standing requirements.see.city,icc,cir to determine whether a petitioner is aggrieved under a statute permitting parties aggrieved to seek judicial review of final orders by specified agencies,we generally incorporate traditional article iii and prudential standing analysis.to satisfy article iii standing,parties must show,causation,and redressability.maine medical center,cir.to meet the prudential standing restrictions,parties must show that the harm asserted is to themselves and not a generalized grievance pervasively shared by a large class of citizens,and in statutory cases,that the claim is within the zone of interests protected by the statute.id.at.
as to constitutional standing,parental idea suits meet the causation and redressability requirements.the primary issue is.parents whose children are denied fape suffer the of either paying for private educational services or risking that their children education will not fully prepare their children for employment and independent living.see ores willow west condo.ass n,finding that parents suffered when their disabled adult sons were denied housing on a discriminatory basis under the fair housing act,because their sons lost the opportunity to live independently and the parents thus faced the financial and emotional burden of continuing to support them.that this injury to parents is based on harm that their child also suffers does not serve as a basis for distinguishing procedural and substantive idea claims.when parents raise procedural claims,their injuries are likewise based on harm to their child they can not recover unless there is some rational basis to believe that procedural inadequacies compromised the pupil right to an appropriate education,seriously hampered the parents opportunity to participate in the formulation process,or caused a deprivation of educational benefits.roland concord sch,cir see also kings local school,bd.of educ.zelazny,cir stating that a serious infringement on a parent opportunity to participate in the formulation of his or her child iep is actionable because it causes substantive harm and thus constitute s a denial of the child right to a fape.
as to prudential standing requirements,this court has found that parental idea claims satisfy the test when they are related to the identification,evaluation,or educational placement of the claimant child,or the provision of a free appropriate public education.weber,at finding the test satisfied when the parent raised a retaliation claim under idea.substantive idea claims,by definition,meet this standard.parental idea suits also satisfy the other two prudential standing restrictions.such suits assert parents own right to seek judicial review under i a.and the claimed harm to their child education is not a generalized grievance.
second,none of the provisions of idea regarding the right of parents to seek relief in administrative or judicial hearings draws a distinction between substantive and procedural rights due process hearings address both procedural and substantive issues.a party to an idea due process hearing has rights to present evidence,confront and cross examine witnesses,and compel testimony.h.idea complaint provision affords parents the opportunity to present complaints with respect to any matter relating to the identification,evaluation,or educational placement of the child,or the provision of a free appropriate public education to such child.b emphasis added.if the parents may pursue substantive claims of denial of fape at due process hearings,they should be able to pursue substantive claims when they are aggrieved by the outcome of the due process hearings at which they presented those claims 
similarly,the attorneys fees provision does not distinguish between procedural and substantive claims.if parents reject settlement offers that meet certain criteria,they can not recover attorneys fees under idea.i d.this is true regardless of whether the parents reject settlements for procedural or substantive claims.
third,procedural and substantive rights under idea are inextricably intertwined.the supreme court stated as much in rejecting the argument that courts have the authority only to review for compliance by states with idea procedural requirements and not for the substance of the state program.see bd.of educ.rowley,d finding that the procedural protections of idea are based on the legislative conviction that adequate compliance with the procedures prescribed would in most cases assure much if not all of what congress wished in the way of substantive content.idea procedural guarantees serve not only to guarantee the substantive rights accorded by the act the procedural rights,in and of themselves,form the substance of idea.congress addressed the problem of how to guarantee substantive rights to a diverse group by relying on a solution.heldman sobol,cir see also wheaton,cir basing the conclusion that parties may be aggrieved under the education of the handicapped act by the denial of their procedural claims on the argument that parties may be aggrieved by the denial of their substantive claims and that the two types of violations are intertwined.
statutory structure of idea 
the interpretation of parents as parties aggrieved for both procedural and substantive claims is further confirmed by the structure of idea,which relies upon the central role played by parents in assuring that their disabled child receives a free appropriate public education.weber,at quotation marks omitted.idea procedural protections are designed to encourage parental involvement in the ultimate goal of having the child receive a free appropriate public education.the idea statement of purpose explicitly recognizes the statute mission to ensure that the rights of children with disabilities and parents of such children are protected.d b emphasis adde
