in this juvenile adjudication proceeding,the san diego county district attorney filed a petition against defendant anthony alleging under vehicle code section that he stole a vehicle count,and under penal code section that he received a stolen vehicle count.the court denied anthony motion to dismiss count brought after the close of the people case,and anthony thereafter testified in his own defense.the court sustained the petition as to count and dismissed count.
in april,the court adjudged anthony a ward of the court and placed him on probation under the supervision of his grandmother.in may,the court held a restitution hearing and ordered that anthony pay restitution under welfare and institutions code section in the amount of to the person whose car was stolen.
no appeal was filed from the judgment sustaining the people petition on count.however,anthony did timely appeal the restitution order.further,anthony filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus petition seeking to set aside the judgment.the petition and the appeal have been consolidated for disposition.
on the appeal anthony asserts that the restitution order was erroneous because the evidence does not support a finding that the losses suffered by the victim of the car theft resulted from his criminal conduct.in the petition,anthony contends that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because of his attorney failure to file a notice of appeal from the judgment,as an appeal would have resulted in a reversal since there is insufficient evidence to sustain the petition on count.in supplemental briefing requested by this court,anthony also asserts that the petition must be granted because the court erred in denying his motion to dismiss brought at the close of the people case.the people argue that the petition must be denied because there was no prejudicial ineffective assistance of counsel as anthony waived his right to challenge denial of the motion to dismiss because his testimony given after the close of the people case cured any deficiency in the people case.
we conclude that anthony j petition is well taken as he was denied effective assistance of counsel by counsel failure to file an appeal from the judgment and that ineffective assistance of counsel was prejudicial because the court erred in denying his motion to dismiss since there was insufficient evidence to sustain the petition on count at the close of the people case.we further conclude that anthony did not waive his right to challenge the denial of the motion to dismiss by testifying in his own behalf because under such circumstances we may still only consider the evidence as it existed at the time the people rested and there is insufficient evidence to sustain the petition even if we consider anthony testimony.
factual and procedural background 
a.the people case 
on the morning of january,at approximately,john moreno arrived at the parking lot of a hour fitness center on balboa avenue.he noticed a newer model bmw pull in and park.four black males exited the vehicle.the driver was wearing brown clothes.the man on the passenger side in the front seat of the vehicle had a green backpack.moreno observed that the four did not go towards the hour fitness,but went toward the back entrance of the parking lot.
moreno saw one of the youths looking back toward the bmw and then all four started running.moreno then saw a police car going through the parking lot.moreno started his vehicle and followed the police car.when the police vehicle stopped half way up the street,moreno stopped his vehicle and asked the police officers inside their vehicle if they were looking for four black kids.one officer responded,should we be moreno then informed the police officers what he had seen.one of the officers asked moreno to go back to the bmw and wait.moreno did so and another officer arrived and talked to him about what had occurred.
after receiving moreno information,san diego police officer brandon gaines and his partner saw four young black males running southbound across balboa avenue toward a bus stop.the police officers drove to the next intersection,turned,and pulled behind the bus stop.the officers contacted the four youths and confirmed they were all under the age of.at trial,officer gaines identified anthony as one of the youths that was at the bus stop.
officer gaines detained the four youths for being truant.he requested that another officer investigate the bmw in the hour fitness parking lot.after it was determined the vehicle was stolen,officer gaines searched and then arrested the four youths.
one of the officers investigating the stolen bmw brought moreno to where the youths were detained to conduct a curbside lineup.the officers asked each youth to stand and turn from side to side.moreno identified the youth wearing brown as the driver of the bmw.he was not able to identify the others,including anthony 
officer gaines found a set of keys with a bmw emblem on it five to ten feet away from the bus stop.he took the keys back to the stolen bmw and discovered that the keys were a fit for the car.
the parties stipulated that the bmw found in the hour fitness parking lot was stolen out of a driveway with its engine running at on january,and that the owner of the car was bounthavy savatdy.
motion to dismiss 
at the close of the people case,anthony requested a judgment of dismissal.although the court statement on the record was somewhat unclear,it appears that the court denied the motion without prejudice to it being renewed following the defense case,the court stating,if you choose to,you can deal with it after the testimony of anthony 
defense case 
anthony,years old at the time of trial,testified in his own defense.he stated that on the morning of january,he was in the mcdonald restaurant by san diego city college with a friend.his friend told him to come on.anthony and his friend went across the street,entered a bmw,and sat in the backseat.anthony testified that he had seen the driver of the vehicle once before at a cousin house,but did not know him well.he also testified that he did not know if the driver owned the car.according to anthony,the group drove around for about to minutes,and he was riding in the backseat.they then stopped at the hour fitness and exited the vehicle.anthony claimed that during the ride they were listening to the radio and that there was no discussion about the car origin.
according to anthony,they got out of the car to go to a sporting goods store.as they were walking to the store,he dropped something.at that point the other three started to run.he did not know why they were running but he ran after them.when he caught up with them he heard them say the bmw was stolen.up until that time he did not know the vehicle was stolen.
court ruling 
following testimony and argument of counsel,the court sustained the people petition on count.in doing so,the court rejected anthony version of events 
the court finds that anthony story that he was at the mcdonald restaurant when a very casual acquaintance,whose last name he did know,pulled him out of line and that he crossed the street to get into a car with two other people that he did know and did not have full knowledge that that car was not legally obtained is totally unbelievable and incredible.and therefore the court will not make its decision based on that absolutely unbelievable story.having disregarded that basis for the actions of the minor,it clear that only appropriate finding in this case is a true finding as to the allegations and that therefore will be the finding of the court.the court finds beyond a reasonable doubt that the allegations contained in the petition are true and correct.
the court thereafter dismissed count,there having been no evidence submitted that anthony had either driven or taken the vehicle.
restitution hearing 
at the restitution hearing,savatdy testified that he was the owner of the stolen bmw.savatdy also testified to the following losses related to the theft of his vehicle approximately cd at a value of each,for a total of a set valued at damage to the vehicle in the amount of,of that amount was a deductible for his car insurance,the rest was paid by his insurance replacement keys for his other vehicle which were lost when the car was stolen,at a cost of and new locks for his house at a cost of.
a screwdriver was missing from the bmw tool kit in the trunk.replacement cost for the tool kit was.however,this amount was included in the cost for the repair of savatdy vehicle.
the court found that savatdy total damages were.the court ordered restitution in that amount,payable to savatdy girlfriend,as she the stolen bmw and was the listed insured on the vehicle.the restitution was made jointly and severally against anthony and the other three minors in the stolen bmw.
anthony did not file an appeal from the judgment,but did timely file an appeal challenging the restitution order.anthony also filed a petition asserting ineffective assistance of counsel resulting from the failure of counsel to file a notice of appeal from the judgment.the petition and the appeal have been consolidated for disposition.following oral argument,we issued an order to show cause and the parties waived additional oral argument.
discussion 
on his petition anthony asserts that the judgment must be reversed based on ineffective assistance of counsel because counsel failed to file an appeal from that judgment.anthony asserts that it is reasonably probable that he would have achieved a more favorable result because the judgment would have been reversed.specifically,anthony asserts that there is insufficient evidence to sustain the petition on count as he,as a passenger,did not have possession of the stolen vehicle.additionally,we requested the parties to address,in supplemental briefing,whether the court erred in denying anthony motion to dismiss brought at the close of the people case,and whether anthony waived the right challenge the denial of the motion to dismiss by thereafter testifying in his own defense.
we conclude that anthony counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to file a notice of appeal from the judgment entered in this case.we further conclude that the ineffective assistance of counsel was prejudicial and requires a granting of the petition because the court erred in denying anthony motion to dismiss at the close of the people case because there was insufficient evidence at that time to sustain the petition as to count and anthony did not waive the right to challenge that denial by testifying in his own behalf.we hold that even if a defendant submits evidence that cures any deficiency in the people case following an erroneous denial of a motion to dismiss,he or she does not waive the right to contest that erroneous denial.we further conclude that even if anthony testimony is considered,the petition must still be granted because there is insufficient evidence to sustain the petition even when taking his testimony into account.accordingly,we need not address anthony appeal from the restitution order as that issue has now been rendered moot.
ineffective assistance of counsel 
in people ledesma cal d,ledesma the california supreme court explained that u nder both the sixth amendment to the united states constitution and article i,section,of the california constitution,a criminal defendant has the right to the assistance of counsel.citations.the ultimate purpose of this right is to protect the defendant fundamental right to a trial that is both fair in its conduct and reliable in its result.citations.construed in light of its purpose,the right entitles the defendant not to some bare assistance but rather to effective assistance.citations.specifically,it entitles him to the reasonably competent assistance of an attorney acting as his diligent conscientious advocate.citations.
the high court in ledesma further explained the showing necessary to reverse a conviction on this ground a convicted defendant claim that counsel assistance was so defective as to require reversal of a conviction has two components.citations.first,the defendant must show that counsel performance was deficient.citations.specifically,he must establish that counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness under prevailing professional norms.citations.in determining whether counsel performance was deficient,a court must in general exercise deferential scrutiny.ledesma,supra,cal d at.
the heavy burden placed upon a defendant asserting ineffective assistance of counsel is based upon sound public policy.the spectacle of a series of attorneys appointed at public expense whose sole job,or at least a major portion of whose job,is to claim the previous attorney was,or previous attorneys were,incompetent discredits the legal profession and judicial system,often with little benefit in protecting a defendant legitimate interests.people smith cal th,d.
additionally,even if this burden is met,a criminal defendant must also establish prejudice before he can obtain relief on an claim.ledesma,supra,cal d at.although prejudice is conclusively presumed in certain contexts,prejudice generally must be affirmatively proved.ibid.it is not enough for the defendant to show that the errors had some conceivable effect on the outcome of the proceeding the defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.citations.id.at.
an ineffective assistance of counsel claim is properly raised in a habeas corpus proceeding.people mendoza tello cal th,d.further,it is undisputed that counsel failure to file a notice of appeal from the judgment constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.the question presented is whether that error was prejudicial that is,is it more probable than not that if an appeal had been filed,we would have reversed the judgment the answer to that question requires an analysis of the law regarding motions to dismiss and a consideration of the evidence developed at trial.
sufficiency of evidence at time of motion to dismiss 
section provides that a minor counsel may request,at the close of the people case,that the court enter a judgment of dismissal 
at the hearing,the court,on motion of the minor or on its own motion,shall order that the petition be dismissed and that the minor be discharged from any detention or restriction therefore ordered,after the presentation of evidence on behalf of the petitioner has been closed,if the court,upon weighing the evidence then before it,finds that the minor is not a person described by section or.if such a motion at the close of evidence offered by the petitioner is not granted,the minor may offer evidence without first having reserved that right.
courts have held that section is substantially similar to penal code section governing motions to acquit in criminal trials and that therefore the rules and procedures applicable to penal code section apply with equal force to juvenile proceedings.in re man d.
thus,the requirement in a criminal case that on a motion for acquittal the trial court is required to weigh the evidence,evaluate the credibility of witnesses,and determine that the case against the defendant is proved beyond a reasonable doubt before the defendant is required to put on a defense applies equally well to motions to dismiss brought in juvenile proceedings.in re andre d.we conclude that at the time anthony brought his motion to dismiss at the close of the people case,insufficient evidence was presented to sustain the petition on count.
penal code section,subdivision a provides in part every person who buys or receives any property that has been stolen or that has been obtained in any manner constituting theft or extortion,knowing the property to be so stolen or obtained,or who conceals,sells,withholds,or aids in concealing,selling,or withholding any property from the owner,knowing the property to be so stolen or obtained,shall be punished by imprisonment in a state prison consequently,to sustain the people petition on the receiving stolen property count,the people must prove the property was stolen the defendant knew it was stolen
