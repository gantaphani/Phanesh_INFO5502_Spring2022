appellant abel father appeals the juvenile court dispositional order granting physical custody of his sons,abram and jacob,to respondent los angeles county department of children and family services the department for suitable placement.the court removed the children from their biological mother,juanita mother,after she allegedly threatened them with physical harm.because father was a noncustodial parent,the juvenile court was required to adjudicate his request for physical custody of the children pursuant to welfare and institutions code section under the statute,father was entitled to physical custody of the children unless the juvenile court found that placement with father would be detrimental to the safety,protection,or physical or emotional of the children,subd.a.the juvenile court,however,did not make an express finding of detriment as the statute requires,subd.c,and it is unclear from the record whether the court considered the requirements of the statute before denying father request for custody of his children.we thus reverse the order and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
factual and procedural background 
the children family 
when this action commenced,abram and jacob were and years old,respectively.the two boys lived with mother,mother husband francisco stepfather,and their adult sister andrea,who was years old.pursuant to a family court order,mother had physical and legal custody of abram and jacob for more than years.
father lived with his girlfriend.abram and jacob visited father on saturdays,approximately every two weeks.
history of domestic violence and physical abuse 
mother and stepfather had a history of domestic violence in the three years they had been together.the couple engaged in verbal confrontations about two times a day,which often involved.on about two occasions the arguments escalated to physical violence.in december,mother pulled out a box cutter knife and threatened stepfather with it.
according to abram,jacob and andrea,mother occasionally physically abused them by hitting them with objects,such as a broom or belt,and with her fists.mother once beat abram on his leg,chest and face with a belt because he refused to attend a youth church conference.when abram was years old,mother hit him with a broom,injuring his eye.according to jacob,mother hit him with a belt more than five times.jacob also claimed that mother hit him with a stick when he was seven or eight years old.andrea claimed that mother hit her with a metal pipe on one occasion,and with a broom on another.
underlying mother abuse of her children was her struggle with mental health.father believed that mother had a problem in her brain.he claimed that mother would say,i want to kill you if someone disagreed with her.jacob described mother as psychotic and having a loose screw in there.abram described her as a psycho.according to mother adult daughter,emily,mother was paranoid.mother sister stated that mother would be happy one day,and down and sleeping all day,another day.the children maternal grandmother stated that mother has mood swings,and easily goes from being very lovable to being very angry,within a split second.
approximately four months before these proceedings began,after mother hit abram with a belt and andrea with a metal pipe,abram and andrea left mother home and went to stay with father and his girlfriend.about three months later,however,abram and andrea returned to live with mother because of conflicts they had with father girlfriend.
july,incident 
on july,mother and andrea had a verbal altercation at home.mother broke a mirror,grabbed a piece of broken glass,and threatened to stab andrea and abram with it.at one point,mother also threatened to stab abram with a knife.andrea and mother called the police,who arrived at the scene and arrested mother for child endangerment.the department temporarily detained abram and jacob and placed them in foster care.
the juvenile dependency petition and initial court hearing and order 
on july,the department filed a juvenile dependency petition requesting the juvenile court to take jurisdiction over abram and jacob pursuant to section,subdivisions a,b and j.all of the counts in the petition except one concerned mother alleged acts or omissions.count b alleged that father had a history of using illicit drugs and was a current abuser of alcohol.this count,however,would later be dismissed by the juvenile court.
on the same day the petition was filed,the juvenile court held a hearing on the case.father counsel stated at the hearing that father could not take custody of jacob and abram because he did not yet have appropriate housing.the court entered an order stating that there was a prima facie case for detaining abram and jacob.the order also granted father unmonitored visits,required father to submit to random alcohol tests,and directed the department to include in its jurisdictional report a discussion about placing the children with relatives.
the department investigation into whether the children should be placed with father 
between the time the department became involved in this matter on july,and the jurisdictional and dispositional hearing on september,the department considered placing abram and jacob with several different relatives,including father.at the time the children were initially detained,however,the department could not locate father.
later,on several occasions,the department asked abram and jacob whether they wished to live with father.both boys stated that they did not wish to live with father if father continued to live with his girlfriend.
the children maternal aunt stated she had concerns about the children living with father girlfriend because she had heard the girlfriend talk down to abram,tell him to look into her eyes when he talked to her,and make inappropriate innuendos to the child.abram stated that he and andrea left father home because father girlfriend had taken andrea ring and argued with andrea.jacob stated that father girlfriend did not like abram and jacob.
on august,a month after the children were detained the department interviewed father about being a potential caretaker for the children.father stated he wanted his sons to live with him but he could not take care of them at the time because there was no space for the children where he was living.he also stated that he was saving money to rent a apartment for himself,andrea and the two boys.at the time,father girlfriend still lived with father,but father said he would be willing to live separately from her for the sake of his children 
on september,father reported to the department that he had found a bigger place to live for himself and the children.father,however,declined to allow the department to inspect his home because he was in the process of moving.he promised to contact the department the next week to schedule an inspection.but father did not call the department before the september,hearing.
after abram and jacob were detained and placed with a foster parent,father only visited them one time.father advised the department he had difficulty visiting the children because they lived in palmdale and he lived in los angeles.in the meantime,abram and jacob were doing well in foster care.
the department determined that it was in the best interest of the children to remain in foster care.in its report to the juvenile court dated september,the department requested the court to enter an order removing the children from the physical custody of the parents pursuant to section,subdivision c.the department did not request in this report that the juvenile court make a finding or order under section,subdivisions a or c,which we shall discuss post.
the department assessment of father alleged alcohol and drug problem 
after the petition was filed,in mid and late july,the department interviewed abram,jacob and mother regarding the allegations in the petition,including father alleged drug and alcohol problem.abram stated that father sometimes drinks alcohol and that father attends aa meetings.jacob stated that he did not know whether father had a problem with alcohol,and that he had never seen father drink.mother stated that father used to use alcohol and cocaine but does not know if he continued to do so.
during a telephone interview by a department social worker,father denied having current alcohol dependence,and expressed a willingness to comply with testing.father took a drug and alcohol test on august,that was negative.the record does not indicate why father did not take additional drug and alcohol tests before the jurisdictional and dispositional hearing.within approximately a month after that hearing,father took three additional drug and alcohol tests,all of which were negative.
the september,hearing and order 
on september,the juvenile court held a jurisdictional and dispositional hearing.at the hearing,the department attorney argued that placing the children with father was premature because father home had not yet been assessed,father had only visited the children once since they were detained,the children did not want to live with father girlfriend,and father had a history of alcohol abuse.counsel for abram and jacob requested that the children not be placed with father because of the friction between the children and father girlfriend and because the foster parent was very,very good to the children.
father counsel requested that the children be placed with father.as to the department concern that father home had not been assessed,counsel stated that father did not call the social worker to arrange for an inspection because some required repairs were not completed.she further stated that those repairs have been done.counsel also stated that father girlfriend was not residing in father new apartment and,in any case,the fact that the children did not like father girlfriend was not a sufficient basis to deny father request for custody.counsel concluded by stating that t he department has not met its burden by clear and convincing evidence to prove that return of the children to the father at this time would create a substantial risk of detriment.
the juvenile court stated it agreed with the department counsel that placing the children with father was premature.the court also expressed concerns about inappropriate housing and drug testing.the court further stated since the children are now stable,i disinclined to move them until i know that the placement with father is going to work out,even though he is non offending.i note he only visited once.so there a relationship that needs to be resolved so,at this time,i not going to send them to father.the court did not,however,refer to section or use the operative language of the statute.
at the end of the hearing,the juvenile court entered an order dated september.the order sustained some counts in the dependency petition and dismissed other counts.the court dismissed the only count against father,count b.the order also declared the children dependents of the court,removed the children from mother physical custody pursuant to section,subdivision c gave the department custody of the children for suitable placement,and provided father with family reunification services.the order further provided that father was to take five random drug and alcohol tests.the order did not make any reference to section.
father filed a timely notice of appeal of the september,order.
contentions 
father argues that the juvenile court failed to make a finding that placing abram and jacob in his custody would be detrimental to the safety,protection or physical or emotional of the children,as required by section.he further contends that there was no substantial evidence to support such a finding.
discussion 
the juvenile court erroneously failed to apply section 
section,subdivision c provides that a dependent child may not be taken from the physical custody of a parent with whom he resided at the time the petition was initiated,unless the juvenile court finds by clear and convincing evidence that at least one of certain enumerated circumstances exists.one such circumstance is when t here is or would be a substantial danger to the physical health,safety,protection,or physical or emotional of the minor if the minor were returned home,and there are no reasonable means by which the minor physical health can be protected without removing the minor from the minor parent physical custody,subd.c.
the juvenile court found that the requirements of section,subdivision c were satisfied in light of mother conduct.mother did not appeal the dispositional order and we assume the court finding was supported by substantial evidence.abram and jacob,however,could not be removed from father physical custody under section,subdivision c because they were not residing with him when the petition was initiated.in re th,section,subdivision c does not,by its terms,encompass the situation of the noncustodial parent.
the statute governing father request that the children be placed in his custody was section.subdivision a of the statute provides when a court orders removal of a child pursuant to section,the court shall first determine whether there is a parent of the child,with whom the child was not residing at the time that the events or conditions arose that brought the child within the provisions of section,who desires to assume custody of the child.if that parent requests custody,the court shall place the child with the parent unless it finds that placement with that parent would be detrimental to the safety,protection,or physical or emotional of the child,subd.a,italics added.
a parent right to care,custody and management of a child is a fundamental liberty interest protected by the federal constitution that will not be disturbed except in extreme cases where a parent acts in a manner incompatible with parenthood.in re marquis th,marquis.t o comport with the requirements of the due process clause,a finding of detriment pursuant to section,subdivision a must be made by clear and convincing evidence.id.at accord in re isayah th,a nonoffending parent has a constitutionally protected interest in assuming physical custody,as well as a statutory right to do so,in the absence of clear and convincing evidence that the parent choices will be detrimental to the safety,protection,or physical or emotional of the child.
under the plain terms of the statute,if the juvenile court finds that placing a child in the physical custody of a noncustodial parent would not be detrimental to the child within the meaning of section,subdivision a,it must place the child in the physical custody of the noncustodial parent.if the child is placed with the noncustodial parent,the juvenile court may order that the parent become legal and physical custodian of the child order that the parent assume custody subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile court and require that a home visit be conducted within three months or order that the parent assume custody subject to the supervision of the juvenile court,subd.b.section,subdivision c provides that t he court shall make a finding either in writing or on the record of the basis for its determination under subdivisions a and b.
nothing in the record indicates that the juvenile court considered the requirements of section in determining whether to deny father request for physical custody of abram and jacob.the order dated september,does not refer to section or the standard set forth in subdivision a of the statute to deny a noncustodial parent physical custody of his or her children.likewise,in its oral remarks regarding the possible placement of the children with father,the juvenile court did not refer to section,or use the operative language of the statute.it is also worth noting that the department did not request the court to consider section in its september,report to the court.therefore,we find the juvenile court did not apply the applicable law to father request for physical custody of the children.
father did not forfeit his arguments 
the department argues that father forfeited any argument that the juvenile court failed to apply or comply with section because he did not raise the issue below.as a general rule,a party who does not raise an argument below,forfeits the argument on
