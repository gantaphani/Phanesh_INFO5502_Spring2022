a child dependency appeal,challenging the juvenile court evaluation of the child best interests,involves a delicate balancing of considerations.we must decide what role a child appellate counsel plays in this balance and,in particular,under what circumstances appellate counsel may investigate whether dismissal of an appeal is in the child best interests.
we conclude the following appellate counsel has the power to seek dismissal of a child dependency appeal based on the child best interests,and the court of appeal has the power to consider and rule on such a motion pursuant to appellate counsel power,counsel may seek funds to meet personally with her client to investigate a potential motion but appellate counsel may actually file a motion to dismiss only after consultation with and authorization from the child or the child guardian ad litem.here,appellate counsel for two minor siblings failed to demonstrate cause for the appropriation of funds in light of the guardian ad litem unequivocal opposition to any motion to dismiss.we affirm the court of appeal denial of appellate counsel request for funds,but remand without prejudice to appellate counsel renewing her motion under the standards set forth in our opinion.
factual and procedural background 
in june,the kern county superior court determined that josiah and infant gabriel came within its jurisdiction under welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b after gabriel tested positive for drugs at birth it found that the children were at substantial risk of physical harm or illness due to their mother drug abuse and their father physical abuse of their mother.the court subsequently declared josiah and gabriel dependents of the court and removed them from parental custody.after both parents failed to reunify with their sons,the court terminated reunification services and set a section permanency planning hearing.
in light of the children recent move to placement with a nonrelative,the children attorney sought a hearing on relative placement.the children attorney asserted she did not know why respondent kern county department of human services the department had previously denied the paternal grandparents request to have the children placed in their home,or why the department had not placed the children with any other relative.the court granted counsel request and set a special hearing on the issue of relative placement.
at the hearing,the department made a showing that each of the paternal grandparents had a criminal record and the paternal grandmother own children had been juvenile dependents due to her neglect.the department had denied the paternal grandparents requests for a criminal records exemption,subd.d that would have allowed josiah and gabriel to be placed with them.the court found the department had not abused its discretion in denying these requests.it then separately considered and denied the paternal grandparents current request for placement.trial counsel for the children appealed on her clients behalf.
consistent with its usual practice,the court of appeal appointed new counsel to represent the children on appeal.appellate counsel requested travel funds to visit her young clients and assess their current situation and wishes.she explained that,in her professional opinion,pursuit of the appeal was not in the children best interests because their current nonrelative placement was satisfactory.she indicated that if,after visiting the children,her opinion remained unchanged,she would move to dismiss the appeal.
the court of appeal ordered briefing on appellate counsel authority to move to dismiss her minor clients appeal based on her analysis of their best interests.appellate counsel argued that she had the authority,and indeed the duty,to seek dismissal of the appeal,independent of the views of trial counsel,if she concluded to do so was in the children best interests.the department and trial counsel opposed the request for funds and any potential motion to dismiss,arguing that appellate counsel was not so empowered and that the consideration of postjudgment evidence would conflict with our recent decision in in re zeth cal th,d.
the court of appeal denied the request for funds.it ruled that appellate counsel 
lacked the authority to file a motion to dismiss based on her assessment of the children best interests,and that in re zeth,supra,cal th,d,prevented the court of appeal from ruling on such a motion.we granted review to address significant questions of first impression relating to the scope of an appellate counsel authority in handling a child dependency appeal.
discussion 
does appellate counsel have the power to seek dismissal of an appeal based on a child best interests 
the goal of dependency proceedings,both trial and appellate,is to safeguard the welfare of california children.the objective of the dependency scheme is to protect abused or neglected children and those at substantial risk thereof and to provide permanent,stable homes if those children can not be returned home within a prescribed period of time.in re marilyn cal th,d.these proceedings are designed not to prosecute a parent,but to protect the child.in re malinda cal d.the best interests of the child are paramount,subd.d in re malinda,at,in re mary th,d.
in deciding what services or placement are best for the child,time is of the essence.after reunification efforts have failed,it is not only important to seek an appropriate permanent adoption when is also important to implement that solution reasonably promptly to minimize the time during which the child is in legal limbo courts should strive to give the child a stable,permanent placement,and a full emotional commitment,as promptly as reasonably possible consistent with protecting the parties rights and making a reasoned decision.in re celine cal th,d,see also in re sade cal th,d,state interest in expeditious resolution of dependency matters is strong indeed.it is undisputed that children require secure,stable,continuous relationships with their parents or foster parents.there is little that can be as detrimental to a child sound development as uncertainty over whether he is to remain in his current home,under the care of his parents or foster parents,especially when such uncertainty is prolonged.lehman lycoming county children services agency,d.thus,the priority in dependency proceedings is to identify and carry out the services and placement that best serve the child interests as swiftly as possible.
with these broad principles in mind,we consider whether appellate counsel has the power to file a motion to dismiss an appeal based on counsel assessment of the child best interests.
first,appellate counsel generally has the power to move to dismiss an appeal.california rules of court,rules and authorize an appellant,through counsel,to seek dismissal of an appeal.in cases such as this one,where the record has been filed with the court of appeal,counsel must file a motion to dismiss with the appellate court,which has the discretion to grant or deny the motion.cal.rules of court,rules c,b degarmo goldman cal d,an appellant may not dismiss his appeal as a matter of right whether he will be permitted to do so is within the discretion of the court.this procedure applies equally to dependency appeals.see in re karen th,d cal.rules of court,former rule a.
second,the power to move to dismiss the appeal includes the power to do so based on the child best interests.california rules of court,rules and contain no express exceptions.they reflect the usual rule that,in every case,an attorney has the power to seek dismissal of an appeal based on the attorneys and the clients evaluation of the clients best interests,as,for instance,when the client elects to settle in lieu of pursuing an appeal.the question then is whether anything in the dependency rules warrants a departure from this usual rule.we conclude not.
in in re zeth,supra,cal th,d,we addressed whether appellate counsel has a statutory duty to independently investigate the current circumstances of the child preadoptive placement,and to report any significant changes to the reviewing court so that the court can determine anew whether the trial courts judgment should be reversed id.at,d.we concluded that although section imposes investigatory duties on a child counsel,subd.e the statute by its terms applies only to trial counsel and thus imposes no similar duties on appellate counsel.in re zeth,at,d.but in deciding that section did not require counsel to conduct an investigation,we did not hold that the statute would prevent counsel from doing so,or from bringing a motion to dismiss motivated by the child best interests.nor does any other dependency statute or regulation preclude such a motion.
indeed,the concerns motivating dependency law persuade us that such a motion will sometimes be the proper course.as we explained in the writ context sometimes the additional delay that seeking writ relief might cause could harm the children.an attorney for a child is charged in general with the representation of the child interests,subd.e rather than always seeking a result that counsel thinks is legally correct regardless of whether that result is in the child best interest.in re celine,supra,cal th at,d.if the delay from a writ proceeding can justify forgoing a potentially meritorious petition,then the typically far greater delay from an appeal can surely sometimes justify forgoing a potentially meritorious appeal.see id.at,d,the delay an appellate reversal causes might be contrary to,rather than in,the child best interests.on appeal,as much as in writ proceedings or before the trial court,the clients best interests remain the lodestar for counsel.when the client is a child,the rule is no different.thus,we reject the departments argument that appellate counsel has an ethical duty to pursue any nonfrivolous arguments on appeal,to the exclusion of a motion to dismiss.
the court of appeal concluded that hearing a motion to dismiss the appeal based on appellate counsels assessment would violate the proscription against consideration of postjudgment evidence on appeal.see in re zeth,supra,cal th at,d.this conclusion reads too much into our holding in zeth there,we held that for an appellate court routinely to solicit postjudgment evidence in order to reopen and reconsider trial court findings and reverse the trial courts judgment would violate both the generally applicable rules of appellate procedure,and the express provisions of section which strictly circumscribe the timing and scope of review of termination orders,for the very purpose of expediting the proceedings and promoting the finality of the juvenile courts orders and judgment.in re zeth,at,d.for these reasons,an appellate court should not consider postjudgment evidence going to the merits of an appeal and introduced for the purposes of attacking the trial courts judgment.but these same concerns militate in favor of permitting motions to dismiss to be brought and heard,and distinguish this case from zeth in three respects.first,the generally applicable appellate rules authorize such a motion,and appellate courts routinely consider limited postjudgment evidence in the context of such motions.cal.rules of court,rule a see,tms,aihara th,d in re melissa d.second,the limited issue involved in a motion to dismiss,whether a child should be permitted to abandon a challenge to the trial court ruling,is distinct from the broader issues resolved by the trial court,and consideration of circumscribed evidence in this context does not give rise to the vice we condemned in zeth appellate courts use of new evidence outside the record to the trial courts resolution of issues properly committed to it by the statutory scheme.see in re zeth,at,d.third,the beneficial consequence of motions to dismiss,where granted,will be to expedit e the proceedings and promot e the finality of the juvenile courts orders and judgment id.at,d,precisely the policy advanced by our ruling in zeth 
the court of appeal also expressed concern that allowing such a motion would leave appellate counsels clients with no recourse,their right of appeal having been abandoned.not so.a motion to dismiss can not be brought unilaterally,without client consent,as we discuss post.nor is such a motion to be granted automatically instead,as noted ante,motions to dismiss are directed to the sound discretion of the court of appeal.thus,the right of appeal will be relinquished only with client consent and after the exercise of judicial oversight.
in lieu of a motion to dismiss,the court of appeal suggested that appellate counsel who identifies no good faith argument for reversal can file a sade brief.in re sade,supra,cal th,d.but appellate counsel properly can notify the court that she has found no arguable issues only when that is in fact the case.the appellate counsel who believes arguable issues exist,but that to pursue them would not be in the client best interests,can not properly file a sade brief.instead,counsel proper course of action is to file an authorized motion to dismiss.
in re karen,supra,th,d,presents an example of such a motion.after the juvenile court ordered a child returned to her mother,both the social services agency and the child trial counsel filed notices of appeal,and appellate counsel was appointed for the child.the social services agency subsequently reversed its position and moved to dismiss its appeal based on changed circumstances.the court of appeal granted the social services agency motion,whereupon the child appellate counsel moved to dismiss the child appeal based on the changed circumstances.though framed in terms of mootness,the motion effectively asked for dismissal because opposing the child placement with her mother was no longer in the child best interests.see id.at,d.the court of appeal took judicial notice of the juvenile court order,which reflected the social services agency changed position and the mother improved performance,and granted the motion to dismiss.id.at,d see also in re harry th,d motion by child appellate counsel to dismiss appeal and remand for new best interests hearing.as karen demonstrates,a motion to dismiss can be an appropriate way to end dependency proceedings and bring closure for a child.
ii.when may appellate counsel exercise the power to seek dismissal of an appeal based on a child best interests 
we determine next the circumstances in which appellate counsel may exercise the power to move for dismissal based on the child best interests.this question requires resolution of a series of related questions who is charged with assessing and deciding whether the best interests of the child warrant a motion to dismiss how does one determine that the child best interests warrant such a motion who may authorize a motion to dismiss based on best interests 
in answering these questions,we begin with the principle that dismissal of an appeal requires client consent.an attorney is authorized by virtue of his employment to bind the client in procedural matters arising during the course of the action but he may not impair the client substantial rights or the cause of action itself.linsk linsk cal d,see also blanton womancare,cal d.the dismissal of an appeal curtails the client right to any relief an appeal might afford.though a procedural step,it relinquishes a client substantial right and can not be taken without client consent.see wuest wuest d.thus,appellate counsel qua appellate counsel can not unilaterally move to dismiss an appeal 
who then is the client that is,who has the power to evaluate the child best interests and authorize a motion to dismiss in civil matters,the answer is clear.with rare exceptions,a child who is a party to a suit must appear through a guardian ad litem or similar representative.code civ.section represents a recognition by the legislature that whenever a minor is involved in litigation,his rights can not be protected unless a guardian ad litem or a similar representative acts for him.the guardian ad litem is an officer of the court,and he has the right to control the lawsuit on the minor behalf.among his powers are the right to compromise or settle the action citation,to control the procedural steps incident to the conduct of the litigation citation,and,with the approval of the court,to make stipulations or concessions that are binding on the minor,provided they are not prejudicial to the latter interests citation.de los santos superior court cal d.a civil guardian ad litem role is more than an attorney but less than a party,in that the guardian oversees any attorney representing minor interests and may make tactical and even fundamental decisions affecting the litigation,but always with the interest of the minor in mind.county of los angeles superior court th,d,italics omitted accord,in re christina th,d.thus,in the civil context,the child section guardian ad litem would be responsible for authorizing a motion to dismiss an appeal after evaluating the child interests.
these principles do not automatically extend to the dependency context.dependency proceedings in the juvenile court are special proceedings governed by their own rules and statutes.welf,et cal.rules of court,rule et unless otherwise specified,the requirements of the civil code and the code of civil procedure do not apply.in re jennifer th,d,fn.omitted accord,in re shelley th,d.however,in the absence of a dispositive provision in the welfare and institutions code,we may look to these requirements for guidance.in re daniel th,d.
the rules governing dependency guardians ad litem are slightly different than those applicable in civil proceedings.the federal child abuse prevention and treatment act capta et authorizes federal funding of state child protective services programs subject to various conditions.among those conditions,a state must ensure appointment of a specially trained guardian ad litem in every judicial proceeding involving an abused or neglected child.b a xiii.the capta guardian ad litem is responsible for both evaluating the situation and needs of the child and mak ing recommendations to the court concerning the best interests of the child.b a xiii i ii.under the implementing regulations,states are required to ensure appointment of a guardian ad litem who will represent and protect the rights and best interests of the child.g.july.thus,the capta guardian ad litem is a fiduciary whose role is to investigate the child circumstances and advocate for her best interests.
to ensure capta funding,the legislature passed welfare and institutions code section,which directed the judicial council to adopt court rules governing appointment of capta guardians ad litem the judicial council responded by amending california rules of court,rule and adding california rules of court,rule.rule c requires appointment of a capta guardian ad litem for every child who is subject to a juvenile dependency petition under welfare and institutions code section.rule d mirrors the language of capta,requiring that the capta guardian ad litem evaluate the situation and needs of the child and make recommendations to the court concerning the best interest of the child.cal.rules of court,rule d.
the child capta guardian ad litem will be either her attorney or,if no attorney has been appointed,a special advocate.cal.rules of court,rules b,e,c.to comply with capta competency requirements,the rules of court impose ongoing training and education requirements on both attorneys and special advocates.cal.rules of court,rules d,c see,subd.d.thus,capta and the state statutes and rules designed to implement its requirements ensure that each child in a dependency matter will have a trained,independent guardian ad litem prepared to understand the child circumstances and make recommendations based on an evaluation of the child best interests.
we read the capta provisions as extending to appeals.capta requirements apply to every judicial proceeding involving an abused or neglected child,without distinction between proceedings before a juvenile court or an appellate court.see b a xiii.nor is there any discernible policy reason that would warrant reading into the statute an implied limitation.as this case demonstrates,to have a specially trained advocate prepared to speak to the child best interests may be no less important in the appellate court than in the juvenile court.
california rules of court,rule,the state rule governing appointment of capta guardians ad litem,does not explicitly address whether its provisions apply to appeals.rule c provides simply a capta guardian ad litem must be appointed for every child who is subject to a juvenile dependency petition under welfare and institutions code section.however,because a child involved in an appeal from a dependency proceeding order is still the subject of a juvenile dependency petition,capta imposes on state courts a continuing obligation to ensure that each child has a capta guardian ad litem on appeal.given that capta requirements extend to appeals,and given the legislature manifest intent to ensure state eligibility for capta funds through compliance with capta requirements,we conclude that rule requires each child to have an appointed guardian ad litem on appeal.
what are the implications of these rules for a motion to dismiss though an attorney must zealously advocate for her client,she can not unilaterally appeal guardianship of gilman cal d,or bring a motion to dismiss aba model code responsibility,ec ante,d at,at.a motion to dismiss requires the authorization of the child or,if the child is incapable of giving authorization,the authorization of a guardian ad litem acting on the child behalf and in the child best interests.see aba model rules conduct,rule,coms,aba model code responsibility,ec.
in turn,the capta guardian ad litem has a duty to represent and protect the rights and best interests of the child.g see also b a xiii cal.rules of court,rule d.this means that in the trial court,a capta guardian ad litem who is also the child attorney has a duty to bring an appeal when it is in the child best interests to do so.on appeal,the duties imposed by capta and california rules of court,rule continue.thus,the capta guardian ad litem has a continuing duty to advocate for the child best interests,including seeking dismissal of an appeal when it is no longer in the child best interests.when the capta guardian ad litem and appellate counsel are two different people,the capta guardian ad litem has a duty to authorize appellate counsel to bring a motion to dismiss when it is in the child best interests and the child is not capable of providing authorization.
here,trial counsel had been appointed as the children capta guardian ad litem.when trial counsel filed a notice of appeal,the appellate court appointed a new appellate counsel,but not a new capta guardian ad litem.thus,trial counsel continued as the children capta guardian ad litem on appeal.regency health services,superior court th,fn,d holding that under code civ,a n appointment in the trial court suffices to appoint a guardian ad litem for appellate purposes also.given the children ages,a motion to dismiss could be brought only with the concurrence and authorization of trial counsel in her role as capta guardian ad litem if trial counsel refused to authorize the motion,appellate counsel would have the option of either zealously arguing any issues on appeal or seeking to withdraw.
appellate counsel argues that section,subdivision d and california rules of court,rule limit trial counsel capta guardian ad litem service to the superior court trial counsel could not serve as capta guardian ad litem in the absence of a formal appointment by the court of appeal and appellate counsel should be deemed the children capta guardian ad litem on appeal based on the language of california rules of court,former rules,and a,despite the lack of any formal appointment.we are not persuaded.
first,nothing in section,subdivision d or california rules of court,rule limits trial counsel capta guardian ad litem service to the superior court.section,subdivision d governs only the scope of trial counsel appointment as counsel and does not bear on her appointment as guardian ad litem.rule distinguishes between the duties of a capta guardian ad litem,which it defines,and the duties of a guardian ad litem.cal.rules of court,rule b.it applies to all juvenile dependency proceedings ibid,but does
