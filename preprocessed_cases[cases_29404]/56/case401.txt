appellant jorge,an admitted gang member,was riding in the front passenger seat of a car with two other known gang members when they were pulled over by police.a police officer discovered a gun in plain sight on the rear left passenger floorboard.appellant appeals from the juvenile court true findings that he carried a loaded firearm in a vehicle,subd.a,hereafter a as an active participant in a criminal street gang,subd.a c,hereafter a c,and was a minor in possession of a firearm,subd.a,hereafter a.for the reasons that follow,we remand the matter to the juvenile court.in the published portion of this opinion,we conclude section a c requires proof of felonious conduct separate and distinct from the conduct supporting a section a allegation,notwithstanding the possibility the section a conduct can support multiple offense allegations.in the unpublished portion,we address appellant claims of insufficient evidence,clerical error,and sentencing error.
factual and procedural history 
appellant was a known active member of the loco park clique of the sureno criminal street gang.officer dwight brumley,a member of the gang suppression unit of the visalia police department,had prior contacts with appellant and knew appellant was on probation with gang conditions.while on routine patrol on may,officer brumley noticed appellant sitting in the front passenger seat of a mustang.two other known gang members from the loco park clique were also in the car,one in the driver seat,one in the right rear passenger seat.officer brumley initiated a traffic stop and the mustang pulled over to the side of the road.
as officer brumley approached the driver side of the car,he heard a thud that sounded like something metal or heavy hitting the floor.he had the occupants step out of the car.when the driver got out of the car,officer brumley saw a chrome handgun with an ivory handle in plain view on the floorboard of the unoccupied left rear passenger seat.the handgun was accessible to appellant from where he was seated in the car.officer brumley later determined it was a caliber sundance boe handgun in apparent working condition,with two live rounds in the magazine,but none in the chamber.appellant and his associates were transported to the police station.
officer daniel ford questioned appellant at the police station,asking him if he knew the gun was in the car.appellant initially denied knowing the gun was in the car.the officer believed he was lying based on his experience in the gang suppression unit and knowledge that as a matter of course gang members inform everyone in a car if a gun is present so those on probation or parole can make informed decisions about violating their conditions of release.appellant confirmed this practice was true and admitted knowing the gun was in the car.
the petition charged appellant with three counts carrying a loaded firearm in a vehicle a with a further allegation of being an active participant in a criminal street gang a c being a minor in possession of a concealable weapon a and active participation in a criminal street gang subd.a,hereafter a.the petition also charged for each of counts and a special gang allegation under section,subdivision b a hereafter b a,which is a sentencing enhancement.the parties raise no issues as to these special enhancement allegations.
after a contested jurisdictional hearing,the juvenile court found true the allegations of counts and,and the associated special gang enhancement allegations under section b a.the juvenile court adopted the recommendations of the probation department and sentenced appellant to days in the youth facility boot camp program,and set the maximum time of confinement for the current offenses at seven years,constituting a upper term for count minor in possession with a upper term sentence enhancement for the special gang allegation under section b a.the court stayed the sentence on count carrying a loaded weapon pursuant to section.the court set the aggregate maximum time of confinement for all prior and current sustained petitions at years,and months,less time served.
on appeal,appellant raises several disparate issues.
discussion 
substantial evidence shows appellant possessed or carried the weapon 
appellant asserts insufficient evidence supports the juvenile court finding that appellant possessed or carried the firearm in violation of sections a and a.we disagree.
standard of review 
in considering a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence,we review the entire record in the light most favorable to the judgment to determine whether it contains substantial evidence that is,evidence that is reasonable,credible,and of solid value from which a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.citation.we presume every fact in support of the judgment the trier of fact could have reasonable deduced from the evidence.citation.if the circumstances reasonably justify the trier of fact findings,reversal of the judgment is not warranted simply because the circumstances might also reasonably be reconciled with a contrary finding.citation.a reviewing court neither reweighs evidence nor reevaluates a witness credibility.citation.people.albillar cal th,albillar.
joint and constructive possession 
possession may be physical or constructive,and more than one person may possess the same contraband.in re daniel th,see in re jorge cal th.constructive possession means the object is not in the defendant physical possession,but the defendant knowingly exercises control or the right to control the object.citation.possession of a weapon may be proven circumstantially,and possession for even a limited time and purpose may be sufficient.citation.daniel,supra,th at.a defendant has constructive possession when the weapon,while not in his actual possession,is nonetheless under his dominion and control,either directly or through others.citations.people pena th,pena.dominion and control are essentials of possession,and they can not be inferred from mere presence or access.something more must be shown to support inferring of these elements.of course,the necessary additional circumstances may,in some fact contexts,be rather slight.citations.it is clear,however,that some additional fact is essential.people zyduck d.
the circumstantial evidence establishes appellant had knowledge of and constructive possession of the handgun.the gun was not concealed in the vehicle,but rather found in plain view on the rear floorboard,easily accessible to appellant.appellant admitted to officer ford he knew the gun was in the car,as did the other passengers.officer brumley testified he heard something heavy or metal drop to the floor immediately prior to his discovery of the gun on the rear floorboard.the juvenile court reasonably concluded that appellant knew of the gun location in his vicinity in the car and had the right to control it,both by its nearby location on the floorboard and under common gang practices.substantial evidence supports the juvenile court finding as to the section a possession charge.
carrying a loaded firearm 
in contrast to section a,which prohibits a minor possession of a concealable firearm,section a prohibits a person from carrying a loaded firearm either on his or her person or in a vehicle.although the terms are not synonymous,we note the offense of carrying a concealed firearm in a requires no action on a defendant part beyond merely having the gun available for use and such offense is committed with the single passive act of carrying the firearm in a concealed fashion in a vehicle.people arzate th.thus,likewise,the offense of carrying a loaded weapon in a vehicle requires no action beyond the single passive act of carrying the weapon in a vehicle.see pena,supra,th at a defendant is armed when he has the weapon available for use,either offensively or defensively.citation.a weapon that is available for use creates the danger it will be used.thus,it is the availability the ready access of the weapon that constitutes arming.citation.evidence of constructive possession of a loaded weapon in a vehicle,such as that described,ante,may therefore also support a finding of carrying a loaded firearm in a vehicle.substantial evidence therefore supports the juvenile court finding as to the section a carrying charge.
ii.substantial evidence supports the juvenile court implicit finding appellant was a minor 
appellant asserts the prosecution failed to provide evidence appellant was a minor at the contested jurisdictional hearing,thus failing to prove an element of the section a offense minor in possession of a concealable weapon we construe this to be a sufficiency of the evidence argument as to the existence of the element of appellant status as a minor and conclude substantial evidence supports the juvenile court implied finding of each element of count.see people lynch cal th.
a n order is presumed correct all intendments are indulged in to support it on matters as to which the record is silent,and error must be affirmatively shown.citation.we must view the record in the light most favorable to the trial court ruling and defer to its findings of historical fact,whether express or implied,if they are supported by substantial evidence.citation.people carpenter cal th.if the circumstances reasonably justify the juvenile court finding,we can not reverse merely because the circumstances also might support a contrary finding.citation.this rule applies equally to express and implied findings.citation.in re manuel cal th.
although appellant concedes the juvenile court had before it in the record documentation of appellant date of birth,appellant asserts such documentation fails to constitute evidence,comparable to that which would be provided to a jury in an adult criminal case.respondent asserts the juvenile court established appellant age at the beginning of the jurisdictional hearing when the court asked appellant his date of birth and he responded,which equated to years of age.appellant argues this is unsworn testimony that also fails to qualify as evidence.
welfare and institutions code section states,at the hearing t he admission and exclusion of evidence shall be pursuant to the rules of evidence established by the evidence code and by judicial decision.proof beyond a reasonable doubt supported by evidence,legally admissible in the trial of criminal cases,must be adduced to support a finding that the minor is a person described by welfare and institutions code section.evidence code section defines evidence as testimony,writings,material objects,or other things presented to the senses that are offered to prove the existence or nonexistence of a fact.
juvenile proceedings are not identical to adult criminal proceedings.although juvenile offenders enjoy many of the rights enjoyed by adult defendants in criminal trials,a right to a jury trial is not one of them.people nguyen cal th.the united states supreme court decision not to find a constitutional jury trial right in juvenile proceedings reflected its concern that the introduction of juries in that context would interfere too greatly with the effort to deal with youthful offenders by procedures less formal and adversarial,and more protective and rehabilitative at least to a degree than those applicable to adult defendants.citations.id.at,explaining mckeiver pennsylvania.welfare and institutions code section specifically embodies this treatment of juveniles 
the judge of the juvenile court shall control all proceedings during the hearings with a view to the expeditious and effective ascertainment of the jurisdictional facts and the ascertainment of all information relative to the present condition and future welfare of the person upon whose behalf the petition is brought.except where there is a contested issue of fact or law,the proceedings shall be conducted in an informal nonadversary atmosphere with a view to obtaining the maximum cooperation of the minor upon whose behalf the petition is brought and all persons interested in his welfare with such provisions as the court may make for the disposition and care of such minor.
although appellant asserts the prosecution presented no evidence as to appellant age,we note the parties referred to appellant as the minor on multiple occasions during the jurisdictional hearing,with no objection from appellant counsel.based on the record before us,appellant status as a minor was not a contested fact.
furthermore,evidence in the record through testimony of police officers provide confirmation of appellant status as a minor.while questioning officer brumley,who was familiar with appellant and his record,the prosecution asked,did you notice anything about this minor,jorge,demeanor as you contacted him in the car on that day officer brumley responded,yeah.usually when i speak with him,he quite jovial the witnesses implicitly acknowledged the appropriateness of the use of minor to refer to appellant by responding affirmatively to the prosecution label of appellant as a minor.moreover,the prosecution differentiated the other occupants of the car,referring to them not as minors,but as individuals and as adults.
section a requires no specific showing of a juvenile age,only that he or she is a minor.substantial evidence supports the juvenile court implied factual finding that appellant was a minor at the time of the offense.
iii.felonious conduct supporting section a c must be distinct from the misdemeanor conduct underlying a section a offense 
the third issue appellant raises involves a complicated interplay between several statutes.appellant asserts the juvenile court felony finding of his a offense in count must be reduced to a misdemeanor because the prosecution failed to prove appellant engaged in felonious criminal conduct for purposes of the a c gang allegation.the gang allegation elevates the otherwise misdemeanor a offense to a felony.a c.
respondent contends the true finding of the felony allegation of count section a minor in possession of a concealable weapon constitutes the felonious conduct to support the a c gang allegation.section a,however,is a wobbler offense,punishable either as a misdemeanor or a felony,at the court discretion.c c see also robert.superior court cal th,robert.the trial court here failed to declare the section a offense a felony,in violation of california rules of court rule e.as outlined below,this issue is remanded to the juvenile court for further determination as to whether the section a offense is a felony or misdemeanor.
appellant,while conceding perhaps prematurely that the a offense is a felony,argues his conduct underlies two offenses,but there was no distinct felonious conduct as between the two offenses.in other words,he asserts we should differentiate felonious conduct from felonious offenses.for the sake of judicial economy,we address this contention,notwithstanding the possibility that upon remand,the juvenile court finds the a offense to be a misdemeanor.as outlined below,we agree with appellant the felonious criminal conduct requirement requires felonious conduct distinct from the misdemeanor gun possession conduct relied upon here,and thus reduce count from a felony to a misdemeanor.
conduct is not synonymous with offense 
section a states in pertinent part a person is guilty of carrying a loaded firearm when he or she carries a loaded firearm on his or her person or in a vehicle while in any public place or on any public street as we discussed,ante,substantial evidence supports the finding appellant committed this offense.
section a states in pertinent part carrying a loaded firearm in violation of this section is punishable,as follows c where the person is an active participant in a criminal street gang,as defined in section a as a felony.
section a states in pertinent part any person who actively participates in any criminal street gang with knowledge that its members engage in or have engaged in a pattern of criminal gang activity,and who willfully promotes,furthers,or assists in any felonious criminal conduct by members of that gang,shall be punished 
our supreme court has interpreted section a c to require proof of all the elements of section a,holding that carrying a loaded firearm in public becomes a felony under section a c when a defendant satisfies the elements of the offense described in section a by actively participat ing in any criminal street gang with knowledge that its members engage in or have engaged in a pattern of criminal gang activity and willfully promot ing,further ing,or assist ing in any felonious criminal conduct by members of that gang.a.robles,supra,cal th at.
more recently,our supreme court further clarified the process in performing a section a c analysis,concluding all of section a elements must be satisfied,including that defendant willfully promoted,furthered,or assisted felonious conduct by his fellow gang members before section a c applies to elevate defendant section,subdivision a misdemeanor offense to a felony.stated conversely,section a c applies only after section a has been completely satisfied by conduct distinct from the otherwise misdemeanor conduct of carrying a loaded weapon in violation of section,subdivision a.people lamas cal th,original italics lamas.the court concluded,defendant misdemeanor conduct being a gang member who carries a loaded firearm in public can not satisfy section a third element,felonious conduct,and then be used to elevate the otherwise misdemeanor offense to a felony.ibid.
in lamas,the defendant discarded a loaded handgun into a planter while attempting to flee from police by scaling a wall.a police gang enforcement team member testified he believed defendant was an active member in the baker street criminal street gang.the handgun was one of several guns that had been stolen earlier.lamas was charged with four felonies active participation in a gang a active gang member carrying a loaded firearm in public a c active gang member carrying a concealed firearm on his person,subds.a b and receiving stolen property,subd.a.the information also alleged a gang enhancement under section,subdivision b as to the second charge.finally,he was also charged with misdemeanor resisting and obstructing an officer.the jury found lamas guilty of being an active participant in a criminal street gang,the elevated felony gun offenses,and misdemeanor resisting an officer.lamas,supra,cal th at.
the two gun offenses in lamas required a finding the defendant was an active participant in a criminal street gang under section a to trigger the elevation from misdemeanor to felony.our supreme court,however,concluded that a triggering section a violation required separate felonious conduct from the misdemeanor gun offense conduct.lamas,supra,cal th at.the gang allegation was to be applied to elevate the offense to a felony only after the elements of section a were proved separately using conduct distinct from the conduct underlying the misdemeanor gun offenses.lamas,supra,at.the court found prejudicial instructional error where the trial court informed the jury the underlying felonious conduct for section a could be possession of a loaded or concealed firearm,and reversed the gun convictions.lamas,supra,at.
the lamas court declined to address the issue before us,noting in a footnote,w e do not address the issue raised in briefing regarding whether the felonious conduct requirement in section a can be satisfied with conduct that occurs contemporaneously with otherwise misdemeanor gun offenses because the record does not contain evidence that defendant lamas engaged in any felonious conduct,either concurrently with,or prior to,his misdemeanor gun offenses.lamas,supra,cal th at,fn.
assuming the juvenile court declares the section a offense in count to be a felony,the issue before us is a determination of whether or not the section a offense,which is based on appellant same conduct as the section a offense,can support a section a violation and by extension,application of the section a c gang allegation.
the language of section a is facially unambiguous.albillar,supra,cal th at people castenada cal th,castaneda through section a plainly worded requirements criminal knowledge,willful promotion of a felony,and active participation in a criminal street gang our legislature has made it reasonably clear what conduct is prohibited.in castenada,the court,analyzing the requirement of section a for a defendant to actively participate in a criminal street gang,noted in dicta,a person who violates section a has also aided and abetted a separate felony offense committed by gang members castenada,supra,cal th at.
the albillar court analyzed the phrase any felonious criminal conduct original italics in section a,but focused on the determination that the phrase targeted felonious criminal conduct,not felonious conduct.albillar,supra,cal th at.the court explained,t he legislature clearly knew how to draft language limiting the nature of the criminal conduct promoted,furthered,or assisted and could have included such language had it desired to so limit the reach of section a.id.at.the court discussed the legislative history of the statute,noting it went through a handful of amendments,one of which added felonious to criminal conduct.id.at.if the legislature desired to specify felonious criminal offenses,or expand the scope of the conduct required,it had ample opportunity and ability to do so.compare,subd.b any person who is convicted of a felony committed for the benefit of,at the direction of,or in association with any criminal street gang,with the specific intent to promote,further,or assist in any criminal conduct by gang members italics added with,subd.c making any felony offense,which would constitute a felony violation of section a serious felony italics added people briceno cal th,briceno.thus,conduct and offense are not synonymous for purposes of a section a analysis.
the lamas court alluded to the distinction between conduct and offenses as well.it noted,misdemeanor convictions do not constitute felonious criminal conduct,and that i t logically follows that misdemeanor conduct similarly can not constitute felonious criminal conduct within the meaning of section.lamas,supra,cal th at see also briceno,supra,cal th at,concluding section,subdivision c reference to a felony violation of section encompassed sentence enhancements under section,subdivision b,and not just the felony offense of section a.while different facts here had to be proved for the a offense,such as minor status as a minor discussed,ante,or the concealable nature of the weapon,appellant conduct remained the same,and thus can not be used to support the a c gang allegation in violation of lamas.
the single act required of the section a and section a charges was possession or carrying of the handgun,as discussed,ante.appellant was found guilty of both offenses by virtue of being a passenger in a car with access to a handgun.his behavior,actions,and omissions constituted a single course of conduct from which those two charges arose.this was acknowledged by the juvenile court in its application of section in appellant disposition.
at the dispositional hearing,the juvenile court adopted the probation report recommendations,which included staying the term for count a under section.section prohibits multiple punishment for offenses arising out of the same conduct,stating in part,a an act or omission that is punishable in different ways by different provisions of law shall be punished under the provision that provides for the longest potential term of imprisonment,but in no case shall the act or omission be punished under more than one provision.thus,the probation department and the juvenile court recognized that a single act,omission,or course of conduct supported both counts and.
we conclude the prosecution must prove felonious conduct distinct from the conduct that underlies the a offense,notwithstanding the possibility that a separate felony offense may be charged based on the same underlying conduct.misdemeanor conduct that would be impermissibly used to support the gang allegation in count under lamas can not be transformed into viable felonious conduct simply by charging a different offense.
we note that section a itself is not at issue.appellant makes no argument it is not properly charged and we have determined,ante,substantial evidence supports it.the issue,rather,is its use as the means to turn an otherwis
