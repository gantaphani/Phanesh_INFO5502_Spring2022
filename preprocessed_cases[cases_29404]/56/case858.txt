in this case we consider the constitutionality of three gang registration provisions of the street terrorism enforcement and prevention act the step act,as amended by proposition,an initiative approved by the voters in the march,primary election.first,we address a challenge to a provision requiring registration as a gang member by any person convicted of,and any person who has had a petition sustained in juvenile court for,a ny crime that the court finds is gang related at the time of sentencing or disposition,subd.b.we apply a limiting construction to the term gang related and hold that,as limited,it is not unconstitutionally vague.we also conclude that the record does not contain sufficient evidence to support the juvenile court finding that the crimes of appellant jorge the minor were gang related.
the second provision at issue requires those registering as gang members to provide a local law enforcement agency with a written statement giving any information that may be required by the law enforcement agency,subd.a c for juvenile registrants,subd.a c for adult registrants.the minor contends that the requirement to give any information that may be required is unconstitutionally vague violates his rights against and to free speech,free association,and privacy and constitutes an improper delegation of authority in violation of the doctrine.to assist the trial court upon remand,we hold that this provision is constitutional,again subject to a limiting construction.
the final provision the minor challenges provides that the registration requirements shall remain in effect for five years after imposition,subd.c.the minor contends that this constitutes cruel and unusual punishment as applied to him because his offenses were minor compared to the length of time that he is required to register.we hold that requiring the minor to register pursuant to the statute is not cruel and usual punishment.
we vacate the juvenile court order,to the extent it directs the minor to register,and remand for a new disposition hearing to provide the people an opportunity to submit additional evidence on the issue of gang relatedness in light of our construction of the statute.we affirm the judgment in all other respects.
factual and procedural histories 
the minor was arrested on march,outside an apartment building in tulare.police found him there among a group of to youths after residents reported a disturbance.the arresting officer arrived at the scene and saw the group of youths,six or seven of whom were wearing red clothing,shouting at a resident of the building.red is the color of the norte√±os gangs the minor was wearing a red shirt and shoes with red markings.the adult resident had the name of the fresno bulldogs gang tattooed across his bare chest.when police arrived,the minor was at the front of the group and continued shouting as his companions fled.the minor finally fled as well but was apprehended.
the people filed a juvenile wardship petition charging the minor with disturbing the peace in violation of section and resisting,delaying or obstructing a peace officer in violation of section,subdivision a,both misdemeanors.the minor admitted to the allegations in the petition.the probation report recommended that the minor remain with his family and be placed on probation.among the recommended conditions of probation was that he register with the police as a gang member pursuant to section,subdivision b.at a contested disposition hearing,the minor challenged the gang registration recommendation.after receiving testimony by the arresting officer,the court concluded that the charges were gang related and ordered the minor to register.
discussion 
gang related 
the step act was enacted by the legislature in to seek the eradication of criminal activity by street gangs by focusing upon patterns of criminal gang activity and upon the organized nature of street gangs.the step act added sections through to the penal code.stats,ch,stats,ch.
proposition amended the step act,adding sections,and.voter information guide,primary,text of,at as of april.section provides that any person convicted in a criminal court or who has had a petition sustained in a juvenile court in this state for a ny crime that the court finds is gang related at the time of sentencing or disposition must register as a gang member with local law enforcement.section requires the court making the gang relatedness finding to advise the defendant of his or her duty to register.section sets forth the steps the defendant must take to comply with the duty to register and section makes failure to register a misdemeanor.
the minor argues that the term gang related in section,subdivision b,is unconstitutionally vague.a facial vagueness challenge is based on the due process clauses of the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution,and on article i,section of the california constitution.williams garcetti cal th,d.under both the federal and the state constitutions,vagueness invalidates a criminal statute if the statute fail s to provide the kind of notice that will enable ordinary people to understand what conduct it prohibits or if it may authorize and even encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.citation.people castenada cal th,d,see also williams garcetti,supra,cal th at,d.
we faced a constitutional vagueness challenge to the word gang in a context similar to the present case in people lopez th,d.there,the defendant had been sentenced to probation with conditions,including a prohibition on being involved in any gang activities,and on associat ing with any gang members id.at,d.we concluded that the word gang in this context is,on its face,uncertain in meaning,and that the condition would be unconstitutional if not for the availability of a limiting construction.id.at,d.we noted that in lanzetta new jersey,the supreme court invalidated a new jersey statute.in doing so,the court stated that the word gang had various definitions in dictionaries and in historical and sociological writings,observing that it could find no definition in statutory or case law.we also cited contemporary dictionary definitions,commenting that a lthough gang has in the recent past likely acquired generally sinister implications,the word has considerable benign connotations,such as a group of persons working under the same direction or at the same task people lopez,supra,th at,d.in short,the condition as written did not give the defendant sufficient notice of the precluded activities or the persons with whom he should not associate.
here,absent a statutory definition of the word gang in the phrase gang related,section,subdivision b,fails to give the public clear notice of the conduct that will result in the requirement to register as a gang member.but,as in lopez,an appropriate limiting construction is available.in lopez,we held that gang in the conditions of probation meant criminal street gang as defined in the section of the step act.section,subdivision f,states 
as used in this chapter,criminal street gang means any ongoing organization,association,or group of three or more persons,whether formal or informal,having as one of its primary activities the commission of one or more of the criminal acts enumerated in paragraphs to,inclusive,of subdivision e,having a common name or common identifying sign or symbol,and whose members individually or collectively engage in or have engaged in a pattern of criminal gang activity.
section,subdivision e,provides 
as used in this chapter,pattern of criminal gang activity means the commission of,attempted commission of,conspiracy to commit,or solicitation of,sustained juvenile petition for,or conviction of two or more of the following offenses,provided at least one of these offenses occurred after the effective date of this chapter and the last of those offenses occurred within three years after a prior offense,and the offenses were committed on separate occasions,or by two or more persons 
a list of enumerated offenses follows.as we observed in lopez,the california supreme court in people gardeley cal th,d,upheld section,subdivisions e and f,against a constitutional vagueness challenge,concluding that the statute sufficiently informs the public of what is a criminal street gang.people lopez,supra,th at,d.
the application of this definition of gang is even more appropriate here than it was in lopez.in lopez,the term was used in conditions of probation imposed by the court.here,it is used in the very same statute as the one in which the definition of criminal street gang appears.when the voters approved the addition of section to the step act via proposition,the ballot pamphlet placed the entire text of section which was also amended by proposition before them.voter information guide,supra,text of.as a result,both are parts of the same statute,the amended step act.
in interpreting a voter initiative,we apply the same principles of construction as when interpreting any other statute.robert superior court cal th,d.a part of a statute should not be interpreted in isolation,but in the context of the entire statute of which it is a part,in order to achieve harmony among the parts.id.at,d.
we acknowledge that nothing prevented section,subdivision b,from containing the words criminal street gang instead of only gang.but we do not believe the voters intended to make a distinction between the two expressions.we instead conclude the terms are used interchangeably and that the voters intended gang related to mean related to a criminal street gang.the findings and declarations prefacing proposition support this conclusion.for instance,subdivision b of section states that c riminal street gangs and violence pose a significant threat to public safety and the health of many of our communities.voter information guide,supra,text of.
as a result,we adopt the definition of criminal street gang set forth in section,subdivisions e and f,as a limiting construction of the word gang in section,subdivision b.
a court may,rewrite a statute in order to preserve it against invalidation under the constitution,when we can say with confidence that i it is possible to reform the statute in a manner that closely effectuates policy judgments clearly articulated by the enacting body,and ii the enacting body would have preferred the reformed construction to invalidation of the statute.by applying these factors,courts may steer clear of judicial policymaking in the guise of statutory reformation,and thereby avoid encroaching on the legislative function in violation of the separation of powers doctrine.kopp fair pol.practices com.cal th,d.
these two criteria are met here.proposition makes clear that the voters intent is to take steps to control criminal street gangs and is better effectuated by adopting this limiting construction rather than invalidating section,subdivision b.
we see no need to adopt any limiting construction of the word related.although broad in meaning,the word is not vague in this context.related is a commonly used word with a broad meaning that encompasses a myriad of relationships.for example,a leading legal dictionary defines related to mean standing in relation connected allied akin.black law dict.ed.bay cities paving grading,lawyers mutual ins.cal th,d.t he fact that related can encompass a wide variety of relationships does not necessarily render the word ambiguous.to the contrary,a word with broad meaning or multiple meanings may be used for that very achieve a broad purpose.ibid.it is evident that in enacting proposition,the voters intended to address broadly the problem of crimes related to criminal street gangs.
for the guidance of the juvenile court on remand,we note that the criteria for imposing a sentence enhancement under section,subdivision b,include a reference to crimes committed for the benefit of,at the direction of,or in association with any criminal street gang crimes within the meaning of section,subdivision b,surely include,but are not limited to,all crimes committed for the benefit of,at the direction of,or in association with a criminal street gang.
ii.sufficient evidence 
with this understanding of the phrase gang related in mind,we now address whether the juvenile court finding of gang relatedness was supported by sufficient evidence.when an appellant asserts there is insufficient evidence to support the judgment,our review is circumscribed.citation.we review the whole record most favorably to the judgment to determine whether there is substantial is,evidence that is reasonable,credible,and of solid which a reasonable trier of fact could have made the requisite finding under the governing standard of proof.in re jerry th,d.
standard of proof 
the requisite finding is that the minor crimes were related to a criminal street gang.we consider this below.before doing so,we first identify the applicable standard of proof.the minor argues that the court was required to find gang relatedness beyond a reasonable doubt.the people argue that only a preponderance of the evidence is necessary.
in apprendi new jersey,d,the united states supreme court held that due process requires that o ther than the fact of a prior conviction,any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury,and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.the question here is whether gang registration is an additional punishment,constituting an increase in the maximum punishment otherwise available for the crimes at issue.
we answer this question in light of people castellanos cal th,d.there was no majority opinion in that case,but two separate concurring opinions agreed on the result.the court considered whether registration as a sex offender pursuant to section constituted punishment for purposes of analysis under the prohibition on ex post facto laws.that prohibition applies only to laws that punish.castellanos,supra,at,d,lead opn.of george.both opinions applied united states supreme court decisions in which two factors appear important whether the legislature intended the provision to constitute punishment and,if not,whether the provision is so punitive in nature or effect that it must be found to constitute punishment despite the legislature contrary intent.id.at,d,lead opn.of george,see also id.at,d,conc.dis.opn.of kennard.
both opinions concluded that the legislature did not intend sex offender registration to constitute punishment.people castellanos,supra,cal th at,d,lead opn.of george,fn.omitted id.at,d,conc.dis.opn.of kennard.both opinions also held that the provision was not so punitive as to constitute punishment.id.at,d,lead opn.of george,id.at,d,conc.dis.opn.of kennard.
applying these two factors here,we hold that registration under section is not punishment for due process purposes under apprendi.the voters purpose in enacting the registration provisions of proposition was similar to the legislature purpose in enacting registration facilitate surveillance of offenders by law enforcement.registration requirements generally are based on the assumption that persons convicted of certain offenses are more likely to repeat the crimes and that law enforcement ability to prevent certain crimes and its ability to apprehend certain types of criminals will be improved if these repeat offenders whereabouts are known.people adams d.
the registration requirement of section is no more punitive than sex offender registration.in fact,the requirement at issue here is substantially less onerous because registration is for life,while registration is only for five years from the last imposition.there is no reason the analysis should differ because this case involves the meaning of punishment for due process purposes under apprendi,while castellanos involved the meaning of the same word for purposes of the prohibition on ex post facto laws.consistently,in people marchand th,d,the court applied castellanos and concluded that registration under section is not punishment for due process purposes under apprendi and therefore need not be based on proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
the minor reliance on our opinion in people villela th,d is misplaced.there,we held that narcotics offender registration pursuant to health and safety code section is punishment for purposes of determining whether a defendant convicted of conspiracy to commit an offense enumerated in health and safety code section could be required to register.the people argument in favor of registration was that section provides that a person convicted of conspiracy to commit a felony is punishable in the same manner as a person convicted of the felony itself.registration is punishment,so conspirators to commit enumerated offenses must be required to register,just like those who actually commit the offenses.we agreed,relying on in re reed cal d,in which the california supreme court held that sex offender registration is punishment for purposes of the prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.people villela,supra,th at,d.
in light of the supreme court subsequent decision in castellanos,neither villela nor reed is applicable here.in castellanos,justice kennard opinion distinguished reed on the grounds that reed concerned cruel and unusual punishment,and punishment is a broader concept in that context than in others.people castellanos,supra,cal th at,d,conc.dis.opn.of kennard.the lead opinion distinguished reed on similar grounds and expressly disapproved reed to the extent it may have had any implications for the ex post facto context.id.at,d,lead opn.we recognize that any proposition or principle stated in an opinion is not to be taken as the opinion of the court,unless it is agreed to by at least four of the justices.citations.adoption of kelsey cal th,d.in castellanos,however,two opinions signed by a total of six justices agreed that reed did not apply in the ex post facto context and implied that it should not apply outside the context.for these reasons,we conclude that reed does not apply here,nor does villela,which is based on reed.
in light of our decision that registration pursuant to section is not punishment for purposes of due process under apprendi,the fact that the subject crime was gang related need be proved only by a preponderance of the evidence.
requisite finding 
the court registration order is based on a finding that the crimes the minor committed were gang related.this finding is supported by sufficient evidence only if there is evidence that is reasonable,credible,and of solid value supporting each element of gang relatedness.a crime is gang related if it is related to a criminal street gang as defined in section,subdivisions e and f.the elements of this definition require an ongoing organization or group,of three or more persons,having as one of its primary activities the commission of the crimes enumerated in section,subdivision e,having a common name or symbol,and whose members individually or collectively have engaged in a pattern of criminal gang activity.this pattern of gang activity must consist of a two or more of the offenses enumerated in section,subdivision e,provided that at least one offense occurred after the effective date of the statute b the last offense occurred within three years of the one before it and c the offenses were committed on separate occasions or by two or more persons.
the minor concedes that elements,and were proved adequately.testimony by the arresting officer and statements in the probation report established that the minor was a member of a norte√±os gang,which is an ongoing organization or group of three or more persons having a common name or symbol.also,the minor conduct was related to that of his companions.this leaves elements and.
to support element,there must be substantial evidence that the commission of offenses enumerated in section,subdivision e,is a primary activity of the gang.evidence of past or present conduct by gang members involving the commission of one or more of the statutorily enumerated crimes is relevant in determining the group primary activities.people sengpadychith cal th,d.however,evidence sufficient to show only one offense is not enough.
the phrase primary activities,as used in the gang statute,implies that the commission of one or more of the statutorily enumerated crimes is one of the group chief or principal occupations.see webster internat.dict.ed defining primary.that definition would necessarily exclude the occasional commission of those crimes by the group members sufficient proof of the gang primary activities might consist of evidence that the group members consistently and repeatedly have committed criminal activity listed in the gang statute.people sengpadychith,supra,cal th at,d.
we recognize that a gang primary activities may be shown though expert testimony people sengpadychith,supra,cal th at,d,people gardeley,supra,cal th at,d,however,no expert testimony was presented on this subject.further,as we shall explain later,the record supports a conclusion that only one enumerated offense was proven.consequently,it follows that there is insufficient evidence to support element.
to support element,there must be substantial evidence of at least two predicate offenses committed within the specified time frame by the minor or other members of his gang.here,the record contains sufficient evidence of only one of the offenses enumerated in section,subdivision e a violation of section,the making of criminal threats.the minor admitted to a petition alleging that he committed this offense in san jose on september.further,the probation report filed in connection with that petition sufficiently establishes that he was a member of a norte√±os gang when he committed this offense.that said,there is insufficient evidence that the minor or any other member of his gang committed another enumerated offense,as required.
the people argue that the minor conduct on march,when he committed the offenses with which he was charged in this case,is sufficient to show additional violations of section.section provides 
any person who willfully threatens to commit a crime which will result in death or great bodily injury to another person,with the specific intent that the statement,made verbally,in writing,or by means of an electronic communication device,is to be taken as a threat,even if there is no intent of actually carrying it out,which,on its face and under the circumstances in which it is made,is so unequivocal,unconditional,immediate,and specific as to convey to the person threatened,a gravity of purpose and an immediate prospect of execution of the threat,and thereby causes that person reasonably to be in sustained fear for his or her own safety or for his or her immediate family safety,shall be punished by imprisonment in the county jail not to exceed one year,or by imprisonment in the state prison.
the record contains some evidence of threats made on the day of the minor arrest.the arresting officer testified that he went to the scene of the disturbance twice on that day.the first time,the minor and his companions apparently were not present when the officer arrived,but the officer met and spoke with the victim.according to the officer,the victim stated that the minor had been there earlier and threatened to come back and shoot the victim.in addition,when the minor was arrested,the officer heard him yelling obscenities at the victim,and calling him a bitch,calling him out to fight.
we agree that this evidence arguably supports the contention that on the day of his arrest,the minor willfully threatened to commit a crime which would result in death or great bodily injury.but there is no evidence in the record regarding a with what specific intent,if any,such threats were made b whether the threats were so unequivocal,unconditional,immediate,and specific as to convey to the victim a gravity of purpose and immediate prospect of execution or c whether the victim was reasonably in sustained fear for his safety.consequently,the record does not support a finding of a second violation of section.
in sum,the record contains evidence that the minor was a norte√±o and violated sections and,subdivision a,while in the company of other norte√±os.but a finding of a crime within the meaning of section must be based on more than this at least two predicate offenses must also be proved,and the commission of enumerated offenses must be proved to be a primary activity of the group.the record here lacks sufficient evidence of these additional facts.
in light of our conclusion,we remand to the juvenile court for a new hearing on the question of gang relatedness.although we reverse the order to register,we conclude the people are entitled to present sufficient evidence in light of the definition and standard of proof that we set forth in this opinion.
in doing so,we conclude that a second disposition hearing will not violate the prohibition on double jeopardy.in people monge cal th,d,the california supreme court held that a retrial on prior convictions alleged for purposes of sentence enhancement,following a reversal of the sentence due to insufficient evidence,does not violate the bar on double jeopardy.the united states supreme court agreed,affirming in monge california,d.the protection against double jeopardy does not apply because t he pronouncement of sentence simply does not have the qualities of constitutional finality that attend an acquittal.citation.id.at.the same reasoning applies here.
nor would the imposition of registration upon remand,if the court makes the requisite findings based on sufficient evidence,be prevented by the doctrines of res judicata,collateral estoppel,or law of the case.in people barragan cal th,d,our supreme court held that res judicata and collateral estoppel did not bar retrial of a prior juvenile adjudication allegation after reversal for insufficient evidence because,among other reasons,the reversal did not constitute a final decision on the merits regarding the truth of the alleged prior juvenile adjudication.id.at,d.the court also held that the law of the case doctrine only bars a different finding after a retrial if the prosecution fails to introduce substantial additional evidence in support of the allegation.the additional evidence the prosecution may adduce is not limited to evidence newly discovered after the original proceeding.id.at,d.barragan resolved a conflict among the appellate court cases.see,people sotello th,d people scott th,d people mitchell th,d,overruled by people barragan,supra,cal th at,fn,d.the court reasoning in barragan applies equally well where,as here,the trial court findings supporting imposition of gang registration were based on insufficient evidence and the matter is remanded for a new disposition hearing.
the minor appeal includes a challenge to the admission of certain testimony at the disposition hearing.because we vacate the order to register and remand for a new hearing,we do not address that issue.
iii.any information that may be required 
on several constitutional bases,the minor challenges the requirement in section that he provide a written statement giving any information that may be required by the law enforcement agency upon registration as a gang member.we address these issues because of the possibility that the court will again order registration on remand.
the minor argues that the any information requirement is unconstitutionally vague.as indicated above,a statute is unconstitutionally vague if it fail s to provide the kind of notice that will enable ordinary people to understand what conduct it prohibits,or if it may authorize and even encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.people castenada,supra,cal th at,d.
the requirement to provide any information that may be required by the law enforcement agency does give the public clear notice of what it must do when,give law enforcement whatever information it requests.but such an unlimited obligation may authorize arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.under the literal meaning of this provision,law enforcement could demand any information from a registrant.these informational demands could range from his or her name and address to detailed and intimate personal information.they could include the identities of all the gang members the registrant knows and all crimes they and the registrant have committed or plan to commit.conceivably,law enforcement could base its decision on how much information to demand based on any or no reason.
in people sanchez th,d sanchez ii and people bailey th,d,the sixth district court of appeal concluded that the any information provision of section was impermissibly vague and subjected it to a limiting construction.we agree and do the same.
in bailey,the defendant contended that the any information requirement is unconstitutionally vague.after noting that a statute will not be held void for vagueness if a reasonable limiting construction is available,the court held that section may reasonably be construed to require descriptive or identifying information that aids law enforcement in monitoring the whereabouts of gang members people bailey,supra,th at,d.the court made clear that it was only referring to information about the registrant himself w e have determined that the questioning by law enforcement pursuant to the requirement to provide any information is limited to descriptive information about the registrant id.at,d,italics added.
in sanchez ii,the court referred to a previous decision in the same case,people sanchez.sanchez i,review granted.although acknowledging that review of sanchez i is pending,the court also noted that the supreme court limited its review to another issue.the court then restated its sanchez i holding regarding the meaning of the any information provision of section.it construed the provision to mean that the registrant must provide information from which the law enforcement agency could locate him or her s uch information would include the person full name,any aliases or monikers or change of name,the person date of birth,residence address,description and license plate number of any vehicle the person owns or drives,and information regarding the person employment or school.sanchez ii,supra,th at,d.on this basis,the court held that being asked what areas were frequented by the registrant was impermissibly vague and need not be answered.id.at,d.
the purpose of registration requirements is specific.they generally are based on the assumption that persons convicted of certain offenses are more likely to repeat the crimes and that law enforcement ability to prevent certain crimes and its ability to apprehend certain types of criminals will be improved if these repeat offenders whereabouts are known.citation.people bailey,supra,th at,d.based on this stated purpose,we construe section to mean that the registrant may be required to provide information enabling law enforcement to identify and locate the registrant.
the people rely on sanchez ii and bailey and,in doing so,implicitly concede that a limiting construction of section is appropriate.that said,the people argue for a different limiting construction than the one the court adopted in those cases t he registration requirement set forth in section reasonably requires the gang registrant to provide information as required by a law enforcement agency to locate known gang associates.italics added.in other words,it seems,the people would have us interpret the statute to allow police to demand from registrants the identities and whereabouts of other members of their gangs.for the reasons set forth below,we conclude that criminalizing a refusal to name and help locate one gang associates would violate the constitutional protection against.
the minor contends that the any information requirement violates the privilege against.the limiting construction we adopt renders the provision constitutional.
the privilege against is violated by a registration statute if it requires disclosure of information that would prove a significant link in a chain of evidence tending to establish the registrant commission of a crime marchetti united states,d,fns.omitted where the statute is directed at a highly selective group inherently suspect of criminal activities.albertson sacb,d.the united states supreme court has upheld the privilege against against statutes requiring registration of members of the communist party id.at.requiring disclosure of participation in illegal gambling marchetti united states,supra,at.requiring disclosure of possession of an unregistered firearm haynes united states,d and requiring disclosure of possession of marijuana leary united states,d.
on the other hand,routine booking information is not incriminatory and a requirement to provide it does not violate the privilege against.pennsylvania muniz,fn,d people rucker cal d,superseded on other grounds by constitutional amendment as stated in people hall d.
unless limited in the manner we have specified,the any information requirement would allow law enforcement to require disclosures that would be a significant link in a chain in proving that gang registrants have committed crimes.marchetti united states,supra,at.fn.omitted.this is particularly true since active,knowing participation in a criminal street gang is an element of a crime defined by section,subdivision a.for instance,to require disclosure of the identities of other gang members with whom the registrant associates would obviously help in proving that the registrant is a knowing participant in a gang.but because we construe the registration requirement as allowing law enforcement only to demand identifying and locational information about the registrant,there is no violation of the privilege against.
free speech and association 
the minor contends that the requirement to provide any information violates his constitutional right to free speech because it compels him to speak against his will.in light of our limiting construction,the statute is constitutional.
t he protections of the first amendment do not afford a witness the right to resist inquiry in all circumstances.barenblatt united states,d.the right to refuse to speak must give way where the state can show a substantial relation between the information sought and a subject of overriding and compelling state interest.gibson florida legislative comm,d.
the requirement to supply routine booking information passes this first amendment test.in people quiroga th,d,the court considered a first amendment challenge to the requirement to disclose one identity at booking.although the refusal to speak is protected,the court held,the individual interest must yield to the strong public interest in discovering the identity of a suspect t he routine booking interview is an indispensable procedure in the efficient administration of justice.therefore,the requirement to respond to routine booking questions does not violate the first amendment.id.at,d.
applying the same approach,we conclude that the public interest in detecting and preventing crime takes precedence over a gang registrant private interest in declining to provide identifying and locational information about him or herself.
the minor also argues that section violates his constitutional right to free association by potentially conditioning the exercise of this freedom upon a requirement that the registrant inform upon those with whom he chooses to associate.in light of our holding that the statute requires only identifying and locational information about the registrant,this argument has no merit.
the minor argues that the any information provision violates his constitutional right to privacy because it permits police to make intrusive inquiries.under the limiting construction we adopt,there is no constitutional violation.
the california constitution contains an express privacy protection,added as a constitutional amendment by voter initiative.cal,art.i.a purpose of the provision is to deter unnecessary collection of personal information by the government.white davis cal d.but i nvasion of a privacy interest is not a violation of the state constitutional right to privacy if the invasion is justified by a competing interest.hill national collegiate athletic cal th,d.assuming the minor has a protected privacy interest in information about himself,we nevertheless conclude that the statute impingement on this interest is justified by a competing interest.
in loder municipal court cal d,the court considered whether retention by law enforcement of records of arrests that do not lead to convictions violated the california constitution.the court held that it did not.the state has a substantial interest in retaining these records in order to protect the public from recidivist offenders,and,in light of statutory limits on dissemination of arrest records outside of law enforcement,there was no violation of the right to privacy.id.at.
the same reasoning applies here.the state has a strong interest in collecting information that enables law enforcement to identify and locate persons adjudicated to have committed crimes.the burden on registrants privacy interests is minimized by the provision in the statute that t he statements,photographs and fingerprints required under this section shall not be open to inspection by any person other than a regularly employed peace or other law enforcement officer,subd.d.the state interest justifies this limited intrusion on the minor privacy.
the united states constitution is less protective of privacy than the california constitution.american academy of pediatrics lungren cal th,d.therefore,the registration requirement,as we interpret it,does not violate privacy rights under the united states constitution.
delegation 
the minor argues that the any information requirement is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to law enforcement officials in violation of the doctrine because it gives local police the authority to ask any questions they want of gang registrants at the time of registration.the limiting construction we adopt,once again,vitiates the minor position.
an executive agency exercise of its power to apply a statute does not violate the doctrine where the fundamental policy determinations are contained in the legislation,and the legislation establish es a yardstick guiding the administrator people wright cal d.in wright,the court held that there was no unconstitutional delegation of power in the legislature decision to assign the judicial council the task of establishing criteria for imposing the upper and lower prison terms under the then new system of determinate sentencing.id.at.the assignment to police of the responsibility for collecting identifying and locational information on gang registrants does not even come close to violating the standards set forth in wright.
iv.cruel and unusual punishment 
the minor argues that the registration requirement is cruel and unusual punishment under article i,section of the california constitution and the eighth amendment to the united states constitution 
the case law is unsettled on whether offender registration statutes impose punishment at all,as indicated in the discussion above.in in re reed,supra,cal d,the california supreme court considered whether lifetime sex offender registration for misdemeanor offenses was punishment or was cruel and unusual.the court gave positive answers to both questions.in people castellanos,supra,cal th,d,by contrast,the court concluded that sex offender registration is not punishment for purposes of ex post facto analysis.
although the lead opinion in castellanos casts doubt on reed,its express language merely states that reed should be disapproved to the extent that decision can be interpreted as suggesting that sex offender registration constitutes punishment for purposes of ex post facto analysis.people castellanos,supra,cal th at,d,lead opn.of george.the concurring and dissenting opinion states that it is not intended to undermine the holding of reed so far as cruel and unusual punishment is concerned.id.at,d,conc.dis.opn.of kennard.reed is thus still the law with respect to the meaning of punishment for purposes of cruel and unusual punishment analysis,at least with respect to sex offender registration 
we need not determine whether gang registration is punishment for purposes of analysis,however.even if it is,it is not cruel or unusual in this case.a punishment may be cruel and unusual if it is so disproportionate to the crime for which it is inflicted that it shocks the conscience and offends fundamental notions of human dignity.in re lynch cal d,fn.omitted.a determination of whether a punishment is cruel and unusual may be made based on an examination of the nature of the offense and the off
