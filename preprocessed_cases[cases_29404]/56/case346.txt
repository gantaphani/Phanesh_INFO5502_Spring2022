i.the law regarding parentage 
the uniform parentage act,et provides the statutory framework by which california courts make paternity determinations.citations.under this statutory scheme,california law distinguished alleged,biological,and presumed fathers.citation.a man who may be the father of a child,but whose biological paternity has not been established,or,in the alternative,has not achieved presumed father status,is an alleged father.citation.citation.a biological or natural father is one whose biological paternity has been established,but who has not achieved presumed father status citation.presumed fathers are accorded far greater parental rights than alleged or biological fathers.citation.presumed father status is governed by family code section,which sets out several rebuttable presumptions under which a man may qualify for this status citations.biological fatherhood does not,in and of itself,qualify a man for presumed father status under family code section.on the contrary,presumed father status is based on the familial relationship between the man and the child,rather than any biological connection.citation.in re th,fn.omitted.t o become a presumed father,a man who has neither married nor attempted to marry his child biological mother must not only openly and publicly admit paternity,but must also physically bring the child into his home.adoption of michael cal th,italics omitted.

ii.factual and procedural background 
section petition 
on january,the alameda county social services agency agency filed a section petition on behalf of,who was a newborn baby at the time.the petition alleged mother failure to protect,subd.b,after tested positive for cocaine at birth.mother admitted using cocaine and marijuana during her pregnancy.the petition also alleged that mother had failed to reunify with at least one of siblings or.finally,the petition alleged,pursuant to section,subdivision g the identity,whereabouts and circumstances of the father ability to care for is unknown.mother states that she does not know who the father is.
detention report and hearing 
on january,was ordered detained.in the detention report,the social worker reported this is mother tenth child.she has four adult children and minors who have been placed out of her care and adopted.mother did not seek out prenatal care because she said that her other babies were born healthy mother stated that she does not know the father of the child.she was prostituting herself when she got pregnant and has no idea who the father is.despite mother long history of substance abuse,she had never entered a drug treatment program.
report and determination 
in the report,the social worker recommended that no reunification services be provided to mother,pursuant to section,subdivisions b and b,because she had failed to treat her substance abuse problem.the agency also indicated that father remained unknown and asked the court to set a section hearing.
by the time of the combined jurisdiction and disposition hearing,mother had disappeared.however,father appeared and was appointed counsel.father counsel indicated that father had signed a statement regarding parentage judicial council forms,form jv indicating that he was requesting the court to order paternity testing,although he was unable to pay for it.father also stated that,if he was biological father,he would seek custody.father pointed out that he had custody of then year old sister,nicole b.the agency stated that it opposed testing because it was not willing to pay.when the juvenile court asked father counsel for authority to support his request for testing,father counsel said it been past custom in this county.i do know if father has an absolute right.i think it the court discretion to order paternity testing for alleged fathers who present themselves in court and who have signed a declaration requesting same.
the juvenile court concluded that father,as an alleged father,did not have standing to contest the jurisdictional allegations.thus,the matter was submitted on the report prepared by the agency.the court found true the allegations under both section,subdivision b,and subdivision g.the court found the welfare of requires that custody be taken from the following person s mother,deanna for federal afdc purposes,the home of removal is that of the mother the court also ordered bypass of reunification services as to mother,pursuant to section,subdivisions b,b,and b.the court also ordered reunification services shall not be provided to the alleged father unless and until he establishes a legal basis.with respect to paternity testing,the juvenile court said given all the circumstances i heard,if father is truly interested in being the custodial parent and caregiver for this young child,then he should take the responsibility and find the wherewithal to pay for his paternity test absent some authority where the court must do it given the situation.i not ordering testing.if he wants to be tested,fine.what i saying is that whatever test has to be paid for by this gentleman.a section hearing was set.
section report 
in advance of the section hearing,the agency submitted a section report recommending that legal guardianship be approved as the permanent plan.the social worker noted that maternal cousin,and her partner,had been approved for placement.and were not interested in adoption but had requested appointment as legal guardians.
the social worker also wrote father was referred to the department of child support services dcss to pursue a paternity test however,the agency has since been informed that the dcss is no longer doing paternity tests unless there is a specific child support claim case opened.further,staff from dcss referred the agency to send clients to the family law facilitator office self help center through which the alleged parent can complete and file a paternity packet with the family law court.this would initiate a child support claim case and therefore a paternity test.on,the undersigned spoke with father who reported that he would be willing to do this 
permanent plan hearing 
the hearing on selection of a permanent plan took place,on june.the matter was submitted on the social worker report.however,father counsel noted we would like you to order the agency to do the paternity testing and go along and have the guardianship established.we want both things to occur.the agency counsel responded it has been our position if someone wants to know those results because they want to step forward and be a father,then they should be responsible for that and take it on themselves.we are asking that the legal guardianship proceed today.if he really needs to have that test result for himself,he can go to the family support center and take the test.if he does want to take on the financial responsibility,then i do know why he would want to know that for sure.he is still being granted visitation rights.
the juvenile court found that notice had been given as required by law,found it likely that would be adopted,but selected legal guardianship as permanent plan because he was living with a relative who was unable or unwilling to adopt.reasonable visitation was ordered for both mother and father.letters of guardianship issued.father was directed to the self help center at the family law center for paternity testing.
status review report 
on october,the agency filed a status review report,which indicated that and now wished to adopt.accordingly,the agency asked the court to schedule another section hearing.the report also noted father has been referred to lab corporation for a dna paternity test.father states that if he is the biological father,he will oppose termination of his parental rights.it was also noted that father had been having unsupervised overnight visits with and had expressed his desire for custody,if was his biological son.
presumed father finding 
on november,the juvenile court received the positive results of the paternity testing and declared father presumed father.father announced his intent to contest termination of his parental rights.
request to change court order 
shortly thereafter,father filed a request to change the court february,order,which had concluded father was ineligible for reunification services.the agency opposed father request,arguing w here,as here,reunification services have been denied or terminated,particularly when the permanent plan is adoption,the focus shifts from a parent interest in the care,custody,and companionship of the child to the needs of the child for permanency and stability here,presumed father alleges that the recent establishment of his paternity constitutes changed circumstances.this alleged change of circumstances comes too late.as mentioned earlier,presumed father whereabout s were known as of january,and he has appeared in this matter as alleged father since the first uncontested hearing on january.therefore,as of january,presumed father was represented by counsel and should have been made aware that a permanent plan of adoption would mean a termination of his parental rights.even so,as previously discussed,presumed father did not pursue presumed father status in a timely manner.presumed father was given multiple referrals for paternity tests on february,march,may,and again prior to november,but did not follow through until october or november of.i t would likewise be difficult to imagine how presumed father could show that the best interests of would be served by returning him,since father has never actually parented him prior to his removal.in fact,the social worker,if called as a witness,is prepared to testify that presumed father has only initiated four visits with since may of.
at a hearing on the matter,held on february,the juvenile court set aside its original order and ordered the agency to provide father with six months of reunification services.the court explained t he child is being protected by very able legal guardians apparently.and even when in the company of the father,there is no risk that has been mentioned or brought up in evidence either through the father testimony,and in,or through any of the reports,at least it has been pointed out to me.the largest concern i have about the father is his representation that he has been a successful parent,and obviously that is questionable given the number of children he had who have been through the system one way or the other,or permanently planned either adopted or dependent.so the court has some concern about his parenting skills,though that was fully developed.looking at the second purpose of providing services to the family to preserve the family or reunify with the family this is not a matter of termination of family reunification services by the father by anything that he did such as being abusive,neglectful,or not visiting with his child.to the contrary,he has done nothing to cause the break up of the family.
the agency sought reconsideration of the court ruling,which was granted.the court ordered termination of father reunification services.the court explained i still think it is a tough case.and upon further review,i thoroughly agree with the agency counsel.i made a mistake.i did not analyze the facts like i should have.i put too much importance on father desires to step up to be a father.that is not what the law requires in this instance.it what in the best interest of the child and whether or not there is a beneficial parent relationship that would be in the best interest of the child.there is no evidence of that.at the conclusion of the reconsideration hearing,the agency represented that it was no longer seeking adoption as permanent plan.
requests to terminate the guardianship 
a status review report,filed on july,indicated that the guardians now wished to set aside the legal guardianship and supported placement of with father.father and continued to have unsupervised weekend visits.guardians reported that appeared to enjoy the visits and returned to their home well and in good spirits.both father and the guardians filed requests to terminate the guardianship.stated,in her declaration in support i believe it is in best interest to be allowed to be raised by his father father has demonstrated a commitment to,and will provide a stable and permanent home for 
the agency submitted a report in advance of the hearing,in which it recommended that the legal guardianship be set aside and be placed with father,with family maintenance services.the social worker reported that the guardians would feel comfortable preventing from residing with his father given that father has show n his willingness and his ability to parent.the social worker also wrote the father reported he has resided in his current residence for approximately years.he is currently employed as a maintenance worker he currently has a bedroom unit in which his girlfriend,his girlfriend year old daughter and his year old daughter reside the agency is concerned that the father has limited experience caring for a toddler.however,the father has demonstrated a commitment to via consistent visitations,which include overnights.appears very affectionate towards his father and enjoys spending time with him.
the matter came on for hearing on august.at the hearing,counsel for the legal guardians indicated that they had changed their minds yet again and now wanted to go forward with adoption.because there was no longer any changed circumstance,the court denied the requests for a change of court order.the court also said i must say i am a little concerned,and for some reason mildly disappointed that we are here.i was really happy to hear that father was in a position to maybe get back.
third request for a change of order 
on september,father filed yet another request to change a court order,which sought termination of the guardianship and placement of in his custody.he asserted that and had not demonstrated commitment to.the juvenile court concluded that father had not met his burden to show changed circumstances.the court explained there is no question in my mind that father has stepped up as a father.i have been consistent in that regard,but we must follow the law.there is no evidence that the legal guardians,at this time,are unwilling to have physical custody of.
section report 
the agency again recommended adoption as permanent plan and another section hearing was calendared.the social worker observed has a regularly scheduled monthly weekend visit with his father the visitation schedule was the result of a mediation agreement developed on.visits are unsupervised and appear to go well for all parties.shows no signs of any emotional discomfort at transitioning between his guardian home and his father home.the social worker also wrote has been living in and home for a significant period of time and fits easily into the household has no health or emotional issues that would present an obstacle to adoption.seeks the guardians out for comfort,reassurance,and to show off his new developmental skills.he can be soothed by his proposed adoptive parents and is quick to give and receive affection and nurturing.he is affectionate and very socially engaging.is able to leave and return to the proposed adoptive parents,for daycare or visits with his father,without discomfort.the relationship is a relationship.
an updated report was provided,on january.therein,it was reported that father visitation with had been inconsistent.specifically,the social worker wrote the caregivers state that father cancelled the october visit due to him being hospitalized for medical concerns.the caregivers offered father a visit over the halloween weekend but this offer was not acted upon.the caregivers also report that the visit in november was cancelled when father called and stated he did not have the funds to pick up and drop off this month in sacramento.the caregivers reported that they were traveling to the bay area and offered to drop off at father oakland home and father would then only be responsible for getting back to their home in sacramento.this offer was also reportedly not acted upon.finally,the caregivers have expressed some frustration that they have been the ones to initiate the visit by calling father and arranging the details and if they do father will not call independently and a visit will not be scheduled although the inconsistency of father visitation has reportedly had little effect upon at this young age,it may become more harmful to him if the pattern continues in the future.
termination of parental rights 
the section hearing was ultimately held on february.father counsel argued that the parental bond exception to adoption,subd.c b i applied,and submitted the matter on the basis of the agency reports.however,father conceded that he had not visited with since september.he explained t he mediation was like for me to come and pick up and for and to come and get him at my home.they told me they could do it.they stopped,so i on the train and i ca pay so i had took ill,right,and once she told me that she could come into town and everything and pick him up that was the deal.one sunday afternoon i had to get up out of my bed and bring him back home because nobody was going to come and get him,and i really did have the money to do this,you know,so that is the only issue that i have i love to have my child every weekend but i not going to drive way out to sacramento and then drive back to bring him back home.
the court found that it was likely that would be adopted and that father had not met his burden of proving an exception.the court said we would have been this far if you were able to visit more because everyone would have realized that you had developed a relationship.unfortunately,you have not.i saluted you in the past for stepping up and wanting to be the father coming to court all the time doing all the testing and at some point visiting somewhat,but you did follow through,and it a question of what your priorities are,how you spend your money you were eligible after a certain period of time for transportation costs from the agency then you have to decide is this worth it to me enough where i going to prioritize my money to be able to go visit my son,and apparently you made the choice not to do that,and that unfortunate.mother and father parental rights were terminated.father filed a timely notice of appeal.
iii.discussion 
on appeal,father does not challenge the juvenile court findings that it is likely will be adopted,within the meaning of section,subdivision c,or that the exception to adoption found in section,subdivision c b i,does not apply.instead,he argues d ue process requires that a parental rights termination order be supported by clear and convincing evidence establishing that a parent is somehow unfit.in most california dependency cases,the detriment findings made to support removal of at the dispositional hearing and review hearings provide the court with adequate evidence of parental unfitness.but in this case,father was not recognized as a presumed father until after those hearings had taken place,so detriment findings were not made against him.because the court never made any finding suggesting that father was an unfit parent,the order terminating his parental rights was constitutionally invalid.
forfeiture 
preliminarily,we must agree with the agency that father has forfeited the argument he raises on appeal.not once did father trial counsel argue that his parental rights could not be terminated because no finding of parental unfitness had been made.in dependency litigation,a party forfeits the right to claim error as grounds for reversal on appeal when he or she fails to raise the objection in the trial court.citations.in re dakota th.however,as father correctly points out,application of the forfeiture rule is not automatic.in re cal th,superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in in re th,in re karla th.because father raises an important constitutional issue,we decline to pass the issue.see in re,at the appellate court discretion to excuse forfeiture should be exercised rarely and only in cases presenting an important legal issue in re frank th,frank we are reluctant to enforce the waiver rule when it conflicts with due process in re th,an appellate court may review an error despite a party failure to raise it below if due process rights are involved gladys,supra,th at same.because father has raised a question of law,we review the claimed constitutional violation de novo,supra,th at.
b.the merits of father constitutional argument 
f reedom of personal choice in matters of family life is a fundamental liberty interest protected by the fourteenth amendment.santosky kramer.t he state can not presume that a child and his parents are adversaries.after the state has established parental unfitness at that initial proceeding,the court may assume at the dispositional stage that the interests of the child and the natural parents do diverge.citation.but until the state proves parental unfitness,the child and his parents share a vital interest in preventing erroneous termination of their natural relationship.id.at,some italics added fn.omitted.thus,b efore a state may sever completely and irrevocably the rights of parents in their natural child,due process requires that the state support its allegations by at least clear and convincing evidence.id.at pp.
in cynthia superior court cal th,cynthia,our supreme court held that santosky kramer did not require that a detriment finding be made,at the termination hearing,under the clear and convincing evidence standard.the court reasoned unlike the termination hearings evaluated in santosky kramer,supra,the purpose of the section hearing is not to accumulate further evidence of parental unfitness and danger to the child,but to begin the task of finding the child a permanent alternative family placement.by the time dependency proceedings have reached the stage of a section hearing,there have been multiple specific findings of parental unfitness.except for a temporary period,the grounds for initial removal of the child from parental custody have been established under a clear and convincing standard see,subd.b in addition,there have been a series of hearings involving ongoing reunification efforts and,at each hearing,there was a statutory presumption that the child should be returned to the custody of the parent,subds.e,f,subd.a.only if,over this entire period of time,the state continually has established that a return of custody to the parent would be detrimental to the child is the section stage even reached.it is not the purpose of the section hearing to show parental inadequacy,which had to have been previously established,and there is no burden on the petitioning agency to show at the section hearing that the parents are at fault.the number of previous findings of fault,coupled with the seriousness of the resulting danger to the minor,most clearly differentiate the section hearing from the termination hearing in santosky kramer.a parent whose conduct has already and on numerous occasions been found to grievously endanger his or her child is no longer in the same position as a parent whose neglect or abuse has not so clearly been established.at this point the interests of the parent and child have diverged,and the child interest must be given more weight.cynthia,at pp,fns.omitted.
in arguing that the juvenile court terminated his parental rights in violation of due process,father relies on santosky kramer and a trio of appellate opinions distinguishing cynthia gladys l,supra,th,frank,supra,th,and in re th.
in gladys,supra,th,the minors became dependents of the juvenile court after being removed from their mother custody.the nonoffending father appeared at the detention hearing,was declared the presumed father,but then disappeared for three years and did not seek custody.id.at.he reappeared at the section hearing and requested visitation.father parental rights were terminated.ibid.the second district court of appeal began by reviewing supreme court precedent.it observed california dependency system comports with santosky requirements because,by the time parental rights are terminated at a section hearing,the juvenile court must have made prior findings that the parent was unfit.gladys,at,citing cynthia,supra,cal th at.the linchpin to the constitutionality of the section hearing is that prior determinations ensure the evidence of detriment is already so clear and convincing that more can not be required without prejudice to the interests of the adoptable child,with which the state must align itself.citation.gladys,at.
but,the gladys court went on to conclude that the requirements of santosky kramer and the safeguards embedded in the california dependency scheme had been ignored.gladys,supra,th at.the court reasoned the social services agency never alleged that the father was unfit and the trial court never made that finding.due process therefore prohibits the termination of his parental rights.implying a finding of detriment asks this court to act as petitioner and fact finder,thereby denying the father an opportunity for notice of specific charges and an opportunity to respond to the charges against him.citation.id.at pp.the gladys court also rejected the notion that the father had forfeited his due process argument by failing to raise it before the juvenile court.id.at.it stressed although the reversal of the juvenile court order undermines the important goal of rapidly concluding dependency proceedings,it is the only way to safeguard the father rights as presumed father and ensure that he is afforded due process.id.at.accordingly,the termination order was reversed.ibid.
in frank,supra,th,an order terminating a nonoffending father parental rights was reversed on similar grounds.id.at.in that case,the father had been involved in the children lives before the dependency and provided income for their support.thus,when father appeared in the juvenile dependency proceedings,he immediately stated his desire to reunify and was declared a presumed father.id.at pp.although the dependency petition had alleged the father failure to provide for the children,pursuant to section,subdivision g,the court found the allegations untrue and dismissed them.accordingly,at disposition,the children were removed from the mother custody only.id.at.during the dependency,the father visited the children only irregularly.in fact,he had not seen them at all for three months before the section hearing.the father claimed that transportation was difficult and repeatedly requested bus passes.although the child welfare agency obtained bus passes,the father never came to pick them up.he also did not request placement of the children.id.at pp.
on appeal,the second district court of appeal again held that the juvenile court had failed to comply with constitutional and statutory safeguards by failing to make a finding of detriment by clear and convincing evidence with respect to the father.frank,supra,th at.the court explained at the jurisdiction hearing,father was deemed a nonoffending parent.hence,the juvenile court never even made the initial finding of unfitness.more important,when the juvenile court was called upon to make the requisite finding of detriment by clear and convincing evidence in order to remove the children from a parent custody citations,it made no such finding as to father because he was noncustodial and did not request custody.rather,the court stated at the hearing that it was proceeding as to mother only and then found in the singular that,clear and convincing evidence suggests that s ubstantial danger exists to the physical health of minor s minor s is suffering severe emotional damage,and there is no reasonable means to protect without removal from parent or guardian physical custody.at no time during the dependency did the court ever make the requisite detriment finding by clear and convincing evidence as to father,subd.c.frank,at pp.
the frank court also considered whether it could infer a finding of detriment.it observed father argues that the only basis for an unfitness finding was his lack of housing and inability to afford transportation to visit his children,and that poverty alone,even abject poverty resulting in homelessness,is not a valid basis for assertion of juvenile court jurisdiction.in re,supra,th.the department counters that father unfitness lies in his failure to protect the twins from mother by allowing them to live with her when he knew she was abusing drugs father sporadic visits with the twins and lack of telephone contact during the dependency,and his failure to diligently attend to the children educational needs,all of which supports the juvenile court finding that father lacked motivation and commitment to the twins.however,although there may be valid bases for the juvenile court to make a finding of father unfitness,the court never made that finding,let alone by the required clear and convincing standard.we may not make that finding here or infer such a finding.frank,supra,th at.accordingly,the court concluded that due process required reversal of the order terminating the father parental rights.id.at pp.
the agency does not discuss any of these cases,with the exception of gladys,in its respondent brief.instead,it broadly argues a finding of parental unfitness or detriment is not required for termination of parental rights.instead,parental rights may be terminated,and a child freed for adoption,based on the best interests of the child,without a finding of parental unfitness,and without violating a parent substantive due process rights.the agency failure to limit the applicability of its suggested rule is rather start
