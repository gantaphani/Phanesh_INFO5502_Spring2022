factual and procedural summary 
this appeal arises from a custody dispute between father and uncle and aunt.the biological mother,mother,is not involved in the proceedings on appeal.uncle and aunt were primary caretakers essentially from birth.father paid child support and visited at the uncle and aunt residence,and became more involved in parenting as grew older.the family court became involved early in life when mother filed a motion to determine custody.in the early stages of the proceedings,father agreed that should stay in the stable home provided by uncle and aunt,and the trial court consistently ordered that primary residence be with uncle and aunt.when father began demonstrating a parenting style that caused uncle and aunt to have concerns for the child,they requested that he participate in mediation to resolve these disputes.father refused,and instead petitioned the court for custody.this is the custody petition at issue in the order currently before us for review.
at the time of the most recent proceedings,was five years old.the professionals involved in the case concurred that father was not prepared to assume full custody,and that it would be detrimental to move from uncle and aunt home.at the custody hearing,father conceded that a complete switch in custody was premature,but requested that he be given joint legal and physical custody with unsupervised custodial time,and that a review hearing be set to reevaluate the custodial arrangement.the trial court declined his request,finding that need for a permanent,stable situation was paramount and that it was necessary to end the tug of war between her caretakers about her upbringing.accordingly,the court issued a permanent custody order awarding sole legal and physical custody to uncle and aunt,and supervised visitation to father,with the supervision aspect subject to removal upon the concurrence of and father therapists.father challenges this ruling on appeal.
detailed factual and procedural background 
discussion 
constitutionality of section 
section provides that before granting custody of a child to a nonparent over the objection of a parent,the court must find that custody to a parent would be detrimental to the child and that custody to the nonparent is in the best interest of the child,subd.a.the finding of detriment must be supported by clear and convincing evidence,but it does not require a showing of parental unfitness,subds.b,c.section further provides that if a preponderance of the evidence shows a nonparent has assumed the parental role for a substantial period of time by providing a stable home where the child physical and emotional needs are met,a de facto parent,this establishes the required showing that nonparental custody is in the best interest of the child and that parental custody would be detrimental,subds.c,d.however,a parent may refute the evidence supporting custody with a de facto parent by showing by a preponderance of the evidence that there would be no detriment from parental custody and that nonparental custody is not required to serve the best interest of the child,subd.d.
thus,under section,subdivision d,a showing of de facto parent status creates a rebuttable presumption that it would be detrimental to place the child in the custody of a parent and the best interest of the child requires nonparental custody.as explained in guardianship of th,d,section,subdivision d reflects a legislative assessment that continuity and stability in a child life most certainly count for something and in the absence of proof to the contrary,removing a child from what has been a stable,continuous,and successful placement is detrimental to the child.
father argues that section is unconstitutional because it allows nonparental custody based on a preponderance of the evidence standard of proof rather than a clear and convincing evidence standard of proof,and without requiring a finding of parental unfitness.we reject both arguments.as we shall explain,section requires clear and convincing evidence of detriment to the child to award custody to a nonparent,which showing of detriment may be established by a rebuttable presumption in cases involving de facto parents.further,in cases involving nonparental custody,the detriment requirement is imposed in addition to the best interest of the child requirement.these standards and criteria represent an appropriate balancing of the competing interests involved in nonparental custody cases and do not run afoul of the constitution.
standard of proof 
parents have a constitutional right to due process of law before the state may interfere with their parental rights.see santosky kramer,d.d ue process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.mathews eldridge,d.
to determine whether a procedure satisfies due process,the courts balance three factors the interest affected by the proceeding the risk of an erroneous deprivation of the interest created by the state chosen procedure and the countervailing interest supporting use of the challenged procedure.santosky kramer,supra,at.mathews eldridge,supra,at.one component of procedural due process is the standard of proof used to support the deprivation.the standard of proof must satisfy the constitutional minimum of fundamental fairness.santosky kramer,supra,at,fn.
as explained in santosky t he minimum standard of proof tolerated by the due process requirement reflects not only the weight of the interests affected,but also a societal judgment about how the risk of error should be distributed between the litigants.santosky kramer,supra,at.when the preponderance of the evidence standard of proof is used,the risk of an erroneous deprivation of the interest is shared in roughly equal fashion between the parties.addington texas,d.the clear and convincing standard represents an intermediate standard that reduces the risk to one litigant by increasing the other litigant burden of proof.id.at.
two competing rights are at issue when a trial court must decide custody issues in a proceeding involving a parent and a de facto parent.parents have a fundamental right to custody of their children.santosky kramer,supra,at.consistent with this right,the courts apply a parental preference doctrine which provides that parents generally have the right to custody of their children over a third party.in re cal d,fn.however,this right is not absolute and must be balanced against a child fundamental right to have a placement that is stable and permanent.in re jasmon cal th,d,in re marilyn cal th,d,guardianship of zachary th,d in re bridget th,d guardianship of,supra,th at,d fish fish,w hen the child interest no longer coincides with that of the parent the magnitude of the parent right to family integrity is diminished see also in re vincent th,d.father challenge to the standard of proof procedures set forth in section in essence involves an assertion that the legislature has not struck a permissible balance when considering these two competing interests and his constitutional right to due process.the contention fails.
preliminarily,to the extent father is contending that section permits detriment to be established by a preponderance of the evidence standard,this claim is incorrect.section,subdivision b provides that detriment must be shown by clear and convincing evidence,subject to subdivision d.under subdivision d,de facto parent status may be established by a preponderance of the evidence,a
