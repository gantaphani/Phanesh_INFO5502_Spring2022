edward was declared a ward of the juvenile court under welfare and institutions code section after he admitted two counts of continuous sexual abuse of a child under penal code section.he appeals from an order committing him to the division of juvenile facilities djf after he violated probation and a supplemental petition was found true.appellant argues the commitment amounts to an ex post facto law because djf was not an authorized placement for his offenses at the time of their commission.see,art.i,cal,art.i.he further argues a djf commitment was an abuse of discretion in light of the less restrictive alternatives available.we reject both claims and,in light of the valid djf commitment,strike the probation conditions imposed by the juvenile court.
background 
in,when he was years old,appellant was discovered touching his year old half brother inappropriately.the half brother revealed appellant had been engaging in sexual activity with him and with his year old sister appellant half sister during the previous two years.the acts occurred several times a week,and included oral copulation and attempted anal and vaginal intercourse.
a petition was filed under section charging appellant with multiple sexual offenses.he was declared a ward of the juvenile court after admitting two counts of continuous sexual abuse of a child under penal code section,between january,and may,in exchange for a dismissal of the other charges.appellant was granted probation and placed in the residential juvenile sex offenders treatment program at martins achievement place map,where he remained for the next two and years.
appellant progress at map was uneven.he had a profound speech problem making it difficult for others to understand him,was believed to be dyslexic,and potentially fell on the autism spectrum.in a probation report filed in september,his behavior was noted to be improving,but a few months later he admitted a probation violation after having consensual sex with his roommate and another resident.he was seen by staff as struggling in treatment minimizing his offenses,falling into a victim role when confronted,and avoiding the emotions necessary to develop empathy.
in a report dated may,the probation officer stated appellant was fully engaged in treatment and has made a significant amount of progress since being moved to a different house at map.on february,however,appellant admitted he had violated probation because he was not progressing in his program and had failed to complete several of his sex offender treatment assignments.he remained in his placement at map and his attitude improved after he began taking prescription antidepressant medication.but problems continued as he persisted in sexualized and aggressive behavior,showing little insight into his issues.
on april,the probation officer filed a notice alleging appellant had violated probation by failing to follow the rules and regulations at map.the accompanying report noted that appellant was having difficulties completing his assignments and described an incident in which he had been discovered in his room with his pants pulled down below his buttocks in the presence of two roommates.the probation officer recommended a change in placement,as appellant had been at map for two and years and made little to no progress.the probation violation was dismissed contingent on appellant placement in a different treatment program.
appellant was placed in the breaking the cycle btc program in may,but had difficulty following the rules and received several incident reports based on his inappropriate behavior with respect to boundaries,his grooming of other residents and staff with sexualized behavior,and his writing in a journal that was sexual in content and included graphics illustrating a penis.a quarterly report on his progress indicated appellant showed little ability or willingness to curtail his inappropriate conduct and did not appear to understand the severity of his situation,focusing more on perceived violations of his own rights.
appellant turned in november.on november,the probation officer filed a notice alleging appellant had violated probation by failing to obey the staff at his placement and by failing to fully participate in his sex offender treatment program.on that same date,the district attorney filed a supplemental petition under sections and seeking continuing jurisdiction over appellant and a modification of his placement,as he would not be permitted to remain in the btc program past his birthday.see,subd.a juvenile court may retain jurisdiction over ward until age.
the court held a combined hearing on the probation violation and supplemental petition on december.rebecca baker,the director of btc,testified there were three phases to their program,which were expected to take six months to complete,but appellant had not finished phase during his time there.he had failed to complete assignments or engage meaningfully in individual therapy,had repeatedly violated the rules,and had shown a poor level of participation in group therapy.the court found by clear and convincing evidence that appellant had violated probation and sustained the supplemental petition.
the court ordered appellant screened for different prospective placements.because appellant was years old with a high school diploma,he was ineligible for placement in any local residential program,the only options being the inpatient sex offender treatment available at djf or an outpatient program.at the contested dispositional hearing,the district attorney urged the court to commit appellant to djf.defense counsel argued a commitment to djf would constitute an ex post facto law,because that disposition was not available when appellant committed his offenses.the probation officer recommended that appellant be released to live with his aunt and treated as an outpatient.
krys hunter,djf acting senior supervising clinical psychologist,testified about the djf sex offender treatment program available at two facilities,each having four units comprised of a maximum of youths,staffed by two clinicians,a senior counselor,several youth counselors,two casework specialists or parole agents,and a treatment team specialist.the curriculum,which was recently revised to take into account research on juvenile sex offenders in particular,consists of seven stages and is designed to be completed in to months,including an eight to orientation period focusing on healthy living.the youths in the program are assessed and segregated based on their risk of reoffense,and if they finish early are able to become mentors or take vocational training.the treatment includes components of group and individual therapy,resource groups designed to address other issues such as substance abuse or anger management,journals,assignments,the discussion of various books,and family therapy.according to hunter,the program was integrated into every aspect of the youth life at djf and was designed to prevent future criminality in general,not merely the sex offenses that led to the commitment.family members were encouraged to participate in family therapy to keep them in touch with the youth and to help prepare the youth for eventual release.
arthur paull,the director of a step forward,a juvenile sex offender outpatient treatment program,had screened appellant for the program and found him to be at moderate risk of reoffending.at the dispositional hearing,he testified appellant would receive one or two hours a week of individual therapy if admitted to a step forward,along with monthly family therapy and quarterly case conferences as needed.if appellant were to participate in that program while residing with his aunt,as the probation department had recommended,the staff at a step forward would have to rely on honest,complete reporting from her to know whether appellant was at risk of reoffending.paull did not think a djf commitment would be productive because appellant had not done well in other residential programs and,accordingly,he recommended an outpatient plan with a suspended djf commitment rather than a straight commitment to djf.he believed appellant would benefit from a structured outpatient program with good supervision,but had appellant not turned,he would have recommended a return to the map residential program.paull believed appellant should get the maximum amount of residential treatment available before participating in a step forward.
the court committed appellant to djf,finding it was probable he would benefit from the reformatory educational discipline or other treatment provided there,and that local resources were inappropriate.
discussion 
i.the djf commitment did not violate ex post facto principles 
appellant argues his commitment to djf amounts to an unconstitutional ex post facto law because such a commitment was not authorized when he committed his crimes in through.see,art.i,cal,art.i.to place appellant argument in the proper context,some statutory background is in order.
djf commitments and juvenile realignment legislation 
previous law placed an absolute bar on a djf commitment only when the ward was under years of age or suffered from a contagious disease that would place others at risk.see former stats,ch,eff.in,the state entered into a consent decree to settle a lawsuit brought on behalf of inmates of state juvenile facilities.in re greg cal th,d,greg.recognizing the state could not afford to comply with the terms of the decree,the legislature enacted realignment legislation in that narrowed the class of juveniles eligible for a djf commitment and shifted responsibility to the counties for all but the most serious youth offenders.ibid.
as part of this realignment legislation,section was amended to add subdivision a,allowing a commitment to djf if the ward has committed an offense described in subdivision b of section and is not otherwise ineligible for a commitment to the division under section.stats,ch,eff,see also stats,ch,eff.section was amended to provide that a ward could not be committed to djf if,in addition to being under the age of or having a contagious disease,c the ward has been or is adjudged a ward of the court pursuant to section,and the most recent offense alleged in any petition and admitted or found true by the court is not described in subdivision b of section,unless the offense is a sex offense set forth in subdivision c of section of the penal code.added by stats,ch,eff,amended by stats,ch,eff.
documents contained in the legislative history of the realignment suggest the legislature did not intend to exclude juvenile sex offenders from djf commitments.floor analyses in both houses stated,juvenile sex offenders are excluded from this change and will not be impacted by this bill.com.on pub.safety,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended,discussing bill reg.sess.as amended july.assembly bill reg.sess.was enacted in september to modify portions of senate bill to include,among other things,conforming changes to ensure that none of the juvenile justice reforms contained in senate bill no.affect juveniles adjudicated of a sex offense as set forth in penal code section.rules,off.of floor analyses,reading analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended,italics omitted.section,which was also enacted as part of the realignment,allowed a recall of wards previously committed to djf in the case of any ward whose commitment offense was not an offense listed in subdivision b of section,unless the offense was a sex offense set forth in subdivision c of section of the penal code.stats,ch,eff,see also stats,ch,eff,operative.the limitation on juvenile offenders eligible for a djf commitment was motivated by a desire to reduce the cost and increase the effectiveness of juvenile confinement.citation i t is clear that the legislature intended to preserve the possibility of djf commitments for violent offenders and sex offenders.greg,supra,cal th at,d.
notwithstanding this apparent intent to continue allowing djf commitments for youthful sex offenders,section,subdivision a,as enacted in,purported to authorize such a commitment only when the minor had committed an offense listed in section,subdivision b.section,subdivision b lists serious and violent crimes,including many forcible sex offenses,but it does not include a number of nonforcible sex offenses that are listed in penal code section,subdivision c,as referenced in section,subdivision c.lewd conduct under penal code section,subdivision a and continuous sexual abuse under penal code section are among the sex offenses that are listed in penal code section,subdivision c,but do not appear in section,subdivision b.
in in re cal th,d,the state supreme court considered the case of a minor who had been committed to djf based solely on a violation of penal code section,subdivision a.it held,a juvenile court lacks authority to commit a ward to the djf under section,subdivision a if that ward has never been adjudged to have committed an offense described in section,subdivision b,even if his or her most recent offense alleged in a petition and admitted or found true by the juvenile court is a sex offense set forth in penal code section,subdivision c as referenced in section,subdivision c.id.at,d.the court explained,read together,sections,subdivision a and,subdivision c limit the class of wards who may be committed to the djf to those wards who have committed an offense described in section,subdivision b and whose most recent offense alleged in any petition and admitted or found to be true by the court is listed either in section,subdivision b or penal code section,subdivision c.id.at,d.
the court in declined to consider documents in the history of the realignment legislation that suggested the legislature intended to permit juvenile sex offenders to be committed to djf.o nly when a statute language is ambiguous or susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation may we turn to extrinsic aids to assist in interpretation,supra,cal th at,d.because sections,subdivision a and,subdivision c had a plain meaning that did not yield absurd results,it would be inappropriate to resort to the legislative history to consider whether an otherwise undisclosed legislative intent might be reflected.ibid.
amendments assembly bill 
in response to,the legislature enacted assembly bill reg.sess.as urgency legislation effective february.stats,ch.the bill amended section,subdivision a to authorize a djf commitment when the ward has committed an offense described in subdivision b of section or subdivision c of section of the penal code,and is not otherwise ineligible for commitment to the division under section.stats,ch,italics added.section,subdivision c was amended to preclude a djf commitment when the most recent offense alleged in any petition and admitted or found to be true by the court is not described in subdivision b of section or subdivision c of section of the penal code.stats,ch.
in addition to clarifying that a djf commitment is authorized for a ward who committed a sex offense listed in penal code section,subdivision c,even if the offense was not also listed in section,subdivision b,assembly bill reg.sess.added section to address the situation of wards who would otherwise be entitled to release from djf under the authority of a the chief of djf may enter into contracts with any county of this state for the djf to furnish housing to a ward who was in the custody of the djf on december,and whose commitment was recalled based on both of the following the ward was committed to djf for the commission of an offense described in subdivision c of section of the penal code.the ward has not been adjudged a ward of the court pursuant to section for commission of an offense described in subdivision b of section.b it is the intent of the legislature in enacting this act to address the california supreme court ruling in.stats,ch,eff.
ex post facto analysis 
it is against the foregoing backdrop that we consider appellant ex post facto claim.
the state and federal ex post facto clauses have the same meaning and apply to juvenile wardship proceedings.john superior court cal th,d,john in re melvin th,d,overruled on other grounds in john,at,fn,d.to fall within the ex post facto provisions,two critical elements must be met.john,at,d.first,the law must be retroactive.ib
