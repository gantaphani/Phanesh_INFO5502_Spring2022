marcus the minor has sickle cell anemia and was years old when he was ordered by the juvenile court to undergo periodic blood transfusions to prevent him from suffering a third stroke and possibly death.the minor,one of jehovah witnesses,opposed the transfusions as contrary to his religious beliefs.
on appeal,the minor argues the order must be reversed because the application did not set forth the legal basis for its request for a court order compelling the minor to undergo blood transfusions.in any event,the minor contends the juvenile court erred in not recogniz ing that mature adolescents may possess the competency and the capacity to make their own medical decisions in exercise of their right of bodily known in some jurisdictions as the mature minor doctrine and in depriving the minor of the opportunity to a medical witness and to call and examine his own medical witness and his minister.
we conclude the juvenile court lacked jurisdiction to issue the order because the requirements of welfare and institutions code section were not met.further section references are to this code unless otherwise specified.thus,we need not address the minor other claims of error.
as we will explain,section provides the juvenile court with jurisdiction to order the performance of necessary medical care for a minor only when the minor has been taken into temporary custody pursuant to section,or is a dependent of the court pursuant to section,or is named in a petition filed to declare the minor a dependent of the court,a licensed health care professional recommends that the minor needs medical,surgical,dental,or other remedial care,and the minor parent,guardian,or person standing in loco parentis is unwilling or incapable of authorizing such care.
here,the minor had not been taken into temporary custody pursuant to section,the san joaquin county human services agency the agency had not filed a section petition to declare the minor a dependent child of the court,and the minor had not already been adjudicated a dependent child of the court.thus,the juvenile court did not have jurisdiction to order the minor to undergo blood transfusions against his will and over the objection of his parents.
background 
on october,the agency filed an ex parte application with the juvenile court,seeking permission for the minor treating physician to administer blood transfusions to the minor without parental consent as medically necessary until october,at which time the treating physician must provide an update concerning the minor need for further transfusions,and in the meantime,should any bloodless treatment alternatives become available that would meet the minor needs,the minor father and the jehovah witness hospital liaison committee would be promptly notified and the alternatives utilized with the father consent.
attached to the application was a letter from the minor treating physician,keith quirolo,asking for a court order to continue blood transfusions treatment.quirolo letter stated the following the minor has sickle cell anemia and has suffered two strokes and has developed moya moya disease due to the cerebral ischemia that was caused by the strokes.c hronic blood transfusion is the only definitive therapy for stroke in sickle cell disease however,because the minor and his parents expressed opposition to blood transfusions based on their religious beliefs,quirolo attempted alternative medical therapies,such as hydroxyurea and decidabine.neither drug increased the minor level of hemoglobin f enough to prevent strokes.indeed,the minor suffered a stroke while taking hydroxyurea and had to be returned to blood transfusion treatment.following three months of decidabine treatment,without sufficient increase in hemoglobin f levels,quirolo concluded that returning to blood transfusion treatment was the only definitive means of preventing another stroke and possibly death.quirolo stressed i am not willing to wait for him to have another event while i,and the family,are waiting for this medication to increase his hemoglobin 
the minor and his parents filed opposition to the application,requested an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the minor is a mature minor possessing the competency and the responsibility to make his own medical decisions,and asked the juvenile court to dismiss the application on the basis that the minor is a mature minor with the capacity of giving informed consent.
counsel for the agency responded that,while some states have recognized a mature minor doctrine,allowing sufficiently mature minors to make their own medical decisions,such a doctrine has not been recognized in california.indeed,argued county counsel,the fact the legislature has enacted specific statutes allowing certain minors to make their own medical,emancipated minors see,subd.e and minors seeking medical care related to sexually transmitted diseases,treatment of drug or alcohol abuse,and mental health care see,indicates the failure to enact a broad mature minor statute is not an oversight,but rather an intentional limit on the rights of minors to make their own health care decisions.accordingly,county counsel asserted,until such time as the minor reaches the age of full and legal discretion,the court should exercise its interest as parens patriae,to e nsure that he gets appropriate treatment.
at the hearing on the application,the minor attorney conceded california does not have a mature minor doctrine,but disagreed with county counsel assessment that the specific statutes allowing certain minors to make their own medical decisions in certain situations indicated the legislature intended to preclude the courts from straying outside the confines of these provisions in recognition of a broader mature minor doctrine.in the alternative,the minor attorney argued that the juvenile court should hear from the minor,as a due process measure,to allow him to express his feelings concerning the blood transfusions.
without ruling on whether the mature minor doctrine is viable in california,the juvenile court decided to hold a short hearing to hear from the minor and his parents both the minor and his father testified that the minor began blood transfusion treatment following his first stroke at the age of four.as the father elaborated,monthly blood transfusions were ordered by the court because the minor father and mother,as jehovah witnesses,would not consent to the treatment.according to the father,the minor initially opposed the blood transfusions simply to go along with his parents wishes.however,by the age of seven,when the minor became more active in the congregation and h is comprehension of bible education started to get a little bit better,he was more able to make an independent decision concerning blood transfusions.
the minor testified that he was a junior in high school with grades.he explained it was his choice to become one of jehovah witnesses,and he opposed the blood transfusions because it states in the bible how our god,jehovah,how he does want us to take blood.he expressed an understanding of sickle cell anemia and the potentially dire consequences of refusing blood transfusion treatment,the risk of another stroke and death.nevertheless,he felt it was important to come to court to oppose the blood transfusions in order to demonstrate to jehovah that he was not disobeying his god.
the juvenile court granted the application and signed the order permitting quirolo to resume blood transfusion treatment as medically necessary until october,as the court explained,it was concerned that the minor decision to refuse blood transfusion treatment was not entirely independent based on the fact he has been making a decision that he does want blood since he was about seven years old.
the minor attorney filed a request for rehearing,arguing for the first time that the ex parte application failed to set forth the legal basis for its request for a court order compelling the minor to undergo blood transfusions that are abhorrent to his religious sensibilities the minor was denied the right to confront and keith quirolo and the minor was denied the opportunity to present medical evidence as to
