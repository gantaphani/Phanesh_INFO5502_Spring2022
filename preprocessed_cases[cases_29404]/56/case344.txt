factual and procedural background 
the dependency 
the juvenile court declared nadia a dependent in when she was years old because her mother was unwilling and unable to provide parental care and supervision and her father had long ago left the family,subds.b g.nadia qualifies for special education,but has a history of truancy beginning when she was years old.hence,she has no high school credits.she started drinking alcohol at age.she was defiant and belligerent.nadia had an infant and was pregnant with her second child when she was removed from her mother care.she gave custody of her first born to her mother.
the juvenile court ordered the department,among other things,to enroll nadia in counseling to refer her to cognitive behavior therapy,a parenting program,and a substance abuse program,and to report on the status of her schooling.
nadia dependency has been marked by instability and inconsistency interspersed with short periods of cooperation.
throughout this dependency,nadia would comply with the juvenile court requirements,the department programs,and house rules for a time and then run away from her foster placement and return to her old behaviors.in her first placement,nadia was rebellious and disrespectful and she refused to attend school.her first foster parent wanted nadia removed because of her misbehavior.instead,nadia ran away in september,just months after the juvenile court assumed jurisdiction.
although placement proved difficult because nadia was pregnant,the department next found her a bed at a home for girls.nadia had difficulty adjusting to the group home rules,and within the first month she had run away twice and was involved in a physical altercation with another resident.eventually,nadia settled into the group home and began attending school and participating in many of her programs.nadia second child was born in november.
only two months later,however,nadia returned from an overnight visit with her mother a day late and intoxicated and had to be prompted several times to wake up to tend to her infant.when she failed to pick up her infant from a visit with the child father,the department detained the baby.after the baby detention,nadia began skipping school and staying in bed until late morning.she would go out in the evenings and on weekends,returning only to sleep or spend the day.she was arrested five months after the baby was born for assaulting and threatening staff at the group home.upon her release from jail in early april,she told her social worker she did not want the department to find her another placement.instead,she opted to stay with an unnamed friend and so the department did not know her whereabouts for over a month.
nadia finally contacted the department from the los angeles police department th precinct in may to announce she had been arrested for battery.by then,she was years old and did not wish to return to her mother home,preferring to reunify with her baby.nadia mother did not want to continue with reunification.
the department recommends terminating dependency jurisdiction.
in may,the department notified the juvenile court that nadia had once again gone missing.the department requested a progress review hearing be scheduled in august to assess nadia compliance with the child welfare services,and the department recommended,if she was not complying,that the juvenile court terminate jurisdiction.
in august,the department reported that nadia was living with a non extended family member,although the placement was at risk because the foster mother son had a criminal record.apart from housing,nadia was trying to make positive changes.she appeared to be very motivated,and as before,appear ed to be serious about her life.she started attending school where she was very motivated to get her general education diploma ged.in the social worker view,nadia was doing her best to follow her program and to keep up with her appointments and responsibilities so that she could reunify with her baby.
nadia motivation was apparently short lived as a month later,in september,she ran away and her whereabouts were unknown for four months.the record contains no further indication of nadia participation in her child welfare services.
during this interval,in november,the social worker reached nadia by telephone.she was staying with a friend but refused to reveal her whereabouts.she admitted she was drinking and declared she had lost all motivation when she lost custody of her baby.she had worked for a few days and was looking for somewhere to live.the social worker warned nadia that her case could not remain open if she was not compliant with school and other services.nadia understood.
nadia whereabouts were still unknown when the department filed its next status review report recommending termination of juvenile court jurisdiction.
the juvenile court announces its intention to terminate jurisdiction and orders the department to prepare nadia for emancipation.
nadia did not appear at the scheduled hearing in december.her attorney relayed nadia wish that jurisdiction continue.nadia wanted services and wanted to be placed in suitable housing.finding emancipation to be the appropriate goal for nadia,the juvenile court ordered the department to file the most current transitional independent living case plan tilp if it continued to recommend terminating jurisdiction.the court announced its intention to terminate jurisdiction if nadia showed little cooperation in her services and did not keep the department informed of her whereabouts and ordered the department to conform with the requirements in wic section.italics added.
at the end of december nadia asked her social worker to come get her.then,she changed her mind and asked to be given housing after the new year.the department made several attempts to find suitable housing for nadia and finally placed her in a group home in january.nadia participated in creating her tilp in early january.
that same month,the juvenile court ordered the department to assess nadia asap for section eligibility and programs 
in february,before her transition meeting was held,nadia was removed from her group home,as it was only a day shelter.preferring to stay with a friend instead of a shelter,nadia vanished for two months.she finally contacted her social worker in april to report that she and her boyfriend were renting a room but she again refused to provide an address and had no working cell phone.she stated she would agree to close her case.nadia did not appear at her transition conference at the end of april and did not contact her social worker.
nadia finally appeared for a transition conference in may.by this time,she was three months pregnant.she and her boyfriend were living at his parents house where they planned to remain until they could afford a place of their own.informed of the services and requirements under section,nadia stated she would like to continue with services until she turned.recognizing what she would have to do to maintain dependency jurisdiction,nadia stated she was stable and was committed to in school and to remaining in her current home.she agreed to undergo mental health treatment and to keep in regular contact with her social worker.under the heading recommendation in the status review report,the department requested the court order nadia to remain a dependent of the court.
in june,the juvenile court asked the department why it wanted to keep the case open as nadia had not been in school in months,was not working,and was not living in approved housing.the department replied it was simply trying to set nadia on the right path in advance of closing her case.nadia was trying to address her problems but claimed her individualized education plan made it difficult to enroll in school.
at the june,contested hearing,the court summarized nadia case she was years old she held her own educational rights the department had not approved her residence as a supervised independent living placement and nadia had only enrolled in school the week before the hearing.the court observed that the department was working harder than nadia to provide services and maintain jurisdiction over her.counsel for the department replied that for the past two months nadia had been communicating with her social worker and so the department recommended keeping the case open.
the juvenile court terminated its jurisdiction.it explained that nadia had not participated in the services that the department provided.indeed,she refused services.although nadia represented she was willing to participate in some services,the court noted nadia difficulty following through with her promises.nadia appealed and the department did not file a brief.
discussion 
the legislature enacted section in in response to concerns that dependent children who had reached the age of were being removed from the dependency system before they had adequate skills or resources to support themselves,and evidence that percent of these young persons became homeless within a year after leaving the foster care system.rules,off.of floor analyses,reading analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended.the youth law center,which sponsored the legislation,posited that h omelessness is not merely a housing issue,but is related to poor education,lack of a support system,estrangement from family,lack of marketable skills,poor employment prospects and lack of community linkages.emancipation of foster youth before they are ready to live independently creates significant to the youth and to the state.ibid.in re holly th.in,the legislature rewrote section to conform to federal law so as to maximize federal financial participation and extend transitional foster care services for youth between the ages of and.off.of floor analyses,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended.
for nonminor dependents who have permanent plans of foster care,the court may continue jurisdiction of the nonminor as a nonminor dependent of the juvenile court or may dismiss dependency jurisdiction pursuant to section,subd.a,italics added,in re tamika th,see also off.of floor analyses,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess,supra,at juvenile court is authorized to terminate jurisdiction over nonminors between ages and.
section expresses the legislative preference for retaining jurisdiction and so the statute authorizes the termination of jurisdiction in only three specific circumstances the court finds t hat the nonminor does not wish to remain subject to dependency jurisdiction t hat the nonminor is not participating in a reasonable and appropriate transitional independent living case plan or t he court finds after reasonable and documented efforts that the nonminor can not be located,subds.c a,c b d cal.rules of court,rule d a i iii,italics added.
even if the juvenile court terminates its dependency jurisdiction however,it retain s general jurisdiction over the youth pursuant to section.if the court has dismissed dependency jurisdiction,the nonminor,who has not attained years of age,may subsequently file a petition pursuant to subdivision e of section to have dependency jurisdiction resumed and the court may vacate its previous order dismissing dependency jurisdiction over the nonminor dependent,subd.c.
jurisdiction is maintained if there is existing and reasonably foreseeable future harm to the welfare of the child.citation.in re holly,supra,th at.the principal question to be addressed when deciding whether to terminate jurisdiction over a child in foster care is the best interest of the child.in re tamika,supra,th at.t he decision to retain or terminate jurisdiction remains within the sound discretion of the juvenile court.in re holly,supra,at.
the evidence supports the juvenile court finding that nadia was not participating in a reasonable and appropriate tilp,subd.c b but termination of jurisdiction was premature because the mandates of section were not followed.
nadia was not participating in her tilp.
nadia contends there is insufficient evidence to support the juvenile court finding she was not participating in her tilp,the second of the three bases for terminating jurisdiction.she reasons that the court found that she was not complying with services,whereas subdivision c b of section requires the court to find that she was not participating in a reasonable and appropriate tilp 
section,subdivision c b authorizes the juvenile court to terminate dependency jurisdiction if it finds t hat the nonminor is not participating in a reasonable and appropriate tilp.the tilp describes the collaborative efforts between the nonminor and the social worker and the supportive services provided to ensure meaningful transition to independent living,subd.y.the tilp is the roadmap for the nonminor transition to.
the record here demonstrates that nadia was not participating in her tilp.entered into on january,nadia tilp required her,among other things,to keep pushing to attend school on a daily basis with the goal of finishing high school try to be trustworthy and choose the right friends follow the programs necessary to obtain her green card and look for a job.the juvenile court stated it did not believe nadia claim that she had been trying to register in school or to participate in a program geared to obtaining her ged.the court observed that nadia had suddenly enrolled in school just a week before the termination hearing and the court openly disbelieved nadia explanation for the delay.the court was entitled to question nadia veracity in light of her pattern of truancy,lying to her social workers,and running away.for the same reason,the court was understandably skeptical of nadia pledge,on the eve of the termination hearing,to comply with her tilp so as to remain a dependent.the court credibility determinations are not subject to reweighing on appeal.in re casey th.as for the remainder of nadia tilp,the department was not in a position to determine whether nadia was choosing the right friends as she made it a practice of hiding her whereabouts from the social workers,which thwarted their efforts to assess her choices.the department,not nadia,was attempting to obtain a green card for her,and although she claimed to be working,the information about that is almost nonexistent.indeed,even nadia agreed her case should be closed just two months before jurisdiction was terminated.the maintenance of jurisdiction for nadia can not realistically be expected to prevent any future harm to her where she has repeatedly rejected nearly all efforts of assistance from the department and where the department is working harder than she to maintain dependency jurisdiction.
in this respect,this case is not unlike the facts of in re holly,supra,th.there,the appellate court noted a lthough one may reasonably conclude that these facts demonstrate a continued need for assistance,holly has repeatedly refused to take advantage of services that have been offered to her.she failed to appear for an evaluation that might have allowed her to receive income from ssi she failed to report for a job that the department helped to secure for her and as just noted she left her group home when she began receiving a very small,income as the result of her father death.holly continued participation in the juvenile dependency system can not reasonably be expect
