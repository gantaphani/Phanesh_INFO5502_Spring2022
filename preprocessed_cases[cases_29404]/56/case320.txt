introduction 
by petition for an extraordinary writ,esteban father asks us to vacate the trial court order for an evaluation of him under the interstate compact on the placement of children icpc and setting a selection and implementation hearing pursuant to welfare and institutions code section as to his daughter,suhey suhey.father contends that the court abused its discretion in ordering an icpc evaluation because the icpc does not apply to placements with a parent.father further contends that the court erred in setting a section hearing without requiring the department of children and family services department to show that placement of suhey with father would be detrimental to her under section 
we issued a stay of the section hearing and an order to show cause and the department responded.we have reviewed the petition on the merits and conclude that the court erred to the extent it set a section hearing and denied father a fair opportunity to present his case for relief under section the petition,however,will be denied as to father objection to the trial court order for an icpc evaluation on the ground that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering such an evaluation.
factual and procedural background 
on march,the department filed a petition alleging,among other things,that suhey had been physically abused by mother,brenda mother,mother abused methamphetamine,and suhey and her infant brother had been exposed to violent conduct between mother and mother male companion.although the department possessed county records indicating that father last known address was in the state of idaho,the department served father with notice of the detention hearing at his last known street address in idaho,california.at the detention hearing,the department reported that father whereabouts were unknown.the court found that father was suhey presumed father and ordered the department to present evidence of due diligence in its attempts to locate father.the children were ordered detained and were placed in the home of maternal aunt.the department was ordered to provide mother with family reunification services.
the department attempted to serve father with notice of the hearing at the idaho,california address once again.the record shows that the notice was returned to the department as not deliverable as addressed.at the hearing on april,the court sustained the petition allegations under section,subdivisions a and b the department filed a declaration documenting its efforts to locate father and stating that his whereabouts remained unknown at the hearing,mother was ordered to participate in counseling and random drug testing,and was allowed monitored visits with suhey.the court further ordered that mother be provided with reunification services but denied reunification services to father pursuant to section,subdivision b on the grounds that his whereabouts were unknown 
in a report prepared for the review hearing,the department stated that mother was not fully compliant with her drug treatment program,had failed to appear for the majority of her drug tests,and had often missed scheduled visits with the children.the department recommended terminating mother reunification services.on october,the court set the matter for a contested review hearing on january.the only attempt to again serve father was the mailing of a notice to the same address in idaho,california.
on december,father contacted the department and stated that he wanted custody of suhey.maternal relatives had informed him about the proceedings father said that he had lived with mother for the first year of suhey life.after he and mother separated,he tried to get visitation with suhey but mother would not cooperate.he said that mother had kept suhey away from him for the past two to three years.maternal aunt also said that mother had threatened to report father to immigration services for being in the without documentation if he tried to obtain custody of suhey.suhey said that she remembered father and that she would like to visit with him.father started talking with suhey by phone several times a week 
on december,the department received a child abuse referral from a mandated reporter who expressed concern about a bluish purple bruise three inches in diameter around suhey left ear.the reporter also stated that suhey said she was afraid to go home.the department investigated the referral.when asked about the bruising,suhey said she could have fallen on the play ground at school,then immediately corrected herself and said that she was running at school,and s he ran into an object and hit the side of her face against a pole at school.suhey said she was not hit or spanked by maternal aunt.
maternal aunt said that suhey must have been injured at school,and denied hitting or spanking suhey or her own children.when one of suhey cousins was asked about the bruising on suhey face,she said i do know who did it.the other two cousins said that they did not know how suhey received the bruise.the department noted that several school personnel expressed concerns about suhey,but concluded that the allegation of physical abuse of suhey by an unidentified perpetrator was determined to be inconclusive.
on january,the department filed an interim review report with the trial court stating that suhey seemed happy and comfortable in the home of the current caregivers.the report did not inform the court about the child abuse referral.father appeared at the review hearing on january,and counsel was appointed to represent him.the court continued the hearing to february,to allow father counsel time to get familiar with the case.on that date,father appointed counsel was ill and another attorney stood in for her.father temporary replacement counsel said that he had not reviewed the file or spoken with father yet and asked for a continuance to allow father appointed counsel an opportunity to appear in court on this matter.the court denied the request and the hearing went forward.
the department reported that father had visited suhey in california,and had maintained daily contact with her since he had returned to idaho.suhey seemed happy and comfortable when speaking about father and said she might like to live with him.the trial court terminated mother reunification services,ordered that father be given services to assist him with visiting suhey,and ordered an icpc evaluation.the court noted that maternal relatives seemed very favorable of the father and that suhey had a very good had very good visits with him when he was visiting her.on the same day,february,the court set a section hearing for june,stating that it believed it was required to set the hearing,and that in any event,that would also give us the update on the father writ petition followed 
the department records reflect that,on february,a second child abuse referral had been generated a mandated reporter said suhey had green and purple bruising on her face,that it looked like the child had been hit,and that suhey came to the reporter and said i do want to go home.the department investigated the referral.maternal aunt was exasperated and verbally aggressive when the investigator came to her home and said suhey was very clumsy,and often falls and injures herself.
the department investigation also determined that suhey,her three cousins,and maternal aunt had all given different accounts of how suhey received the bruise but each one denied that anyone had hit suhey.two of suhey cousins said that maternal aunt spanked them.however,maternal aunt said she disciplined the children with time outs or taking away their privileges.the department concluded that the abuse allegations were unfounded.
on february,the department filed an interim review report with the trial court stating that f ather stated that he and his home were ready to meet all of suhey needs,he has looked into the school that suhey will be attending and he was committed to fully care for suhey.the department further stated that it had made a referral to icpc for father in idaho and identified the plan for suhey as reunification and placement with father.the report did not inform the trial court about the two child abuse referrals reflected in its records.
on march,the department filed a last minute information for the court with the trial court stating that the icpc coordinator had not received the referral for father,but that the forms were later submitted on march,almost six weeks after the court had ordered the icpc investigation.at a progress hearing on march,the court gave the department the discretion to liberalize father visits and release suhey to him.the department,however,did not do so.
on april,a third child abuse referral was generated.a mandated reporter said that suhey had a swollen purple and blue bruise about three inches on her face from her cheek bone to her eye and the bruise appears like some one punched her face.the reporter also stated that the bruise is similar to the ones that suhey had before,and that the reporter was concerned for the safety of suhey in this home because on three different occasions recently,suhey has been seen with bruises like the one that she has today.
the department also investigated this referral.suhey said she hit her face on the wheel of the bed and denied that maternal aunt hit her.one of suhey cousins said that maternal aunt and uncle spanked her sisters,and that they also hit suhey.a second cousin,however,said that maternal aunt and uncle did not hit or spank her,her sisters or suhey.a third cousin said maternal aunt and uncle did not spank anyone.maternal aunt denied hitting or spanking the children,and said that suhey had told her she had hit her face on the bed.the department determined that the abuse allegations were inconclusive.this third report of injury to suhey was likewise not reported to the trial court.
on may,suhey was asked if she wanted to live with father and she said that she did want to go and live with her father,that she talks to him on a regular basis,and that he is nice to her.despite suhey clearly expressed wishes and all of the information in its files,on june,the department filed a section report identifying the goal for suhey as adoption and recommended terminating father parental rights with no explanation as to why the goal had changed from placement with father 
in the section report,the department also briefly informed the trial court,for the first time,that there had been three child abuse referrals over the past six months concerning suhey.the report set forth the dates of the referrals and stated that the referrals alleged that suhey was the victim of general neglect by maternal aunt and physical abuse by an unknown perpetrator,and the department conclusion that the february referral was unfounded and the likely disposition for the april referral was inconclusive.the department,however,did not further inform the court as to the substance of the abuse allegations or its investigation of the referrals,but continued to recommend adoption by maternal aunt and uncle and,inexplicably,advised the court that the family had developed an even closer loving relationship with one another.
at the june,hearing,the court again gave the department discretion to liberalize father visits with suhey and to release suhey to father.again,however,the department did not do so.the court order did not address the alleged abuse of suhey.less than two weeks later,a fourth child abuse referral alleging physical abuse was made.a mandated reporter stated that suhey had a black eye with swelling and bruising under the eye,the reporter was concerned because this was the fourth child abuse report for suhey in the last six months,and the child had a troublesome pattern of absences from school whenever she was injured.the record does not reflect the nature of investigation the department undertook in response to this referral,but indicates only that the investigation was never completed.
in late june or early july,maternal aunt brought suhey in to the department and said she wanted to give her up and that she did want her anymore.on july,the social worker conducted a visit and observed bruising on suhey cheek.when the social worker asked suhey how she received the bruise,suhey could not say but shrugged her shoulders.maternal aunt said that suhey fell.
in spite of all of these circumstances,on august,the department filed a status review report stating that suhey was thriving in maternal aunt home,had a strong emotional attachment to her,that maternal aunt was providing suhey with a loving and stable environment.the department did not inform the court,in this report,that maternal aunt had attempted to give up suhey to the department or that a social worker had observed bruising on suhey face the week prior.the department,however,did advise the trial court that a child abuse referral alleging physical abuse had been made on june,and that it was under investigation.
on august,the department also submitted the results of the icpc investigation to the trial court which made only positive findings about father and his home father and his wife were eager to have suhey live with them had space in their home for suhey,a supportive family network,and several positive references and were willing to participate in parenting classes and family counseling despite the positive icpc report and maternal aunt attempt to give up suhey and all of the information it had in its files pointing to possible physical abuse,the department report nonetheless recommended that maternal aunt be allowed to adopt the child.
on september,one month after the initial oral argument before this court,the department received a fifth child abuse referral alleging that suhey had suspicious bruises.a social worker investigated the allegations and found that maternal aunt had been physically abusing suhey.suhey was removed from maternal aunt home,and the department agreed to release her to father.
in a detention report filed on september,the department,for the first time,informed the trial court of the substance of the child abuse referrals going back to december.the department also filed a section petition against maternal aunt alleging that she had abused suhey on numerous occasions by striking suhey face with a sandal.on september,the court sustained the petition and ordered that suhey be placed in the home of parent father under the supervision of the department.the court set a hearing for october,at which it would consider an exit order for suhey.
contentions 
father contends that the court erred in ordering an icpc evaluation of father because the icpc does not apply to placements with a parent.more significantly,father contends that the court erred in setting a section hearing without considering his request for custody of suhey under section.

the icpc evaluation 
father contends that the court abused its discretion by ordering an icpc evaluation because the icpc does not apply to placements with a parent.the icpc is a compact among california and other states,the purpose of which is to facilitate the cooperation between states in the placement and monitoring of dependent children.citation.in re john th.pursuant to the icpc,no child shall be sent,brought,or caused to be sent or brought into the receiving state until the appropriate public authorities in the receiving state notify the sending agency,in writing,to the effect that the proposed placement does not appear to be contrary to the interests of the child,art,subd.d.
placement with an parent need not follow icpc procedure,as is plain from the statutory language the icpc governs conditions for placement in foster care or as a preliminary to a possible adoption.citation.in re john,supra,th at emphasis added see alsoin re johnny th,holding that the provisions of the icpc are not mandatory in connection with placement of a child with a natural parent in another state.however,although icpc compliance is not required for an placement with a parent,nothing in the icpc prevents the use of an icpc evaluation as a means of gathering information before placing a child with such a parent.in re john,supra,th at.
although an icpc evaluation was not legally required prior to placing suhey with father,the court had discretion to use such evaluation as a means of gathering information about father for the purposes of determining whether placing suhey with him would be detrimental to her.in re john,supra,th at.accordingly,the court did not abuse its discretion in ordering an icpc evaluation of father.
the section hearing 
father argues that the court should not have set a section hearing without requiring the department to meet its burden of showing that placement with father would be detrimental to suhey under section.section provides that,when a court orders removal of a child,it must determine whether there is a parent of the child,with whom the child was not residing at the time that the events or conditions arose that brought the child within the provisions of section,who desires to assume custody of the child.if so,the court must place the child with that parent unless it finds that doing so poses a risk of harm to the child,subdivision a.section language suggests that the statute is applicable only at the time the child is first removed from the custodial parent or guardian home.in re zacharia cal th.accordingly,the trial court would not generally be required to conduct a section analysis at a review hearing.
however,the department now agrees that a section analysis would be appropriate in this particular case given its inadequate efforts to locate father and provide him with timely notice of these proceedings the court denial of reunification services to father was based on the department report stating that it had conducted a diligent search for father and had served father with notice of the proceedings at his last known address.as we further discuss below,it is clear from the record that the department failed to properly serve father with timely or any notice of these proceedings.therefore,a section analysis would be appropriate.
at the detention hearing,or as soon thereafter as practicable,the court shall inquire of the mother and any other appropriate person as to the identity and address of all presumed or alleged fathers,subd.a.if,after the court inquiry,one or more men are identified as an alleged father,each alleged father shall be provided notice at his last and usual place of abode by certified mail,subd.b.here,father was identified as an alleged father at the detention hearing,and the department repeatedly attempted to serve him with notice at an address in the fictional town of idaho,california.the department does not dispute that it failed to provide father with notice at his last and usual place of abode,and that there was not clear and convincing evidence that his whereabouts were unknown.see fn.ante.serendipitously,father later found out about the proceedings from suhey maternal relatives he then contacted the department and sought custody of suhey.
had father received timely notice of the disposition hearing,he would have had an opportunity to appear at that hearing and request custody of suhey.if he had done so,he would have been entitled to custody of suhey under section unless the court made a finding that such custody would have been detrimental to suhey.instead,the trial court denied father reunification services because it found,based on the department report,that his whereabouts were unknown.the court then set a section hearing to address the termination of parental rights and adoption of suhey by her then current caregivers.the department argues that,at that point,father interest in reunification was,in its view,no longer a paramount concern and the burden shifted to him to file a petition under section based upon changed circumstances in order to have suhey placed with him.in re marilyn cal th.we disagree with this conclusion by the department.
the department failure to properly serve father deprived him of the opportunity to appear at the disposition hearing and obtain custody under the section framework.as a result,the burden should not have been shifted to father to show that suhey should be placed with him.rather the burden was on the department,under section,to prove that placing suhey in the custody of father would be detrimental to her,because,due to the department inadequate and ineffective service efforts,the court never obtained jurisdiction over father.in re arlyne th holding that the trial court failed to acquire personal jurisdiction over the father due to inadequate efforts to locate him and provide notice.had the trial court been aware of the department failure to properly serve father,it would have proceeded to adjudicate father custody request under section rather than set the section hearing.thus,we agree with father that he was entitled to have his claim for custody adjudicated under section.
it now appears that such claim has been,in fact,addressed.the record before us indicated that the trial court did,effectively,apply section at the section hearing when it placed suhey with father,and therefore,father has now obtained the relief to which he was entitled all along in our view,this result was not precluded by in re zacharia,supra,cal th at.
the department failed to adequately address evidence of child abuseand failed to facilitate reunification of suhey with father 
this record clearly demonstrates that the department failed to protect suhey from being physically abused by her maternal aunt.the multiple reports of child abuse in this case deserved far more attention than was devoted to them by the department.mandated reporters repeatedly notified the department of their concerns that suhey showed marks of severe physical abuse and had stated that she was afraid to go home.the department own investigation of the abuse referrals revealed troubling inconsistencies in maternal aunt and her children accounts of how suhey received her injuries and regarding maternal aunt use of corporal punishment.however,the department nonetheless concluded time after time that suhey should remain in maternal aunt home and was,in fact,thriving in her care.the department also did not keep the trial court informed about the reports or evidence of abuse in the foster home,and misrepresented to that court the state of that home for example,there is no way to reconcile the fact that maternal aunt brought suhey in to the department in an attempt to give her up because she did want her anymore,and the department subsequent report to the trial court that maternal aunt was providing suhey with a loving and stable environment.
further,there is no justifiable explanation as to why it took almost six months for the department to inform the trial court about the multiple reports of child abuse in the foster home,and almost ten months to inform it of the substance of those allegations.the first child abuse referral occurred in december,but it was not until june after three child abuse referrals had been made that the department included any information about these referrals in its reports to the court.moreover,the department june report provided the court with only a minimal description of the referrals that there had been allegations of physical abuse by an unknown perpetrator and withheld from the court the fact that mandated reporters had repeatedly reported severe
