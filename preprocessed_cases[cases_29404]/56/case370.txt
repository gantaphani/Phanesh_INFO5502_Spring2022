we affirm judgments in which the court assumed jurisdiction over children,lana and landon,based on her drug use and the presence of drug paraphernalia in the home removed them from her custody and denied her reunification services.contrary to contention,the court jurisdictional and dispositional findings,and the denial of reunification services,are supported by substantial evidence.
a preliminary issue on the denial of reunification services is a matter of statutory construction.under welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b and a parent is not entitled to services if the juvenile court finds by clear and convincing evidence that in a prior dependency case the parent failed to reunify with a sibling or half sibling of the child in the current proceeding,and has not subsequently made a reasonable effort to treat the problems that led to removal of the sibling or half sibling,subd.b,italics added.the issue is whether the italicized language refers only to the problems alleged in the prior dependency petitions,physical abuse and domestic violence,or extends to a chronic problem addressed as a substantial component of service plan,drug abuse.
to avoid an absurd result,we interpret the language in the latter manner.the exceptions to the general mandate of services are intended to protect a child best interests,and secondarily to preserve limited governmental resources,by not requiring services when doing so would be fruitless.
factual and procedural background 
prior proceedings 
has a lengthy history of drug abuse and child protective services cps intervention.in the san diego county health and human services agency the agency took her eldest son,joshua,into protective custody at birth because they both tested positive for methamphetamines.she admitted a history of drug abuse and drug use during the pregnancy.she participated in reunification services,including a drug treatment program,and reunified with him in.
later in,however,the agency again took joshua into protective custody,along with eldest daughter,because of the physical abuse of joshua.originally confessed to harming him,but after she was arrested she recanted and blamed her boyfriend,shawn b.in,gave birth to shawn,whose alleged father was shawn shawn was taken into protective custody because of a domestic violence incident between and shawn admitted to the social worker that she was involved in several domestic violence incidents in the past.
the agency detention report in this case states that in the prior proceedings service plan required her to reenroll in individual therapy,participate in an parenting education program,and maintain regular visitation with the children.at some point,she was also required to complete a second psychological exam,continue in individual therapy,domestic violence classes,and substance abuse testing.
the report also states throughout the duration of her second dependency case,there were concerns that was using drugs,as evidenced by her pattern of when asked to submit to random drug tests,showing up to the drug testing site and reporting that she could not produce a urine sample,or showing up to drug test at times not designated by the social worker.in november of,tested positive for methamphetamine and since that time she failed to complete drug tests for sarms substance abuse recovery management system program.
the report adds throughout the duration of her second dependency case,was asked to submit to random drug testing as part of her case plan.further,was asked to enroll in drug treatment but she refused.she continued to deny her drug use and therefore failed to adequately address and remedy her drug issues she failed to acknowledge take responsibility for addressing her drug issues,which appeared to contribute to her inability to maintain a safe home for her children.italics added.
a november psychological evaluation of states she revealed that in the earlier proceeding for joshua she was kicked out of kiva,a residential drug treatment program in re yvonne th,d,because she would not complete the work assignments she was given.the report states that in psychological testing,exhibited a profile similar to that found in individuals who have proven vulnerable to difficulty in managing alcohol and any drugs give them an immediate relief from tension.the report also states that since had not developed many life coping skills that enable her to deal well with stress,she remains vulnerable for substance abuse.
in the summer of,reunification services and parental rights over the three children were terminated.she appealed and this court affirmed the judgments.in re joshua,wl nonpub.opn.the children were ultimately adopted.
current proceeding 
lana was born to in the fall of,and landon was born to her in.and the children presumed father,michael,separated in.
in august boyfriend,justin,was living with her and the children.on august,police officers went to the home on a domestic violence call.said she and justin were just arguing.she quickly walked toward her bedroom in the back of the apartment,but officers stopped her.she became confrontational and yelled.in plain view,and within the children reach,the officers found drug paraphernalia in the bedroom,including glass pipes,burnt foil,a burnt tablespoon and a blowtorch.they found more glass pipes and a compressed pellet gun inside an open drawer.
denied drug use,but justin reported she used heroin and methamphetamines,and she last used methamphetamines the previous night.the home was foul smelling and filthy,with piles of dirty clothing,trash,and rotten food thrown throughout the living room,and animal feces and urine on the floors,however,did not feel the home was unfit for the children,who were also filthy.was arrested for possession of drug paraphernalia,obstruction of justice and child cruelty.
was released on bail,and on august,a social worker,accompanied by police officers,made an unannounced visit to her home.the social worker checked bedroom and saw a glass bong on top of a dresser in the open closet.denied any drug use since she was a teenager,despite evidence to the contrary in the prior dependency proceedings.she vehemently refused to voluntarily drug test.reported that the children had been in the care of their maternal grandmother since august,but gave the social worker a false address for the grandmother.after a brief period,ordered the social worker and officers to leave.
on august,when the children were located,the agency took them into protective custody and filed petitions on their behalf under section,subdivision b.both children tested presumptively positive for methamphetamines,but confirmatory testing was negative.medical personnel explained to the social worker that cutoff levels for an initial screening are lower and detect exposure through any factors,including environmental exposure.that amount,however,may not be high enough to produce a confirmatory positive.
told the social worker that when police officers arrived at her home on august,she had just returned from a vacation to washington state.she said she could produce evidence of the trip,such as gas receipts,in court.she let a friend of justin stay at her home during her absence,and she surmised he threw a party,trashed the place and left the drug paraphernalia behind.again refused to voluntarily drug test.she also refused other voluntary services.she did not give a sober date and stated that she was in treatment before but it did not work for her.she said that being around other s that use and have a problem does help her.she did not give any specific information on the substance abuse program she participated in or the dates of enrollment.
in its jurisdictional and dispositional report,the agency recommended the denial of services to because,among other things,she failed to reunify with three older children who were removed due to the mother substance abuse the report also states that on september,phone accidentally called the social worker phone.on phone,the social worker overheard a conversation taking place between and justin.the report states the following is a summary of concerning statements between them 
justin where is the mouse car sounds continuous beeping 
i do fucking know.move away from me.
justin where is the mouse i need the mouse give me the mouse 
you ca wait for five fucking minutes give me the shit that mine.i give it to you after me.unzipping sounds 
justin no i paid.that was mine.it was all my shit.
you a fucking punk.you steal from me all the time.it my shit,dollars is yours the rest of it is mine.dollars is what you get.that my hook up you fucking prick.hell no.you not married.i not married to you.
justin exactly,so you ai getting half of mine.i going to tell my grandma you took it.
then i going to tell your grandma you a fucking heroin addict you going to use my shit so you can sell it to your brother so you can get a fucking computer.bye i calling your grandma.
in an addendum report,the social worker explained was provided with referrals for a parenting class and a drug abuse assessment and strongly encouraged to voluntarily participate.she did not attend and showed no interest in those services or any type of drug treatment.further,she was asked to submit to drug testing four times,but she did not show up.
the contested hearing was held in december.the social worker testified she made a variety of attempts to offer voluntary services to,and encouraged her to participate,but she refused.the social worker also testified never provided any proof of a trip to washington.as to the recommendation of no services for,the social worker explained the main concern is the fact that mother is in denial of substance abuse history and use.it a huge concern because if a parent denies having any problems,then they will not often seek any treatment,and she has been very resistant to doing any type of services.and if we had seen that she had been participating in voluntary services,then we certainly would have reexamined our position in giving the mother services.but at this point,other than visitation,she has not been willing to do an assessment or address any of the concerns that we have.
the social worker clarified that said she would participate in services if they were court ordered.in the social worker view,however,it was unlikely that a parent who refused voluntary services would participate in services.
testified she had given receipts from her washington trip to her former attorney and was unable to retrieve them.she explained she refused voluntary services b ecause in the past,i have completed services,and i completed everything,and the outcome was still the same.she said she would participate in services to get her children back.claimed the last time she smoked methamphetamine was in,and her test in was not positive,but presumptively positive because she did not show up.as to the phone conversation between her and justin,testified they were talking about a computer mouse,not drugs.
the court assumed jurisdiction over the children and placed them with paternal relatives.it ordered services for michael and no services for 
discussion 
jurisdictional finding 
challenges the court jurisdictional finding.a dependency proceeding under section is essentially a bifurcated proceeding.citation.first,the court must determine whether the minor is within any of the descriptions set out in section and therefore subject to its jurisdiction.citation.the petitioner in a dependency proceeding must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the child who is the subject of a petition comes under the juvenile court jurisdiction.citation.the basic question under section is whether circumstances at the time of the hearing subject the minor to the defined risk of harm.in re th,d.
here,the juvenile court assumed jurisdiction under subdivision b of section.before courts and agencies can exert jurisdiction under section,subdivision b,there must be evidence indicating that the child is exposed to a substantial risk of serious physical harm or illness,as a result of the parent failure or inability to adequately supervise or protect the child.in re,supra,th at,d,subd.b.
a substantial evidence standard of review applies.in re th,d.we review the entire record to determine whether substantial evidence supports the court finding.we resolve all conflicts,and draw all reasonable inferences in support of the findings.ibid.we do not reweigh the evidence,evaluate the credibility of witnesses or resolve evidentiary conflicts.the appellant has the burden to demonstrate there is no evidence of a sufficiently substantial nature to support the findings or orders.in re jordan th,d.
substantial evidence does not mean any evidence it must be substantial proof of the essentials which the law requires.citation.to be sufficient to sustain a juvenile dependency petition,the evidence must be reasonable,credible,and of solid value such that the court reasonably could find the child to be a dependent of the court by clear and convincing evidence.citation.a mere scintilla of evidence is not enough.in re th,d.
count of the petition alleged has a history of drug abuse and she used narcotics on august.asserts the evidence was insufficient on this count because justin statement to a police officer that she used methamphetamines was uncorroborated and not credible.when he made the statement,she had just returned from a trip to washington to find her home in disarray.she was angry with justin because his friend had been staying there,and a fight had ensued.argues his statement had to be considered,as likely as not,a way to get even with her.
count of the petition alleged that on august,police officers found drug paraphernalia in home and within the reach of the children claims the evidence was insufficient on this count,because the evidence was uncontroverted that when officers found the paraphernalia she had just returned from washington.thus,she lacked knowledge of its existence.
the court,however,expressly found testimony not credible.further,she submitted no gas receipts or other corroborating evidence of a trip to washington.on september,michael told the social worker he did not believe the drug paraphernalia belonged to,and she let a friend watch her home while she and the children were on vacation.the court,however,was presumably not swayed by michael unsupported opinion.further,the police report does not indicate mentioned the washington trip to officers on august when they found the drug paraphernalia,which is notable since she would naturally be trying to avoid arrest.
essentially asks us to reweigh the evidence and credibility of the witnesses,which we may not do.further,she cites no authority for the proposition that to be believed justin accusation had to be corroborated.to the contrary,t he testimony of a single witness is sufficient to uphold a judgment.in re th,d.
moreover,the evidence shows has a lengthy history of drug abuse.her oldest son was removed from her custody in because of drug abuse,and she underwent drug treatment and reunified with him.in late,however,she either tested positive for drugs or failed to show up for the test when the social worker met with her on august,she refused to voluntarily drug test.additionally,on august,the children tested presumptively positive for exposure to methamphetamines,the drug justin accused her of using on august.further,the court could reasonably infer from the overheard phone conversation between and justin,they were arguing over drugs rather than a computer mouse.these various factors give credence to justin statement.
also asserts the children were not at risk of serious physical harm.she points out that the children presumptively positive tests for methamphetamines could be explained by any environmental exposure.the court,however,could reasonably find used methamphetamine at home on august,which exposed the children to the drug.even if she did not use the drug herself that day,the young children were in her control and,on august,drug paraphernalia was found in the home indicating someone had recently used drugs.again,the court did not believe story that she and the children had just returned from washington.substantial evidence supports the court jurisdictional finding.
