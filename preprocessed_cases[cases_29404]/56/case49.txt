petitioner appellant shermaine ali johnson appeals the district court dismissal of his habeas petition under,challenging his sentence of life imprisonment without parole.he argues that the rule announced in miller alabama,d,is retroactively applicable to him on collateral review.miller held that imposing mandatory life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for juvenile homicide,imposing that sentence without any individualized consideration of their status as the eighth amendment.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the miller rule is not retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.we therefore affirm 
the facts pertinent to this appeal are as follows 
johnson was convicted of the capital murder and rape of hope hall in.johnson was sixteen at the time of the offense,but was sentenced by a jury to death.prior to that conviction,johnson had also been convicted of the rapes of two other women.in,the supreme court of virginia partially granted johnson a writ of habeas corpus based on his trial counsel failure to request a particular jury instruction.on remand,a properly instructed,second jury also imposed a sentence of death t he supreme court of virginia affirmed johnson sentence 
in,johnson sought review from the supreme court of the united states,which remanded johnson case in light of its decision in roper simmons,d a majority of states have rejected the imposition of the death penalty on juvenile offenders under,and we now hold this is required by the eighth amendment.pursuant to virginia code sections d and,the supreme court of virginia commuted johnson sentence to life without the possibility of parole.in commuting johnson sentence,the virginia supreme court did not hold or order a rehearing.
johnson ponton,cv,wl,at,footnote omitted.johnson conviction and sentence became final on september,which was the last date on which he could have sought direct review by the supreme court.id.at see generally d a.
roughly seven years later,in june,the supreme court decided miller.the court held that a mandatory,sentence imposed on a homicide offender who was a juvenile at the time of the offense violates the eighth amendment.the concern motivating the court decision was that such a sentencing scheme precludes consideration of how children are different from adults.miller.at.the court noted that it is the odd legal rule that does not have some form of exception for children,id.at,and cited its decisions in roper,at,which categorically barred the death penalty for juveniles,and graham florida,d,which categorically barred sentences for juvenile nonhomicide offenders.unlike in roper and graham,however,the miller court did not categorically bar a penalty for a class of offenders or type of crime.miller.at.rather,the court mandate d only that a sentencer follow a certain process considering an offender youth and attendant characteristics before imposing a particular penalty.id.
just under one year later,in june,johnson sought collateral review of his sentence by filing a petition pursuant to.johnson argued that his sentence violates the eighth amendment because miller applies retroactively on collateral review.he requested that the district court vacate his sentence and order a new sentence consistent with miller.the district court found that johnson claim was justiciable and properly exhausted,but untimely.the court explained that a petitioner has only one year from the time his conviction becomes final in which to apply for a writ of habeas corpus,unless,as relevant here,the constitutional right asserted by the petitioner is newly recognized by the supreme court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.johnson,wl,at quoting d c.the court found that the supreme court had not made the miller rule retroactive,and therefore dismissed johnson petition as untimely.the court,however,granted a certificate of appealability as to the specific issue regarding whether the new constitutional rule announced in miller is retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.this appeal followed.
before turning to the question of the miller rule retroactivity,we must first address a threshold jurisdictional question.respondent appellee henry ponton the warden contends that johnson claim is nonjusticiable as moot because,under virginia offender law,even if we invalidate his sentence under miller,johnson would still be parole ineligible johnson counters that constitutional challenges to sentences currently being served are not moot,and we agree.justiciability is a question of law that we review de novo.see green city of raleigh,cir.that review,however,is largely circumscribed by supreme court precedent.
the supreme court held in walker wainwright,d per curiam,that a habeas petition is not moot where,if successful,the petitioner would not be released because he would be subject to another sentence.see id.at it is immaterial that another prison term might still await the petitioner even if he should successfully establish the unconstitutionality of his present imprisonment.this reasoning applies even where the same sentence might await a successful habeas petitioner due to other convictions.see mancusi stubbs,d.these cases establish that a person confined under a sentence from which he has not been unconditionally released can validly contest that sentence in federal court.adamson lewis,cir.applying this principle to the facts before us,we conclude that johnson petition is justiciable because he is currently serving the sentence he challenges.
finding johnson appeal justiciable,we turn to the question whether the rule announced in miller is retroactively applicable on collateral review.before addressing johnson arguments,we provide an overview of the circumstances under which new rules of constitutional law apply retroactively.
in general,new constitutional rules of criminal procedure will not be applicable to those cases which have become final before the new rules are announced.teague lane,d.however,a rule may apply retroactively on collateral review if the supreme court has itself held that the rule is retroactive,or if the court holdings logically permit no other conclusion than that the rule is retroactive.san miguel dove,cir citation omitted quoting tyler cain,d,concurring.where the supreme court has not expressly made a rule retroactive through a holding,the court holdings logically prescribe the retroactivity of a rule where the rule falls into one of the two exceptions identified in teague the rule is substantive rather than procedural,or the rule is a watershed rul e of criminal procedure implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding.whorton bockting,d alteration in original quoting saffle parks,d see also teague,at.
a new rule is substantive if it prohibit s a certain category of punishment for a class of defendants because of their status or offense.penry lynaugh,d,abrogated on other grounds by atkins virginia,d.a watershed rule of criminal procedure is one that requires the observance of those procedures that are implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.teague,at quoting mackey united states,d harlan,concurring in the judgment.the exception is extremely narrow.schriro summerlin,d.indeed,the supreme court has never found a new procedural rule to be watershed despite the fact that it has considered the question fourteen times.see jennifer berman,comment,padilla kentucky overcoming teague watershed exception to non retroactivity.const.the court statements that the right to counsel in felony prosecutions,guaranteed by gideon wainwright,might qualify as a watershed rule reveal how rare watershed rules are.see,beard banks,d.
with these exceptions in mind,we turn to johnson arguments that the rule announced in miller applies retroactively he first contends that the miller rule is retroactively applicable because the supreme court made the rule retroactive by applying it in miller companion case,jackson hobbs.alternatively,johnson argues that the rule applies retroactively under each teague exception because it is a substantive rule of criminal law or,alternatively,a watershed rule
