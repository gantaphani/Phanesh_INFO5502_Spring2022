at issue in this case is the issue left open in in re,whether a postadmission motion pursuant to supreme court rule d d is a jurisdictional prerequisite to taking a delinquency appeal.for the following reasons,we hold that it is not.
background 
the state filed a delinquency petition against respondent,william,in the circuit court of kankakee county charging him with burglary and criminal trespass to two automobiles.on october,respondent appeared in court with his appointed counsel.respondent counsel informed the court that pursuant to a plea agreement,respondent would admit to the burglary allegations in exchange for the dismissal of the criminal trespass charges,as well as the dismissal of an unrelated domestic battery charge.the trial court admonished respondent that an admission waived his right to remain silent,to require the state to prove the charges,to a hearing,to present evidence and witnesses,and to the state witnesses.the trial court also informed respondent that the burglary charges would have been class felonies if he had been charged as an adult.respondent acknowledged that he had not been coerced and was acting voluntarily.the trial court entered a finding of delinquency and adjudicated respondent a ward of the court.
on november,a dispositional hearing was held.respondent was committed to the department of corrections,juvenile division,for an indeterminate period.the trial court advised respondent of his right to appeal and further advised respondent that if he planned to appeal,he had to file a motion to withdraw his plea or a motion to reconsider his sentence within days.at the conclusion of the dispositional hearing,respondent counsel requested the filing of a notice of appeal and the appointment of the appellate defender.the trial court granted both requests.the clerk of the court filed the notice of appeal on november.respondent counsel,however,did not file a motion to withdraw respondent guilty plea or a motion to reconsider his sentence.
on appeal,respondent argued that the adjudication of delinquency must be vacated because the record failed to show that he was aware of the consequences of his admissions or that he was informed of the potential dispositions he could receive if he was adjudicated a delinquent minor.d.respondent acknowledged,however,that he had failed to file a postadmission or postdisposition motion pursuant to rule d prior to filing his notice of appeal.d at.the state argued that the appellate court was required to dismiss respondent appeal.d at.the state claimed that because respondent had failed to file a motion pursuant to rule d,the appellate court was without jurisdiction to consider respondent appeal.d at.
citing people mckay,d,the appellate court held that a rule d motion is not jurisdictional in the same sense that a notice of appeal is jurisdictional.d at.the appellate court stated that the failure to file a rule d motion raises questions of waiver as opposed to questions of jurisdiction.d at.consequently,the appellate court characterized the issue before it as whether it should consider respondent appeal,rather than whether it could consider the appeal.d at.the appellate court noted that if the case were a criminal case,the proper procedure would be to dismiss the case and allow respondent to pursue his remedy under the hearing act ilcs et west.d at.however,because the hearing act does not apply to juvenile proceedings,dismissal of respondent appeal would foreclose all review of respondent claims,including a claim with constitutional implications and a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel.d at.consequently,the appellate court held that respondent failure to file a postdisposition motion in accordance with rule d did not require dismissal of his appeal.d at.the appellate court,however,did not consider the merits of respondent appeal,but instead remanded the cause to the trial court for further proceedings in compliance with rule d.d at.this court then granted the state petition for leave to appeal.a.
this court recently held that rule d applies to juvenile proceedings.in re.because the minor in that case had filed a postadmission motion,however,this court left open the issue of whether the filing of such a motion is a jurisdictional prerequisite to taking a delinquency appeal.in re,at.
in the context of adult defendants,this court has stated that a rule d motion is a condition precedent to an appeal from a guilty plea.people wilk.consequently,this court held in wilk that the appellate court properly dismissed the appeals of those defendants who had not filed motions to withdraw their guilty pleas in accordance with rule d prior to filing the appeals.wilk,at.this court recognized that a defendant is denied the effective assistance of counsel,appellate review,and other potential constitutional issues when his attorney fails to adhere to rule d despite hearing the admonishments required by supreme court rule b b.we noted,however,that the dismissal of the defendants appeals did not leave those defendants without a remedy,because relief was available to those defendants pursuant to the hearing act.wilk,at.
at issue in this case is the interpretation of the condition precedent language in wilk.the state interprets the condition precedent language in wilk as establishing that the failure to file a rule d motion deprives the appellate court of jurisdiction over an appeal.the state further argues that because rule d has been held to apply in the juvenile context,its jurisdictional component must also apply.in support of its argument that rule d is jurisdictional,the state cites in re,d.
in in re,the appellate court relied on wilk in holding that a juvenile failure to file a motion to withdraw his admission of juvenile delinquency prior to filing his notice of appeal required dismissal of the appeal.in re,d at.the appellate court rejected the juvenile attempt to distinguish wilk on the ground that a defendant in a criminal case has the right to a hearing under the hearing act,while a juvenile has no corresponding right.in re,d at.the appellate court acknowledged that there was language in wilk indicating that the holding in that case would not leave defendants without a remedy.in re,d at.the court concluded,however,that the language was not central to the court holding and dismissed the juvenile appeal.in re,d at.
in contrast,respondent argues in favor of the appellate court interpretation of the condition precedent language in wilk.as noted,the appellate court in this case relied upon people mckay,d,in holding that a juvenile failure to file a rule d motion does not require dismissal of his appeal.the mckay court held that wilk and its progeny do not withdraw jurisdiction from the appellate court,but instead withdraw the decision whether waiver should bar the appeal of a defendant who has not filed a rule d motion.mckay,d at.in following mckay,the appellate court in this case acknowledged that its decision was in direct conflict with in re,d,but nonetheless held that respondent failure to comply with rule d did not require dismissal of his appeal.d at.
upon review,we find that the court in mckay was correct in its determination that wilk and its progeny do not stand for the proposition that the filing of a rule d motion is required to vest the appellate court with jurisdiction.in arguing that rule d is a jurisdictional prerequisite to filing a notice of appeal,the state points to language from a decision of this court subsequent to wilk.specifically,the state notes that in people foster,this court stated that when a defendant fails to file a motion pursuant to rule d,the appellate court must dismiss the appeal,leaving the hearing act as a defendant only recourse.emphasis added.foster,at.the state contends that the use of the word must indicates that compliance with rule d is jurisdictional.the state,however,overlooks the preceding sentence,which provides that t hough the appellate court may have jurisdiction,rule d precludes it from considering the appeal of such an error unless the defendant first files a written motion pursuant to rule d.emphasis added.foster,at.contrary to the state argument,then,a written motion pursuant to rule d is not required in order to vest the appellate court with jurisdiction over a defendant appeal.
moreover,as respondent argues,if the failure to comply with rule d deprived a court of jurisdiction,such noncompliance would always require dismissal of a defendant appeal.however,since our decision in wilk,this court has recognized certain exceptions to the written motion requirement of rule d.for example,in foster this court recognized an admonition exception to rule d.specifically,this court held that where a trial court fails to give rule b admonitions,the appellate court may entertain an appeal from a sentence despite defendant noncompliance with the written motion requirement of rule d.foster,at.we explained,however,that w here the appellate court may consider an appeal despite a defendant noncompliance with rule d,the appellate court has no discretion and must remand for strict compliance therewith.foster,at.
similarly,in people belcher,this court again addressed the written motion requirement of rule d.there,the defendant pleaded guilty to one count of first degree murder after his psychiatrist found him fit to stand trial.belcher,at.at the defendant sentencing hearing,the psychiatrist testified that he would have found the defendant insane at the time of the alleged offense under the prior version of the insanity statute.belcher,at.while the defendant appeal was pending before the appellate court,the defendant alerted the appellate court to the fact that the public act creating the new version of the insanity statute had been declared unconstitutional by this court.belcher,at.nonetheless,the appellate court denied the defendant request to vacate his guilty plea or to allow him leave to file a motion to withdraw his guilty plea in the trial court.belcher,at.
on appeal to this court,the defendant claimed that the appellate court had erred in denying his request to vacate his guilty plea.belcher,at.the state argued that the defendant could not challenge the validity of his guilty plea because he did not file a written motion to vacate his guilty plea in the trial court prior to challenging that plea on appeal.belcher,at.this court agreed that,in the usual case,the defendant failure to file a motion to withdraw his guilty plea within the time allotted by rule d would leave him without a remedy.belcher,at.we stated,however,that 
w hile it is true this court does not approve of any failure to comply strictly with the explicitly stated requirements of rule d people wilk,the unusual and circumstances found in this case lead us to believe that the ends of justice will be better served by permitting defendant leave to file a motion to withdraw his guilty plea in the trial court.belcher,at.
we therefore remanded the cause to the trial court to give the defendant an opportunity to file a motion to vacate his guilty plea.belcher,at.
the fact that this court has recognized exceptions to the written motion requirements of rule d,then,reinforces our statement in foster that those requirements are not jurisdictional.because failure to comply with the written motion requirement of rule d does not deprive a court of jurisdiction in the adult context,it follows that the failure to comply with the written motion requirement does not deprive the appellate court of jurisdiction in the juvenile context.consequently,we affirm the appellate court finding that respondent failure to file a written motion pursuant to rule d did not deprive the court of jurisdiction over the appeal.to the extent that the appellate court decision in in re,d,suggests that the appellate court must dismiss a juvenile appeal for lack of jurisdiction when the minor fails to comply with the written motion requirement of rule d,that decision is hereby overruled.
we next must determine whether the appellate court properly remanded this cause to the circuit court for further proceedings in compliance with rule d.as discussed,in the context of adult defendants,we have acknowledged that an attorney failure to adhere to rule d despite hearing the admonishments required by rule b falls short of providing competent representation.wilk,at.we recognized that 
t he defendant,through no fault of his,is deprived of a right to be heard in the appellate court.such assistance of counsel,coupled with the denial of appellate review,raises effective assistance of counsel constitutional questions.furthermore,many of the grounds for withdrawal of guilty pleas,consideration of which is denied because of counsel failure,themselves may raise constitutional questions.wilk,at.
we observed,however,that a defendant is not left without a remedy because the defendant can raise his claims in a post conviction petition.
the hearing act,however,has never been held to apply in juvenile proceedings.see in re,at,this court has not reviewed holdings of the appellate court concluding that relief from such juvenile court proceedings is unavailable under the hearing act.consequently,dismissing a juvenile defendant appeal for failing to comply with the written motion requirements of rule d may leave a juvenile without a remedy for his claims,including those claims alleging constitutional violations.
the state contends that juveniles would not be left without a remedy in this situation because they could present their claims in a section motion ilcs west.section of the code of civil procedure,however,does not provide a juvenile defendant with a remedy equivalent to the hearing act.although the remedial powers of section have been held to extend to criminal cases,such a motion is intended to correct all errors of fact occurring in the prosecution of a cause,unknown to the petitioner and court at the time judgment was entered,which,if then known,would have prevented its rendition.people haynes.a juvenile claim that his counsel was ineffective for failing to file a written motion pursuant to rule d does not fall within those parameters.moreover,a section petition is not intended to provide for a general review of all trial errors or as a substitute for a direct appeal.haynes,at,quoting people berland.consequently,we find that section is not adequate to preserve a juvenile claims on appeal when his attorney fails to comply with the written motion requirements of rule d.
because a juvenile does not have an adequate means for presenting his claims when his attorney fails to file a written motion pursuant to rule d,we find that dismissal is too harsh a sanction for a juvenile defendant failure to comply with rule d.we emphasize,however,that this court requires strict compliance with rule d in both the juvenile and the adult context.we therefore hold that when a juvenile defendant fails to comply with the written motion requirements of rule d prior to filing an appeal,the appellate court has no discretion and must remand the cause to the circuit court for strict compliance with rule d.accordingly,we affirm the appellate court order in this case remanding this cause to the circuit court for further proceedings in compliance with rule d.
for the foregoing reasons,the judgment of the appellate court is affirmed.
i write separately to address the dissents related contentions that certain statements in the majority opinion are irreconcilably inconsistent and that the majority conclusion is improperly based on the implicit assumption that the hearing act does not apply to juvenile proceedings.i believe that the statements can be reconciled and that our conclusion is supported by sound reasoning.
as the majority opinion states,the hearing act has never been held to apply to juvenile proceedings.at.at,at.in the absence of such an affirmative holding,juvenile defendants necessarily face the possibility that no avenue of review exists for their claims,even when those claims allege constitutional violations.at.at,at.in this case,however,the state argues that section offers such an avenue.we explicitly reject that argument,holding that a juvenile can not use a section motion to present a claim that trial counsel failed to comply with the mandates of rule d.at.at,at.after addressing these initial matters,we conclude that b ecause a juvenile does not have an adequate means for presenting his claims when his attorney fails to file a written motion pursuant to rule d,dismissal is too harsh a sanction.at.at,at.
this last statement forms the basis for the dissenters contentions that the opinion is internally inconsistent because it both claims that the application of the hearing act in juvenile cases is an open question and implicitly assumes that it does not apply.i believe these contentions are premised on an unduly loose interpretation of our statements and,thus,write separately to explain that the majority conclusion,read in its proper context,does not suffer from a fatal flaw.
in this opinion,we recognize the absence of any holding authorizing the use of the hearing act for review of juveniles claims.at.at,at.we also reject juveniles use of section for this purpose.at.at,at.properly read in this limited context,our statement that a juvenile does not have an adequate means for presenting his claims when his attorney fails to file a written motion pursuant to rule d merely acknowledges the absence of any precedential authority supporting the conclusion that juveniles such as the respondent have a viable means of appellate redress.see at.at,at.it neither creates an inherent conflict with our prior statements nor necessarily relies on an implicit assumption that the hearing act is inapplicable in juvenile proceedings.it merely recognizes the unsettled state of the law in this matter.
as for the dissenters contention that the majority should address the issue of whether the hearing act applies to juveniles in this case,i believe that our decision to decline that opportunity is well justified.the parties offer minimal argument on the issue.indeed,as appellant,the state does not even raise the issue in its opening brief.even more telling,the respondent brief explicitly requests that we simply affirm the appellate court remand,arguing that doing so would have the same effect as a decision on the merits of the substantive issue,plus have the additional benefits of serving the court interest in judicial economy,and avoiding the potential for overburdening relatively uneducated juveniles with the filing of pro se postconviction petitions capable of surviving first stage review.based on only this limited adversarial context,resolving an issue as important as the applicability of the hearing act in juvenile proceedings would be premature and unwise.a question of such magnitude should be fully briefed and argued by opposing parties zealously advocating the relevant arguments prior to its definitive resolution by this court.lacking the benefit of such strong adversarial testing,this court declined to address the merits of the issue in this case.thus,it remains an open question wisely left for another day.
i join fully in justice freeman partial concurrence and partial dissent.i write separately only to underscore the internal inconsistency in the majority resolution of the appeal in the case at bar.
the majority concludes that dismissal is too harsh a sanction for a juvenile defendant failure to comply with rule d because a juvenile does not have an adequate means for presenting his claims when his attorney fails to file a written motion pursuant to rule d.at.at,at.necessarily implicit in this conclusion is the determination that the hearing act does not apply to juvenile proceedings.otherwise there would be adequate means for a juvenile to present his claims when his attorney fails to file a written motion pursuant to rule d.see people wilk,when a defendant attorney fails to file a motion to withdraw defendant guilty plea in compliance with rule d,defendant may not pursue appellate review,t he appropriate remedy for these defendants lies in our hearing act.
however,only a few paragraphs earlier,the majority states that it is leaving as an open question whether the hearing act applies to juvenile proceedings.quoting in re,the majority notes that this court has not reviewed holdings of the appellate court concluding that relief from such juvenile court proceedings is unavailable under the hearing act and concludes that dismissing a juvenile defendant appeal for failing to comply with the written motion requirements of rule d may leave a juvenile without a remedy for his claims.emphasis added.see at.at,at.
if the question whether the hearing act applies to juvenile proceedings is truly an open one,as the majority claims,the majority should not be deciding this appeal as it does,based on the assumption that the hearing act does not apply to juvenile proceedings.as justice freeman points out,this court could just as readily assume that the hearing act does apply to juvenile proceedings.in so doing,however,the appeal in the case before us would necessarily be decided differently.
it should be apparent that resolution of the appeal in the case at bar is dependent on deciding whether the hearing act applies to juvenile proceedings.for this reason,the court has no discretion to avoid addressing the issue.the issue needs to be confronted.
like justice freeman,i concur in the majority holding that a defendant failure to comply with rule d does not deprive an appellate court of jurisdiction to consider the defendant appeal.however,because the majority assumes,without deciding,that the hearing act does not apply to juvenile proceedings in reaching its conclusion that dismissal is too harsh a sanction for a juvenile defendant failure to comply with rule d at.at,at,i,like justice freeman,can not join fully in the majority opinion.
i agree with the majority initial determination that a defendant failure to comply with rule d d does not deprive the appellate court of jurisdiction to consider the defendant appeal.i also agree with the majority that,where the circuit court gives proper rule d and rule b b admonitions to an adult defendant and the defendant fails to comply with rule d,it is not appropriate for the appellate court to remand the cause to the circuit court for strict compliance with rule d.instead,the appellate court must dismiss the appeal because the defendant has an adequate remedy under the hearing act ilcs et west.see people wilk.i part company with the majority,however,because it assumes,without analysis or citation to authority,that the hearing act does not apply to juvenile proceedings,and does not provide an adequate remedy for the juvenile in the case at bar.moreover,the assumption the majority makes affects the very outcome of the present cause and is therefore contrary to principled judicial review.in my opinion,whether the hearing act applies to juvenile proceedings is an issue of great import which this court must decide to reach the proper resolution of this cause.
in wilk,in the context of criminal proceedings,this court considered what should be the effect of the defendants failure to comply with rule d.both defendants had filed notices of appeal of their guilty pleas without prior rule d motions to withdraw the guilty pleas.this court first acknowledged the impact upon a defendant rights when there is a failure to comply with rule d 
a n attorney who stands with his client in a criminal proceeding,hears the admonishments of the court required by rule b,and fails to adhere to rule d by moving to withdraw the plea prior to filing a notice of appeal has fallen short of providing competent representation.the defendant,through no fault of his,is deprived of a right to be heard in the appellate court.such assistance of counsel,coupled with the denial of appellate review,raises effective assistance of counsel constitutional questions.furthermore,many of the grounds for withdrawal of guilty pleas,consideration of which is denied because of counsel failure,themselves may raise constitutional questions.wilk,at.
this court also emphasized,however,the importance of rule d 
the purpose of rule d is to ensure that before a criminal appeal can be taken from a guilty plea,the trial judge who accepted the plea and imposed sentence be given the opportunity to hear the allegations of improprieties that took place outside the official proceedings an
