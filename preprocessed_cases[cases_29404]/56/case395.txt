jon cryer and sarah trigger cryer were married and had a son hereinafter,child.they eventually separated and divorced.following their separation,sarah had primary physical custody of child and received substantial child support.after a dependency action was initiated,however,child was placed with jon.while the dependency action was still in the early procedural stages,jon sought to modify his child support obligation.the family court modified the child support amount but did not decrease it as much as jon requested.
on appeal,we find that the family court did not abuse its discretion by declining to order a more severe reduction of child support.the court properly found that special circumstances existed,and its ruling was consistent with the objective of protecting child best interest.it also did not err by denying a request for an accounting or trust for the child support funds.finally,we find that the ordered attorney fees awards were proper.accordingly,we affirm.
jon and sarah have both had acting careers,though their career paths diverged widely.as a costar in the tv show two and a half men,jon career soared.in contrast,sarah career stalled it appears her last acting job was in.
jon and sarah were married in and had child in june of that year.the couple separated in april,around the time jon finished his first season on two and a half men.with jon assistance,sarah bought a condominium in december.
following divorce proceedings,judgment of dissolution was entered in january.in a stipulated judgment entered into around the same time,jon agreed to pay sarah per month for child support,and the parties agreed to a custody arrangement giving sarah a percent time share of child and jon percent.from december until may,child lived primarily in sarah home.
after their divorce,jon and sarah both remarried.sarah had a son in january,with her new husband,david.sarah and david separated in march and eventually divorced.
in may,jon brought an ex parte application in the family court the trial court requesting sole physical custody of child.jon alleged that child had been improperly cared for by sarah and was left unsupervised.the trial court denied the ex parte application but cautioned sarah not to leave either of her children unattended.
later that month,sarah younger son suffered an injury while in sarah home.that event led to the initiation of a dependency action against sarah,and both of sarah sons were immediately placed by the department of children and family services dcfs with their respective fathers.sarah applied to the trial court for an order requiring jon to pay for her attorneys in the dependency action,but her request was denied.
on august,with the dependency action still pending,jon filed an order to show cause seeking to have his monthly child support obligations reduced from to zero.jon argued that his previous stipulated judgment with sarah was predicated on her percent time share for child.jon contended that because the dependency court placed child with him,and sarah was allowed only short periods of monitored visitation,none of the money he was paying as child support went to child and the obligation should cease.
sarah opposed the order to show cause.she argued that the child support obligation of per month was not a burden on jon since it constituted only around percent of his income at the time.she also argued that the custody arrangement ordered by the dependency court was temporary and subject to change,and that if she did not receive the child support she would lose her house and car and be unable to pay other bills,which would in turn harm child.
prior to the hearing,the parties submitted income and expense declarations.jon showed income of approximately per month,liquid assets of nearly million,and monthly expenses of approximately.sarah showed negligible average income and liquid assets,and monthly expenses of approximately,not including attorney fees.in her declaration,sarah stated her only significant source of income was the child support she received from jon.
the hearing on the order to show cause was held on november and the trial court issued its statement of decision on december.the trial court did not reduce jon child support obligation to zero as he was seeking,but did modify the obligation,requiring jon to continue paying child support at a rate of per month through the duration of,and then per month beginning in january.the ruling was primarily based on the status of the dependency proceedings.since the proceedings were still in the phase,sarah custody arrangement could be modified in short order,and dcfs had authority to liberalize visitation at any time.the court found it was in child best interest to be able to return to the same home that he had shared with his mother prior to the dependency case,and that it was important for sarah to have regular and consistent contact with him.the court found that jon was an extraordinarily high earner,and that guideline support et of per month would be unjust and inappropriate under the circumstances.jon was also ordered to pay to sarah attorney for fees.the order stated that sarah was expected to pursue gainful employment.the court scheduled a review hearing for possible further child support modification.
after the statement of decision was served,jon filed a motion for reconsideration.shortly thereafter,he filed a separate order to show cause seeking an accounting of how all child support funds paid to sarah since june,were used,or,alternatively,an order requiring the support funds to be paid into a trust account.jon believed that sarah was circumventing the prior ruling denying her request to have jon pay her dependency attorney fees by using the child support funds to pay those same fees.
the trial court heard both of these matters in february.the court granted in part the motion for reconsideration and made some technical,though not particularly substantive,changes to its prior statement of decision.as for the order to show cause,the court found that there was no legal authority that would support an accounting or imposition of a trust and denied jon motion.a total of in attorney fees was awarded to sarah counsel.
jon then filed two supplemental memoranda of points and authorities in anticipation of the scheduled review hearing regarding the requested child support modification.jon stated that sarah visitation rights had not been liberalized,even though the dependency action was instituted in may.further,sarah had not found a job and had not produced any evidence that she was looking for a job.jon argued that sarah was the person benefitting from the child support payments,not child,and requested that the court stay any further child support until sarah visitation rights were liberalized.jon also submitted an income and expense declaration listing average monthly income of,based on a average cash flow.
sarah filed responsive papers arguing that jon misstated his monthly income by averaging the prior three years of cash flow.she claimed that jon monthly income as of was actually.sarah papers also stated that her visitation rights had in fact been liberalized,since child was having home visits with her.sarah again argued that she would be unable to pay for her home if the child support stopped.she also submitted an income and expense declaration stating a monthly income of zero and monthly expenses of.
the review hearing was held on may.the trial court found that there were no changed circumstances that would warrant a modification to the prior child support order.at the hearing,the court stated that it had previously set the review hearing in the hope that the jurisdictional and disposition phases of the dependency matter would be completed.the dependency action,however,had progressed extremely slowly.as an example,the court noted that if there were an exit order eliminating sarah custody rights,that would constitute a significant change.but there had not been any significant change in circumstances since the last hearing in november.the court reiterated its finding that it was in child best interest that sarah have a home for him to return to,and that she was likely to lose the home absent child support.the court thus denied the requested modification.in addition,it ordered jon to pay in fees to sarah attorney.
discussion 
jon appeals the trial court rulings on i his initial order to show cause for modification of child support,ii his order to show cause seeking an accounting or imposition of a trust,and iii his later attempt at modification at the review hearing.jon also contends that the attorney fees awarded to sarah were excessive 
i.the trial court order modifying child support was proper 
child support orders are subject to an abuse of discretion standard of review.in re marriage of chandler th,chandler.as is standard in this type of review,we do not substitute our judgment for that of the trial court,and we will disturb the trial court decision only if no judge could have reasonably made the challenged decision.ibid.we review factual findings by determining whether they are supported by any substantial evidence.ibid.since we are reviewing a child support order,however,we are mindful that determination of a child support obligation is a highly regulated area of the law,and the only discretion a trial court possesses is the discretion provided by statute or rule.in re marriage of butler gill th.
jon argues that the trial court december order requiring him to pay monthly child support in the amount of through and afterward was an abuse of discretion.he points out that the order required him to pay significantly more than guideline support of per month.jon contends that the ruling was untenable,particularly because at the time of the ruling he had nearly total responsibility for child.we agree that under normal circumstances,such a deviation from guideline support would be an abuse of discretion.
this case,though,presented anything but normal circumstances.the trial court was faced with a pending and uncertain dependency case over which it had no control and which,although initiated months prior,was still in an early procedural stage.an imprudent order had the potential to undermine the preferred objective of the dependency matter,reunification.the trial court also faced the strong possibility that visitation and custody arrangements could change quickly,as they often do in dependency matters.furthermore,while one parent enjoyed an extraordinarily high income and could easily afford to pay monthly child support of or,the other parent had essentially no income,and would be unable to maintain a household of the sort to which child was accustomed absent substantial support.given these unusual circumstances,and particularly because the trial court ruling reflected a paramount concern of protecting child best interest,we can not say that the court abused its discretion.
overview of relevant law 
the amount of child support normally payable is calculated based on a complicated algebraic formula found at family code section although this formula is referred to as the statewide uniform guideline,guideline is a misleading term.in re marriage of hubner th.the formula support amount is presumptively correct in all cases see,subd.a,subd.k,but may be rebutted by admissible evidence showing that application of the formula would be unjust or inappropriate in the particular case,consistent with the principles set forth in section,subd.b.
section sets forth a number of principles,foremost among them being the protection of the child best interest the guideline seeks to place the interests of children as the state top priority,subd.e.among other principles,section also provides,a a parent first and principal obligation is to support his or her minor children according to the parent circumstances and station in life d e ach parent should pay for the support of the children according to his or her ability and f c hildren should share in the standard of living of both parents.child support may therefore appropriately improve the standard of living of the custodial household to improve the lives of the children.in light of these principles,departure from the standard child support formula may be appropriate when application of the formula would be unjust or inappropriate due to special circumstances in the particular case,subd.b,so long as the variance is consistent with section.
b.the special circumstances 
at the time of the initial hearing on the requested modification,jon was paying sarah per month for child support.in bringing his order to show cause,jon argued that there had been a material change in circumstances due to the dependency proceedings,which caused his time share to increase dramatically.a child support order may be modified when there has been a material change of circumstances.in re marriage of williams th.
the trial court at least implicitly acknowledged there was a change in circumstances.as noted in the court statement of decision,sarah time share had decreased from percent to percent.
jon was successful in persuading the trial court to modify child support,but he takes issue with the amount of the modification.as required by section,subdivision a,the trial court statement of decision included the amount of support that would have been ordered under the guideline formula per month,payable from jon to sarah.this comparatively low amount was largely the result of sarah then percent time share.the court departed from this guideline amount,finding that it would be unjust and inappropriate under the special circumstances of the case to modify jon obligations to such an extent,and instead ordered a reduction from to.
we find that the trial court decision was and consistent with the principles of section,especially the principle of protecting child best interest.jon is correct that the modification was unusual.so far as we are able to determine,no published california case has examined the propriety of an order giving child support to a parent with a minimal time share.in many cases,such an order would be improper.but,as noted above,this was not a typical case.
the special circumstances exception of section,subdivision b gives the trial court considerable discretion to approach unique cases on an ad hoc basis.county of lake antoni th,see also in re marriage of fini th,the court,in child support cases,is not just supposed to punch numbers into a computer and award the parties the computer result without considering circumstances in a particular case which would make that order unjust or inequitable.the trial court has broad discretion to determine when special circumstances apply.in re marriage of de guigne th.
this was a unique case that presented special circumstances,particularly when viewed from the trial court perspective in late.prior to initiation of the dependency matter,child spent most of his time with sarah.at the time of the november hearing,sarah custody and visitation rights were in the control of the dependency court and dcfs,and were subject to potentially sudden change.the relationship and its attendant duty of support do not end when a child is declared a dependent of the juvenile court and removed from the parents custody.citation.to the contrary,the chief objective of the dependency law is the preservation or reunification of the family whenever possible.county of ventura gonzales th.an order granting a large decrease of child support could have jeopardized the objective of the dependency action.substantial evidence supported the conclusion that sarah would have lost the house in which child had lived much of his life,and would have faced other substantial burdens that likely would have impacted her attempts at reunification.child interest was best served by an order that promoted the objective of reunification,as this one did.
further,the trial court correctly appreciated that the dependency action was still in its initial stages.jon argues that the dependency action had already lasted about six months with no change in visitation.but,given the procedural posture of the dependency action,a substantive change was likely to occur.despite its may initiation,the jurisdictional hearing and the disposition hearing had not occurred as of december.this in itself was unusual.generally,the jurisdictional hearing happens no later than days after the filing of the petition.welf.the disposition hearing often immediately follows the jurisdictional hearing cal.juvenile dependency practice,and is subject to strict time limits.see welf.numerous important issues are addressed at the disposition hearing,including whether the child is adjudged a dependent of the court welf,subd.d if so,whether to keep the child at home or remove the child see welf,with whom to place the child if removed welf,and whether reunification services should be provided see welf.when the child is adjudged a dependent of the court and removed from a parent custody,reunification services are generally required in re nolan cal th,and visitation is a vital component of reunification.in re alvin th.thus,from the trial court perspective at the time of the hearing,the visitation and custody situation was potentially volatile.the trial court was not obligated to order a severe reduction in child support based on apparently temporary conditions.see goldring goldring d.
in addition,given the posture of the dependency matter,the trial court did not abuse its discretion by finding that child best interest was served by a level of child support that would allow sarah to make the payments necessary to avoid losing her family home.a child need is measured by the parents current station in life citations,and where the child has a wealthy parent,that child is entitled to,and therefore needs something more than the bare necessities of life.citation.in re marriage of cheriton th,cheriton.there was a benefit to child in ordering this level of support,and the fact that sarah obviously benefited did not per se invalidate the order.see in re marriage of hubner d.depending on the status of sarah visitation and custody situation,child could stay in her house,a house he was used to and which was commensurate with the high standard of living to which he was accustomed.in light of his father substantial income and wealth,child needed more than an apartment,which was sarah only likely housing option if child support were decreased to guideline levels.an order that resulted in child spending time with his father in an opulent abode and time with his mother in a apartment would have conflicted with the principles of section.
importantly,child suffered no obvious detriment from the order.the and support levels did not impact jon ability to provide for child.nor did the order have any significant detrimental impact on jon financial situation.each parent is expected to pay child support according to his or her ability,subd.d.the support amount constituted anywhere from percent to percent of jon monthly income,depending on which income numbers were used.although,understandably,jon may have found the situation unfair,the primary focus must remain on the child,not the parents feelings.since the order minimized potential harm to child standard of living and station in life,and a severe reduction in support could have caused such harm,the court order was not an abuse of discretion.
c.the support amount 
jon argues that the support amount was excessive because sarah income and expense declaration showed a total of only in expenses that were directly related to keeping the house the mortgage payment,real property taxes,and utilities.the modification order was not simply premised on allowing sarah to keep the home,however.rather,the statement of decision emphasized the importance of reunification and the court reluctance to make any drastic changes pending a more certain status in the dependency action.a child support order need not,and generally should not,earmark specific amounts for certain purposes.in re marriage of de guigne,supra,th,chandler,supra,th.
further,despite jon argument to the contrary,the court apparently did take into account extra expenses he incurred due to the dependency matter.the court reduced the monthly support amount from to.although jon contends that the reduction in child support was too small,the court was obligated to examine the financial circumstances of both parents.see in re marriage of leonard th.jon was not likely to suffer any appreciable hardship paying a month,and the amount was consistent with the trial court proper objective of maintaining the status quo pending a more definite status in the dependency matter.
d.the denial of retroactive modification 
jon also argues that the modification of support should have been made retroactive to august,when he served his order to show cause.an order modifying child support may be made retroactive to the date that the notice of motion or order to show cause for modification was served.see county of santa clara perry cal th.when the order is based on a party unemployment or certain type of military activation,the order shall be made retroactive,unless there is good cause to deny retroactivity,subds.b,c.when the modification is based on other reasons,as is the case here,whether to order retroactivity is a matter within the trial court sound discretion.see,subd.a.in exercising its discretion,the trial court analysis must focus on the child needs,which is dependent on the parents ability to provide support.cheriton,supra,th at.
the trial court denial of retroactivity was proper.in practical terms,given sarah financial situation,modifying support retroactively likely would have resulted in a loss of the house,a result that would not have been in child best interest.jon,on the other hand,bore no unjust and unreasonable financial burden due to the denial of retroactivity.see in re marriage of leonard,supra,th at finding good cause for denial of retroactive modification when retroactivity would harm children and parent had ability to bear financial burden.
ii.the denial of an accounting or imposition of trust was not in error 
after the trial court decided not to severely modify his child support obligation,jon brought an order to show cause requesting an accounting of how the child support funds were used,or requiring the support funds to be paid into a trust account.this was a somewhat audacious request,as similar arrangements have been flatly rejected by the court of appeal.see chandler,supra,th,cheriton,supra,th.the trial court denied the order to show cause,finding there was no legal authority to support it.
we can not definitively say that in all circumstances,requiring an accounting or trust of support funds would necessarily be improper.our task on appeal,however,is not to review the trial court reasoning,but to review the ruling.cates california gambling control com.th,since jon order to show cause rested on nothing more than speculation,it could not meet the high standard under which an accounting or trust could possibly be acceptable.
chandler cogently expressed the reasons not to require a trust for child support,and its reasoning is applicable to the request for accounting as well.in chandler,the trial court ordered the father to pay in monthly child support and to place in a trust each month for expenses.the court of appeal found that the court decision to create the trust constituted an abuse of discretion.th at.the trust placed restrictions on use of the funds,and the mother use of the funds for nondelineated expenses required the father written permission or a court order.ibid.the court of appeal found that the law did not provide for the supporting parent control of the money paid for support,whether used to buy groceries,pay rent or pay for music lessons.id.at.it held as follows we doubt it is ever appropriate to employ a trust when ordering a parent to pay child support,particularly one which,in part,places the custodial parent under the fiscal control of the supporting parent.but even assuming a trust can be used,it must be limited to cases where there is a strong showing of necessity,buttressed by specific,detailed factual findings compelling the need to limit access to support funds.id.at.
jon again points out that,at the time he brought the order to show cause,he was effectively the custodial parent.but,an order imposing a required accounting or trust would have under
