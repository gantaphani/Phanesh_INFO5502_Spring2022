and hereafter referred to individually by their respective initials or collectively as the children appeal from the welfare and institutions code section orders designating legal guardianship with their maternal grandparents as their permanent placement this placement was based on the juvenile court finding that the exception to termination of parental rights and adoption of section,subdivision c a,which governs a child living with a relative who is unable or unwilling to adopt the child because of circumstances that do not include an unwillingness to accept legal or financial responsibility for the child,applied in this case.the children contend the juvenile court erred in applying this exception because it was required to find the relative caregiver inability or unwillingness to adopt was due to appropriate circumstances.we disagree and affirm the orders.
factual and procedural background 
in may,the madera county department of social service,child welfare services department initiated dependency proceedings over then and after their mother,mother,was arrested for trespassing in an occupied house with the children.the police took the children into protective custody as mother was unable and unwilling to make a plan for their care due to her mental health issues.the children were detained and placed with their maternal grandmother,brenda 
this was not the first time the family had come to the department attention.in november,the department received two referrals stemming from mother hospitalization for a section evaluation.in the first,no caregiver was available for when mother was hospitalized,while in the second,mother had given birth to and the hospital staff reported concerns about safety due to mother bizarre behaviors.the first referral was evaluated out after brenda took into her care,while the second was closed after brenda agreed to assist mother in caring for.the department received two more referrals in february.the first reported that mother was exhibiting bizarre behavior and walking into people apartments uninvited,and the second reported that while mother was in a department of social services office,was dirty and screaming,and mother refused to supervise.in the second referral,mother admitted to the responding social worker that she was unable to supervise and care for the children.the referral was closed after the maternal grandfather picked up mother and the children and took them to his home,where the maternal grandparents cared for the children until april,when mother took the children to stay with her at a rescue mission.
the juvenile court found true the allegations of an amended petition which alleged the children came under section,subdivisions b,j and g,due to mother failure and inability to supervise the children due to her mental illness,and because the children,was declared a dependent under section,subdivisions b and g,and mother continued to suffer from severe mental health issues that led to his removal and termination of mother reunification services in august.in august,the juvenile court declared the children dependents of the court,continued their relative placement,and denied reunification services to mother under section,subdivision b based on her failure to reunify with and to make reasonable efforts to treat the problems that led to removal.the court ordered visitation for mother and set a section hearing.
in a report prepared for the hearing,california department of social services cdss adoption specialist mary wilson stated that cdss had determined the children were adoptable as they were in good health with no current developmental delays.wilson noted,however,that the children current relative care providers grandparents were unwilling or unable to commit to adopting the children,although they were willing to commit to a permanent plan of legal guardianship.accordingly,cdss recommended a permanent plan of legal guardianship with the grandparents without termination of mother parental rights.
wilson stated the children had adjusted successfully to placement with their grandparents,where they had been since their detention,while making steady improvements in physical and emotional development.the children appeared successfully bonded to their grandparents and they all operated as a family unit.the grandparents had been the one stable factor in the children lives,as they had consistently come forward to take responsibility for their care when mother had mental health and legal problems,and were willing and committed to providing the children with a permanent home through legal guardianship.in wilson opinion,the children and grandparents had close and loving attachments,and the detriment of separation from grandparents outweighed the prospects of placement with another unknown family or even another family member.wilson noted that department case records showed mother had maintained monthly contact with the children through visits supervised by either the department or grandparents,and recommended mother supervised visits continue as long as the visits were not detrimental to the children emotional stability.
the department assessed the grandparents,year old maternal grandmother brenda and her husband,year old kirk,for guardianship.the couple has two children together.kirk is also the father of two other adult children and he raised brenda daughter,since she was two.the department stated that the grandparents and children appeared to be quite bonded to each other,and the family has a good support system.the grandparents were aware of the children needs for stability and affection,and were committed to providing a stable loving environment for them.the department recommended the grandparents be approved as the children legal guardians and dependency dismissed.
a contested section hearing was held at the request of children counsel.kirk testified that he is the children granddad and while he is not mother biological father,he raised her since she was two years old and she considered him a father figure.kirk was asking for guardianship over the children rather than adoption because i just looking at the best interest for the kids and i just like to keep my family together.he was willing to keep the children in his home as a permanent plan,provide for them throughout their childhood and was capable of supporting them financially.kirk was not willing to adopt the children if the court ordered adoption as the permanent plan,however,because he had been in mother life since before the children were born and he would quit my kids and i have to see them through.they need help.they need me.so it not it not nothing that i have to do as a grandparent is adopt.kirk recognized his commitment now was to the children,but he understood he could raise them without adopting them.kirk admitted there was nothing that precluded him from being able to adopt the children if he wanted to and the only reason he would not adopt them was because he was unwilling to do so.
wilson testified that while she found the children adoptable,she recommended legal guardianship as their permanent plan because the children were living with relatives who were committed to providing a permanent plan through legal guardianship,and the children had relationships with the relatives since they were born.wilson had discussed the options with the grandparents,including the differences between adoption and legal guardianship,and felt their responses were clear.wilson understood the grandparents did not want to adopt because they wanted to remain the grandparents and raise the children.kirk also stated that he feared for mother safety,he did not want to hurt or damage mother,and he wanted to maintain his family.
in wilson opinion,it would be detrimental to the children to remove them from the grandparents home as they had lived with the grandparents for a year and been in the grandparents home on and off all their lives.wilson believed the grandparents were willing and capable of providing the children with a stable and permanent environment,as they were meeting the children needs and had a very loving relationship with them.the grandparents had good jobs and adequate wages,but needed some assistance to provide for the children financially,such as medical and kin gap.wilson did not believe the grandparents were unwilling to adopt because they did not want to accept financial responsibility for the children.in her ten years as an adoption specialist,wilson had only encountered this reason for not wanting to adopt,wanting to remain the grandparents and raise the children,in two other cases.ultimately,wilson recommended guardianship because it was in the children best interests.wilson thought the children would benefit from continuing visitation with mother as long as she was compliant with her medications and acted appropriately.
brenda testified she had spoken with the children attorney on the telephone,who told her he was going to contest the guardianship recommendation because he wanted her to adopt the children.brenda felt the attorney was trying to force or pressure her to adopt the children she told him she did not want to adopt,she wanted to be the children legal guardian.in brenda view,as a grandparent she would be the children parent for life no matter what.the children attorney sent an investigator,margarita reyes,to see brenda,who brenda felt also was trying to pressure her to adopt.brenda explained that she did not want to adopt because i their grandparent,i these are my grandbabies.i was seeing my grandbabies every weekend.i picked them up.i going to be a grandma for life,that why i do know i their grandmother,i granny.
brenda realized the selection of a permanent plan was about the children and the best interest of the kids is they with me,and,i want them with me.she wanted to be the children legal guardian and wanted the children with her permanently.brenda had some concerns about taking legal responsibility for the children,since anything can happen as the children get older.for example,had been taken to a genetic specialist who saw some problems and brenda was concerned that she might have serious problems as she got older.despite this,brenda wanted to give the children a permanent placement with her as she had already been doing,since she was legally their grandmother and she wanted to exercise her right as the grandmother to have the children stay with her under legal guardianship.brenda did not have a problem with stepping up and being a parent to the children,but she did not want to be made to do something she did not want to do.brenda was willing to care for the children full time,raise them in her home and provide them with the things they need.brenda testified the children had been visiting with mother about once per week and the visits,which lasted from one to two hours depending on mother mental state,were going well.according to brenda,the children loved the visits and enjoyed mother.
reyes testified she met with brenda and the children in february.according to reyes,brenda told her that she would have loved to adopt the children,but it looked like they were going along with legal guardianship,which she preferred because there would be considerable additional cost to adopt the children and it would be a difficult process to go through.reyes said brenda told her that mother right to get the children back would end if brenda adopted them.brenda told reyes in another conversation that she was also concerned she would lose funding for the children if she adopted them.
after hearing oral argument,the juvenile court took the matter under submission.at the continued hearing,the juvenile court delivered its oral statement of decision.the court found that there were exceptional circumstances present,which case law had interpreted as designed to achieve the best interests of the children,as mother had a mental illness but still visited the children under the grandparents supervision,which visits might end if parental rights were terminated and the children placed for adoption.the court also stated that while it was not exactly clear why the grandparents did not want to adopt,they were willing to provide a permanent,stable home as guardians,and the reasons for not wanting to adopt,which included wanting to be grandparents and support mother,had nothing to do with an unwillingness to accept the legal or financial consequences.the court further found that the grandparents had the children in their care for a long time,they were committed to the children care no matter what,and removing the children from the grandparents would be detrimental to them.the court found the appropriate permanent plan was guardianship.accordingly,the court ordered guardianship as the children permanent plan,issued letters of guardianship to the grandparents,and dismissed dependency jurisdiction.
discussion 
at a section hearing,the juvenile court determines a permanent plan of care for a dependent child adoption,guardianship or foster care.in re casey th,subd.b.adoption is the permanent plan preferred by the legislature.in re celine cal th.if the juvenile court finds that a child is likely to be adopted,it must terminate parental rights and select adoption as the permanent plan unless section,subdivision c a section c a or the relative caregiver exception applies,or the court finds a compelling reason for determining that termination would be detrimental to the child due to one of the six enumerated circumstances set forth in section,subdivision c b,subd.c a b.
here,the juvenile court ordered legal guardianship as the children permanent plan pursuant to section c a,which provides,as pertinent here,the following exception to termination of parental rights the child is living with a relative who is unable or unwilling to adopt the child because of circumstances that do not include an unwillingness to accept legal or financial responsibility for the child,but who is willing and capable of providing the child with a stable and permanent environment through legal guardianship,and the removal of the child from the custody of his or her relative would be detrimental to the emotional of the child in applying this exception,the juvenile court found that the grandparents were unwilling to adopt the children because of circumstances that did not include an unwillingness to accept legal or financial responsibility for the children,the grandparents were willing and capable of providing the children with a stable and permanent environment through legal guardianship,and removing the children from the grandparents custody would be detrimental to their emotional.
the children challenge only the first finding,asserting the order selecting guardianship as their permanent plan must be reversed because the legislature did not intend the relative caregiver exception to be based on the relative mere preference for guardianship over adoption.pointing to the language in section c a that the relative must be unable or unwilling to adopt because of circumstances that do not include an unwillingness to accept legal or financial responsibility for the child,the children argue the term circumstances must mean concrete,appropriate circumstances that make the relative caregiver unable or unwilling to adopt,and a relative caregiver stated preference for guardianship over adoption is insufficient in itself to establish such circumstances.
the question raised is one of statutory interpretation calling for our independent review.burden snowden cal th,in re th.o ur fundamental task in construing a statute is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the statute.citation.in this search for what the legislature meant,t he statutory language itself is the most reliable indicator,so we start with the statute words,assigning them their usual and ordinary meanings,and construing them in context.if the words themselves are not ambiguous,we presume the legislature meant what it said,and the statute plain meaning governs.on the other hand,if the language allows more than one reasonable construction,we may look to such aids as the legislative history of the measure and maxims of statutory construction.in cases of uncertain meaning,we may also consider the consequences of a particular interpretation,includi
