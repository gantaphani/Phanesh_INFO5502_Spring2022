background 
respondent,was adjudicated delinquent because he was found to have violated the solicitation statute.on march,while at school,respondent asked whether he wanted to receive oral sex,and responded affirmatively.followed respondent instructions to go to the high school science room.respondent told,another minor,to go tell that b to go down to the science room.believed respondent was referring to an junior named relayed respondent message to,who went to the science room.testified that respondent and were in the science room when he entered.testified that after entered the room,respondent told her to perform oral sex on,and she complied because she was afraid respondent would physically harm her if she refused.respondent denied all of the allegations against him,but was nonetheless found to have violated the statute and was adjudicated delinquent.he was made a ward of the state and sentenced as a juvenile to months probation,seven days in the juvenile detention center,with credit for time served,additional days in custody with a stay of the mittimus,and registration and evaluation as a sex offender.
respondent appealed,arguing that the solicitation statute did not apply to juveniles and that it violated both the due process clauses of the federal and state constitutions,amend.xiv.const,art.i,and the proportionate penalties clause of the illinois constitution.const,art.i.the appellate court held that the statute applied to juveniles,was not unconstitutionally vague as it applied to respondent,and that respondent lacked standing to raise his facial constitutional claims.in re,d.respondent filed a petition for leave to appeal in this court.
we initially denied respondent petition,but issued a supervisory order directing the appellate court to vacate its judgment and consider his due process and proportionate penalties challenges on the merits.in re,supervisory order.the appellate court subsequently filed an opinion reiterating its original beliefs that the solicitation statute applied to juveniles and that respondent lacked standing to make his due process and proportionate penalties arguments.following our instructions to review the latter arguments on the merits,the appellate court also held that the statute did not violate due process principles,but that it did violate the proportionate penalties clause in such a pervasive manner that the entire statute was rendered unconstitutional.d.this court allowed the state petition for leave to appeal as a matter of right.respondent.
ii.analysis 
the state first asserts that the minor respondent lacks standing to challenge the constitutionality of the solicitation statute since its sentencing provisions were inapplicable to him.the state also argues that the appellate court erred by concluding that the statute violates the proportionate penalties clause.in respondent brief,he maintains that he has standing to raise his constitutional claims and that the statute violates the proportionate penalties clause both when the issue is analyzed under our prior analysis,previously used for comparing different offenses with similar purposes,and when it is reviewed by considering the severity of the penalties for offenses containing identical elements,relying in part on people graves.
in respondent,he reiterates the latter proportionate penalties arguments,as well as raising two other issues whether the indecent solicitation of an adult statute ilcs west may be properly applied to juvenile offenders and whether the statute is a facial violation of the due process clause of the united states and the illinois constitutions,amend.xiv.const,art.i.respondent latter contention is comprised of two discrete arguments.in these arguments,he contends the statute improperly turns misdemeanor conduct into a felony and does not contain the requirement of a culpable mental state or criminal purpose,thus potentially criminalizing innocent conduct.we first address the applicability of the statute to juvenile offenders because it presents an issue of statutory construction not implicating constitutional considerations that need not be addressed if the appeal may be resolved on other grounds.see people lee.
application of the solicitation statute to juvenile offenders 
respondent contends that the indecent solicitation of an adult statute does not apply to juveniles because the legislature intended to protect minors by criminalizing the acts of adults who arrange sexual penetration or sexual conduct between adults and children.in support,respondent cites brief portions of the record in the state general assembly indicating that the original impetus for the bill was the difficulty a state attorney experienced in prosecuting an adult who had lured juveniles into sexual encounters with other adults.from this,respondent generalizes that the statute was not intended to apply to juveniles who arrange similar contacts,relying on in re detention of lieberman,for his approach to statutory interpretation.as an issue of statutory construction,respondent argument is subject to de novo review.in re.
in lieberman,this court reiterated our principle that the primary objective of a reviewing court is to determine and effectuate the intent of the legislature,subordinating all other rules of construction.lieberman,at.we emphasized that the most reliable indicator of that intent is the language selected by the legislature,given its plain and ordinary meaning.lieberman,at,quoting michigan avenue national bank county of cook.in addition,we noted that specific provisions must be read in relation to the entire statute,with all words being construed in relation to other relevant sections.whenever possible,each word should be construed to avoid rendering it superfluous.with those fundamental concepts in mind,we indicated that courts may sometimes consider both the statutory language and the reason and necessity for the law,the evils sought to be remedied,and the purpose to be achieved.lieberman,at.we then examined whether the definition of a s exually violent offense as used in the sexually violent persons commitment act ilcs et west included the crime of rape.lieberman,at.
in looking beyond the literal language of the statute,we explained that w here the spirit and intent of the general assembly in adopting an act are clearly expressed and its objects and purposes are clearly set forth,courts are not bound by the literal language of a particular clause which would defeat the obvious intent of the legislature.lieberman,at,quoting people mccoy,quoting continental illinois national bank trust of chicago illinois state toll highway comm n.finding that the exclusion of a conviction for rape from the category of sexually violent offenses would lead to absurd results and prejudice the public interest in keeping citizens safe from violent sexual offenders,we held that the legislature omission of the repealed crime was an apparent oversight and that a contrary interpretation would frustrate the spirit of the statute and the intent of the legislature.lieberman,at,quoting gill miller.
here,adopting respondent construction of the solicitation statute would produce a similarly absurd result and frustrate both the intent and the spirit of the legislation.the plain language of the statute broadly states a person commits indecent solicitation of an adult if the person arranges for someone over the age of to commit an act of sexual penetration or other sexual conduct with a child under the age of or between the ages of and.emphases added.ilcs a west.thus,the statute expressly defines the requisite ages of the person who would actually commit the sexual conduct as well as of the minor who is the intended victim,but not the age of the person who arranges for the illicit contact.
as respondent readily acknowledges,the clear intent of the statute is to protect children.in his argument,he attempts to bring himself within that protected group based solely on his status as a person under the age of at the time of the offense.respondent argument fails to recognize,however,that the plain meaning of the language shows that this particular statute was designed to protect children from certain specified evils,namely,sexual penetration or sexual conduct with adults.there is no hint that the statute was intended to protect children from prosecution for their criminal acts.
here,respondent was not in danger of becoming the victim of either of the evils noted in the statute.quite to the contrary,he was judicially found to have been the instigator of those targeted evils by arranging for sexual conduct involving an adult and a minor.to read the statute as protecting respondent from prosecution due to his age would not only violate the plain meaning of the statutory language but also lead to absurd results and prejudice the public interest as well as frustrate the spirit of the statute and the intent of the legislature.lieberman,at,quoting gill,at.we hold that the indecent solicitation of an adult statute is equally applicable to both persons under and over the age of.
proportionate penalties challenges 
we note that before the scheduled oral argument in this case,respondent filed a motion for leave to withdraw both of his proportionate penalties arguments due to our recent decision in people sharpe.prior to sharpe,this court recognized three types of proportionate penalties challenges those raising analysis,requiring courts to judge penalties by comparing the penalties for offenses with differing elements sharpe,at,those claiming a particular penalty was excessively severe and therefore cruel or degrading and those comparing the severity of penalties for offenses with identical elements.sharpe,at.respondent made two of these three types of challenges,inviting both the use of analysis and a comparison of the penalties in offenses with an identity of elements.he did not claim that the statutory penalty was cruel or degrading.
in sharpe,this court ended our use of analysis,while continuing to permit proportionate penalty claims involving either the cruel or degrading standard or challenging the penalties in offenses with identical elements.sharpe,at.respondent abandonment of his proportionate penalty challenges was based on this change as well as our reversal of graves.respondent indicated his belief that the reversal of graves at best significantly diminishes,if it does not completely eliminate,the precedential effect of the appellate court graves decision.thus,he sought to withdraw both of his proportionate penalties arguments.this court allowed respondent motion for leave to withdraw those claims prior to hearing oral arguments in this case.
nonetheless,the state contention that the appellate court erred in finding that the solicitation statute violates the proportionate penalties clause remains properly before this court.the appellate court finding of unconstitutionality was based entirely on the application of analysis.d at.notably,the court conducted its review long before the issuance of our decision in sharpe.with the subsequent elimination of analysis in sharpe,we now reverse the appellate court holding that the statute was constitutionally invalid based on that analysis.
due process challenges 
we next address respondent facial challenges to the statute based on the federal and state due process clauses.we must first briefly examine the issue of standing.standing is a factor in justiciability that must be decided on a basis.the doctrine of standing is necessary to ensure that only parties with a genuine interest in the outcome of a case will raise and argue its issues.people greco.
here,the state asserts that respondent lacks standing to challenge the constitutionality of section a ii because,as a juvenile offender,he was not sentenced under its provisions.while this assertion may have been relevant to respondent ability to make proportionate penalties arguments,he has now abandoned those claims on appeal.his remaining three contentions do not attack the sentencing provisions of the statute.rather,respondent claims his delinquency finding under the substantive provisions of the statute violates the due process clause.
in respondent initial due process claim,he maintains that the legislature was not empowered to define the act of merely arranging for sexual conduct between an adult and a child as a felony while characterizing actual sexual conduct with a child as a misdemeanor.respondent brief specifically states that he is challenging the constitutionality of the statute in its entirety,not any uncharged or inapplicable provisions,and he argues that because this criminal statute violates due process,it is completely invalid.respondent arguments also refer to the pervasive nature of the alleged constitutional flaw.he asserts standing because he was adjudicated delinquent based on a judicial finding that he had violated a statute that he contends should be deemed void ab initio because it is constitutionally invalid in its entirety.these arguments establish that respondent is challenging more than the mere sentencing provisions of the statute.
in addition,respondent notes that,even as a juvenile not subject to imprisonment risks identical to those faced by adult offenders,he has nonetheless suffered direct harm from being found in violation of the statute.while his juvenile court record may be expunged of entries relating to misdemeanor violations,adjudication records based upon sex offenses which would be felonies if committed by an adult,including violations of the solicitation statute,are statutorily barred from being expunged.ilcs west.as we recognized in in re christopher,n ullification of a conviction may hold important consequences for a defendant,even when the sentence imposed is not at issue.here,respondent maintains he is directly harmed by the legislature decision to create a felony solicitation statute for reasons wholly unrelated to pure sentencing differences between felony and misdemeanor offenses.
after reviewing respondent challenge to the legislature ability to enact these disparate offense classes,we agree it addresses the substantive validity of the statute underlying respondent adjudication of delinquency.thus,respondent falls within the class aggrieved by the alleged unconstitutionality of that statute for purposes of raising this due process challenge.see people morgan,stating the general rule for determining issues of standing.the fact that respondent was not actually sentenced under the provisions in the adult statute does not negate the broader nature of the arguments presented in his brief.
next,we address the issue of standing in respondent remaining two due process claims.we note that these claims assert that the solicitation statute improperly lacks the requisite elements of a culpable mental state and knowledge of the participants ages.both these contentions relate to the substantive characteristics of the statute rather than to the nature of its sentencing provisions.respondent has standing to raise these two due process challenges because his adjudication of delinquency was based on a judicial finding that the allegedly inadequate statutory elements were met.see morgan,at.
ii.conversion of misdemeanor conduct into a felony 
turning next to the merits of respondent due process arguments,he first claims that the statute improperly converts misdemeanor conduct into a felony since the adult who actually engages in sexual conduct with a child commits a misdemeanor while the person who simply arranges the
