in january the district attorney filed a sixth petition,alleging oscar violated probation.the morning after disposition,oscar refused to go into his father house after his release from juvenile hall.he then left without permission and did not return until after.the court subsequently removed oscar from his parents custody and directed the probation department to find a placement to address his rehabilitative needs.the probation officer placed oscar at the alpha connections facility toward the end of january.initial reports indicated oscar had adjusted well to the program and appeared motivated to act appropriately.however,oscar behavior declined when he learned he would not return home after the school year,and he ran away in late july.the court issued a bench warrant,but oscar remained awol absent without leave until he turned himself in six months later.the court reinstated his placement a few days later.while the probation officer tried to find a new facility,oscar was diagnosed with bipolar disorder,but refused to take medication.
in early march,oscar went to ee residential care group ee for placement.while at ee,oscar received more than incident reports for various problems,such as noncompliance,disrespecting staff,excessive profanity,stealing food,leaving without permission,gang writing,tagging property,and getting into fights.
toward the end of april,oscar ran away from ee.after his arrest,the district attorney filed a seventh petition,alleging oscar violated probation.the court reinstated oscar placement,but detained him in juvenile hall until a new facility accepted him.at his placement review,the probation officer informed the court that he had sent applications to two california facilities,philos and california family life center cflc,and that rite of passage silverstate academy rop in nevada had accepted oscar.oscar counsel objected to the because the probation officer had not exhausted all options.the probation officer provided a memorandum documenting its continued efforts to locate an facility and oscar acceptance to cflc in late may.at cflc,oscar had some incident reports involving use of profanity and refusing to follow rules and directives.

in late august,the probation officer conducted the behavior health services assessment.the assessment indicated that oscar dislikes placement,which is why he repeatedly runs away or gets terminated.it further described oscar poor relationship with his parents,problems at school,behavioral issues,and long history of substance abuse.the assessment recommended oscar receive individual and family psychotherapy,medication support,and substance abuse services.from this,the probation officer concluded placement would best serve oscar interests.the probation officer again recommended rop in nevada for its locked facility,which would minimize oscar ability to run away before completing treatment.
in september oscar admitted using methamphetamine.oscar counsel argued the court should not yet place oscar because the probation officer provided insufficient evidence to support that recommendation.the court agreed and instructed the probation officer to provide a memorandum listing specific reasons why facilities were unavailable or inadequate.the probation officer second memorandum stated oscar either ran away or was terminated from his first four homes and that two additional facilities had denied oscar acceptance into their programs.
that month,the court held a placement review hearing to determine whether to order placement.oscar counsel again argued the probation officer had not provided sufficient evidence to show a need for placement.the probation officer stated all four of oscar previous homes denied his readmission,and she had sent applications to all the other group homes utilized by her department.she recommended rop because it operated a higher level facility than california facilities,had more extensive services,and more supervision.when pressed by oscar counsel as to its differences from facilities,the probation officer explained rop offers classes more frequently and provides staff,such as psychiatrists.additionally,it has an school and is,which would limit oscar
