this is an appeal from the district court award of summary judgment to the state of michigan in a putative class action case that challenges the constitutionality of certain provisions of the state sex offender registration act sora.the plaintiff represents one of two proposed classes of individuals who were assigned to youthful trainee status under the state holmes youthful trainee act hyta for sex offenses and,under michigan law,were then required to register as sex offenders.on appeal,the plaintiffs contend that the district court erred when it found that they had suffered no due process or equal protection violations from the requirement that they register and appear on michigan public sex offender registry psor.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
the hyta.comp.laws et,is essentially a juvenile diversion program for criminal defendants under the age of.it provides in pertinent part as follows 
i f an individual pleads guilty to a criminal offense,committed on or after the individual seventeenth birthday but before his or her birthday,the court of record having jurisdiction of the criminal offense may,without entering a judgment of conviction and with the consent of that individual,consider and assign that individual to the status of youthful trainee.
comp.laws.an assignment to youthful trainee status does not constitute a conviction for a crime unless the court revokes the defendant status as a youthful trainee.id.if and when the defendant successfully completes his or her status as a youthful trainee,the court shall discharge the individual and dismiss the proceedings.comp.laws.once the individual is so released,he or she shall not suffer a civil disability or loss of right or privilege because of the assignment.id.unless the court enters a judgment of conviction against the individual for the criminal offense,all proceedings regarding the disposition of the criminal charge and the individual assignment as youthful trainee shall be closed to public inspection.id.
a defendant assigned to youthful trainee status may,depending on the possible sentence for the underlying offense,serve up to three years in custodial supervision,up to one year in the county jail,or up to three years on probation.id.in essence,a juvenile criminal defendant offers a guilty plea to the court.the court then holds the plea in abeyance under the hyta until the defendant completes the requirements of the program.at that time,the court discharges the defendant and dismisses the proceedings.
in,michigan adopted the sora.comp.laws,in response to congress jacob wetterling act,which requires states to establish registries of convicted sex offenders.the sora,as it was first enacted,was designed as a tool solely for law enforcement agencies,and registry records were kept confidential.pub.acts a registration is confidential and shall not be open to inspection except for law enforcement purposes.as of september,however,the sora was amended to create the psor,which can be accessed by anyone via the internet.the psor website has a disclaimer posted on its front page that describes the registry as follows 
this registry is made available through the internet with the intent to better assist the public in preventing and protecting against the commission of future criminal sexual acts by convicted sex offenders.
the registration requirements of the sex offenders registration act are intended to provide the people of this state with an appropriate,comprehensive,and effective means to monitor those persons who pose such a potential danger.
michigan public sex offender registry,available at.mi.us last visited may.the psor provides a version of the information available in the law enforcement database,but includes names,aliases,addresses,physical descriptions,birth dates,photographs,and specific offenses for all convicted sex offenders in the state of michigan.comp.laws a.
when the michigan legislature enacted the sora,it also amended the hyta to provide that even individuals assigned to youthful trainee status were required to register as sex offenders.pub.acts adding a provision to of the hyta stating that a n individual assigned to youthful trainee status for a listed offense enumerated in section of the sex offenders registration act is required to comply with the requirements of that act.this new provision.comp.laws is in effect an exception to hyta general provision.comp.laws that u nless the court enters a judgment of conviction against the individual,all proceedings regarding the disposition of the criminal charge and the individual assignment as youthful trainee shall be closed to public inspection.comp.laws.
the hyta also requires that for every individual assigned to youthful trainee status for a listed offense enumerated in section of the sora,law enforcement agencies shall register the individual or accept the individual registration as provided under the sora.comp.laws.as a result,the psor includes information about individuals who were assigned to youthful trainee status under the hyta,satisfied their obligations,and thus were never convicted of their offense.
michigan amended the sora and the hyta again in.prior to the amendment,the sora defined the term convicted to include,in relevant part 
a having a judgment of conviction or a probation order entered in a court having jurisdiction over criminal offenses,including a conviction subsequently set aside pursuant to act of the public acts of,being sections to of the michigan compiled laws.
b being assigned to youthful trainee status pursuant to sections to of chapter ii of the code of criminal procedure,act of the public acts of,being sections to of the michigan compiled laws.
pub.acts.but effective october,the definition of convicted was amended to include 
a being assigned to youthful trainee status under sections to of chapter ii of the code of criminal procedure,pa,mcl to,before october.
b being assigned to youthful trainee status under sections to of chapter ii of the code of criminal procedure,pa,mcl to,on or after october,if the individual status of youthful trainee is revoked and an adjudication of guilt is entered.
pub.acts emphasis added.
in addition,the hyta was amended in to make it unavailable to most individuals under years of age who had been charged with criminal sexual conduct.only those individuals charged with offenses,defined as consensual sexual activity of a youth between the ages of and with another youth between the ages of and,are still eligible for youthful trainee status.see.comp.laws d a sexual penetration of a person between ages and.comp.laws e a sexual contact with a person between ages and if the actor is five or more years older.
the amendment was motivated,in part,by concerns that individuals who do not pose a danger to the public,and who do not pose a danger of reoffending,including teens engaging in consensual sex,are required to register as sex offenders unnecessarily.house legis.analysis section,sex offender registration revisions juveniles,at,hereinafter sex offender registration revisions juveniles.
both the original and the amended versions of the sora,however,define the term convicted to reach youthful trainees charged with certain sex offenses.the sora thus creates an exception to the hyta provisions that assignment of an individual to the status of youthful trainee is not a conviction for a crime and that an individual assigned to the status of youthful trainee shall not suffer a civil disability or loss of right or privilege following his or her release from that status because of his or her assignment as a youthful trainee.comp.laws.notwithstanding the hyta,the sora thus requires youthful trainees charged with certain sex offenses to register as convicted sex offenders and information about their identities and convictions appears on the psor.
this case involves two distinct groups of plaintiffs,one headed by pseudonymous plaintiff john doe and the other headed by pseudonymous plaintiff samuel poe.both groups of plaintiffs allege that their members were charged with criminal sexual offenses,assigned to youthful trainee status,and sentenced under the hyta on or before october.as of the date of the initial complaint march,however,the members of the first group,headed by john doe,had completed their hyta obligations,been discharged from youthful trainee status,and had their criminal proceedings under of the hyta dismissed by the sentencing courts.they are accordingly required to register as convicted sex offenders under the sora and information about them appears on the psor.in contrast,the group headed by samuel poe had not yet completed their obligations under the hyta program nor had their criminal proceedings been dismissed as of the date of the complaint.they will be required to register as convicted sex offenders upon the termination of their youthful trainee status,but are not presently so obligated.had the doe or poe plaintiffs been assigned to youthful trainee status on or after october,however,they would have been exempt from the registration requirements of the sora unless their youthful trainee status was revoked prior to their final release under the hyta.
the plaintiffs have sued the michigan department of state police and its,tadarial sturdivant,in his official capacity,alleging violations of their right to privacy,substantive due process rights,and equal protection rights.both defendants will hereafter be collectively referred to as the state.in addition to declaratory and injunctive relief,the plaintiffs seek attorney fees and costs.the state moved for summary judgment on all of the claims.in light of prior decisions from the supreme court addressing procedural due process arguments and this court addressing substantive due process arguments that had upheld similar registration laws,the district court granted the state motion.this timely appeal by the john doe plaintiffs followed.

standard of review 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.int l union cummins,cir.summary judgment is proper where no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in considering a motion for summary judgment,the district court must construe the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.see matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.the central issue is whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so that one party must prevail as a matter of law.anderson liberty lobby,d.
plaintiffs substantive due process claims 
the plaintiffs first amended class action complaint alleges two causes of action based upon a substantive due process theory.their first cause of action asserts that they have a constitutionally protected liberty interest and fundamental right to be left alone.they claim that registration under the sora violates their liberty interest because personal identifying information about them is listed on the psor and is accessible to the general public via the internet,despite the fact that they have not been convicted of a crime and are entitled to a second chance under the hyta.furthermore,the plaintiffs contend that the disclaimer language that appears on the psor labels them currently dangerous sex offenders even though there has been no determination of their dangerousness and despite the fact that youthful trainee status is available only to defendants who are found to be at low risk to reoffend.
doe and poe assert in their second cause of action that the sora and its requirement that youthful trainees register as convicted sex offenders violates their substantive due process rights by continuing to mandate their registration and public disclosure of information about their offenses which is not made public under hyta,and thus leads to an absurd result that is not in accord with the plain language and legislative goals of the hyta.the district court considered both causes of action to be alleging the same substantive due process claim,noting that the liberty interest raised in the first cause of action is best viewed as one of the substantive rights provided by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.in granting summary judgment to the state on both of these causes of action,the district court relied on the supreme court decision upholding the connecticut sex offender registry against a due process challenge,connecticut department of public safety doe,d,and a sixth circuit case upholding the tennessee sex offender registry,cutshall sundquist,cir.
the plaintiffs in department of public safety raised a procedural due process challenge to connecticut sex offender registry,contending that the state failure to provide a hearing on a registrant potential danger to the community violated their due process rights.this argument failed,according to the supreme court,because connecticut sex offender registry statute made no distinction between offenders based on dangerousness.at.instead,the connecticut statute reflected the state decision that the registry information of all sex dangerous or be publicly disclosed.id.at.emphasis in original.the court,however,left open the question of whether a substantive due process challenge might succeed,noting 
it may be that respondent claim is actually a substantive challenge to connecticut statute recast in procedural due process terms but states are not barred by principles of procedural due process from drawing such classifications.such claims must ultimately be analyzed in terms of substantive,not procedural,due process.because the question is not properly before us,we express no opinion as to whether connecticut sex offender registry law violates principles of substantive due process.

in the year following department of public safety,a procedural due process challenge to the michigan sora reached this court.fullmer.dep t of state police,cir.the fullmer court,following the lead of department of public safety,left open the substantive due process question while upholding the sora against the procedural due process challenge.id.at b ecause the plaintiff in this case did not rely on substantive due process as a ground for relief,that issue is not before us at this time.
after acknowledging that the plaintiffs in the present case were attempting to litigate the question that the supreme court explicitly left open,the district court relied on the analysis set forth in cutshall sundquist,cir,to grant summary judgment to the state on the plaintiffs substantive due process challenge.cutshall,like department of public safety and fullmer,involved a procedural due process challenge to a state registry statute.at.the cutshall plaintiff alleged that tennessee sex offender registration and monitoring act violated the double jeopardy,ex post facto,bill of attainder,due process,and equal protection clauses of the united states constitution,in addition to the eighth amendment,the constitutional right to interstate travel,and the constitutional right to privacy.id.on appeal,this court upheld the statute and reversed the district court decision that required the state to hold a hearing on the offender alleged danger to the community prior to placing him or her on the registry.id.at.
the cutshall court discussion of this procedural due process challenge rested in large part on a substantive due process analysis.cutshall,like the plaintiffs in the present case,alleged that the registry statute violated his due process rights because it imposed a stigma and deprived him of employment and privacy.this court dismissed cutshall argument on the basis that he did not allege that the tennessee statute limited the ability of registrants to seek and obtain any type of employment.id.at.the court concluded that a charge that merely makes a plaintiff less attractive to other employers but leaves open a definite range of opportunity does not constitute a liberty deprivation.id.citation and quotation marks omitted.furthermore,the court found no case recognizing a general right to private employment.id.
the district court in the present case also discussed the eleventh circuit case of doe moore,cir,which explicitly addressed a substantive due process challenge to florida registry statute.after defining the right asserted as the right to refuse postconviction registration of his or her personal information with florida law enforcement and prevent publication of this information on florida sexual website,id.at,the eleventh circuit found that this assertion did not constitute a fundamental right.the moore court accordingly reviewed the substantive due process challenge under the standard and determined that the statute satisfied florida stated interest in protecting the public from sexual abuse.id.at brackets omitted.
doe and poe argue that the district court in the present case erred when it failed to address the interface of the hyta with the sora.they also contend that the cases that the district court relied on are inapplicable to the situation of youthful trainees who entered a deferred guilty plea to a charge of criminal sexual conduct in exchange for a dismissal of the charges against them and a promise of privacy.this argument principally relates to the doe plaintiffs,who had completed their obligations under the hyta and had been discharged from youthful trainee status as of the time that the present complaint was filed.unlike the poe plaintiffs,who had not yet been discharged from youthful trainee status,the criminal records of the doe plaintiffs had already been sealed.the doe plaintiffs thus contend that the registration requirement abrogated the state promise under the hyta that the charges against them would be dismissed and essentially would cease to exist.
substantive due process analysis 
the substantive component of the due process clause protects fundamental rights that are so implicit in the concept of ordered liberty that neither liberty nor justice would exist if they were sacrificed.palko.such rights include the rights to marry,to have children,to direct the education and upbringing of one children,to marital privacy,to use contraception,to bodily integrity,and to abortion.washington glucksberg,d citations omitted.the supreme court has cautioned,however,that it has always been reluctant to expand the concept of substantive due process because guideposts for responsible decisionmaking in this unchartered area are scarce and.id.
when reviewing a substantive due process claim,we must first craft a careful description of the asserted right,reno flores,d,and then determine whether that right is deeply rooted in this nation history and tradition and implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,such that it can be considered a fundamental right.glucksberg,at.legislation that infringes on a fundamental right is reviewed under the test and will be invalidated unless it is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.flores,at.
the right asserted 
the amicus curia in this case,the aclu of michigan,states that the right asserted here is the right of youths adjudicated under hyta to have offense information be kept private where those youths,in exchange for a promise of privacy,pled guilty and gave up their sixth amendment rights in their first amended complaint,the plaintiffs assert a general right to have information about their hyta proceedings be excluded from public disclosure and to be left alone by not being falsely designated as currently dangerous sex offenders who pose a threat to the public safety.having considered both views,we believe that the best definition of the right asserted by the plaintiffs is that their hyta records should be sealed and exempted from public disclosure because,at the conclusion of their youthful trainee status,the criminal charges against them were or will be dismissed.as a result,the right asserted also encompasses the right to be free from being labeled a convicted sex offender when,under the hyta,the plaintiffs were never convicted of such an offense.
implicit in the concept of ordered liberty 
other circuit courts have considered substantive due process arguments against the registration requirement of registries.each appellate court to have done so has found that the registry laws are constitutional.see moore,at holding that the right to refuse to register under a statute is not a fundamental right doe tandeske,cir per curiam p ersons who have been convicted of serious sex offenses do not have a fundamental right to be free from registration and notification requirements gunderson hvass,cir concluding that the registration statute does not infringe the plaintiff fundamental right to a presumption of innocence paul verniero,cir holding that the effects of registering under a registration statute fail to fall within the penumbra of constitutional privacy protection.
after giving due consideration to this issue,we now join our sister circuits in concluding that the right asserted here is not a fundamental right deeply rooted in our nation history.we reiterate that not all rights of privacy or interests in nondisclosure of private information are of constitutional dimension,so as to require balancing government action against individual privacy.kallstrom city of columbus,cir analyzing the substantive due process rights of undercover police officers in not having their personal identifying information disclosed to criminal defendants.
we acknowledge,however,that the plaintiffs substantive due process claim presents a close question because the registry in fact discloses information about the plaintiffs that is not entirely accurate.as the district court noted in its opinion,e ven putting aside the parties arguments about the accurate definition of the word convicted,there remains a problem with michigan scheme the information published about plaintiffs would not otherwise be publicly available.these plaintiffs have not been convicted by a jury nor has a judge accepted their guilty pleas.instead,they have been sentenced,if that word is even applicable,to a form of a diversion program designed to punish youthful offenders who have been deemed unlikely to reoffend.the consideration offered by the state for the relinquishment of the plaintiffs sixth amendment rights is that at the conclusion of their youthful trainee status,the charges against them will be dismissed and their criminal records sealed.but the interaction of the sora and the hyta abrogates this agreement for youthful trainees charged with sex offenses prior to october.this does not rise to the level of a substantive due process violation based upon the relevant caselaw,but the inconsistency and the harms to the plaintiffs from their inclusion on the registry are troubling and noteworthy.
we evaluate statutes that do not implicate a plaintiff fundamental rights by utilizing a standard of review.lenscrafters,robinson,cir.specifically,we ask whether the statute at issue is rationally related to legitimate government interests.glucksberg,at.this standard is highly deferential courts hold statutes unconstitutional under this standard of review only in rare or exceptional circumstances.
michigan contends that its interest in the sora and the psor is to better assist law enforcement officers and the people of this state in preventing and protecting against the commission of future criminal sexual acts by convicted sex offenders.comp.laws a.the state further argues that the public has an interest in knowing the whereabouts of sex offenders that outweighs any privacy interest that plaintiffs have in their criminal records,home addresses and other public registration information.although we believe that the state justification sweeps too broadly,especially with reference to the plaintiffs in the present case,we are constrained to conclude that the rationale articulated in the statute itself satisfies the standard.
the plaintiffs next contend that the district court erred when it found that they did not meet the test for finding that michigan registration requirement infringed their liberty interests.as defined by the supreme court in paul davis,d,the test is used to analyze a due process claim where the action taken by the state injures the plaintiff reputation.the frequently drastic effect of the stigma which may result from defamation by the govern
