discussion 
the juvenile court decision in this case reflects a misapprehension of principles of juvenile dependency law,the rights of de facto parents and the procedures to be followed when the dependency court is presented with a section petition.we therefore summarize those principles,rights and procedures.
dependency proceedings are civil in nature,designed not to prosecute a parent,but to protect the child.in re mary d,quoted in in re malinda cal d,modified by statute on another ground as stated in in re lucero cal th.except where there is a contested issue of fact or law,the proceedings shall be conducted in an informal nonadversary atmosphere with a view to obtaining the maximum cooperation of the minor upon whose behalf the petition is brought and all persons interested in his or her welfare with any provisions that the court may make for the disposition and care of the minor,subd.a.dependency proceedings are adversarial in nature only insofar as the agency is advocating a position which,if successful,may result in depriving a parent of his or her constitutional right to parent.in re emilye th.

it is the express intent of the legislature that juvenile court records,in general,should be confidential.in re keisha th,quoting,subd.b.thus,section restricts access to the case file in a juvenile proceeding.that section lists persons entitled to inspect the file without a court order,and a smaller number of persons who are also entitled to receive copies of the file without a court order,subd.a,rule b.de facto parents are not listed,subd.a,but they have stand
