in miller alabama.miller,the united states supreme court ruled that under the eighth amendment to the united states constitution a state may authorize its courts to impose a sentence of life without parole on a juvenile homicide offender only when the penalty is discretionary and when the sentencing court discretion is properly exercised people gutierrez cal th,gutierrez.the proper exercise of discretion in this context requires the sentencing court to consider relevant evidence as may exist concerning factors that miller identified as bearing on the distinctive attributes of youth and how these attributes diminish the penological justifications for imposing the harshest sentences on juvenile offenders.miller,at.at see also gutierrez,at.
petitioner kristopher kirchner committed murder as a year old,for which he is serving a sentence of life without the possibility of parole hereinafter life without parole.the people have conceded that in imposing this sentence,the sentencing court did not give due consideration to the miller factors.the judgment in petitioner original criminal proceedings became final more than two decades ago,when petitioner did not pursue his appeal.through this proceeding for a writ of habeas corpus,petitioner seeks a resentencing hearing at which the court would properly integrate the miller factors into its sentencing calculus,potentially leading to a new sentence that would offer the possibility of parole.after the superior court granted habeas corpus relief,the court of appeal reversed.the court of appeal determined that the existence of a statutory mechanism,penal code section,subdivision d hereafter section d through which petitioner could seek recall of his sentence and resentencing to a term of life with the opportunity for parole,remedied any constitutional defect in petitioner sentence,and therefore precluded habeas corpus relief.
we hold that section d does not provide an adequate remedy at law for miller error,and that petitioner may obtain a miller resentencing as a form of habeas corpus relief.section d was not designed to address miller error,and its recall of sentence and resentencing procedure is not well suited to remedy the constitutional error of which petitioner complains.specifically,as a process designed to revisit lawful sentences of life without parole,section d limits the availability of resentencing under its terms,and the resentencing inquiry it prescribes does not necessarily account for the full array of miller factors in the manner that a proper resentencing under miller would.even though petitioner conceivably could avail himself of the section d process,we conclude that his claim of constitutional error need not be pursued,either exclusively or in the first instance,through this statutory scheme.because petitioner can not be required to exhaust the section d procedure prior to seeking habeas corpus relief from his sentence,let alone accept section d as his exclusive remedy,we reverse the judgment of the court of appeal.
factual and procedural background 
in april,petitioner and another juvenile robbed and murdered the owner of a gun store.petitioner beat the victim to death with a metal pipe.after being found unfit for juvenile court proceedings see welf.inst.code,petitioner was charged and tried as an adult.following a bench trial,petitioner was convicted of first degree murder,subd.a,robbery,and burglary.the court also found true enhancement allegations that petitioner personally used a deadly weapon former,subd.b and personally inflicted great bodily injury former,and the special circumstances that petitioner committed the murder while engaged in a burglary and a robbery,subd.a.
prior to sentencing,petitioner was found amenable to the treatment and training services offered by the california youth authority now the div.of juvenile justice.the referral report advised that petitioner has the physical and mental capacity to change and there is a reasonable possibility that petitioner likelihood to commit criminal behavior can be significantly reduced or eliminated within the confinement time or jurisdiction time available.the court declined to follow this recommendation in pronouncing sentence and described petitioner as a clear demonstration of a person whose life has turned to complete and ultimate violence.for the murder with its attendant allegations,the court sentenced petitioner to life without parole,plus one year for the weapon enhancement.the sentences for the robbery and burglary counts,with their associated enhancements,were stayed.
petitioner filed a notice of appeal,but he did not file an opening brief in the court of appeal.his appeal was therefore dismissed.
the present petition for writ of habeas corpus was filed in october.through this collateral proceeding,petitioner attacks his sentence of life without parole on the ground that it was imposed without appropriate consideration of the array of factors specified in miller,supra.petitioner seeks a resentencing hearing in which these factors will be properly taken into account,potentially leading to a new sentence that will incorporate an opportunity for parole.
following a review of the petition,the superior court issued an order to show cause.in a return to the order to show cause,the people acknowledged that the record does not show that the judge considered all the factors relating to petitioner youth as now required by miller and gutierrez.the people also conceded,at first,that petitioner was entitled to resentencing,but reserved the right to argue for reimposition of a sentence of life without parole at a new sentencing hearing.in a supplemental filing,however,the people objected that miller did not apply retroactively.the superior court rejected the people retroactivity argument,granted the petition for writ of habeas corpus,and remanded the matter to the trial court for resentencing.
the people appealed.after oral argument,the court of appeal requested and received supplemental briefing on the relationship between the section d recall of sentence and resentencing procedure and language in montgomery louisiana.montgomery providing that a state may remedy a miller violation by permitting juvenile homicide offenders to be considered for parole,rather than by resentencing them.citation.allowing those offenders to be considered for parole ensures that juveniles whose crimes reflected only transient immaturity and who have since matured will not be forced to serve a disproportionate sentence in violation of the eighth amendment.montgomery,at.at.
the court of appeal ensuing decision held that habeas corpus relief was unavailable to petitioner because section d provided an adequate remedy at law.it determined that where,as is the case in california,a legislature has provided inmates serving life sentences for crimes committed while they were juveniles with an opportunity to obtain a parole hearing,the state has remedied any constitutional defect in the inmate sentence.the court of appeal acknowledged that section,subdivision d does not provide an inmate with a parole hearing as a certain matter rather,the inmate must petition for recall of sentence and resentencing to engage a process that then might lead to a sentence that incorporates an opportunity for parole.nevertheless,the court of appeal determined that section d provides the inmate with all the rights set forth in miller and montgomery.
the court of appeal conceded that where a prisoner is serving a sentence of life without parole for a crime committed while he or she was a juvenile,and at the time of his or her sentence the trial judge failed to employ the procedures required by miller,his or her sentence is presumptively unlawful and he or she is entitled to relief from it.for this reason,it determined that a petition under section,subdivision d will meet the requirements of miller and montgomery,only if,at both the trial court review of the sufficiency of the petition citation and at any hearing ordered thereafter,the people bear the burden,as they would at any initial sentencing under miller and gutierrez,of showing that the defendant is one of the rare individuals for whom no possibility of parole should be provided.
we granted review 
ii.discussion 
in determining whether the court of appeal erred in casting section d as an adequate remedy at law that precludes habeas corpus relief for miller error,we first review the united states supreme court recent jurisprudence concerning sentences of life without parole for juvenile offenders.we then turn to section d and analyze that provision bearing upon habeas corpus proceedings that seek a proper resentencing under miller.
recent supreme court jurisprudence 
the eighth amendment to the united states constitution prohibits the infliction of cruel and unusual punishments,amend.the cruel and unusual standard is construed by reference to the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society to determine which punishments are so disproportionate as to be cruel and unusual.roper simmons,roper,quoting trop dulles,plur.opn.of warren.
some punishment is cruel and unusual as it pertains to juvenile offenders,even though the same sanction may not run afoul of the eighth amendment when applied to adults.in roper,supra,the united states supreme court determined that the eighth amendment categorically prohibited imposition of the death penalty on juvenile offenders.roper,at.in reaching this conclusion,the court observed that t hree general differences between juveniles under and adults demonstrate that juvenile offenders can not with reliability be classified among the worst offenders,at.first,a lack of maturity and an underdeveloped sense of responsibility are found in youth more often than in adults and are more understandable among the young.these qualities often result in impetuous and actions and decisions,quoting johnson texas.a second area of difference is that juveniles are more vulnerable or susceptible to negative influences and outside pressures,including peer pressure.ibid.and third,the character of a juvenile is not as well formed as that of an adult.the personality traits of juveniles are more transitory,less fixed,at.put together,these differences render suspect any conclusion that a juvenile falls among the worst offenders.the susceptibility of juveniles to immature and irresponsible behavior means their irresponsible conduct is not as morally reprehensible as that of an adult.citation.their own vulnerability and comparative lack of control over their immediate surroundings mean juveniles have a greater claim than adults to be forgiven for failing to escape negative influences in their whole environment.citation.the reality that juveniles still struggle to define their identity means it is less supportable to conclude that even a heinous crime committed by a juvenile is evidence of irretrievably depraved character.from a moral standpoint it would be misguided to equate the failings of a minor with those of an adult,for a greater possibility exists that a minor character deficiencies will be reformed.ibid.
after its decision in roper made juvenile offenders ineligible for the death penalty,the high court has on several occasions considered the relationship between the eighth amendment prohibition of cruel and unusual punishments and sentences of life without parole for this same class of defendants.in graham florida graham,the court held that the eighth amendment prohibits sentences of life without parole for juvenile offenders who have committed crimes other than homicides.the court reasoned that l ife without parole is an especially harsh punishment for a juvenile graham,at,and the imposition of such a sentence for a nonhomicide crime could not be justified by retribution,deterrence,incapacitation,or rehabilitation interests,at.although a state is not required to guarantee eventual freedom to a juvenile offender convicted of a nonhomicide crime,because t hose who commit truly horrifying crimes as juveniles may turn out to be irredeemable,the court held that the eighth amendment prohibits s tates from making the judgment at the outset that juvenile offenders convicted of nonhomicide crimes will never be fit to reenter society,at.therefore,the court directed that these defendants be provided some meaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.ibid.
two years later,in miller,supra,the court considered whether the eighth amendment prohibits sentencing schemes that mandate a life without parole sentence for all juvenile offenders convicted of a specific homicide offense.in finding these sentencing schemes unconstitutional,miller condemned them as impermissibly preclud ing a sentencer from taking account of an offender age and the wealth of characteristics and circumstances attendant to it,at.at.because the defendants in miller had been sentenced pursuant to mandatory sentencing laws,the court declined to address their alternative argument that the eighth amendment categorically prohibits sentences of life without parole for all juvenile offenders,or at least those years of age or younger at the time of their crimes,at.at.miller cautioned,however,that given all we have said about children diminished culpability and heightened capacity for change,we think appropriate occasions for sentencing juveniles to this harshest possible penalty will be uncommon.that is especially so because of the great difficulty of distinguishing at this early age between the juvenile offender whose crime reflects unfortunate yet transient immaturity,and the rare juvenile offender whose crime reflects irreparable corruption.citations.although we do not foreclose a sentencer ability to make that judgment in homicide cases,we require it to take into account how children are different,and how those differences counsel against irrevocably sentencing them to a lifetime in prison.ibid.
in its analysis,miller,supra.provided a recap of factors relevant to the imposition of a state harshest penalties upon a juvenile offender,at.at.these factors provide a framework for sentencing courts to take into account how children are different,and how those differences counsel against irrevocably sentencing them to a lifetime in prison,at.at.as we explained in gutierrez,supra,cal th,under miller a sentencing court considering a sentence of life without parole for a juvenile offender must consider evidence that may exist regarding a juvenile offender chronological age and its hallmark features among them,immaturity,impetuosity,and failure to appreciate risks and consequences the family and home environment that surrounds the juvenile and from which he can not usually extricate himself no matter how brutal or dysfunctional the circumstances of the homicide offense,including the extent of the juvenile defendant participation in the conduct and the way familial and peer pressures may have affected him whether the offender might have been charged and convicted of a lesser offense if not for incompetencies associated with youth for example,his inability to deal with police officers or prosecutors including on a plea agreement or his incapacity to assist his own attorneys and the possibility of rehabilitation,at,quoting miller,at.at.
most recently,in montgomery,supra,the court clarified that miller announced a substantive rather than a procedural rule,and therefore operates retroactively.montgomery,at.at.montgomery explained that miller did more than require a sentencer to consider a juvenile offender youth before imposing life without parole it established that the penological justifications for life without parole collapse in light of the distinctive attributes of youth.citation.even if a court considers a child age before sentencing him or her to a lifetime in prison,that sentence still violates the eighth amendment for a child whose crime reflects unfortunate yet transient immaturity.citation.because miller determined that sentencing a child to life without parole is excessive for all but the rare juvenile offender whose crime reflects irreparable corruption,citation,it rendered life without parole an unconstitutional penalty for a class of defendants because of their status that is,juvenile offenders whose crimes reflect the transient immaturity of youth.citation.as a result,miller announced a substantive rule of constitutional law.like other substantive rules,miller is retroactive because it necessarily carr ies a significant risk that a defendant here,the vast majority of juvenile offenders faces a punishment that the law can not impose on him.citation.montgomery,at.at.
senate bill reg.sess,the measure that added subdivision d to section,was introduced in the legislature after graham,but before miller.like graham,supra,miller,supra,and montgomery,supra,section d was inspired by concerns regarding sentences of life without parole for juvenile offenders.see assem.com.on appropriations,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended.
as enacted,section d provides an avenue for juvenile offenders serving terms of life without parole to seek recall of their sentences and resentencing to a term that includes an opportunity for parole this process is unavailable to a defendant sentenced to life without parole where it was pleaded and proved that the defendant tortured his or her victim,or that the victim was a public safety official,another law enforcement officer,or a firefighter,subd.d a ii.an eligible defendant may file a petition requesting recall and resentencing with the sentencing court after having been incarcerated for at least years,subd.d a i.in this petition,the defendant must describe his or her remorse,relate his or her work toward rehabilitation,and state that a qualifying circumstance is true,subd.d b.if the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that one or more of the qualifying circumstances in the petition are true,the court must recall the defendant sentence and hold a hearing to resentence the defendant,subd.d e.
during this hearing,in deciding whether to resentence the defendant to a term of imprisonment with the possibility of parole the court may consider factors that include,but are not limited to,the following i the defendant was convicted pursuant to felony murder or aiding and abetting murder provisions of law.ii the defendant does not have juvenile felony adjudications for assault or other felony crimes with a significant potential for personal harm to victims prior to the offense for which the defendant was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole.iii the defendant committed the offense with at least one adult codefendant.iv prior to the offense for which the defendant was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole,the defendant had insufficient adult support or supervision and had suffered from psychological or physical trauma,or significant stress.v the defendant suffers from cognitive limitations due to mental illness,developmental disabilities,or other factors that did not constitute a defense,but influenced the defendant involvement in the offense.vi the defendant has performed acts that tend to indicate rehabilitation or the potential for rehabilitation,including,but not limited to,availing himself or herself of rehabilitative,educational,or vocational programs,if those programs have been available at his or her classification level and facility,using for,or showing evidence of remorse.vii the defendant has maintained family ties or connections with others through letter writing,calls,or visits,or has eliminated contact with individuals outside of prison who are currently involved with crime.viii the defendant has had no disciplinary actions for violent activities in the last five years in which the defendant was determined to be the aggressor,subd.d f.in addition,the court may consider any other criteria that the court deems relevant to its decision,so long as the court identifies them on the record,provides a statement of reasons for adopting them,and states why the defendant does or does not satisfy the criteria,subd.d i.
upon conducting this assessment,the court shall have the discretion to resentence the defendant in the same manner as if the defendant had not previously been sentenced,provided that the new sentence,if any,is not greater than the initial sentence,subd.d g.if the defendant first section d petition does not result in resentencing to a term of imprisonment with the possibility of parole,he or she may apply again for section d relief after having been committed to custody for at least years,subd.d h.a defendant may file a third petition after serving years of his or her sentence of life without parole.ibid.
this court has had one prior opportunity to consider the intersection of the eighth amendment,sentences of life without parole for juvenile offenders,and section d.in gutierrez,supra,cal th,we construed section,subdivision b,which provides that the penalty for special circumstance murder,when committed by a or year old,shall be confinement in the state prison for life without the possibility of parole or,at the discretion of the court,years to life,subd.b.both defendants in gutierrez had been convicted of special circumstance murder for crimes committed as juveniles,and sentenced to life without parole under section,subdivision b.gutierrez,at.on appeal,they argued that their sentences had been skewed by a presumption read into section,subdivision b by the courts of appeal,people guinn th and trial courts that life without parole was the appropriate penalty for juvenile offenders convicted of special circumstance murder.gutierrez,at.
in addressing this argument,gutierrez,supra,cal th,considered and rejected the people contention that the section d process eliminated the constitutional concerns that otherwise might be associated with reading a presumption in favor of a life without parole sentence into section,subdivision b we explained that n either miller nor graham indicated that an opportunity to recall a sentence of life without parole to years into the future would somehow make more reliable or justifiable the imposition of that sentence and its underlying judgment of the offender incorrigibility at the outset.gutierrez,supra,cal th at,quoting graham,supra,at.we also observed that the high court in graham explained that a juvenile offender subsequent failure to rehabilitate while serving a sentence of life without parole can not retroactively justify imposition of the sentence in the first instance by the same logic,it is doubtful that the potential to recall a life without parole sentence based on a future demonstration of rehabilitation can make such a sentence any more valid when it was imposed.if anything,a decision to recall the sentence pursuant to section d is a recognition that the initial judgment of incorrigibility underlying the imposition of life without parole turned out to be erroneous.gutierrez,at.
the court of appeal below acknowledged gutierrez determination that the prospect of resentencing under section d represents an inadequate response to the concerns implicated by a court failure to properly integrate the miller factors into its initial sentencing decision.the court of appeal regarded the present matter as distinguishable,however,in that it involves a collateral challenge to a sentence,rather than a direct appeal.the court of appeal determined that a different rule should apply in this context,whereby the existence of an adequate remedy at law will displace habeas corpus proceedings targeting miller error.we consider this position next.
habeas corpus proceedings and section d 
habeas corpus is an extraordinary remedy.citation.in re clark cal th,fn.as a general rule,it may not be invoked where the accused has such a remedy under the orderly provisions of a statute designed to rule the specific case upon which he relies for relief in re alpine cal,at least when the remedy at law is well suited,in ordinary circumstances,to enforc e or vindicate the right being asserted in re gandolfo cal d.see also witkin epstein,cal.criminal law ed.criminal writs,habeas corpus is not a proper remedy to review errors that could be raised on appeal or by other appropriate remedies,and ordinarily the aggrieved party must exhaust those remedies.
the court of appeal applied these principles to this matter it construed section d as a constitutionally adequate remedy for miller error,so t
