seven years after appellant marjorie the guardian or marjorie was appointed guardian of her two granddaughters,and the minors,the trial court granted a petition to terminate the guardianship filed by the minors parents,respondents jennifer and richard,the parents,or jennifer and richard,following a minutes long hearing in which no evidence was introduced,no witness testimony was taken,and no arguments from counsel were heard.such a truncated process deprived the guardian of any meaningful hearing or opportunity to object to the petition,and prevented the court from fully considering whether termination was in the best interests of the minors the paramount concern in cases of this nature.we therefore reverse the order terminating the guardianship and remand for an evidentiary hearing before a different judge to consider whether termination is in the minors best interests.we express no opinion on the merits of the petition itself.
facts and proceedings 
family history 
the parents have had a tumultuous relationship fraught with drug abuse,domestic violence,financial hardship,and criminal convictions.they began dating around following jennifer divorce from her first husband who supplied her with drugs.jennifer was convicted of prostitution in and theft in,and richard was convicted for failure to appear on a written promise in.
the parents married in and have four children together.the oldest,was born in june.a son,followed in may.was born next in july.their fourth child,was born in july.
as noted,the parents have a lengthy history of drug abuse.jennifer began using methamphetamine when she was.she continued abusing the drug for approximately years,and evidence in the record suggests she used drugs while pregnant with.after achieving what turned out to be temporary sobriety around the age of,she relapsed in,a year before filing the petition to terminate the guardianship.richard also began using methamphetamine as a teen.he abused the drug for over years,from the age of until approximately the age of when he enlisted in the army in.
child protective services cps received at least referrals regarding the parents,four of which were substantiated for an absent or incapacitated caretaker,substantial risk or general neglect.to avoid having and removed by cps in august,richard asked his stepsister,shannon,to care for the children.shannon lived with her minor children in a house on the property of richard,richard father and her stepfather.in early,returned to live with the parents but remained with shannon.in january,richard asked shannon to care for and also for,who had since been born.because she was already caring for her own children and,shannon declined.richard and jennifer then approached marjorie,richard mother,for help with the minors since richard had lost his job and they were losing their home.
guardianship of the minors 
with the parents consent,marjorie petitioned the sacramento county superior court for guardianship of and among other things,the parents drug use and financial difficulties were cited as bases for the guardianship.the court granted the petition in august.in a separate case,richard,petitioned for and was granted guardianship of 
living arrangements 
throughout the guardianship,the minors periodically lived with the parents.beginning in january,moved to kentucky where richard was stationed in the army to live with the parents.because jennifer was pregnant with at the time,the guardian and the parents agreed would stay with her until birth.was born with severe health issues so the guardian and the parents agreed would remain in california with her until his health issues improved.eventually moved to kentucky with her parents around august.richard was then transferred to virginia and the parents,the minors,and relocated remained in california with richard,and shannon,and did not join the rest of the family in virginia until approximately january.
in february,richard was deployed to afghanistan.during his deployment,jennifer and the children moved into a house on richard,property in california.while the parents maintain that jennifer cared for the children during this time,shannon claims she was the children primary between february and march because jennifer was abusing prescription and illegal drugs and had difficulty caring for the children.
richard returned from afghanistan in late february.upon his return,he discovered jennifer had been having a sexual relationship with an who was a drug dealer.the parents got into a domestic dispute over the affair and jennifer assaulted richard.jennifer also inexplicably injured her foot that same day,although the parents deny the injury was related to domestic abuse.the next day,richard stepmother reported the incident to police,and jennifer was arrested for domestic violence.jennifer was jailed for a few days,but the charges ultimately were dismissed.
due to a restraining order obtained by richard or his family members,jennifer did not return to the property after being released from jail and her whereabouts were unknown.jennifer later admitted to staying with her,with whom she had had the affair,and using methamphetamine at least twice while with him.after jennifer left,shannon found a methamphetamine pipe in jennifer room and indicating jennifer had allowed to spend time with her and the.
a few days after jennifer arrest,richard returned to his army duties in virginia and left all four children in california with his family.prior to leaving,he helped his father obtain guardianship of thus,as of march,the minors and their two siblings lived with shannon on richard,property without either jennifer or richard and all four children were under guardianship at that time.the guardian consented to the arrangement in order to keep all the siblings together and because the children were thriving under shannon care.
several months later,jennifer and richard reconciled.according to the parents,richard family was displeased with the reconciliation and made it difficult to have regular contact with the children.from march to may,richard saw the children once at christmas.jennifer did not see them at all.the parents,however,did speak with the children over the phone.
petition to terminate guardianship 
in may,the parents petitioned the court to terminate guardianship of the minors.the parents each submitted declarations supporting the petition together with letters from friends and parenting and anger management class certificates for jennifer.neither declaration mentioned their history of drug use nor jennifer drug relapse in they described jennifer extramarital affair with her who dealt drugs as a friendship and characterized their physical altercation after richard discovered the affair as a simple slap.
a probate court investigator interviewed the parents,the minors,the guardian,richard,and shannon in connection with the petition.citing,among other things,the parents history of domestic violence and jennifer recent drug relapse,which she failed to mention in her declaration,the investigator did not support terminating the guardianship.the investigator expressed serious concerns about separating the minors from their siblings and removing them from a familiar environment where they had been living for the past two years.the investigator report specifically stated the minors guardian and richard,the guardian of the minors siblings,objected to terminating the guardianship of and.the investigator recommended the court order mediation or set the matter for trial.
the guardian and shannon each filed declarations opposing the petition.the declarations generally discussed the circumstances giving rise to the guardianship,the parents volatile relationship and drug use,and unsuccessful efforts to reunite the family.the guardian believed it was in the minors best interest to remain in california with their siblings and shannon because the children were thriving in that environment.
in november,the court appointed an attorney for the minors and continued the hearing on the petition to february.shortly after being appointed,the minors counsel interviewed the parents,spoke with the guardian,and met with the minors.although the minors had not seen their parents in nearly two years and unbeknownst to the guardian,the minors attorney arranged to have the parents meet with the girls at her office without the guardian or a family therapist present.based on these interviews,the attorney for the minors recommended suspending the guardianship and immediately returning the minors to the parents subject to a status review as well as other terms and conditions.although the minors attorney met with the parties in november,she did not file or serve her report until june.
at the continued hearing in february,the court ordered the department of social services in virginia or the military equivalent to conduct a home study of the parents home and to file a written report detailing its findings prior to the next scheduled hearing in june.although not clear from the record,it appears the minors counsel was given the task of requesting the virginia home study.the court also ordered jennifer to undergo monthly drug testing,to submit the results prior to the june hearing,and further ordered the parties to mediation.
the parties mediated the dispute in march.a court mediator met with the parents,the guardian,and the minors but refused shannon request,as the minors caregiver,to participate in the mediation.the mediator also did not interview richard,even though the minors had been living on his property for the previous two years.the mediator recommended terminating the guardianship and believed richard family was unnecessarily restricting the parents access to the minors.
while the mediation occurred in early march,the mediator did not complete her report until may,six days before the june hearing on the petition.the guardian counsel did not actually receive a copy of the mediation report until june,three days before the scheduled hearing.similarly,on june the guardian counsel received a copy of the minors counsel report recommending the guardianship be suspended and the children immediately be returned to their parents custody.because the reports were served only three days before the hearing,the guardian counsel requested that opposing counsel stipulate to continue the hearing to allow the guardian time to respond to the newly filed reports.after initially agreeing to a continuance,the parents counsel later refused to stipulate as did the minor counsel.
hearing on the petition to terminate guardianship 
on june,the day of the hearing,the court called the matter a few minutes after.the guardian was waiting in the hallway for her counsel,who was running late due to a traffic accident.before the minors counsel could even make it to counsel table to state her appearance,and without receiving any evidence or hearing any witness testimony,the court announced it was terminating the guardianship.it did so even though the virginia state department of social services never conducted a home study of the parents home as previously ordered by the court.
the minors counsel then verified the court was terminating rather than suspending the guardianship.after confirming he was terminating the guardianship,the court asked if there were any objections.despite the previous written objections from the guardian,shannon,and the court investigator,the court terminated the guardianship when neither the minors counsel nor the parents counsel objected.
the guardian counsel arrived a few minutes later without a suit jacket.he persuaded the judge to recall the matter and asked for a continuance and an opportunity to respond to the newly filed reports.the court questioned what,if anything,the guardian counsel could say to change his mind.in response,counsel stated that neither the mediator nor the minors counsel had spoken with shannon or richard,the minors primary caretakers,and that the court investigator,who did speak with them,recommended against terminating the guardianship.
the court ultimately denied the request for a continuance and an opportunity to respond to the reports,stating that had counsel really been prepared he would have worn a suit jacket.besides relieving minors counsel and ordering richard to pay a assessment,the order terminating the guardianship states only that the petition is granted it contains no factual findings that the termination is in the minors best interest nor does it impose any of the conditions recommended by the mediator or the minors counsel.the minors were immediately transferred to their parents custody and moved to virginia.
motion to set aside order terminating guardianship 
both the guardian and shannon filed ex parte motions to set aside the order terminating the guardianship.the motions were denied on an ex parte basis and were set for hearing on august.because her deadline for appealing would have expired prior to receiving a ruling on the motion to set aside the order,the guardian filed a timely notice of appeal.in light of the appeal,the trial court stayed the motions without ruling on the merits.
in august,we denied the guardian petition for a writ of supersedeas,but later granted her motion for calendar preference.we received no response from the parents following the filing of the guardian opening brief on the merits.
discussion 
requires an evidentiary hearing prior to terminating a probate guardianship 
the guardian contends the trial court was required to conduct a full evidentiary hearing before terminating the guardianship and awarding custody of the minors to the parents.we agree.
probate code section governs the termination of probate guardianships,further undesignated section references are to the probate code.section provides,upon petition of the guardian,a parent,the ward,or,in the case of an indian child custody proceeding,an indian custodian or the ward tribe,the court may make an order terminating the guardianship if the court determines that it is in the ward best interest to terminate the guardianship.notice of the hearing on the petition shall be given for the period and in the manner provided in chapter commencing with section of part.
the current appeal requires us to construe the language of section.we must decide whether the term hearing as used in the statute necessarily encompasses a judicial proceeding where the parties are afforded an adequate opportunity to present evidence on disputed factual issues before the court decides whether to terminate a probate guardianship based on such evidence.we conclude that it does.

although section refers to a hearing on the petition,the statute does not explicitly define the meaning of the word hearing.some courts have recognized that the term is generally understood to be a proceeding where evidence is taken to the end of determining an issue of fact and a decision made on the basis of that evidence.see,people pennington cal d,reversal required where defendant erroneously denied full hearing on sanity issue under penal code section pennington people ivenditti d,hearing under welfare and institutions code section et took place even though counsel dispensed with calli
