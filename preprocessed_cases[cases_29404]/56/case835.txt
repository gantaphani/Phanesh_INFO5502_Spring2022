hector jose barillas melgar hector appeals from the termination of his parental rights under family code sections and,and the denial of his motion for a new trial he contends the judgment is void,and a new trial should have been granted,because the trial court failed to consider a report from family court services,subd.d,interview the oldest of the minor children,and consider whether to appoint independent counsel for the children the court erred in deciding that section,subdivision b,precluded it from granting a new trial and the court erred in ruling that hector abandoned his children within the meaning of section.
in the published portion of this opinion,we conclude that the trial court did not comply with its statutory obligations to protect the best interests of the children under sections,and.in the unpublished portion,we hold that substantial evidence supported the trial court conclusion that hector abandoned the children.accordingly,we will vacate the judgment and remand the matter to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
facts and procedural history 
hector and respondent irina neumann irina met in germany in or and moved to the united states in.they never married,but are the parents of two children,and,born in august and april respectively.
as will be further described post,irina obtained a domestic violence restraining order against hector in november.he thereupon vacated the family residence,and by the end of had both visitation rights and child support obligations.later,while hector was jailed for violation of the restraining order,irina and the children moved.after locating them in,hector sought modification of the visitation order in april.the court referred the parties to family court services fcs for an extended evaluation in july.the following month,irina filed a petition to declare the minors free from hector parental custody and control,and to terminate his parental rights,on the ground he abandoned them by failing to provide support or communicate with them for over a year.see.trial on the petition occurred on november,and december.
a.the trial 
irina testimony 
irina testified that hector acted violently toward her on a number of occasions.while she was pregnant,hector slapped her on the head with a shoe.another time,he hit irina on the head while she held her baby.hector also regularly threw things at irina while she was nursing or holding the baby,and many times struck her with a closed fist and threatened to kill her.several police reports recorded hector violent episodes.
in november,irina obtained a domestic violence temporary restraining order against hector,and hector moved out of their redwood city home.an order entered in december required hector to pay per month in child support and granted him visitation rights.a restraining order issued in march required that he remain at least yards from irina,the residence,her work,and the children school,but granted him joint legal custody of the children and visitation rights.
nevertheless,hector violated the restraining order on several occasions,breaking into the house in the middle of the night,chasing irina with his car,cutting the telephone line,and threatening to kill her.he also failed to adhere to the visitation schedule.as a result,irina and hector returned to mediation with fcs in july at irina request.they reached an agreement which called for visitation exchanges of the children to take place at the redwood city visitation center.the fcs document recording the agreement states both parents shall immediately go there the visitation center to register.this agreement was apparently not reduced to a court order.
irina promptly registered with the visitation center in july,and thereafter checked in with the center periodically.she was advised that hector had not registered.hector also failed to comply with the visitation schedule.
on october,hector was arrested at the redwood city house following an altercation with irina boyfriend and later husband,garilov.as described below,hector was incarcerated for the offense in june,served about three months in county jail and several weeks in immigration custody,and was then released in october.
after hector incarceration commenced,irina continued to live with the children at the redwood city residence,with the same telephone number,until the end of summer.at that point she moved to a small house behind a church.in february,she married garilov and they moved with the children to fremont.on february,she apprised the visitation center of her new address.father vladimir,at the russian church she attended,was aware of her whereabouts,and the children were openly enrolled in fremont public schools.irina again contacted the visitation center in june,and was told that hector still had not registered.
according to irina,she last received a child support payment from hector in july or october.the children had not received cards,letters,or calls from hector since july.hector last visited the children in accord with the visitation schedule in july,although he saw them on occasion thereafter but no later than october.
probation officer ojeda testimony 
raymond ojeda was hector probation officer with respect to his october violation of the restraining order and assault on garilov.in that capacity,ojeda wrote to the victims irina and garilov around august,at irina redwood city address,but received no response.he first met hector in november after hector was released from custody.as part of his probation orientation,ojeda instructed hector not to contact irina or garilov,since there was a no contact order with the victims in the case.
ojeda and hector first discussed hector children on december.ojeda advised his probationer twice to contact his attorney to establish visitation rights,and the second time specifically directed him to have his attorney contact irina hector failed to initiate the proceeding to modify visitation until april.
hector testimony 
despite the july agreement,hector admitted that he never registered with the visitation center or even contacted them.
hector testified that he last saw the children the day before he was arrested on october.although released on bail following his arrest,he did not attempt to contact irina or the children during the pendency of the criminal matter through may because,in his words,i was ordered not to do it.hector conceded he was never actually ordered not to contact the children but said he did not contact the children because i was traumatized that if i do anything even to see my children it could get me in trouble by she saying that i follow her or do something.
in june,hector began serving his jail sentence for violating the restraining order,he remained in custody for weeks.the immigration service then placed hector in custody for an additional six weeks,ultimately releasing him in october.according to hector,he did not communicate with his sons while incarcerated because i did want to give any chance to more misunderstanding.like i send any letter,i could be accused.i did want to take a chance like that.
upon his release in october,hector learned from a neighbor of irina former redwood city residence that she and the children had moved.the next month,he went to the department of motor vehicles to find out where irina was living,but was informed that information was confidential.he then requested their address from his insurance company,but was told the information was confidential since he was no longer living with irina.in the beginning of,hector inquired of fcs to no avail,and learned he could not initiate a proceeding to visit his children without their address.on a friend suggestion,he next went to the child support division of the district attorney office,where he was informed that irina had closed the case and they could not provide him further information.about a month later,hector contacted a private investigator to try to locate his children,but he did have the funds to pay him for the amount of money.
hector claimed he never gave up looking for his children.he asked ojeda and lewis guich who led his domestic violence classes what he could do to locate his children he also asked his fianc√©e for assistance.in and,hector used internet services to search for them,but the services could find the kids even in school records or on anything like that.in december,he located an investigator on the internet who was able to discover the address,whereupon he contacted an attorney to begin the process of seeing his children again.hector order to show cause was filed in april.
hector testified he was very sad and frustrated that he could not see his children for so long,he loved them very much,and they loved him a lot.he wanted to be there for his children for help and support and help them to be successful persons in life.
in response to questioning from the court,hector conceded he knew that irina attended a russian orthodox church,but never contacted the priest who was present in the courtroom to discover her location because he did think that she was there.hector further claimed he did not look for irina or his children through the family visitation center,because fcs advised that the earlier visitation agreements had no effect after he went into custody.
hector acknowledged making no child support payments between october and october,even though,during that period,he had not yet learned that irina had moved.by way of excuse,he claimed he lost his job before going into custody in june.he made no child support payments after learning where irina lived in december,because he thought she would move away and he would not find her again.
kimberly payne testimony 
kimberly payne had known hector for about four years and was aware he had been searching for his children.she assisted hector by looking in school directories in san mateo county and santa clara county and using private investigators on the internet.
decision and judgment 
the trial court found that hector failed to provide support and communicate with his two sons for greater than the statutory period.as set forth in section,this created a rebuttable presumption that he intended to abandon the children.hector failed to rebut the presumption,the court concluded,because he made no efforts to support or communicate with them,his efforts were so minimal to be so insignificant to this court,he made no attempt to communicate with someone known to irina and he made no efforts even to contact the visitation center.further,the court pointed out,irina was believable and credible and given any dispute between her testimony and that of hector,the court adopts her testimony.
finding without explanation that it was in the best interest of the children,the court by written judgment declared the children free from hector custody and control and terminated hector parental rights.judgment was entered on february.
hector motion for new trial or modification 
hector obtained different trial counsel.on march,his new attorney filed a motion for a new trial or,alternatively,to modify the judgment.hector asserted the court had erroneously interpreted the term abandonment in section failed to consider a report of the fcs evaluator,in violation of section,subdivision d failed to interview the oldest child,who at the time was age,under section and failed to appoint independent counsel for the children under section.
the hearing on the motion began on april.at that time,the court found there was no basis for a new trial on the ground of the sufficiency of the evidence declared that the issue of appointing counsel for the children rested in the court discretion under section,and hector waived the issue by not raising it before or during trial sought briefing on whether hector also waived section interview of child and section,subdivision d review of evaluator report,as he did not raise those issues at trial either and sought further briefing on whether section,subdivision b,which ostensibly bars modification of a judgment declaring the child free from parental custody and control,prohibited the court from considering the evaluation report and interviewing the child.irina counsel indicated she would not object to the matter being reopened for the limited purpose of considering the evaluator report and interviewing the child,but the court declined to do so.
the hearing reconvened on may,at which time hector motion was denied on the ground the requested relief was precluded by section,subdivision b.
on june,hector appealed from the judgment 
ii.discussion 
as mentioned,hector contends the judgment is void and a new trial should have been granted because the court did not consider the evaluator report,interview the oldest minor child,or appoint counsel for the children the court erred in concluding that section,subdivision b,barred it from granting a new trial or modifying the judgment and the court erred in finding that he abandoned the children.irina responds that hector failed to raise these arguments during the trial,section,subdivision b,precluded a new trial as a matter of law,and the purported errors do not compel reversal in any event.
to orient the reader,we begin with a brief overview of the relevant statutory scheme.we next consider the procedural issues raised by irina,and then conclude with an analysis of the trial court failure to comply with its statutory obligations.
statutory background 
upon enumerated statutory grounds,an interested party may file a petition for the purpose of having a minor child declared free from the custody and control of either or both parents.one basis for declaring a child free from parental custody and control,pursuant to section,is abandonment by the parent a a proceeding under this part may be brought where the child has been left by one parent in the care and custody of the other parent for a period of one year without any provision for the child support,or without communication from the parent or parents,with the intent on the part of the parent or parents to abandon the child.b the failure to provide support,or failure to communicate is presumptive evidence of the intent to abandon.if the parent or parents have made only token efforts to support or communicate with the child,the court may declare the child abandoned by the parent or parents.when a child is declared free from parental custody and control,the parent rights and responsibilities are terminated with respect to the child.
statutes authorizing an action to free a child from parental custody and control are intended foremost to protect the child.in re sherman d.typically,such statutes are invoked for the purpose of terminating the rights of one or more biological parent,so the child may be adopted into a stable home environment.see the purpose of this part is to serve the welfare and best interest of a child by providing the stability and security of an adoptive home when those conditions are otherwise missing from the child life.in re daniel th,d daniel.in any event,the best interests of the child are paramount in interpreting and implementing the statutory scheme.see daniel,supra,at,d.indeed,our legislature has declared that the statutory scheme shall be liberally construed to serve and protect the interests and welfare of the child.it further directs that the trial court shall consider the wishes of the child,bearing in mind the age of the child,and shall act in the best interest of the child,italics added.
we recognize,as well,that t he relationship of a natural parent to his child is a vital human relationship,with implications for the child growth and development.in re d.we therefore view the involuntary termination of parental rights as a drastic remedy which should be resorted to only in extreme cases of neglect or abandonment.ibid.in light of these weighty concerns,proof of abandonment must be established by clear and convincing evidence.in re heidi d.heidi.with these principles in mind,we next turn to the issues presented on appeal.
substantial evidence of abandonment 
potential impediments to review or relief 
irina maintains that hector is precluded from now raising the court failure to consider the evaluator report,interview the oldest child,and appoint independent legal counsel,because he did not raise these issues during trial.we examine this argument as it relates both to hector appeal from the judgment and his appeal from the denial of the new trial motion.we then consider whether,as the trial court concluded,section,subdivision b,barred a new trial or modification of the judgment.
waiver with respect to appeal from judgment 
during trial,hector did not offer the evaluator report into evidence or request its consideration.nor did he ask the court to interview the oldest child,or request that the court consider appointing independent counsel for the children.and,he did not assert during trial that the court failure to do these things constituted error.issues not raised at trial usually will not be considered on appeal.in re aaron th,d father failure to raise inadequacy of social worker report in proceeding terminating his parental rights heidi,supra,d at.order terminating parental rights not vacated on grounds that the trial court had failed to ascertain the children express desires and appoint them counsel,where mother had not raised the issues in the trial court.
hector contends the court omissions rendered the judgment void,presumably because a void judgment may be attacked at any time,without regard to principles of waiver or estoppel.a judgment is void,however,only if the court rendering it lacked subject matter jurisdiction or jurisdiction over the parties.in re andres th,d.that was not the case here.instead,a court failure to follow proper procedure results in an act in excess of its jurisdiction in a broader sense,such that the judgment remains valid but voidable,and the parties may be precluded from setting it aside by waiver or estoppel.ibid.whether waiver or estoppel will actually be applied turns largely on the degree of the procedural irregularity and whether the court act violated a comprehensive statutory scheme or offended public policy.id.at,d.
in the matter before us,the procedural protections ignored by the trial evaluator report,an interview of the child,and deciding whether to appoint independent all calculated to promote the best interests of the affected children.this not only reflects a substantial public interest,it pertains to the paramount concern of the entire proceeding.see.under these circumstances,we would not apply the principles of waiver or estoppel hector failure to remind the court of its statutory obligations to the children should not be permitted to frustrate the legislature aim of protecting the children best interests.furthermore,we have discretion to review a question of law,even if not raised in the trial court,where the underlying facts are undisputed and the matter is of public importance.we choose to exercise that discretion in light of the important concerns involved,and conclude that hector is not barred from asserting these matters in his appeal from the judgment.
waiver with respect to appeal from denial of new trial motion 
as we have pointed out,hector appeals not only from the judgment,but also from the denial of his new trial motion.because his new trial motion did raise the issues of the evaluator report,the interview with the child,and the appointment of counsel,hector did not waive his right to challenge the denial of the new trial motion on these grounds.
jurisdiction to grant new trial 
we next address irina argument,and the trial court ruling,that the court lacked jurisdiction to grant the new trial motion or modify the judgment.the court denied hector new trial motion on the ground that section,subdivision b,precluded it from modifying the order and judgment.hector claims this was error,and we agree 
section provides a an order and judgment of the court declaring a child free from the custody and control of a parent or parents under this part is conclusive and binding upon the child,upon the parent or parents,and upon all other persons who have been served with citations by publication or otherwise as provided in this part.b after making the order and judgment,the court has no power to set aside,change,or modify it.c nothing in this section limits the right to appeal from the order and judgment.italics added.
the judgment declaring the children free from hector custody and control was entered on february.if we were to look solely at the language of section,subdivision b,it would appear that from then on the trial court was without jurisdiction to modify the judgment.however,when we apply fundamental precepts of statutory construction and consider section as a whole,we discover a logical and reasonable interpretation that countenances the entirety of section,promotes the interests of expediency and finality in child custody matters,and permits trial court correction of errors in instances such as these.
in morrow,supra,d,the appellate court examined whether civil code section predecessor to section precluded a motion for a new trial,because,if it did,appellant new trial motion had not extended the deadline for filing the notice of appeal and the appeal was untimely.ultimately,the court did not decide the issue,concluding the petitioner was estopped from asserting it by failing to raise it earlier.morrow,supra,at.nevertheless,the court observed it is arguable that civil code section refers to setting aside,changing or modifying an ordered judgment which has become final that it is not intended to prohibit the which may generally be conducted under section or section of the code of civil procedure before a judgment or order is final and that the provisions of section were merely inserted out of an abundance of caution to distinguish the continuing jurisdiction over custody which generally marks proceedings for dissolution of marriage.morrow,supra,at,italics added.
we agree with this observation,particularly in light of the balance of section.see daniel,supra,th at,d statute must be construed in context and with effect to every word or phrase of the statute.in particular,section,subdivision c,reads nothing in this section limits the right to appeal from the order and judgment.since the legislature has deemed it appropriate for the trial court decision to be appealed within the appeal period,we see no reason the trial court should not be able to correct any errors on its own,upon motion timely brought within that same period,before the judgment becomes final.we are cognizant,of course,that matters pertaining to the custody of children should be resolved with expediency and finality,and the filing and adjudication of a new trial motion could delay the time for an appeal.see,in re clarissa th,d clarissa.but it is also true that the opportunity for the trial court to correct errors in response to a timely motion could obviate the need for an appeal,and thus significantly reduce the time before the judgment becomes final.
in addition,there are recognized exceptions to the preclusive language of section,subdivision b.in in re olivia d.olivia,the mother had successfully petitioned to terminate the father parental rights,at the father request,because he could not pay the support payments.in obtaining this judgment,however,the mother had failed to inform the court that she was receiving welfare and had therefore assigned her rights to child support to the county,and had failed as well to notify the county of the proceeding.the trial court vacated the judgment,and the court of appeal affirmed,notwithstanding civil code section predecessor to section,on the grounds that civil code section applied only to persons who have been served with a citation to appear at the hearing,and the county was not served neither the juvenile probation department nor the county had investigated the minor and the circumstances alleged in the petition and the mother had perpetrated a fraud on the court,and the court always retains the power to vacate a judgment obtained through fraud.olivia,supra,at.olivia thus suggests that,at least in combination with other infirmities,the failure to investigate and report on the best interests of the child can be addressed postjudgment,notwithstanding section,subdivision b.
as applied to the present case,the court failure to consider the evaluator report left the children in virtually the same position as if the investigation had never occurred or the report had not been prepared.this error,in combination with the other errors hector alleged in his new trial motion,was appropriate for the trial court postjudgment consideration.see also adoption of michael d.noting,albeit without a discussion of,subd.b,that trial counsel had failed to request a new trial in a proceeding to terminate parental rights.
clarissa,supra,th,d,on which the trial court in this matter relied,is not to the contrary.there,the stepfather filed a petition to declare the children free from the custody and control of their biological father.the biological father failed to appear at the hearing,and the court granted the petition.a few days later,the biological father requested a new hearing,claiming he missed the hearing by mistake.the trial court denied the request,pursuant to section,subdivision b.the biological father appealed,arguing he could obtain relief from the default in the appellate court,based on the assumption that section,subdivision b,precluded such relief in the trial court.the court of appeal disagreed,concluding that the appellate review permitted by section,subdivision c,is limited to the merits,and the court of appeal should not be able to reverse on the ground of a default under section,subdivision c,where the trial court is precluded from doing so under section,subdivision b.clarissa,supra,at,d.consequently,the court in clarissa addressed the scope of appellate review based on the assumption that section,subdivision b,barred relief for a default.it did not examine the application of section,subdivision b,where the trial court was called upon to rectify its own critical legal or procedural errors before the judgment became final.
also distinguishable are the cases underlying the clarissa opinion.clarissa relied most prominently on in re issac th,d issac.in issac,the trial court had terminated a father parental rights.after the father appeal was dismissed as untimely,he requested habeas corpus relief.in dictum,the appellate court stated in a footnote that under section t he trial court has no power to entertain a motion for new trial after a judgment freeing a minor from his parent custody issac,supra,at,fn,d.for this proposition,the court in issac cited in re manuel d,which held that the trial court had no jurisdiction to consider a motion to set aside a default judgment that had been entered approximately six months earlier.neither issac nor manuel stands for the proposition that a trial court may not correct its own errors before a judgment terminating parental rights has become final.
we hold that section,subdivision b,does not preclude the trial court from granting a timely new trial motion where,as alleged here,the court has committed several legal errors in violation of statutory provisions designed to protect the best interests of the child.we now turn to the significance of those errors.
errors at trial 
the trial court failed to consider the evaluator report,interview the oldest minor child,and consider whether to appoint independent legal counsel for the children.we address each in turn.
consideration of evaluator report section,subd.d 
when a petition is filed for an order or judgment declaring a child free from the custody and control of either or both parents,the court must notify the appropriate person or agency as specified in the statute,who shall immediately investigate the child circumstances and the alleged basis for ordering the child free from parental custody and control.this person or agency shall,in turn,render to the court a written report of the investigation with a recommendation of the proper disposition to be made in accordance with the best interest of the child,subd.a.section,subdivision d,provides the court shall receive the report in evidence and shall read and consider its contents in rendering the court judgment.
the parties were referred to fcs for an extended evaluation in july.the evaluator report was filed with the trial court under seal on november,several days before trial commenced.neither party requested that the report be admitted into evidence or considered by the court.at the hearing on hector new trial motion,the court initially believed it had reviewed the evaluator report,but noted the record did not reflect such a review,and was willing to defer to the record.the court also recalled the report was outdated,although counsel for both parties agreed it was not.based upon the foregoing,we conclude the trial court did not review the evaluator report.
a threshold issue is whether section,subdivision d,required the trial court to consider the contents of the report,even though neither party offered it in evidence or requested it to be considered.looking at the statutory language,the court obligation to receive the report in evidence seems dependent upon a party first offering it into evidence.it is less clear,however,whether the court duty to review the in the phrase,and shall read and consider its contents italics added also hinges on a party offering the report into evidence,or is instead an independent sua sponte obligation to guard the interests of the minor children.because the stated statutory purpose of the report is to inform the court of the best interests of the child,and the interests of the children are fundamental to the proceeding,we conclude that it was the trial court obligation to read and consider the report sua sponte 
we must therefore consider the gravity of the court oversight.hector argues the evaluation report corroborated testimony that he did not know the whereabouts of irina or the children,was looking for them,and sought help from fcs.he also claims the report supported probation officer ojeda testimony that he too was unable to locate the children.neither of these claims are meritorious.as to hector,the evaluator report merely reiterated what hector told the evaluator it did not confirm the veracity of his statements.this conclusion was probative of whether the termination of hector parental rights would be in the best interests of the children,since the termination of these rights would adversely affect the prospects of a relationship and visitation.the failure to consider the evaluator report was therefore prejudicial error.
interview of minor 
section states in a proceeding under this part,the court shall consider the wishes of the child,bearing in mind the age of the child,and shall act in the best interest of the child.to this end,section requires the court to interview the minor child if he or she is of sufficient age.specifically,section reads a except as otherwise provided in this section,if the child who is the subject of the petition is years of age or older,the child shall be heard by the court in chambers on at least the following matters the feelings and thoughts of the child concerning the custody proceeding about to take place.the feelings and thoughts of the child about the child parent or parents.the child preference as to custody,according to section.b the court shall inform the child of the child right to attend the hearing.however,counsel for the child may waive the hearing in chambers by the court.c this section does not apply if the child is confined because of illness or other incapacity to an institution or residence and is therefore unable to attend.italics added.the court duty under section is sua sponte.see jack,supra,d at.
in the matter before us,the oldest child was years old at the time of trial.the court did not discuss with him the matters set forth in section,and we can not say this error was harmless.the record contains no indication what the minor would have said,other than what is contained in the evaluator report.although the report noted that the oldest child was happy,was attached to his mother,and had a good relationship with his brother and stepfather,it also stated that,although initially hesitant,he was open to visitation with hector if another adult was present.the evaluator report,therefore,contained at least some relevant information the court might have learned and explored,which could have been helpful to hector case.furthermore,al
