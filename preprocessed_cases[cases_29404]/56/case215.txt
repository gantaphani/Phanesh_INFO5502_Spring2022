appellant niema mother appeals from the juvenile court order terminating parental rights over her children alayah born,curley born,and christopher born.mother contends the order must be reversed because the juvenile court erred by initially granting her a hearing on her welfare and institutions code section petition seeking unmonitored visits and an assessment of her home for overnight visits and placement of the children,and then subsequently denying her such a hearing,and by terminating her parental rights before considering her section petition.
we agree that the juvenile court erred by terminating mother parental rights without first considering her section petition.we conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred,however,as a result of that error and therefore affirm the order terminating mother parental rights.
