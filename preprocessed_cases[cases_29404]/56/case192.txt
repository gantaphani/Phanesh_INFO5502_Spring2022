at a permanent plan hearing in a juvenile dependency matter welf,the court appointed legal guardians for the minor,and,without objection from the mother,ordered that visitation between the two be determined by the legal guardians.we address two issues whether,by not objecting to the visitation order,the mother forfeited her right to challenge that order on appeal and whether the court erred in having the legal guardians determine the question of visitation.
we hold that the mother failure to challenge the visitation order in juvenile court did not preclude the court of appeal from considering the issue on appeal,and that the juvenile court can under current law delegate to a legal guardian the decision whether to allow parental visitation.
in november,the los angeles county department of children and family services department took custody of,then years old,and her half brother,then years old.the department filed a dependency petition under section alleging that the children came within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.the petition alleged,among other things,that the children mother failed to ensure that the children attended school,that because of her emotional problems she did not provide the children with the basic necessities of life,and that she was unable to care regularly for the children.the petition further alleged that the identity and whereabouts of the children fathers were unknown.this appeal concerns only the minor 
at the initial detention hearing,the juvenile court ordered the department to detain the two children and to monitor visits with the mother.the court appointed separate counsel for the children and the mother.at the jurisdictional hearing et,the court sustained the petition it appointed psychologist steve ambrose to evaluate the children and their mother.
at the dispositional hearing,the court found that removal of the children from the mother custody was necessary to protect them from substantial danger to their physical health,and that they were suffering severe emotional damage.it declared the children dependents of the court,placed them in the care of the department for suitable placement,and ordered the department to provide family reunification services.the department placed the two children in separate foster homes.
reunification services were not successful.the mother canceled some of the visits with the children,and she was late for many others.when she did visit,she verbally abused.the psychologist concluded that the mother suffered from a debilitating mental illness that significantly impaired her ability to cooperate with a reunification case plan and to provide a stable home life for her children.
on july,the juvenile court terminated reunification services and scheduled a permanent plan hearing.at that hearing,the mother was represented by counsel.although the mother was in the courthouse,she did not appear at the hearing.the court did not terminate the mother parental rights,but it did appoint foster parents as her legal guardians.without objection from the mother attorney,the court ordered the legal guardians to make all decisions concerning parental visits between and her mother.on appeal,the mother challenged that order,contending that the issue of visitation could be determined only by the juvenile court,not the legal guardians.
a divided court of appeal reversed and remanded the case to the juvenile court,directing it to comply with the statutory language of either ordering visitation with guidance as to the time,place,and manner of visits or denying visitation because of the detrimental effect on the child physical or emotional.
we granted the department petition for review challenging the court of appeal holding that the juvenile court erred in leaving it to the minor legal guardians to determine visitation,if any,between and her mother.our order granting review directed the parties to brief the additional issue whether the mother could challenge on appeal the juvenile court order notwithstanding her failure to object in the juvenile court.while this case was pending before this court,the legislature amended the controlling statute,section,subdivision c,effective january.at this court request,the parties filed supplemental briefs addressing the effect,if any,of the amendment.
the department contends that the failure of mother to object to the juvenile court order granting the legal guardians the authority to determine visitation precluded the court of appeal from considering that issue.we disagree.
it is true that,as the department contends,a reviewing court ordinarily will not consider a challenge to a ruling if an objection could have been but was not made in the trial court.people saunders cal th,d.the purpose of this rule is to encourage parties to bring errors to the attention of the trial court,so that they may be corrected.saunders,at,d.
dependency matters are not exempt from this rule.see,in re dakota th,d failure to obtain supervising agency assessment of prospective guardian under,subd.b in re lorenzo th,d failure to request court to order bonding study in re kevin th,d failure to challenge setting of permanency planning hearing when court determined that no reasonable reunification efforts were made.
but application of the forfeiture rule is not automatic.hale morgan cal d,see people williams cal th,fn,d,party failure to object in trial court does not deprive appellate court of authority.but the appellate court discretion to excuse forfeiture should be exercised rarely and only in cases presenting an important legal issue.see canaan abdelnour cal d,fn,hale morgan,supra,at.although an appellate court discretion to consider forfeited claims extends to dependency cases rosa superior court th,d renee superior court th,d,the discretion must be exercised with special care in such matters.dependency proceedings in the juvenile court are special proceedings with their own set of rules,governed,in general,by the welfare and institutions code.in re chantal cal th,d.because these proceedings involve the of children,considerations such as permanency and stability are of paramount importance.
the court of appeal majority here did not abuse its discretion in entertaining the mother challenge to the visitation order notwithstanding her failure to object to it in the juvenile court.the appeal presented an important issue of law whether a juvenile court in a dependency case may delegate to the child legal guardian the authority to decide whether a parent may visit the child,a question that has divided the courts of appeal.moreover,because the juvenile court here had neither allowed nor prohibited visitation,but instead had delegated to the legal guardians the authority to either allow or prohibit visitation,an appellate determination on the validity of that delegation would add certainty and stability to the child visitation.
at the time of the juvenile court proceedings in this case,former section,subdivision c hereafter former section c provided in relevant part if the court finds that adoption of the child or termination of parental rights is not in the best interest of the child the court shall either order that the present caretakers or other appropriate persons shall become legal guardians of the child or order that the child remain in foster care the court shall also make an order for visitation with the parents or guardians unless the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the visitation would be detrimental to the physical or emotional of the child.italics added.
the italicized sentence had been construed by the courts of appeal in in re jasmine th,d jasmine and in in re randalynne th,d randalynne,with conflicting interpretations.jasmine held that the juvenile court could delegate to a legal guardian the issue of visitation between parent and child.in the court words w here the child is left in foster care and not in a legal guardianship,then the juvenile court shall order visitation with the parents or guardians unless the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the visitation would be detrimental to the physical or emotional of the child.th at,d.the sect
