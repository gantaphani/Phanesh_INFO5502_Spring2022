an oklahoma statute makes abortion providers liable for any subsequent medical costs that may be required because of an abortion performed on a minor without parental consent or knowledge.seeking to challenge the constitutionality of that statute,nova health services nova,an abortion provider,brought this action for injunctive and declaratory relief against various officials who oversee certain public health care facilities in oklahoma.these public officials have not attempted to recover any medical costs from nova under the challenged statute,although it is possible that they may seek to do so sometime in the future.
the district court held that there was a justiciable case or controversy between the parties and entered summary judgment against the defendants.the court issued declaratory and injunctive relief against the defendants,declaring that the oklahoma statute imposed an unconstitutional burden on a woman ability to obtain an abortion and was excessively vague.
we now hold that nova lacked standing to bring this lawsuit because it has not shown that the injury it may have suffered due to the challenged oklahoma law was caused by these particular defendants or that it would be redressed by a judgment against them.indeed,nothing in the record distinguishes these defendants from any other party who might one day have the occasion to seek compensatory damages under the challenged statute as a civil plaintiff.a party may not attack a tort statute in federal court simply by naming as a defendant anyone who might someday have a cause of action under the challenged law.
absent a genuine case or controversy between the parties,it is not constitutionally permissible for the federal courts to decide the issues presented.accordingly,we vacate the order of the district court against the defendants in this appeal and dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.
background 
prior to june,nova offered abortions to minors without requiring that they first notify a parent.according to nova,it saw approximately one to two minors a month who had not consulted with a parent regarding their abortion.when a prospective minor patient stated that she had not talked to a parent about the abortion,nova would encourage her to do so but would ultimately leave that decision to the patient.in many cases,the minor eventually would choose to consult with a parent about the abortion.
in june,oklahoma enacted a law providing that 
any person who performs an abortion on a minor without parental consent or knowledge shall be liable for the cost of any subsequent medical treatment such minor might require because of the abortion.
stat.tit.although this law applies only to abortions performed on minors without parental consent or knowledge,nova responded by deciding that,in the future,it would require minors to produce parental consent in order to obtain an abortion there.since came into effect,nova alleges that it has turn ed away young women who have valid and compelling reasons for not involving their parents in their decision.more specifically,nova asserts that between july and january at least minors declared that they would not bring a parent to the clinic to give consent 
less than a week after came into effect,nova filed the instant lawsuit in federal district court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.the four defendants in this appeal are oklahoma public officials whose functions include overseeing certain state medical institutions.nova alleged in its complaint that each of these institutions provide some form of medical treatment services,but the record does not detail the scope of their activities.

before the district court,nova argued that is unconstitutional because it lacks an exception for abortions performed in medical emergencies,lacks a judicial bypass procedure,and is impermissibly vague.the defendants argued,among other things,that nova failed to demonstrate article iii standing.the district court denied the defendants motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment,and granted nova motion for summary judgment.the defendants listed above appealed.for the reasons discussed below,we vacate the judgments against these defendants and dismiss for lack of standing 
as an irreducible constitutional minimum,a plaintiff must satisfy three criteria in order for there to be a case or controversy that may be resolved by the federal courts.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.first,the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact an invasion of a legally protected interest that is both a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.id.second,there must be a causal connection between that injury and the challenged action of the injury must be fairly traceable to the defendant,and not the result of the independent action of some third party.id.finally,it must be likely,not merely speculative,that a favorable judgment will redress the plaintiff injury.id.at.
we review questions of standing de novo.utah babbitt,cir.as the party seeking to invoke federal jurisdiction,the plaintiff here nova has the burden of establishing each of these three elements of article iii standing.see lujan,at.at the summary judgment stage,the plaintiff must set forth by affidavit or other evidence specific facts that,if taken as true,establish each of these elements.id.a federal court is powerless to create its own jurisdiction by embellishing otherwise deficient allegations of standing.whitmore arkansas,d.
standing is determined as of the time the action is brought.see smith sperling,d see also friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl,d w e have an obligation to assure ourselves that plaintiff had article iii standing at the outset of the litigation.emphasis added focus on the family pinellas suncoast transit,cir article iii standing must be determined as of the time at which the plaintiff complaint is filed.carr alta verde,cir as with all questions of subject matter jurisdiction except mootness,standing is determined as of the date of the filing of the complaint.accordingly,the question we face is whether,as of june,nova faced a concrete and actual or imminent injury in fact that was caused by the defendants in this case and that was redressable by a favorable judicial order 
injury in fact 
as noted above,an injury in fact must be actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.lujan,at.allegations of possible future injury do not satisfy the requirements of art.iii.a threatened injury must be certainly impending to constitute injury in fact.whitmore,at.an article iii injury must be more than a possibility the threat of injury must be both real and immediate.essence,city of federal heights,cir quotation omitted.
there is evidence in the record that,before came into effect,one or two minors each month would seek abortions at nova without first consulting with a parent.in light of this past demand for abortions without parental involvement,nova certainly could have expected to lose some business under its new policy demanding that minors obtain parental consent.further,there is evidence in the record that nova actually turned away minors who sought abortions between july and january,after came into effect,because they refused to comply with nova new parental consent policy.
this evidence is enough,for summary judgment purposes,to support a conclusion that it was imminent at the time nova brought this action that it would lose some minor patients.see singleton wulff,d identifying abortion providers injury as a direct financial impact on their practice doe bolton,d physicians may establish injury in fact when challenging abortion regulations by showing a sufficiently direct threat of personal detriment salem inn,frank,cir standing established when plaintiff suffered economic loss due to compliance with a challenged ordinance.
accordingly,nova has sufficiently demonstrated at this stage of the litigation that it faced a concrete and imminent injury in fact.more specifically,as of june,nova faced an imminent likelihood that it would lose some minor patients seeking abortions 
we next turn to whether nova injury in imminent threat that nova would lose some minor patients seeking fairly traceable to the defendants in this action.we hold that nova has failed to demonstrate the necessary causal connection between its injury and these defendants.
to invoke federal jurisdiction,a plaintiff must show that his or her injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant,and not the result of the independent action of some third party not before the court.lujan,at.quotation omitted.as other courts have noted,article iii causation requirement demands something less than the concept of proximate cause.see focus on the family,at.yet article iii does at least require proof of a substantial likelihood that the defendant conduct caused plaintiff injury in fact.see utah evans,d franklin massachusetts,d duke power carolina envtl.study group,d.
as explained above,makes abortion providers liable for any subsequent medical costs necessitated by an abortion that was performed without parental consent or knowledge.stat.tit.in addition to allowing certain minors the right to recover their medical expenses,it appears that the statute also enables suits by medical facilities that incur certain treatment costs that their patients fail to reimburse 
nova has produced some evidence that the enactment of coerced it into requiring at least some sort of parental involvement prior to performing an abortion on a minor.in turn,there is evidence that nova new policy made it imminent that it would lose some minor patients however,the record is conspicuously silent with respect to how the particular defendants in this case might have affected nova decision to demand parental consent or nova resulting imminent lost patients injury,if at all.
we hold that nova has failed to show the required causal connection between its injury and these defendants.first,there is no evidence that the defendants have done or have threatened to do anything that presents a substantial likelihood of causing nova harm.nova submitted evidence that its refusal to offer abortions absent parental consent was a response to the enactment of,not a response to any actions of these particular public officials.additionally,nothing in the record suggests that the conduct of any of these defendants substantially caused nova to stop offering abortions to minors without parental involvement.therefore,it is at best merely speculative whether these defendants caused nova decision to require parental consent,with a concomitant prospective loss of patients that flowed from that decision.the plaintiff burden of demonstrating causation is not satisfied when s peculative inferences are necessary to connect its injury to the challenged actions.see simon.welfare rights,d.
in other words,nova has confus ed the statute immediate coercive effect on the plaintiff with any coercive effect that might be applied by the defendants.see okpalobi foster,cir en banc emphasis in original holding that a state governor and attorney general were not proper defendants when they had no power to enforce the challenged statute.nothing in the record distinguishes these particular defendants from anyone else who could possibly have a claim someday under including,for example,minors themselves who might seek an abortion without parental notification and who might incur subsequent medical costs.
it may be true that these defendants potentially have the power to sue nova under,in the event that they happen to incur medical costs not reimbursed by the patient that were required because of an abortion performed by nova on a minor without parental consent or knowledge.in this respect,is not unlike a multitude of other state tort laws under which these defendants might someday have a cause of action.yet if these defendants latent power to litigate were enough to support standing,anyone who might someday have a claim under could be summoned preemptively before the federal courts to defend the constitutionality of that statute.article iii does not allow a plaintiff who wishes to challenge state legislation to do so simply by naming as a defendant anyone who,under appropriate circumstances,might conceivably have an occasion to file a suit for avid damages under the relevant state law at some future date.
furthermore,it makes no difference in this case that each of the defendants are public officials sued in their official capacities.in wilson stocker,we noted that an official who is charged with enforcing a state statute on behalf of the entire state is a proper defendant,so long as the plaintiff shows an appreciable threat of injury flowing directly from the statute,cir finding standing to sue the oklahoma attorney general to challenge a state criminal statute he was charged with enforcing.other courts have reached similar conclusions.see mobil oil attorney general of,cir finding standing to sue the state enforcement officer the attorney general who had authority to enforce a petroleum franchise law by seeking stiff civil remed ies corporate health,texas dep t of,cir finding standing to sue the state attorney general,who could enforce the challenged act on the state behalf through regulatory oversight responsibility,and noting that t his is not a case in which private suits are the only means of enforcing the statute,abrogated on other grounds by rush prudential hmo,moran,d.
in contrast,the defendants in this case are not charged with enforcing on oklahoma behalf.rather,they are simply able to bring a civil suit under that statute along with any other potentially relevant state law in their proprietary capacities as directors of certain public medical institutions.wilson deals only with suits against state enforcement officers to challenge the laws they execute as a representative of the state.see wilson,at.wilson did not vest all public officials with standing to litigate the constitutionality of any state legislation that might be the basis of a future lawsuit in which the state agency might be a civil litigant seeking compensatory damages.
in sum,although nova has shown that it suffered an injury in fact,it has failed to demonstrate that its injury was caused by the challenged action of the defendant s,and not the result of the independent action of some third party not before the court.lujan,at.quotation omitted.therefore,article iii does not permit us to decide the merits of nova claims.
redressability 
article iii further requires that the plaintiff demonstrate a substantial likelihood that the relief requested will redress its injury in fact.ash creek mining lujan,cir.the plaintiff must show that a favorable judgment will relieve a discrete injury,although it need not relieve his or her every injury.larson valente,d.
we hold that nova has failed to show that a judgment against the defendants in this action would likely redress its lost patients injury.as noted above,the record contains evidence that the enactment of created the imminent possibility that nova would be reasonably coerced into turning away prospective minor patients who would not obtain parental consent.yet the record can not support a conclusion that a judgment enjoining only these defendants from filing suit to recover damages under would redress that injury.
in this case,like many,redressability and traceability overlap as two sides of a causation coin.see cache valley utah dep t of,cir quotation omitted.even if these defendants were enjoined from seeking damages against nova under,there would still be a multitude of other prospective litigants who could potentially sue nova under that act.most significantly,a judgment in nova favor would do nothing to prevent lawsuits against nova by the minor patients who actually require subsequent medical care,or by any doctors or hospitals and medical clinics who may treat them.
consequently,nothing in the record suggests that a judgment against these defendants would materially reduce the coercive effect of that nova claims prevented it from offering abortions to minors without parental consent.in turn,such a judgment would likely do nothing to prevent nova from losing minor patients in the future,and thus would not be substantially likely to redress nova injury in fact.see essence,at at the summary judgment stage,mere allegations of redressability are not enough to support standing.
finally,we reject nova argument that a favorable declaratory judgment against these defendants would redress its injury by deterring other potential litigants from relying on,even in state court.as an initial matter,nova argument is entirely speculative.more fundamentally,it overlooks the principle that it must be the effect of the court judgment on the defendant that redresses the plaintiff injury,whether directly or indirectly.see ash creek mining,at the redressability inquiry looks to whether the relief requested will redress the injury claimed emphasis added cox phelps dodge,cir w hat makes a declaratory judgment action a proper judicial resolution of a case or controversy rather than an advisory opinion is the settling of some dispute which affects the behavior of the defendant toward the plaintiff.superceded by statute on other grounds emphasis added quoting hewitt helms,d.if courts may simply assume that everyone including those who are not proper parties to an action will honor the legal rationales that underlie their decrees,then redressability will always exist.redressability requires that the court be able to afford relief through the exercise of its power,not through the persuasive or even effect of the opinion explaining the exercise of its power.franklin massachusetts,d scalia,concurring emphasis omitted 
for these reasons,we hold that a judgment against the defendants in this action would not be substantially likely to redress nova lost patients injury.
conclusion 
article iii standing requirements guarantee that both plaintiffs and defendants have such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions.see duke power,at.quotation omitted.
our decision that nova injury is not fairly traceable to the defendants in this action and not likely redressable by a judgment against these defendants reflects this fundamental policy.the incentives of these directors and university defend a politically divisive abortion statute is not particularly strong,at least at the present time when these defendants have no actual or imminent claims against nova under the statute.article iii sensibly requires the federal courts to refrain from determining the validity of that legislation until the issue reaches us as part of a genuine case or controversy between adverse,in a case presenting a claim of concrete and actual or imminent injury traceable to the named defendants which is redressable by the authority of a judgment against those defendants.no such case or controversy is presented in this litigation.
we vacate the judgment of the district court against the defendants in this appeal,and dismiss for lack of standing 
i concur in the majority conclusion that nova has failed to demonstrate article iii standing for its claim seeking injunctive relief.i respectfully dissent,however,from the majority conclusion that nova lacks standing to pursue its claim for declaratory relief.in my view,nova has shown that the conduct of these defendants is causally connected to nova injury and,further,that our declaring unconstitutional would redress its injuries.
to establish article iii standing,a litigant must show it has suffered an,that the injury is fairly traceable to the defendant allegedly unlawful conduct,and that the injury is likely to be redressed by the requested relief.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.here,as the majority correctly concludes,it is clear nova has demonstrated an nova faced an imminent likelihood that it would lose some minor patients seeking abortions.op.at.
the majority correctly states that,to prove causation,a plaintiff must show his or her injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant,and not the result of the independent action of some third party not before the court.lujan,at.emphasis added.however,the majority applies a heightened standard to determine if nova has established causation,stating,article iii does at least require proof of a substantial likelihood that the defendant conduct caused plaintiff injury in fact.op.at emphasis added.the majority concludes nova can not establish causation because nova is unable to show the required causal connection between its injury and these defendants because there is no evidence that defendants have done or have threatened to do anything that presents a substantial likelihood of causing nova harm.id.at emphasis added.further,the majority views nova suing of state officials in their official capacities as irrelevant to the causation analysis because does not explicitly charge these defendants with enforcement of.the majority reasons that,since these defendants are not responsible for enforcing,nova injuries are not fairly traceable to them.
i find no support for the majority conclusion that nova must show a substantial likelihood that defendants conduct caused nova injuries in this case.the reason this conclusion lacks support is apparent.in a case such as this where the plaintiff seeks review of a statute constitutionality,it is often the case that the defendant has not enforced or even threatened to enforce the statute.as this court explained in wilson stocker,cir,the lack of enforcement alone does not prevent a plaintiff from proving causation.
t he supreme court has often found a case or controversy between a plaintiff challenging the constitutionality of a statute and an enforcement official who has made no attempt to prosecute the plaintiff under the law at issue.in doe bolton,d,the court found a justiciable controversy between doctors subject to prosecution under criminal abortion statutes and the state attorney general,despite the fact that the record does not disclose that any one of the doctors has been prosecuted,or threatened with prosecution.i n diamond charles,d,the court stated that the conflict between state officials empowered to enforce a law and private parties subject to prosecution under that law is a classic case or controversy within the meaning of art.iii.id.
the legal principle underlying these decisions is the familiar doctrine that a suit against a state officer in his official capacity is,of course,a suit against the state.thus a controversy exists not because the state official is himself a source of injury,but because the official represents the state whose statute is being challenged as the source of injury.
wilson,at internal citations omitted.to require that a plaintiff seeking to prove causation must first show that there was a substantial likelihood that defendants caused plaintiff injury abandons this line of cases,which directly address standing in the context of declaratory judgment actions.this result forces nova
