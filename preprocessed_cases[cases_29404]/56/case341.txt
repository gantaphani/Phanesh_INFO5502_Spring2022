background 
in,dcfs received a referral alleging past sexual abuse of by father.reported that father had sexually abused her by inappropriate touching when she was about seven or eight years old until she was about years old which was about five or six years prior to the filing of the petition.father would tell,do tell your mom.it our little secret.mother started dating father when was four or five years old,and father moved in with them.in,when was about seven or eight years old,was born to mother and father.it was around that time,father sexual molestation of began.
the abuse occurred at night while mother was at work and was alone with father.bed was in the living room,and father would sit next to her on the bed watching television and put his hand inside her pants,touching her vagina.father repeatedly orally copulated.when these events occurred,was on the premises,as was a babysitter.on one occasion,may have seen the abuse taking place.
when was about years old,she told her mother about the sexual molestation.according to,mother tried to expel father from the house,but father threatened to take away.mother did put locks on doors to stop the abuse.has now expressed concern that father would sexually abuse,a physically maturing child noted that father would shower or bathe,which considers weird.
dcfs filed a section petition on behalf of and,asserting counts under section,subdivisions b,d and j,and setting forth the allegations of father sexual abuse of.the juvenile court found a prima facie case and ordered the children removed from father and released to mother.the juvenile court ordered monitored visits and telephone calls for father with,but no contact between father and 
after initial denials,mother admitted that disclosed the sexual abuse to her when was years old.mother said she put locks on the doors,took father keys to the rooms away,and was more vigilant about not leaving the children alone with father if the babysitter was not there.mother also said she remained with father after disclosure because of economic reasons,as father paid half the rent and other costs.
dcfs recommended that father attend parenting and sexual abuse treatment classes,and that mother attend parenting and sexual abuse awareness classes for nonoffending parents.in a report for the march,hearing,dcfs reported that father enrolled in a week program for sex offenders in fresno,california,in which city he worked.mother was in a sexual abuse awareness group through the family preservation program.
because had turned in,dcfs recommended she be dismissed from the section petition.dcfs further recommended that the court take jurisdiction over,and monitor father progress and the risk to as father began the program for sexual abuse perpetrators.dcfs continued helping mother with services for and with funds for the family housing.

the juvenile court found by a preponderance of the evidence that father sexually abused,father denials were not credible,demeanor in the forensic interview supported her credibility,and a babysitter were in the home at least some of the time that the abuse of took place,and had told mother about the abuse.the juvenile court dismissed from the section petition because she had turned and found that,beautiful as she is,was differently situated from because was father biological daughter and his sexual abuse of did not put at risk for sexual abuse.the juvenile court also observed that the last incident of sexual abuse of occurred six years earlier.consequently,the juvenile court dismissed the petition in its entirety.

on april,the respondent juvenile court held the hearing directed by the writ and filed a return.the juvenile court,in explaining its reasons for not changing its prior decision,said that without new evidence,dcfs did not establish by a preponderance of the evidence that was at substantial risk of future harm from father.accordingly,the show cause proceeding went forward before this court.
