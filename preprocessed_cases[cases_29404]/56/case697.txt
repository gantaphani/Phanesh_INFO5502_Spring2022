introduction 
in this mandate proceeding,rene seeks relief from the juvenile court order declaring that he is not a fit and proper subject to be dealt with under the juvenile court law.we grant his writ petition.
factual and procedural background 
on february,the people filed a petition pursuant to welfare and institutions code section alleging that when rene was years of age he committed the crimes of murder,count,attempted murder,count and assault with a firearm,subd.a count.the people also alleged numerous firearm and great bodily injury enhancements,subds.b,c,d counts,subd.a count,subd.a counts count.due to the nature of the offenses alleged,rene statutorily was presumed not to be a fit and proper subject to be dealt with under the juvenile court law,subds.b,c.the people consequently moved the court for an order declaring rene unfit so they could try him as an adult.
on may,the juvenile court conducted an edsel hearing,which was followed immediately by a fitness hearing.during the edsel hearing,the following evidence was adduced 
alex santos alex,the murder victim in count,was a member of a tagging crew.prior to january,someone from a rival tagging crew had threatened alex with a gun.alex told his older brother,george santos george,what had happened.george is the named victim in counts and.
on january,george drove alex and alex friends,daniel torrero torrero,rudolfo gonzalez gonzalez and two others,to a market so they could buy something to drink.alex and torrero went inside the market while the others remained in george truck,which was parked across the street.when alex and torrero walked out of the market,or members of the rival dsw tagging crew advanced on them.sensing his brother was in danger,george got out of his truck and ran across the street.george punched one of the dsw crew members as hard as he could without warning in order to protect the individual fell to the ground,after which george repeatedly kicked the individual with all his might.this person assumed a fetal position in an attempt to protect himself.after the fourth or fifth kick,someone shot george.the person on the ground then stood up and ran away.at that point,george attempted to return to his truck.as he did so,he saw alex approaching and realized for the first time that alex had been shot in the neck.alex later died of his injuries.
bell gardens police detective angel puente investigated the shooting.torrero told the detective that when he walked out of the market,he saw a large group of dsw tagging crew members walking toward him and fearful that a fight would ensue,torrero ran away.as he fled,torrero saw someone point a gun at torrero continued to run but looked back when he heard two gunshots.alex had been shot.
during a subsequent interview,torrero gave detective puente additional details about the shooting.torrero told detective puente that while he was running,he saw george fighting with someone on the ground.torrero heard a gunshot and saw the person with whom george was fighting stand up and run away,holding something near his front pants pocket.torrero selected rene picture out of a photographic display,identifying him as the person with whom george had been fighting.torrero also identified andrew as the person who shot according to detective puente,both rene and andrew are members of the dsw tagging crew.
gonzalez told detective puente that he was waiting in george truck when he saw a large group of males from a rival tagging crew advancing on alex and torrero after they walked out of the market.at that point,gonzalez,along with george,got out of the truck and approached the group.gonzalez heard two gunshots and saw a male holding a revolver.gonzalez saw alex fall to the ground.the members of the group then dispersed.from a photographic display containing six pictures,gonzalez identified andrew as the person who shot alex,and rene as the person who shot george.
george told detective puente that he did not know who shot him and that the person with whom he fought did not shoot him and was not rene.at the hearing,george testified that he did not recognize rene and that rene was not the person with whom he fought 
rene attorney argued that rene was acting in when he shot george.the court rejected the argument,stating,there no testimony that george santos ever touched rene.the only testimony that i have before me,and i mean this with all sincerity,is that he was identified by a witness to take a gun and shoot george.rather than inform the court that it was mistaken and call the court attention to torrero statement that rene was the person with whom george was fighting on the ground and who got up off the ground and ran away holding something near the front of his pants after george was shot,rene attorney inexplicably agreed with the court characterization of the evidence.the court concluded that the people had established a prima facie showing that rene had committed the alleged offenses and then turned to the issue of rene fitness to be tried as a juvenile.
rene counsel submitted on the report of edward fischer,a licensed psychologist appointed by the juvenile court to evaluate rene pursuant to evidence code sections and with regard to his fitness for treatment under the juvenile court law fischer reported that rene lived with both parents and that his current detention was the first time he had ever been away from home.
according to fischer,rene has been a special education student his entire life.he related in a childish,simpleminded,immature manner.rene cried during the course of his interview with fischer.
as part of his evaluation,fischer administered various tests to rene.fischer concluded that rene suffers from congenital organic brain dysfunction.fischer observed that rene has attended a special education program in all subjects.his measured intelligence and his achievement test scores are consistent with a diagnosis of mild mental retardation,and it appears that the defendant is a developmentally disabled person within the meaning of the welfare and institutions code.
fischer opined that rene was fit with respect to all five fitness criteria set forth in section,subdivision c.with regard to the fifth and final factor,the circumstances and gravity of the offenses allegedly committed by rene,fischer made the following observations 
while the allegations against the minor are quite serious,his role was passive,without a personal motive,and the result of his association with the minor who placed the gun in his hand and told him to show it to their enemies.
his responsibility is diminished by the fact of his mental retardation and immaturity.this experiences life in the credulous manner of an eight year old.he was punched and then kicked by a adult that sic he believes assaulted him years earlier when he lived in maywood.this was unable to show his attacker the gun he had been given to frighten him away and he was certain that he would be soundly beaten and seriously injured,if not killed.he panicked and shot his attacker george santos.he is also charged with the death of alex santos,his victim younger brother.
at the time of the offense,the minor was unable to appreciate any alternative course of action.at the time of the evaluation,he conceded that he knows that he is not justified in the use of deadly force in response to an unarmed assault,but he was afraid.
in summary,the minor remains fit for rehabilitation in the juvenile justice system because of his immaturity and his developmental disability.an appropriate disposition is referral to the r egional center for a suitable placement where this developmentally disabled minor can undergo assessment and rehabilitation.it is quite possible with appropriate supervision that this minor would never again offend.
when submitting on fischer report,rene counsel emphasized the following rene,at the time of this offense,was years and months.he comes from loving parents,who have been in continuous contact with me showing their concern for their son.one of the more important aspects of fischer report is the testing of rene and fischer determination that he functions as an based on his borderline mental retardation.counsel questioned whether the adult system was the right system for rene despite the crimes he is alleged to have committed.counsel urged the court to keep rene in the juvenile system and emphasized that the only chance of saving this young man life is to keep him here in juvenile court.
after entertaining the arguments of all counsel,the juvenile court found rene fit under the first four criteria,but unfit as to the fifth and final criterion.the court ruled as follows in regard to the minor rene,in regard to the first factor,for the degree of criminal sophistication,i find the minor fit for juvenile court.on the second factor whether the minor can be rehabilitated prior to the expiration of juvenile court jurisdiction,i find that the minor is fit.on the third factor,the minor previous juvenile history,he has no prior record.therefore,i find that he is fit.on the fourth factor,previous attempts for juvenile rehabilitation,there were no attempts.find the minor fit.the fifth factor,circumstances and gravity of the offense s alleged to have been committed by the minor,i find the minor unfit.the minor fired a gun to cause harm and possibly death to victims.the minor motivation was gang related and he played a primary role in the commission of the crime.minor chose to engage in delinquent behavior and posed a serious threat to the safety not only to the people injured,but also to other people who were in the community.therefore,the court finds minor,rene c,is not a fit and proper subject for consideration under the provisions of the juvenile court law the court directs the prosecution to file an accusatory pleading against the minor in a court of criminal jurisdiction the people thereafter filed a felony complaint against rene on may,charging him with murder,attempted murder and assault with a firearm,and alleging various firearm and great bodily injury enhancements.
contentions 
rene contends the juvenile court abused its discretion by failing to consider his psychological evaluation when making its fitness determination.rene further contends he met his burden of rebutting the presumption of unfitness.although we conclude that the juvenile court considered rene psychological evaluation when making its fitness determination,we do agree that rene rebutted the presumption of unfitness.
discussion 
rene writ petition was timely 
before we can reach the merits of rene contentions,we must address the people assertion that rene writ petition should be denied because it is untimely.rule j of the california rules of court provides an order that a child is or is not a fit and proper subject to be dealt with under the juvenile court law is not an appealable order.appellate review of the order is by extraordinary writ.any petition for review of a judge order determining the child unfit shall be filed no later than days after the child first arraignment on an accusatory pleading based on the allegations that led to the unfitness determination.
the people first accusatory pleading based on the allegations that led to the unfitness determination was the felony complaint,which was filed on may.on that same date,the court called the case for arraignment.rene demanded counsel,and the court appointed the alternate public defender to represent him.rene waived arraignment,reading of the complaint and statement of rights,after which the court continued the matter to june,for arraignment and plea.the court subsequently continued the matter three more times to september,when rene entered a plea of not guilty to all counts.
the people contend that rene had days from may,or until june,to file his writ petition challenging the juvenile court finding of unfitness.rene,on the other hand,contends he had days from september,or until september,to file his writ petition.rene is correct.
an arraignment consists in reading the accusatory pleading to the defendant and delivering to the defendant a true copy thereof,and of the endorsements thereon,if any,including the list of witnesses,and asking the defendant whether the defendant pleads guilty or not guilty to the accusatory pleading,italics added.inasmuch as rene was not asked to enter a plea until september,he technically was not arraigned on the felony complaint until september.he thereafter had days to seek extraordinary relief.his writ petition filed on september,therefore,was timely.
