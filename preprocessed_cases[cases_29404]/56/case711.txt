the minor got into his car and started to leave,but before driving away,he emerged from his car and approached attendant hugo mejia.while looking at mejia,the minor said i am going to come and get you and i am going to kill you,which prompted cerritos to step between them.cerritos testified he was afraid for his life and believed the minor meant what he said.officers arrived minutes later.mejia did not testify at the hearing.

discussion 
the minor contends the evidence is insufficient to support the finding he made a criminal threat against mejia,who was not a witness at the adjudication.
the same standard of appellate review is applicable in considering the sufficiency of the evidence in a juvenile proceeding as in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction in either type of case,we review the whole record in the light most favorable to the judgment to determine whether it discloses substantial is,evidence that is reasonable,credible and of solid which a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt 
the following elements must be proved to show the making of a criminal threat.that the defendant willfully threaten ed to commit a crime which will result in death or great bodily injury to another person,that the defendant made the threat with the specific intent that the statement is to be taken as a threat,even if there is no intent of actually carrying it out,that the may be made verbally,in writing,or by means of an electronic communication device was on its face and under the circumstances in which it was made,so unequivocal,unconditional,immediate,and specific as to convey to the person threatened,a gravity of purpose and an immediate prospect of execution of the threat,that the threat actually caused the person threatened to be in sustained fear for his or her own safety or for his or her immediate family safety,and that the threatened person fear was reasonabl e under the circumstances.citation.
the delinquency petition alleged the minor made separate criminal threats against cerritos and mejia.however,cerritos was the only victim to testify.without mejia testimony,the minor argues,there is no evidence mejia was actually in sustained fear from the minor threats and,because the record is silent as to this subjective element of the offense,the prosecution failed to support a finding beyond a reasonable doubt the minor made criminal threats against mejia.the people respond cerritos unobjected to testimony,everybody got scared,was sufficient to establish mejia was placed in sustained fear.we disagree.
cerritos testified everybody got scared because you never know what is going on when the prosecutor asked whether cerritos was scared by the minor earlier threat to kill him,which did not involve mejia.defense counsel did not object,but the court immediately interrupted and questioned cerritos as to whether he,not we,was scared.cerritos answered i was scared,yes.while a percipient witness,like cerritos,could conceivably testify to having observed a person targeted by another criminal threat actually experienced sustained fear and,in so doing,supply sufficient evidence of the subjective element,this was not the case with cerritos testimony.his answer everybody got scared is not substantial evidence of mejia subjective fear for the very reasons it was inadmissible as being without foundation and therefore based on speculation or hearsay indeed,by obtaining clarification as to whether cerritos personally sustained fear,the court effectively struck cerritos objectionable answer.
while under the circumstances it is probable the minor threats caused mejia,like cerritos,actually to suffer sustained fear that is not enough.r easonableness is the ultimate standard under the substantial evidence rule.the appellate court must determine whether a reasonable trier of fact could have found the prosecution sustained its burden of proving the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.citation.evidence which merely raises a strong suspicion of the defendant guilt is not sufficient to support a conviction.suspicion is not evidence,it merely raises a possibility,and this is not a sufficient basis for an inference of fact.citation.
although we find the evidence insufficient to prove appellant guilty of the crime of criminal threat,it was sufficient to prove him guilty of attempted criminal threat.all elements of the crime of criminal threat were established,except whether the victim mejia actually experienced sustained fear upon hearing the threat.proof of that element is essential to a conviction under the criminal threat statute.but absence of proof of that element does not defeat a conviction for attempted criminal threat.indeed in people toledo itself,the victim testified she was not placed in fear by her husband several threats and threatening behavior.the jury evidently credited that statement because it found him guilty of the lesser offense of attempted criminal threat rather than the completed crime.yet the california supreme court upheld the husband conviction of the lesser included offense of attempted criminal threat.
we recognize there is a difference between people toledo and the case before this court.in toledo the victim did testify and,if believed,supplied affirmative evidence the perpetrator threats failed to arouse the sustained fear required for a criminal threat conviction.accordingly the supreme court could readily find the elements of the charged crime of attempted criminal threat had been proved.i f a defendant,again acting with the requisite intent,makes a sufficient threat that is received and understood by the threatened person,but,for whatever reason,the threat does not actually cause the threatened person to be in sustained fear for his or her safety even though,under the circumstances,that person reasonably could have been placed in such fear,the defendant properly may be found to have committed the offense of attempted criminal threat.in this situation,only a fortuity,not intended by the defendant,has prevented the defendant from perpetrating the completed offense of criminal threat itself.
in appellant case,however,the unintended fortuity,was not proof the victim experienced no fear but a failure of proof whether he did or did not.this failure of proof resulted largely from the absence of that victim from the trial and thus the absence of evidence from him about his state of mind upon hearing appellant utter his threat.nor did the prosecution produce sufficient evidence from any other source regarding mejia actual state of mind on that occasion.
