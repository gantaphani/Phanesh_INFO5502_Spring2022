discussion 
in graham,the year old defendant,terrance graham,committed armed burglary and attempted armed robbery,was sentenced to probation,and subsequently violated the terms of his probation when he committed other crimes.graham,supra,at.at.the trial court revoked his probation and sentenced him to life in prison for the burglary.ibid.graham sentence amounted to a life sentence without the possibility of parole because florida had abolished its parole system,leaving graham with no possibility of release unless he was granted executive clemency.id.at at.at.
the high court stated that nonhomicide crimes differ from homicide crimes in a moral sense and that a juvenile nonhomicide offender has a twice diminished moral culpability as opposed to an adult convicted of murder both because of his crime and because of his undeveloped moral sense.graham,supra,at.at.the court relied on studies showing that developments in psychology and brain science continue to show fundamental differences between juvenile and adult minds.for example,parts of the brain involved in behavior control continue to mature through late adolescence.citations.juveniles are also more capable of change than are adults,and their actions are less likely to be evidence of irretrievably depraved character than are the actions of adults.id.at at.at,quoting roper simmons,d.no legitimate penological interest,the court concluded,justifies a life without parole sentence for juvenile nonhomicide offenders.id.at at.at.
although the state is by no means required to guarantee eventual freedom to a juvenile convicted of a nonhomicide offense,graham holds that the eighth amendment requires the state to afford the juvenile offender a meaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation,and that a life without parole sentence improperly denies the juvenile offender a chance to demonstrate growth and maturity.graham,supra,at.at.the court observed that a life without parole sentence is particularly harsh for a juvenile offender who will on average serve more years and a greater percentage of his life in prison than an adult offender.id.at at.at.graham likened a life without parole sentence for nonhomicide offenders to the death penalty itself,given their youth and the prospect that,as the years progress,juveniles can reform their deficiencies and become contributing members of society.ibid.
the people assert that graham ban on life without parole sentences does not apply to juvenile offenders who commit attempted murder,with its requisite intent to kill.the people also claim that a cumulative sentence for distinct crimes does not present a cognizable eighth amendment claim,concluding that each of defendant sentences was permissible individually because each included the possibility of parole within his lifetime in addition,the court of appeal reasoned that graham applied a categorical rule specifically limited to juvenile nonhomicide offenders receiving an explicitly designated life without parole sentence i f graham had intended to broaden the class of offenders within the scope of its decision,it would have included any juvenile offender who received the functional equivalent of a life sentence without the possibility of parole for a nonhomicide offense.the court of appeal found support for its conclusion in justice alito dissent from graham nothing in the court opinion affects the imposition of a sentence to a term of years without the possibility of parole.graham,supra,at.at dis.opn.of alito.graham scope and application,however,were recently clarified in miller alabama,d miller.
in miller,the united states supreme court extended graham reasoning but not its categorical ban to homicide cases,and,in so doing,made it clear that graham flat ban on life without parole sentences for juvenile offenders in nonhomicide cases applies to their sentencing equation regardless of intent in the crime commission,or how a sentencing court structures the life without parole sentence.miller,supra.at,d.the high court was careful to emphasize that graham categorical bar on life without parole applied only to nonhomicide crimes.id.at at.at.but the court also observed that none of what graham said about children about their distinctive and transitory mental traits and environmental vulnerabilities is.those features are evident in the same way,and to the same degree,when a botched robbery turns into a killing.so graham reasoning implicates any sentence imposed on a juvenile,even as its categorical bar relates only to nonhomicide offenses.miller,supra.at,d.miller therefore made it clear that graham flat ban on life without parole sentences applies to all nonhomicide cases involving juvenile offenders,including the sentence that amounts to the functional equivalent of a life without parole sentence imposed in this case 
defendant in the present matter will become parole eligible over years from now,subd.b requiring defendant serve a minimum of years before becoming parole eligible.consequently,he would have no opportunity to demonstrate growth and maturity to try to secure his release,in contravention of graham dictate.graham,supra,at.at see people mendez th,d holding that a sentence of years to life was the equivalent of life without parole under graham,and therefore cruel and unusual punishment.graham analysis does not focus on the precise sentence meted out.instead,as noted above,it holds that a state must provide a juvenile offender with some realistic opportunity to obtain release from prison during his or her expected lifetime.graham,supra,at.at.
conclusion 
consistent with the high court holding in graham,supra,we conclude that sentencing a juvenile offender for a nonhomicide offense to a term of years with a parole eligibility date that falls outside the juvenile offender natural life expectancy constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of
