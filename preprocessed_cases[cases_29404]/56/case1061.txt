we have for review state,so d dca,which certified conflict with payne state,so d dca we have jurisdiction.see art.v,b.const.for the reasons set forth in this opinion,we approve the decision of the first district court of appeal that an adjudication of delinquency does not constitute a felony criminal conviction for purposes of adjudicating a person to be a sexual predator under the florida sexual predators act.we disapprove the contrary holding in payne.
proceedings to date 
a juvenile,was charged as an adult with sexual battery in violation of section b,florida statutes see,so d at.pled nolo contendere to the charge and the trial court exercised its discretion to adjudicate as a delinquent,discretion authorized by section c,florida statutes,and section b,florida statutes in imposing juvenile sanctions,the court ordered to a level,nonresidential treatment program under the supervision of the department of juvenile justice.
three experts testified at the juvenile disposition hearing that offense was not typical of the type committed by a chronic sexual offender.the experts recommended against incarceration,stating that incarceration would serve no purpose.they also opined that was amenable to treatment,did not present a high risk of reoffense,and would likely be rehabilitated.likewise,they recommended against placement in any,residential juvenile sexual offender program that specialized in more serious,older offenders.
subsequently,after juvenile sanctions were imposed,the state requested that the court classify as a sexual predator,pursuant to section,florida statutes,also known as the florida sexual predators act predator act.section a provides,in relevant part,that upon conviction,an offender shall be designated as a sexual predator if t he felony is a capital,life,or felony violation of chapter.emphasis added.in the definitions section of the predator act,the term conviction is defined as meaning a determination of guilt which is the result of a trial or the entry of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere,regardless of whether adjudication is withheld.c.stat.
although the trial court granted the state request,the trial court expressed concerns in its order that classifying as a sexual predator was inappropriate and particularly difficult in light of the uncontroverted evidence in this case.the trial court concluded that it was legally bound to grant the state request by the holding in payne state,so d dca,since no other district court had ruled on the issue.in payne,the second district,while acknowledging that section b provides that an adjudication of delinquency should not be deemed a conviction,nevertheless held that an adjudication of delinquency should operate as a conviction for purposes of applying the predator act because of the unique nature of section.id.at.
on appeal,the first district reversed the order designating as a sexual predator,and held that an adjudication of delinquency could not be treated as a felony criminal conviction for purposes of invoking the predator act.writing for the court,judge ervin pointed out that section b specifically provides that an a djudication of delinquency shall not be deemed a conviction,nor shall it operate to impose any of the civil disabilities ordinarily resulting from a conviction,so d at.judge ervin also noted that t here is no language in section that demonstrates any legislative intent to abrogate the statutory mandate excluding adjudications for delinquency from the consequences of conviction,unless expressly stated otherwise.id.at.the first district vacated the portion of sentence classifying him as a sexual predator and certified conflict with the second district contrary decision in payne.see id.at.
we approve the opinion of the first district court of appeal.consistent with the analysis of the first district,we hold that juveniles who may be charged as adults,but are actually adjudicated as delinquents,do not stand criminally convicted for the purpose of designation as a sexual predator under the predator act.in reaching this conclusion,we note that the legislature has joined the majority of states that have chosen not to subject juveniles to the provisions of their adult sexual offender registration and notification laws 
legislative intent 
it is well settled that legislative intent is the polestar that guides a court statutory construction analysis.see state rife,so d,mclaughlin state,so d.further,we have explained that when the court construes a statute,we look first at the statute plain meaning.moonlit waters apartments,cauley,so d.
as noted,the trial court elected to treat as a delinquent child under the provisions of section c,florida statutes which states 
when a child has been transferred for criminal prosecution as an adult and has been found to have committed a violation of state law,the disposition of the case may be made under and may include the enforcement of any restitution ordered in any juvenile proceeding.
in turn,the relevant portion of section provides 
in order to use this paragraph,the court shall stay adjudication of guilt and instead shall adjudge the child to have committed a delinquent act.adjudication of delinquency shall not be deemed a conviction,nor shall it operate to impose any of the civil disabilities ordinarily resulting from a conviction.
b.stat.emphasis added.initially,we note the lack of ambiguity in the legislature language in section b that an a djudication of delinquency shall not be deemed a conviction,nor shall it operate to impose any of the civil disabilities ordinarily resulting from a conviction.this unambiguous language must then be considered in conjunction with the unambiguous language of section a,which states that an individual will be designated a sexual predator only upon conviction of certain crimes.in the definitions section of the predator act,the term conviction is defined as meaning a determination of guilt which is the result of a trial or the entry of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere,regardless of whether adjudication is withheld.c.stat.adjudications of delinquency are simply not included within this statutory provision.
therefore,upon a plain reading of the controlling statutes,it is apparent that an adjudication of delinquency does not fall under the definition of a felony criminal conviction required under the act.thus,we conclude that an adjudication of delinquency does not trigger the sexual predator status provisions of the predator act.
we also note that other language in the predator act indicates the legislature was fully aware of the unique status of adjudications of delinquency at the time the act was drafted.for example,under the act a sexual offender can be designated as a sexual predator in two different ways,based on the severity of the offender current offense.first,in cases involving a serious current offense,an offender can be designated a sexual predator after a single conviction.see a.stat.second,in cases where the current offense is less serious,the sexual offender can still be designated a sexual predator,if the offender also has prior felonies.see a.stat.subsection b reads,in relevant part 
in order to be counted as a prior felony for purposes of this subsection,the felony must have resulted in a conviction sentenced separately,or an adjudication of delinquency entered separately,prior to the current offense and sentenced or adjudicated separately from any other felony conviction that is to be counted as a prior felony.
emphasis added.although this section was not applicable to,the wording demonstrates that the legislature was aware of the distinct status of adjudications of delinquency in drafting the predator act,and that it intended for adjudications to be counted as prior felonies under the provisions of section b.
obviously,if the legislature intended an adjudication of delinquency to operate as a conviction under the act,it could easily have done so in the same manner provided in section b.the statutory scheme could have included adjudications of delinquency in the definition of a conviction in the predator act or,alternatively,could have provided in section a that sexual predator status attached upon conviction or adjudication of delinquency.
we also note that in other instances when the legislature intended adjudications of delinquency to operate in the same manner as a criminal conviction it has expressly stated so.see,a.stat.a county may adopt an ordinance imposing a fine upon any person who is convicted of or adjudicated delinquent for a crime.stat.a person who violates this section and who has been previously convicted or adjudicated delinquent two or more times of any violation of this section commits a felony of the third degree.stat.when any person pleads guilty or nolo contendere to,or is convicted of or adjudicated delinquent for,any felony,misdemeanor,delinquent act,or criminal traffic offense there shall be imposed as an additional cost in the case the sum of.stat.stating that a criminal history record that relates to a violation of chapter may not be expunged regardless of whether defendant was found guilty or adjudicated delinquent.stat.t he court shall order the offender to undergo hiv testing following conviction or delinquency adjudication.
on the other hand,to find that must be classified as a sexual predator despite the lack of a felony criminal conviction,the court would have to add language to the act that is not there.of course,when construing statutes,courts are not at liberty to add words to statutes that were not placed there by the legislature.see hayes state,so d.
effect of adult filing 
the state notes that was prosecuted as an adult and that the court should find this aspect of the case compelling in determining that an adjudication of delinquency should operate as a conviction.however,we note the legislature has enacted a separate and specific notification and registration scheme for juvenile sexual offenders under chapter,florida statutes see b.stat.requiring department of juvenile justice to inform school superintendent of juvenile sexual offender presence d.stat.expressing legislative intent for department of juvenile justice to develop strategies regarding notification of schools,parents or legal guardians of victims,and law enforcement agencies of juvenile sexual offenders return to the community.this express mechanism for registration and notification of juvenile sexual offenders clearly implies the legislature intent not to subject juveniles who are adjudicated delinquent to designation under the adult predator act 
specific general 
the first district also relied on the rule of statutory construction that the specific statute controls over the general statute and found that section was more specific than the general provisions of the predator act see,so d at.we find the first district analysis sound.under that analysis,even if we were to find conflict between the provisions of section and the predator act which we do not,we would apply the principle of statutory construction that where two statutory provisions are in conflict,the specific statute controls over the general statute.see,state ex rel.johnson vizzini,so d.
in this instance,we agree with the first district that the specific language of section b stating that adjudications of delinquency are not convictions should control over the general use of the term conviction in other statutes,because to hold otherwise would effectively render the limitation in section b meaningless.moreover,as the first district noted 
section c specifically authorized trial courts to enter dispositions under section for juveniles found to have committed certain offenses section specifically dealt with the courts powers of disposition of cases involving juveniles tried as adults and found to have violated the law.accordingly,the provisions in section b excluding adjudications of delinquency from the definition of conviction,takes precedence over the definition of conviction in section c,which generally applies to all sexual offenders.
so d at.to accept the state argument,any statute providing that a conviction triggers a criminal or civil penalty would trump the specific language in section that states that juvenile delinquency adjudications are not convictions.however,that argument would have us virtually ignore the legislature mandate that juvenile dispositions not be treated as criminal convictions and the case law recognizing the distinction.logically,where a juvenile is involved,the statutes specifically related to juvenile offenders should control over statutes that deal generally with the conduct of all offenders.
other contexts 
indeed,florida courts have consistently recognized that adjudications of delinquency do not operate as convictions in a variety of contexts.for example,in merck state,so d,the trial court found that a prior adjudication of delinquency supported the prior violent felony death penalty aggravator.see id.at.on appeal,we noted that it was improper to use an adjudication of delinquency in this manner,because a juvenile adjudication was not a conviction within the meaning of section b,florida statutes and because section,florida statutes,the precursor to the current juvenile delinquency statutes,expressly mandated that adjudications of delinquency were not convictions.id.at.although merck involved a criminal statute and the predator act is ostensibly a civil penalty that does not involve punishment,the reasoning in merck is still instructive,particularly given the similarity between the definition of conviction in the predator act and the definition in the sentencing statute 
several courts have noted that under florida evidence code,adjudications of delinquency,unlike certain types of convictions,can not be used to impeach witnesses.see b.stat.stating that adjudications of delinquency are not to be used as convictions for purpose of impeachment rivers state,so d,dca martin state,so d,dca goodman state,so d,dca.furthermore,florida courts have held that adjudications of delinquency can not be used as convictions for the purpose of sentencing a defendant as a habitual offender.see cotton state,so d,dca gahley state,so d,dca shook state,so d,dca see also city of jacksonville caverly,so d,dca holding statute that permitted state and local subdivisions to recover per diem charges for incarceration from convicted offenders did not allow for recovery from juveniles in detention based on an adjudication of delinquency moody campbell,so d,dca holding previous adjudications of delinquency were not convictions for purposes of determining pretrial bail wilson state,so d,dca holding adjudications of delinquency are not convictions for purposes of determining whether a sentence in excess of sentencing guidelines could be justified by an escalating pattern of offenses.
civil disabilities 
we also note that section b specifically states that adjudications of delinquency should not operate to impose any of the civil disabilities ordinarily resulting from a conviction.section l of the predator act requires a sexual predator to register with the florida department of law enforcement fdle for life,with a limited right to petition for removal of predator status after twenty years moreover,fdle is required to notify the community where a registered predator is living of his or her presence.clearly,requiring to register as a sexual predator and subjecting him to public notice of this status for a lifetime would impose serious civil disabilities upon contrary to the provisions of section b.
adjudications of delinquency 
as discussed above,the first district recognition that a juvenile adjudication of delinquency will not give rise to the same consequences as an adult conviction unless the legislature has expressly stated otherwise is supported by a long line of case law.the distinction between adjudications of delinquency and criminal convictions stems,in large part,from the consistent historical view that delinquent juveniles are not considered adult criminals.as this court has recognized,the juvenile and criminal justice systems are separate and distinct and serve different purposes 
a child offender,even after being adjudicated delinquent,is never held to be a criminal,even if the act would be considered a crime if committed by an adult.th
