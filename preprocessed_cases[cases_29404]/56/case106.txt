the missouri court of appeals made the following factual findings in denying perry ineffective assistance of counsel claim 
there was testimony at the evidentiary hearing that wampler advised perry against making both the january and the january statements to the police.wampler testified that he initially advised perry not to go to the interview on january,but that it was their call.if jermaine wanted to go it would be his call he the client.wampler testified that he did call to confirm the appointment as just a courtesy.on,wampler testified that he advised the perrys to not feel pushed into having to make the appointment with the juvenile officer.wampler testified that he warned them about the pitfalls of talking to the police,but the perrys were hell bent on talking to the police and telling the truth.
conversely,eldo rado perry perry adoptive father testified that he had not scheduled the appointments,but that the decision was made by wampler.he testified that wampler did not advise them against it,and told them to return on january for an appointment with juvenile authorities.mary perry perry mother testified that going to the appointment on january was wampler idea and that he made the phone call to arrange it.she testified that she did not want perry to make a statement.perry testified that when he went to the january interview,it was what his attorney wanted him to do,and that he did not want to go,nor did his parents want him to go to the interview.he testified that wampler set up the interview,and made the decision for him to talk to the police on january.perry also testified that wampler told him it was best to make the statement,and that wampler never said he was better off not talking to the police.
wampler testified that he did not remember whether he scheduled the january meeting,or if someone else did.wampler did state that his general thought was that if perry talked to the police,it might result in him remaining under the juvenile system,and not be certified as an adult.wampler accompanied perry to the january statement.
giving deference to the motion court ability to judge the credibility of the witnesses,this court does not conclude that the court erred when finding this claim to be without merit.there was evidence indicating that the attorney performance was not deficient,as he testified that he advised perry not to talk to the authorities,and perry acted against that advice.
perry state.the district court,after citing the factual findings of the missouri courts,stated 
absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary,the factual determinations of the state court are presumed to be correct.see e.perry has not presented this court with clear and convincing evidence that would cause this court to disregard factual determinations made by the missouri courts.therefore,as stated by the missouri court of appeals,there is evidence tending to show that wampler performance was within the bounds of competency in advising perry not to make a statement to authorities on january and and that perry,at the behest of family members seeking the truth,made the statements anyhow.in light of the facts as found by the missouri courts,this court can not say that the holding of the missouri court of appeals is contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law as is required before this court can issue a writ of habeas corpus.see d.
while the missouri court of appeals made its findings of fact regarding wampler behavior in the process of evaluating perry ineffective assistance of counsel claim,which involved both questions of law and fact,the underlying factual findings are entitled to deference.we agree with the district court that,in the course of rejecting perry ineffective assistance of counsel claim,the missouri court of appeals found it to be a fact that wampler advised perry against making both the january and the january statements to the police.
indeed,perry agrees in his brief that the missouri courts made a factual finding that wampler advised him not to talk to the police on both january and.discussing a statement made by wampler during the january interview,perry argues that t his can not be reconciled with the state court finding that wampler advice to appellant was not to proceed with the interrogation.perry also notes that wampler claimed that he advised appellant not to talk to police on january and,a position which the state court credited.perry argument is not that the missouri courts did not find that wampler advised him not to talk to the police on january and,but that the presumption of correctness of this finding has either been overcome or is inapplicable.he has thus acquiesced in the district court determination that the state court found it to be a fact that wampler advised him not to talk to the police,and he has consequently forfeited any claim based upon the premise that the state court never made such a factual finding.
in attempting to demonstrate that the state courts was inconsistent and contradictory,and thus not entitled to a presumption of correctness,perry relies upon evidence before the state court that wampler affirmatively allowed both interviews to proceed.a deputy juvenile officer testified that wampler called to set up the date and time of the january interview after indicating that perry wanted to come into the office and tell the police what happened.during the audiotaped january interview,the chief juvenile officer told perry that wampler had authorized perry to go ahead and talk to us in his absence and that wampler had indicated to us that you can proceed.and during the audiotaped january interview,wampler,who was present during the first part of the interview,affirmatively indicated to a detective that he was ready to proceed to allow perry to be questioned.
none of this evidence,however,is inconsistent with or contradicts the state court finding that wampler had advised perry not to talk to the police on january and.it does tend to show that wampler left the ultimate choice of whether to talk to the police to his client and that he did not impede perry desire to ignore his legal advice by making statements to the police.but the evidence does not constitute clear and convincing evidence sufficient to rebut the presumed correctness of the state court finding that wampler advised perry not to talk to the authorities and that perry acted against that advice.
perry also argues that the presumption of correctness is not dispositive of his right to relief on this claim because the missouri courts made the inherently contradictory findings that,on the one hand,wampler told him not to make a statement,but that on the other,wampler had valid strategic reasons for advising him to confess.the missouri court of appeals did note that wampler had state d that his general thought was that if movant talked to the police,it might result in him remaining under the juvenile system,and not be certified as an adult.perry state,at.during the hearing,however,in response to the question and still,the meeting on the was still against your advice wampler had testified,it was against my advice and admonition,and when jeremaine said this is what he wanted to do,i said,i with you.i will go with you.and we will go together,and that what we do,we off.earlier in the hearing,wampler had provided a more nuanced explanation of his thoughts about the decision to submit to the january interview,stating,i talked to jeremaine,and,you know,the general thought was that this is what he wanted to do,and he was a fine young man,fetching young man,and looked like if he did testify and cooperate,that there was a possibility that they would certify him.and that was what we were shooting for we did want him certified.we think that wampler eventual recognition of the strategic benefits of cooperating with the police is not sufficiently contradictory to his initial advice and admonition that jeremaine not talk to the police to allow a rejection of the missouri courts factual findings.it is plausible that wampler awareness of both perry earlier fabricated statements to the police and perry steadfast desire to come clean with the truth led him to abandon his attempt to prevent perry from volunteering for another interview.we thus conclude that the missouri courts findings were not inherently contradictory,and thus that their finding that wampler advised perry against speaking to the police on january and should be presumed correct.
simply put,the missouri courts decided to credit the testimony of wampler and the deputy juvenile officer that wampler had advised perry not to speak with the police,and to discredit the testimony of perry and his parents that wampler had advised them to talk to the police.federal habeas review gives federal courts no license to redetermine the credibility of witnesses whose demeanor has been observed by the state trial court,but not by them.see marshall lonberger,d.we therefore reject this claim.
perry also contends that he did not waive his miranda rights knowingly,voluntarily,and intelligently because of his limited intellect and maturity,and because of coercion and pressure applied by the police and juvenile authorities.the state argues that this claim is procedurally barred due to a failure to present it in state court.
to avoid a procedural default,a habeas petitioner must present the same facts and legal theories to the state court that he later presents to the federal courts.jones jerrison,cir.in state court,perry claimed that he did not make a knowing and voluntary waiver of his constitutional rights to remain silent and to counsel because statements elicited from him were in violation of a missouri juvenile court rule requiring the authorities to give juveniles certain warnings about their rights.the factual and legal bases for perry claim in state court thus differed somewhat from those relied upon here,and it is therefore probably barred.we find it unnecessary,however,to resolve that question,as perry claim clearly fails on the merits.
the united states supreme court has made clear that the validity of a miranda waiver has two distinct dimensions whether the waiver is voluntary and whether it is knowing and intelligent.colorado spring,d.we thus evaluate perry claim that his waivers were not knowing,voluntary and intelligent within this bifurcated framework.
we first address perry argument that his miranda waivers were not voluntary.the proper inquiry is whether the miranda waiver was the product of a free and deliberate choice rather than intimidation,coercion,or deception.moran burbine,d united states turner,cir.
perry contends that the police utilized coercive tactics in obtaining his waiver by lying to him about his attorney instructions and subjecting him to repeated questioning.we reject these contentions.first,the record does not show that the police lied to perry,as the truth of their statement to him that wampler has indicated to us that you can proceed with the interview is consistent with the state court finding that wampler had advised perry against making statements to the police but had left the final decision on whether to talk in the hands of perry and his parents.perry argument that his waivers were involuntary because he was repeatedly interrogated over the course of several days is also plainly without merit.the waivers at issue undisputedly occurred before the beginning of each of perry interviews.the quantity and frequency of questions asked within an interview can not possibly have any effect on a waiver that precedes that interview.
to the extent that perry is contending that the frequency and duration of the questioning rendered his confessions involuntary despite his waivers,we reject this contention as well.perry voluntarily appeared at the police station for both of the interviews in which he made the damaging recorded statements used against him at trial.the duration of the questioning was not excessive the january interview lasted one hour,and the january interview lasted hours.transcripts of each of the interviews reveal that,following perry miranda waivers,police investigators asked direct and straightforward questions,and no threats or promises of leniency were made.perry has failed to show that his confessions were involuntary because he has failed to show that he was subjected to coercive police tactics.
we also reject perry argument that his waivers were not knowing and intelligent.a valid miranda waiver must have been made with a full awareness of both the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it.moran,at.the missouri court of appeals found that under the totality of the circumstances,it is clear that perry was fully aware that anything he said during each of his interviews could be used against him in an adult court proceeding.state perry,perry i.perry has not presented clear and convincing evidence sufficient to rebut the presumed correctness of these findings.indeed,there is substantial evidence indicating that perry subjectively understood and waived his rights to remain silent and to have counsel present.as the state court noted,transcripts from perry interviews support a conclusion that he was informed of his rights and was afforded appropriate warnings before the beginning of each interview,and that he affirmatively indicated his understanding of those rights.id.at.perry thus can not prevail on this claim.
perry third claim is that his right to the effective assistance of counsel was violated by wampler disclosure to the prosecution of privileged or secret information obtained from perry during conferences.the proper standard for evaluating perry claim is set forth in strickland washington,d,under which perry must show both deficient performance on wampler part and resulting prejudice to his case.
just prior to perry trial,the special prosecutor disclosed to the trial court that he had met with wampler and that he intended to call wampler to testify that,prior to perry confession to the police,perry made a statement to wampler that he had shot his grandfather twice.after an objection and a hearing to determine whether the statements were protected by the privilege,the special prosecutor decided not to call wampler as a witness.perry contends that,despite the fact that the communications between perry and wampler were never placed before the jury,wampler decision to provide the prosecution with statements made by perry amounts to ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of perry sixth amendment rights.
it is undisputed that wampler met with prosecutors and provided them with statements made by perry during conferences that his parents attended.the missouri court of appeals found that such a meeting is unusual,if not improper,perry state,perry ii,and the district court found that wampler disclosed confidential information regarding petitioner statements to special prosecutors in this case and thus fell below the standard expected of a reasonably competent attorney under similar circumstances.
we agree with the district court that wampler revelation to the prosecution of secret information relating to his representation of perry was professionally unreasonable,whether or not perry statements were protected by the privilege.we also agree with the district court,however,that perry has failed to make the requisite showing that wampler actions prejudiced his defense.
prejudice is shown only where there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.strickland,at.we concede that wampler disclosures may have had some negative impact on perry defense.the special prosecutor gave the following reason to the trial court for seeking to introduce wampler statement i know what coming down the road.the defendant going to say,they forced me to make a statement that was true w e have been told that his position is,i did do this crime,that i confessed to something i did do.the information supplied by wampler gave the special prosecutor insight into the defense strategy of challenging the reliability of perry statements to the police.the mere possibility of wampler testifying might have affected perry defense strategy at trial.because wampler did not testify,however,the theory that his disclosures to the prosecution altered the jury verdict is too speculative to satisfy the prejudice requirement of an claim.perry has failed to show that it was reasonably probable that wampler actions changed the result of his trial.
perry was certified to stand trial as an adult by former missouri circuit judge thomas mcguire.perry contends that the proceedings before judge mcguire violated his rights to due process and equal protection of the law under the fifth and fourteenth amendments because judge mcguire was prejudiced against perry,who is black,because of his race.the due process clause guarantees a fair and impartial judge,of course,but we begin a consideration of this kind of claim with a presumption that are honest and impartial.see gordon hansen,cir per curiam.
perry argument that judge mcguire decision to certify him as an adult was motivated by racial bias is based on racially derogatory remarks that judge mcguire allegedly made off the record.paul hungerford,judge mcguire former bailiff,testified at a motion hearing before the trial court that while the petition to certify perry as an adult was pending,judge mcguire said something to the effect that perry parents had raised a nasty little nigger that killed the best niggers in springfield.hungerford also admitted in his testimony,however,that he had had a disagreement with judge mcguire over a job.in judge mcguire deposition,which was introduced at the hearing,he denied ever having made the comments alleged by hungerford or any other racist comments in connection with the case.the state trial court chose to believe judge mcguire and to disbelieve hungerford,and the state appellate court,in denying the claim,deferred to the trial court superior opportunity to determine the credibility of witnesses whom it observes.perry i,at.
under e,the missouri courts finding discounting hungerford testimony is entitled to a presumption of correctness unless perry can rebut the presumption by clear and convincing evidence,e.he has failed to present such evidence.a federal habeas court has no power to redetermine hungerford credibility.see marshall,at.furthermore,perry has identified no other evidence in the record tending to show that judge mcguire decision to dismiss the juvenile proceeding was the product of racial prejudice.although perry asks us to consider newspaper articles about events involving judge mcguire unrelated to perry proceedings,those articles were not in the record below and,in any event,are necessarily hearsay,and thus could not properly be before the court.
perry argues that he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing in the federal district court in order to develop a factual basis for this claim.a federal habeas court power to conduct an evidentiary hearing is,however,sharply limited by e b,which provides that,as a prerequisite to such a hearing,a petitioner must show that the facts underlying the claim would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that but for constitutional error,no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense.because perry does not even contend that he has any new evidence bearing on his actual innocence,it would be inappropriate to conduct new evidentiary inquiries at this stage in the proceedings.for all of the reasons stated,we deny this claim.
perry was brought to trial and convicted by a jury in september,over years after his original detention in juvenile court.he contends that this delay deprived him of his sixth amendment right to a speedy trial.
the state appellate court evaluated and rejected this claim using the principles outlined in barker wingo,d,under which a court faced with this kind of claim is obliged to consider the length of delay,the reason for the delay,whether the defendant asserted his right in the trial court,and any prejudice that the delay caused the defendant.perry i,at.the court first noted that the delay in bringing perry to trial exceeded eight months,and was thus presumptively prejudicial,inviting further inquiry.id.the court then found that the reason for the delay was a combination of perry engag ing in a vigorous defense,involving the filing of numerous motions,many of which were subsequently amended during the litigation process,and the state engag ing in a vigorous prosecution with its attendant motions,together with its applications for change of judge.id.at.next,the court found that,as perry admitted,he had failed to move for an earlier trial.id.finally,the court found that perry evidence of prejudice from the delay due to his aging and change in personality was speculative,at best.id.internal quotations omitted.
the state court conclusion that perry rights were not violated,arrived at after a careful consideration of the relevant circumstances noted above,was not contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,nor was it based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented to the state court.see d.this claim therefore must fail.
perry asserted,for the first time in the district court,that he was prejudiced because evidence was lost and memories faded during the time between arrest and trial.we agree with the district court that this argument is procedurally barred due to perry failure to present it in state court.
for the reasons indicated,we affirm the district court denial of perry petition.
i agree with the majority in affirming the district court order refusing jeremaine perry habeas petition and join in all parts of the majority opinion except part ii.two reasons cause me to write separately.first,i believe the majority misstates the nature of perry ineffective representation claim and perpetuates an error of the district court.in a normal ineffectiveness case,i would argue we should,as a result,consider the merits of that claim.this is not such a case,which is the other reason i write separately.in my view,decisions of the supreme court compel the conclusion perry did not have a right to counsel under the sixth amendment when he confessed to murdering his grandfather.i would affirm on that basis.
part ii of the majority opinion suffers,in my view,from two maladies.first,it mischaracterizes perry complaint about his attorney conduct.according to the majority,perry claim is this wampler rendered ineffective assistance by arranging for perry to be interviewed by police once without the presence of counsel on january and again with counsel absent for a part of the time on january,during which interviews perry made damaging statements which were used against him at trial.ante at.so stated,the most troubling aspects of perry claim escape review entirely.a fair rendering of the critical part of perry complaint follows wampler acted deficiently in advising perry to confess to murdering his grandfather at the january meeting with police,and in doing so without attempting to engage in plea bargaining to keep perry in the juvenile justice system.this is a serious charge that raises important questions even under the unforgiving standard of strickland washington,d.
the decision to admit to committing a crime is a grave one.it is,in fact,ordinarily the most important single decision in a criminal case.united states gordon,cir holding defendant did not receive effective assistance at plea negotiations when counsel seriously underestimated his exposure at sentencing internal quotation and citation omitted see also united states day,cir same toro fairman,cir a criminal defendant has a right to effective assistance of counsel in deciding whether to accept or reject a proposed plea agreement.any lawyer considering such an option should do so with the utmost care.any court reviewing such a claim should at a minimum acknowledge its nature and seriousness.
the second concern with part ii of the majority opinion is it replicates an error of the district court.the district court misread the state trial court findings of fact.according to its version,the state court found wampler advised perry not to talk to the police on january and again advised him not to talk to them on january,when perry confessed to the murder.the district court deferred to these findings of fact as required by the habeas statute and rejected perry claim because he had not produced clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of correctness such findings enjoy.with those factual findings in place,perry ineffectiveness claim could not survive because,at least so far as the district court could recognize,wampler did not commit the complained of acts.the majority opinion agrees with the district court in all respects the district court reasoning is sound but is based on a false state trial court did not find wampler advised against confessing on january 
on the contrary,the state trial court only unequivocal statement regarding the january meeting shows it found wampler advised confession.the court wrote 
wampler testified that it was his belief the only way to salvage a positive result was to keep perry in the juvenile justice system and do everything possible to prevent movant certification to be tried as an adult.by january,once wampler was finally told the truth by perry,wampler,based on his testimony at the relief hearing,did have a strategy.in his mind,the only strategy left to perry was to cooperate with authorities and convince them that his client,a juvenile,should be handled by the juvenile justice system.even the defendant was aware of the strategy that he and his attorney were trying to employ.
findings of fact conclusions of law and order,app.appendix vol.vii at emphasis added.this passage indicates the court accepted perry claim wampler recommended full cooperation at the january meeting.the state trial court handling of perry claim is consistent with this finding.rather than determine wampler did not act in the manner perry claimed,the court conducted a strickland inquiry based on the premise that wampler did advise confession,and rejected perry claim on the basis he suffered no prejudice from taking that advice id.at.
the district court therefore committed clear error in its analysis and the majority opinion replicates that error.before the presumption of correctness can even arise,the state court must have resolved the merits of a factual dispute.in essence the habeas statute merely codifies the proposition that a state court must have made a finding on a particular issue before a federal court can defer to that finding.united states ex rel.partee lane,cir since i believe the state court actually made the contrary wampler in fact advised conclude the district court also erred in failing to defer to the state court actual finding.since there is no showing the state trial court erred in this,no one seems willing even to engage the trial court findings in their own district court should have accepted that wampler advised perry to confess.
the majority prefers to disregard the district court findings of fact.instead it focuses on the factual findings of the missouri court of appeals and defers to them under the rule of sumner mata,d,as it is expressed in king bowersox,cir.in sumner,the supreme court held that state court factual findings are entitled to deference under the habeas statute,regardless whether it is a state trial court or state appellate court making those findings.i differ with the majority over the applicability of that rule to this case i can not agree the missouri court of appeals made findings of fact in its opinion.instead,as the majority opinion quotes at length,the court of appeals listed the record evidence both supporting and undermining the proposition that wampler advised perry not to talk to the police recitation complete,the court of appeals concluded,g iving deference to the motion court ability to judge the credibility of the witnesses,this court does not conclude that the court erred when finding this claim to be without merit.perry state,perry ii.on its face then,the court of appeals opinion states it is not finding facts,but instead performing the customary responsibility of an appellate a factual finding under a standard of review.this court previously has held a state appellate court makes a legal determination when it reviews a trial court factual finding under a standard of review,and such a legal determination is not entitled to a presumption of correctness.jones jones,cir.in jones,the court wrote 
the missouri court of appeals upheld the trial court implicit finding with respect to each struck venire member under the clearly erroneous standard and stated its legal conclusions in language such as the conclusion is not clearly erroneous,we defer to that finding,or we find no error.sumner does not require us to apply the habeas statute presumption to these legal conclusions.
it therefore is concluded the majority is wrong in determining the missouri court of appeals made findings of fact when it recited the evidence in the record.
indeed,if the majority were correct that the missouri court of appeals made its own findings of fact,the state appellate court would have committed an error of law missouri supreme court rules of criminal procedure specify the standard of review for state appellate courts considering appeals from state trial court orders on challenges under rule.according to such rule,a ppellate review of the trial court action on the motion filed under this rule shall be limited to a determination of whether the findings and conclusions of the trial court are clearly erroneous.rule k see also,missouri madison,the standard of review for denial of a motion for relief is whether the motion court findings and conclusions were clearly erroneous.if the state appellate court issued its own findings,it would have impermissibly exercised de novo review of the state trial court findings of fact.burton missouri,were this court to furnish the necessary findings
