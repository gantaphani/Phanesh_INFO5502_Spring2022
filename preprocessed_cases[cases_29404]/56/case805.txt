introduction 
the california department of corrections cdc appeals from an order of the juvenile court declaring section of title of the california code of regulations regulation invalid and enjoining the cdc from enforcing the regulation to prevent visitation between inmate vaughn and his sons lucas and joshua regulation prohibits inmates who have been incarcerated for committing certain sexual offenses from participating in visits with minor children.on appeal,the cdc challenges whether the juvenile court had jurisdiction to order visitation in this case and whether the juvenile court exceeded its authority in declaring the regulation in question invalid pursuant to a petition filed under welfare and institutions code section.we conclude that the superior court acted beyond the scope of its authority in addressing the validity of the regulation.we further conclude that because the court had no authority to act pursuant to welfare and institutions code section and because the court followed improper procedures in invalidating the regulation,the juvenile court did not have the authority under the circumstances of this case to order that the cdc allow visitation between vaughn and his sons.
factual and procedural background 
robin petitioned the san diego county juvenile court to permit her two minor sons,lucas and joshua,to visit their incarcerated father,vaughn,pursuant to welfare and institutions code section.
vaughn was sentenced to nine years four months in state prison on september,as a result of convictions for one count of attempted lewd acts on a child,subd.a,one count of attempted forcible lewd acts on a child,subd.b,and counts of child pornography into the state,subd.a.vaughn was previously convicted in of three counts of lewd acts on a child,subd.a.
lucas and joshua were not the victims of vaughn crimes.following vaughn arrest,child protective services interviewed the boys and made a home visit.no evidence of misconduct was found with respect to either child,and the boys were permitted to remain with robin,their mother.both sons visited their father at pleasant valley state prison every six weeks without incident until october.
in october,prison authorities elected to prohibit lucas and joshua from visiting vaughn.prison officials relied on regulation to prevent the boys from being able to visit their father.regulation,which became effective on march,prohibits inmates who have been incarcerated for committing certain sexual offenses from receiving visits from minor children,regardless of whether or not the children were victims of the offenses.regulation makes an exception for child victims who have been permitted to visit by order of the juvenile court 
robin was informed by the prison authorities that if she wanted the visits to continue,she would have to get an order from the juvenile court authorizing visits between her children and vaughn.
on december,robin filed a petition with the juvenile court on behalf of lucas and joshua requesting an order allowing the boys to visit their father pursuant to section of the welfare and institutions code a hearing on the petition was held on january,after which the court took the matter under submission.the cdc was not notified of the hearing,and it was not represented at the hearing.
on february,the trial court issued a temporary order permitting lucas and joshua to visit vaughn in prison.the court also issued an order to show cause directed to the cdc to show why regulation should not be held invalid as conflicting with penal code section.
the court held a hearing on the order to show cause on march.the cdc was present with counsel.on april,the trial court issued a formal order granting robin petition,declaring regulation invalid,and enjoining the cdc from enforcing the regulation at all facilities throughout the state.the court ordered that visits by lucas and joshua with their father could resume,effective immediately.the court stayed for days the portion of the order declaring regulation invalid in order to allow the cdc an opportunity to seek review.
on april,the cdc filed a petition for a writ of supersedeas and a notice of appeal.in the writ petition,the cdc requested a stay of the april,order to the extent the order prohibited the cdc from enforcing regulation throughout the state.this court issued a temporary order staying the april,order,as requested by the cdc,but did not stay that portion of the order permitting lucas and joshua to visit their father.
on may,this court,on its own motion,determined that the case should proceed as a civil case,and set a briefing schedule for the appeal.on june,this court granted the cdc writ petition and directed the parties to address,in addition to the issues raised on appeal,whether the juvenile court had the authority to issue an order to show cause to the cdc on its own motion.
discussion 
the cdc contends that the juvenile court exceeded its jurisdiction in this case because,under welfare and institutions code section,a juvenile court possesses the authority to order visitation only when the child seeking visitation has been prohibited from visiting the incarcerated individual by a sentencing court pursuant to penal code section in this situation,the children seeking visitation were prohibited from visiting the incarcerated individual pursuant to regulation,a general cdc regulation that prohibits visitation between inmates convicted of certain sexual offenses and all minor children.because consideration of these matters requires only the interpretation of statutes and regulations,the issues before us present pure questions of law which we review de novo.see burden snowden cal th,d.
we agree with the cdc to the extent it argues that the juvenile court did not possess the authority to order visitation between lucas and joshua and their father pursuant to welfare and institutions code section.however,we disagree with the cdc to the extent it argues that the juvenile court error was in basing its jurisdiction on welfare and institutions code section.the juvenile court quite clearly did not authorize visitation pursuant to welfare and institutions code section.rather,the court ordered visitation between vaughn and lucas and joshua only after it concluded that regulation was void for exceeding the scope of penal code section.
we conclude,however,that the juvenile court acted beyond the scope of its authority in reaching the merits of the validity of regulation on a petition brought pursuant to welfare and institutions code section.the court did not have the authority,under the circumstances of this case,to enjoin the cdc from enforcing its regulation,or to order visitation between vaughn and his sons.
a.the juvenile court did not have the authority to order visitation pursuant to welfare and institutions code section 
the only authority a juvenile court has to order visitation between an inmate and a juvenile is pursuant to welfare and institutions code section.under that section,such action by the juvenile court is authorized only when a sentencing court has previously prohibited the visitation pursuant to penal code section.thus,unless a sentencing court has prohibited visitation pursuant to penal code section,a juvenile court lacks the authority to order visitation pursuant to welfare and institutions code section.
the trial court acknowledged that it had no authority to order visitation between vaughn and his sons pursuant to welfare and institutions code section 
i going to issue an order that allows visitation,and i do this not under section and not based on a finding that the best interests of the children are served by the visitation because we have done that whole process.but i making this order based on the fact that it appears to me that the statute is,in fact,invalid and that there seems to be a pattern of an attempt to deny visitation under this invalid statute,and it,i think,needs to be addressed.
we agree with the juvenile court assessment that it had no power to order visitation in this case pursuant to a petition filed under welfare and institutions code section.in a situation involving juveniles who were not the victims of the incarcerated individual crimes,as in this case,welfare and institutions code section does not apply and may not be used to order visitation between an inmate and nonvictim children.
b.the cdc actions did not confer jurisdiction on the court pursuant to welfare and institutions code section 
vaughn,robin,lucas and joshua all argue that even if the juvenile court did not originally have jurisdiction to order visitation pursuant to welfare and institutions code section,the cdc should be estopped from asserting that the juvenile court lacked jurisdiction because the cdc referred robin to the juvenile court in the first instance,and suggested that she petition the court under the process envisioned in welfare and institutions code section.we disagree.
jurisdiction over the subject matter in this case can not be conferred upon the court merely by the cdc suggestion to a custodial caregiver that she seek an order from the juvenile court pursuant to welfare and institutions code section although a party who erroneously invokes the jurisdiction of a court may be estopped from later arguing that the court lacked jurisdiction see remillard brick dandini d,such is not the case here.the cdc did not institute any action before the juvenile court in this case.rather,the cdc suggested to robin,through a form letter,that the only way the cdc would allow her children to visit with their father was by way of an order from the juvenile court pursuant to welfare and institutions code section.the cdc reference to the only available method for seeking visitation under regulation does not serve to invoke the jurisdiction of the court.in fact,the cdc was not even a party to the case,and was brought into the matter only pursuant to the court order to show cause.under these circumstances,the cdc is not estopped from challenging the court jurisdiction.
c.the court erred in invalidating regulation on the ground that it exceeds the scope of penal code section 
the trial court concluded that section impermissibly enlarges the scope of penal code section and welfare and institutions code section,and is invalid.the court determined that the cdc had improperly expanded the scope of penal code section by denying sex offenders the right to visit with any child,and not just their child victims.however,the court was incorrect in asserting that regulation must fall within the scope of penal code section in order to be valid.
a regulation is impermissible only if it exceeds the scope granted by the relevant enacting legislation california teachers commission on teacher credentialing th,d or if it conflicts with any act of the legislature american airlines los angeles county d.administrative regulations that alter or amend the authorizing statute or enlarge or impair its scope are void and courts not only may,but it is their obligation to strike down such regulations.citation,fair employment housing com.cal d.
regulation was not promulgated pursuant to either penal code section or welfare and institutions code section.rather,the relevant enacting legislation authorizing the cdc to promulgate regulations regarding the administration of state prisons,including visitation rules,is penal code section.this provision of the penal code provides in relevant part 
the director may prescribe and amend rules and regulations for the administration of the prisons and for the administration of the parole of persons sentenced under section except those persons who meet the criteria set forth in section.the rules and regulations shall be promulgated and filed pursuant to chapter commencing with section of part of division of title of the government code,except as otherwise provided in this section and sections to,inclusive.all rules and regulations shall,to the extent practical,be stated in language that is easily understood by the general public,subd.a.
regulation does not improperly expand upon the authority granted to the cdc to create rules for the administration of the state prisons pursuant to penal code section,nor does it conflict with this provision.it is widely accepted that the cdc has the authority to enact reasonable rules and regulations regarding visits between inmates and their families.advocates gomez th,d.a regulation limiting visitation between inmates and their families falls within the scope of the powers granted to the cdc under penal code section,the enacting legislation 
because regulation was not intended to effectuate the legislature command set forth in penal code section,the differences between the regulation and this statutory section cited by the juvenile court as reasons to invalidate the regulation are irrelevant further,regulation does not conflict with either penal code section or welfare and institutions code section in that the regulation does not permit visitation between a sexual offender and a young victim despite the existence of a sentencing court order preventing such visitation.in fact,it disallows visitation between sexual offenders and children entirely.nor does it not prohibit visitation between a sexual offender and a young victim despite a juvenile court order allowing the visitation.in fact,the regulation allows for an exception to the prohibition against visits between certain sexual offender inmates and minor children in situations in which a juvenile court has ordered,pursuant to welfare and institutions code section,that the child victim be allowed to visit with the sexual offender.in this way,the regulation is written so as to avoid any conflict with penal code section and welfare and institutions code section that specifically authorize the courts to determine when a prisoner may or may not visit with the child victim of the prisoner sex crime.
we recognize that the combined effect of penal code section,welfare and institutions code section,and regulation is that the only children who may be allowed to visit with inmates convicted of certain sexual offenses are those children who were the victims of the sexual crimes.this result is counterintuitive,at best,since it permits inmates access to their former victims while denying them access to juvenile family members who were not their victims however,although the combined effect of regulation,penal code section,and welfare and institutions code section,challenges the bounds of common sense,this effect alone does not mean that the regulation is in conflict with either penal code section or welfare and institutions code section.in fact,the regulation carefully carves out an exception for orders arising out of welfare and institutions code section so that it does not conflict with these statutes 
d.the trial court did not have the authority to reach the merits of the question of the validity of regulation 
the trial court erred in addressing the merits of whether the regulation in question is reasonably related to a legitimate penological interest.because this action was instituted by a petition for an order granting visitation pursuant to welfare and institutions code section petition the juvenile court recognized it had no authority to action was the incorrect procedural vehicle by which to challenge the validity of regulation.as such,the juvenile court acted beyond the scope of its authority in turning a welfare and institutions code section petition,which is meant to address only the best interests of a child,into a direct action challenging a cdc regulation.the court action was procedurally improper.
the court determined that it had jurisdiction to rule on the validity of the cdc regulation pursuant to section of the government code,which grants a superior court the authority to rule on the validity of an administrative regulation.section provides in relevant part 
a any interested person may obtain a judicial declaration as to the validity of any regulation or order or repeal by bringing an action for declaratory relief in the superior court in accordance with the code of civil procedure.the right to judicial determination shall not be affected by the failure either to petition or to seek reconsideration of a petition filed pursuant to section before the agency promulgating the regu
