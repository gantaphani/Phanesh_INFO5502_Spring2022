kent appeals the order declaring his daughter,a dependent of the juvenile court under welfare and institutions code section,subdivision d kent contends we must reverse the jurisdictional order because of the ineffective assistance of appointed counsel in not interviewing her therapist,the juvenile court abuse of discretion in excluding the therapist prehearing statements and limiting her testimony on the ground of invocation of the privilege,and the lack of evidentiary support for the court finding that kent sexually molested.we conclude kent lacks standing to raise the ineffective assistance of counsel issue,and his other contentions lack merit.we affirm the order.
factual and procedural background 
was born in trinidad in.her parents divorced when she was about eight years old,and she lived under difficult circumstances.when she was about nine years old,a neighbor sexually molested her.her father found out and beat her.in maternal great aunt,and kent,her former husband,who live in san diego,obtained permission from her parents to bring her here to live with them.
and kent intended to adopt together,but their relationship ended in march when he commenced dissolution proceedings.moved out of the home and asked to live with her.was not interested,however,because she and fought and had threatened to send her back to trinidad when she misbehaved.kent proceeded with the adoption alone,and it was finalized in march.
in late disclosed to a school official that kent had sexually molested her.in december the san diego county health and human services agency the agency removed from the home and placed her at polinsky children center polinsky.the agency filed a petition on her behalf under section,subdivision d,which alleged that between and june,kent sexually molested her,including digital vaginal touching and penetration,oral copulation and intercourse.
the agency detention report states told the social worker that kent had sexually molested her between the ages of and years.the molestation stopped when kent got a new girlfriend.said she was afraid her father will harm her since she has finally told the truth.she did not want to return to his home or to have any contact with him.she stated that she wanted to stay somewhere safe and she is willing to stay in a foster home.attached to the detention report was a police report discussing disclosures of molestation.
kent denied allegations.he told the social worker that in began to act strange and evasive.he had read diary and learned she was having sex with a boy,and a man.he confronted the teenage boy,and became upset.he described her as emotionally charged.
at the detention hearing,the court detained at polinsky and ordered no visitation for kent.the agency was to provide voluntary services and referrals to him.
a contested jurisdiction hearing was held over several days in march,during which numerous witnesses testified.in summary,testified that kent began sexually molesting her about two months after she moved to san diego,and he continued doing so until a week before her fourteenth birthday.the abuse began with inappropriate touching and escalated to digital penetration,oral sex and intercourse.a few of friends testified she revealed the sexual molestation to them.
kent denied ever sexually abusing.he testified that on one occasion he and were sitting on her bed while he was helping her with homework,and he accidentally touched the inside of her thigh when he reached out to try to keep things from falling off her desk.she became upset and immediately reported the incident to.a few witnesses who knew him and testified she did not seem afraid of him or reveal any sexual molestation to them.further,the adoptions social worker who handled kent adoption of testified she never mentioned any sexual abuse,and was clear with me that she want ed to be adopted by kent.
kent sought to introduce prehearing statements of a therapist had been seeing for about three years,cherie verber.verber told the social worker and a police detective that never revealed that kent abused her,and verber did not believe her story.the information was included in the agency jurisdiction report,and a san diego police department investigator report.kent also sought to elicit verber live testimony on the same issue.the court struck verber prehearing statements from the reports,and limited her trial testimony based on invocation of the privilege.
on march,the court made a true finding by clear and convincing evidence on the sexual molestation allegation.the court sustained the petition,accepted jurisdiction and removed custody from kent and continued her in a licensed foster home.the court explained,ultimately it a credibility case,and i do believe kent indicated he intended to voluntarily waive reunification services,but he had not yet completed a written waiver form.
kent moved for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence intended to impeach credibility.the court denied the motion without prejudice as his motion was procedurally improper.he then filed a petition for modification under section requesting that the court reverse its true finding based on the new evidence.
at a hearing on may,the court denied the petition.kent then submitted a written waiver of reunification services,subd.b,and the court accepted the waiver as knowingly made the court limited kent right to make educational decisions for pending further court order,and appointed a casa court appointed special advocate to make educational decisions for her.the court also scheduled a review hearing,noting i t appears that the child will not be returned home by the next review hearing and a permanent plan would need to be selected.the court then set her plan as a permanent plan living arrangement.
discussion 
iineffective assistance of counsel 
kent contends we must reverse the court jurisdictional order because counsel rendered ineffective services by not interviewing her therapist,verber.his theory is that had counsel interviewed verber,she would have learned the therapist believed was lying about kent conduct,and thus the outcome of the jurisdictional hearing would have supposedly been different.he states that by failing to properly investigate credibility,her counsel could not have acted in her best interests.kent cites section,subdivision e,which provides that to represent a child interest appointed counsel shall make or cause to be made any further investigations that he or she deems in good faith to be reasonably necessary to ascertain the facts,including the interviewing of witnesses.
the agency and assert kent lacks standing to challenge the competency of her counsel.generally,parents can appeal judgments or orders in juvenile dependency matters.citation.however,a parent must also establish she or he is a party aggrieved to obtain a review of a ruling on the merits.citation.therefore,a parent can not raise issues on appeal from a dependency matter that do not affect her or his own rights.in re frank th.to be aggrieved,a party must have a legally cognizable immediate and substantial interest which is injuriously affected by the court decision.a nominal interest or remote consequence of the ruling does not satisfy the standing requirement.in re carissa th.an appellant can not urge errors that affect only another party who does not appeal.in re vanessa th.
we conclude that kent can not assert statutory right to be represented by competent counsel because that right is personal to s.in re caitlin th.interests do not interweave with kent interests.where the interests of two parties interweave,either party has standing to litigate issues that have a n impact upon the related interests.id.at.kent asserts he has a personal interest in the matter because he was falsely labeled as a sexual molester.harm to a parent reputation or credibility,however,remote consequence of the ruling that does not satisfy the requirements for standing.in re paul th.
most importantly,it would be nonsensical to confer standing on a party,whose interests may be adversarial to those of a minor,when the minor has independent counsel on appeal.this court,consistent with statutes and california rules of court,regularly appoints independent counsel for minors on appeal.appellate counsel,after reviewing the matter thoroughly and speaking with,her trial counsel,the social worker and verber,has not raised the issue of ineffective assistance of trial counsel,and agrees we should affirm the court jurisdiction order.kent,who has relinquished reunification services and any potential reunification with or custody of,is hardly in a better position to protect and assert her interests.
in any event,kent position lacks merit.the record shows counsel did know verber believed was lying,because verber gave her opinions to the social worker and a police detective without consent,and the opinions were included in reports,copies of which counsel would have had.the information was redacted when invoked the privilege,but her counsel obviously knew verber position on credibility.kent was not prejudiced because verber opinion did not cause counsel to take a different position pertaining to whether the court should exercise jurisdiction,and indeed,she represented to the court that was of sufficient age and maturity to invoke the privilege to exclude verber information.
exclusion of privilegea 
in a related argument,kent contends the court improperly excluded verber hearing statements and limited her trial testimony based on the privilege.the contention lacks merit.
in ruling on the admissibility of evidence,the trial court is vested with broad discretion.t he court ruling will be upset only if there is a clear showing of an abuse of discretion.citation.the appropriate test for abuse of discretion is whether the trial court exceeded the bounds of reason in re cole th,cole.
it is established that the privilege applies to the relationship between a dependent minor and his or her therapist.citations.t he purpose of the privilege is to protect the privacy of a patient confidential communications to his or her psychotherapist.citations.cole,supra,th at.in this relationship between a patient and therapist,the patient generally is the holder of the privilege unless the patient has a guardian or conservator.ibid.
in dependency proceedings,the minor appointed counsel serves as his or her guardian ad litem.cole,supra,th at.a guardian ad litem is responsible for both evaluating the situation and needs of the child and mak ing recommendations to the court concerning the best interests of the child.citation.the guardian ad litem is required to represent and protect the rights and best interests of the child.cole,at.
under section,subdivision f either the child or the counsel for the child,with the informed consent of the child if the child is found by the court to be of sufficient age and maturity to so consent,which shall be presumed,subject to rebuttal by clear and convincing evidence,if the child is over years of age,may invoke the privilege,and if the child invokes the privilege,counsel may not waive it,but if counsel invokes the privilege,the child may waive it.counsel shall be holder of the privilege if the child is found by the court not to be of sufficient age and maturity to so consent.thus,once an attorney has been appointed for a minor in a juvenile dependency matter,the attorney holds the privilege to therapeutic communications sought to be introduced in evidence.cole,supra,th at.t he holder of the privilege is determined at the time the disclosure of the confidential communications is sought to be introduced in evidence.ibid.
kent complains that did not invoke the privilege herself,and the court erred by allowing her counsel to invoke the privilege on her behalf without making any finding was of insufficient age and maturity to invoke the privilege herself.it does not appear that section,subdivision f provides counsel may invoke the privilege on the child behalf only when the child is of insufficient age or maturity to invoke the privilege him or herself.rather,counsel may invoke the privilege in addition to the child on the child behalf when the child is of sufficient age and maturity to consent to the invocation,but in that instance the child wishes override counsel wishes.
we need not engage in statutory interpretation,however,because did invoke the privilege herself.her attorney explained to the court during the jurisdiction hearing,i have advised in regards to the privilege.she and she is of sufficient age and maturity to invoke the privilege and object to verber testimony.was present when her counsel made the statement.contrary to kent view,was not required to take the stand and personally advise the court she wished to invoke the privilege.her attorney properly spoke on her behalf as her legal representative,just as attorneys customarily speak on their clients behalves on a variety of issues.indeed,after counsel spoke,the court determined that holds the privilege,and it not been waived.
we also reject kent assertion forfeited the privilege because of a lack of immediacy in raising the issue.kent cites cole,supra,th at page,for the proposition that this court found the invocation of the privilege was untimely in that case because it was made three days after trial commenced.in cole,however,we found the invocation timely,explaining at the start of the contested jurisdiction and disposition hearing and about three days after mark the stepfather submitted his witness list,giddens the children attorney asserted the privilege.this was well in advance of corbett being called to testify at trial.cole,supra,th at,fn.in cole,we held that the proper time for the guardian to invoke the privilege is at the time the disclosure of confidential discussions is attempted.id.at.
kent claims did not invoke the privilege until several months into trial.the claim is nonsensical since the contested jurisdictional hearing was held over several days in march.counsel raised the issue of privilege at the detention hearing on december,the first hearing in this case.she clearly stated she was not waiving any privilege on behalf,which put kent on notice of her position.further,expressly invoked the privilege during the jurisdictional hearing when kent attempted to introduce verber prehearing statements and testimony.the invocation was timely and caused kent no surprise.
kent suggestion that the privilege was forfeited as verber disclosed many statements and made many oral disclosures to the police and social workers,which appeared in their reports,also lacks merit.verber did not hold the privilege,did,and she did not authorize verber to reveal confidential information and opinions to third parties.counsel explained to the court b efore i could speak with verber in regards to the privilege,she had already discussed this case with the social worker and with the detective.so she had already given her impressions and opinions based on her sessions with to other people.today i wanted to discuss the privilege further in regards to informing the court and counsel that verber had disclosed that information without consideration of right to confidentiality,and that she is the holder of that privilege.
similarly,we are unpersuaded by kent assertion the privilege is inapplicable because he and had some joint sessions with verber.he cites no authority to support his argument.p arties are required to include argument and citation to authority in their briefs,and the absence of these necessary elements allows this court to treat appellant issue as waived.interinsurance exchange collins th.
additionally,kent points out that the privilege is not absolute in dependency proceedings.he argues that without verber statements and testimony both the court and the a gency would be hampered in their efforts to ensure the minor best interests.
kent cites in re kristine th kristine,in which the teenaged minor,kristine,appealed the juvenile court order permitting the agency to receive certain information from her therapist regarding her therapy,despite her invocation of the privilege.the agency sought from kristine therapist one letter that gives a general idea of whether or not the client is making progress.id.at.the agency attorney represented that she would tell the social worker not to ask for all the details of what kristine discloses in her therapy and the agency merely sought general progress reports on probably a quarterly or every basis.ibid.
this court concluded under the facts there that the privilege protects kristine confidential communications and details of the therapy,but does not preclude her therapist from giving circumscribed information to accomplish the goal of therapy.kristine,supra,th at.we noted that w ithout information from the therapist,both the court and the agency would be hampered in their efforts to ensure that kristine receives services to protect her and enable her to make a successful transition from minor to adult.ibid.we added that the legislative history of section,subdivision f does not suggest the legislature intended to make unavailable that important information.ibid.we recognized the child substantial privacy interest,and the foreseeable harm to her that disclosure posed,and limited the disclosure to matters that reasonably assist the court in evaluating whether further orders are necessary for kristine benefit and preserves the confidentiality of the details of her therapy.ibid.
kent also cites in re pedro th pedro,a juvenile delinquency case,in which the court relied on evidence code section in holding the juvenile court properly admitted testimony of the minor therapist after invocation of the privilege.the court explained quite obviously,the court ability to evaluate the minor compliance with a condition of the court disposition order and its effect on his rehabilitation would be severely diminished in the absence of some type of feedback from the therapist,and it would be unreasonable for the minor to think otherwise.pedro,at.the court noted the juvenile court carefully sought to circumscribe the therapist testimony so that the details of the therapeutic session would not be disclosed.as a consequence,no testimony was admitted regarding any specific statements the minor had made to the therapist,any advice given to the minor by her,or any diagnosis made by her.under the circumstances,the privilege did not preclude the therapist from testifying concerning the minor participation and progress in the treatment plan.id.at.
in kristine,this court explained the rationale of pedro,supra,th,is applicable in the juvenile dependency context,in which therapy has a dual of the child to ameliorate the effects of abuse or neglect and the disclosure of information from which reasoned recommendations and decisions regarding the child welfare can be made.as the supreme court has observed,w ithout the testimony of psychologists,in many juvenile dependency and child custody cases superior courts and juvenile courts would have little or no evidence,and would be reduced to arbitrary decisions based upon the emotional response of the court.kristine,supra,cal.app th at.
we can not say the court ruling was arbitrary,capricious,or patently absurd,or that no reasonable court would have ruled the same way.in re geoffrey d.in deciding to redact verber prehearing statements from the reports,and to exclude the circumscribed testimony kent sought,the court presumably determined that under the reasoning of kristine w.and related opinions,the information was unhelpful to its decision.credibility was a hotly contested issue,and the court already knew she did not reveal to verber any sexual molestation by kent,as admitted that during her testimony.it appears that kent primary purpose in seeking admission of the evidence was to discredit and protect his reputation,and not to learn of her treatment progress,or to assist the agency and the court in fashioning recommendations and decisions regarding her welfare.under the circumstances,the court did not abuse its discretion by opting for full confidentiality to protect substantial privacy interest.kent claims that without the evidence the court may have been reduced to a fairly arbitrary he said,she said decision based on an emotional response,but it was the court province,not verber,to decide credibility.
substantial evidencea 
kent challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the court jurisdictional order.substantial evidence is evidence that is reasonable,credible,and of solid value such that a reasonable trier of fact could make such findings.citation.it is axiomatic that an appellate court defers to the trier of fact on such determinations,and has no power to judge the effect or value of,or to weigh the evidence to consider the credibility of witnesses or to resolve conflicts in,or make inferences or deductions from the evidence.we review a cold record and,unlike a trial court,have no opportunity to observe the appearance and demeanor of the witnesses.citation.issues of fact and credibility are questions for the trial court.citations.it is not an appellate court function,in short,to redetermine the facts.in re sheila th,sheila.under the substantial evidence rule,we must accept the evidence most favorable to the order as true and discard the unfavorable evidence as not having sufficient verity to be accepted by the trier of fact.in re casey th.
we recount the key evidence supporting the court ruling.
