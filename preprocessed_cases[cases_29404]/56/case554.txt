discussion 
maximum confinement timea.contentions 
minor argues his maximum confinement time should be six years,rather than nine years,because it was not alleged,and he did not admit,that the robbery was committed in concert.the people contend the fact of whether the robbery took place in concert is a sentencing factor that does not need to be pled and minor was on notice that he was pleading to an in concert first degree robbery,because the petition listed the maximum confinement time as nine years.we agree with minor argument.
legal and factual background 
the maximum confinement time for a first degree robbery that was not committed in concert is six years,subd.a b.the maximum confinement time for a first degree robbery committed in concert is nine years,subd.a a.
in the petition filed against minor,it was alleged that o n or about march,in san bernardino county,the crime of home invasion robbery,in violation of penal code section,a felony,was committed by minor,who did unlawfully and by means of force and fear take personal property from the person,possession and immediate presence of the victim and said offense was perpetrated in an inhabited dwelling house,trailer coach or inhabited portion of a building.if an adult is convicted of this offense the possible punishment would be.
sentencing factor 
we begin by addressing the people first contention that acting in concert is a sentencing factor,which does not need to be alleged in the petition.for reference,we set forth the language of section,subdivision a robbery of the first degree is punishable as follows 
a if the defendant,voluntarily acting in concert with two or more other persons,commits the robbery within an inhabited dwelling house,by imprisonment in the state prison for three,six,or nine years.
b in all cases other than that specified in subparagraph a,by imprisonment in the state prison for three,four,or six years.
at the outset,we note that the people provide no argument in support of their conclusion that acting in concert is a sentencing factor that does not need to be pled however,at the end of their conclusion,the people provide one citation to a case that quotes the legislative history of section the statutory language regarding robberies occurring in concert was added to section in.stats,ch.accordingly,we do not examine the legislative history.
nonetheless,we construe the people argument as asserting that the factor set forth in section,subdivision a a,is a sentencing factor as provided for in california rules of court,rule c,which includes as aggravating sentencing factors a ny other factors statutorily declared to be circumstances in aggravation.we further construe the people argument as contending that the maximum confinement time for a robbery in concert is akin to an upper term sentence,and therefore would not need to be pled and proven beyond a reasonable doubt in juvenile court.see in re christian th,d the aggravating and mitigating circumstances sentencing scheme applicable to adult offenders is not applicable in juvenile courts.
in order to determine whether or not,in juvenile court,the prosecution is required to allege that a robbery took place in concert,we must determine whether section,subdivision a a,operates as a sentencing factor,a sentence enhancement,or a separate offense.it is unclear from the face of the statute how the legislature intended for it to operate,because the section sets forth an entirely separate sentencing scheme,which is not typical of enhancements or sentencing factors,which generally add additional time to an established term,rather than creating a new sentencing scheme.see people rayford cal th,d,rayford enhancements usually add additional time to a term of imprisonment or if the enhancement provides for a sentencing scheme the term enhancement is explicitly used in the statutory language.on the other hand,section does not appear to create a new offense,because the language,r obbery of the first degree is punishable as follows,causes the statute to read as though it is merely a sentencing scheme for the offense of robbery that is defined in sections and,subd.a.
our supreme court has set out guidelines for determining whether a particular statutory provision is a substantive offense,or an enhancement or penalty provision.people garcia th,d garcia,fn.omitted.in rayford,our supreme court examined whether section,which sets forth the punishment for kidnapping,contained a separate offense in subdivision d for kidnapping with the intent to commit a sexual offense.rayford,supra,cal th at,d.the court concluded section,subdivision d,did set forth a separate offense from simple kidnapping.rayford,at,d.in reaching this conclusion,the court looked first to the words of the statute,then to the legislative history of the section,the way the statute was treated in other related code sections,and the fact that the legislature itself expressly characterized the section as a separate crime.rayford,at,d.garcia,supra,th at,d.the primary factor in deter
