defendant,woodrow brown,is an inmate in the department of corrections,where he is serving a sentence for attempted murder of a police officer,a crime he committed in at the age of.the issue presented by this case is whether defendant should be granted postconviction relief on the grounds that the statute under which he was transferred from juvenile custody to criminal court and subsequently sentenced was declared invalid by our court in people cervantes.the circuit court of cook county found defendant claim to be frivolous and patently without merit.the appellate court reversed and remanded for a new transfer hearing in accordance with the law currently in effect.d.the state petitioned for leave to appeal,which we allowed.defendant then asked for,claiming that the appellate court erred in determining which statute should govern his transfer hearing on remand.for the reasons that follow,the judgment of the appellate court is affirmed in part and reversed in part,and the cause is remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings,with directions.
the events giving rise to this case began in october of,when chicago housing authority officer william henderson was shot in the face with a caliber rifle at close range,breaking his jaw.defendant was arrested for the crime.because he was years old at the time,he was initially the subject of a petition for adjudication of wardship pursuant to the juvenile court act of ilcs et west.the state petition alleged that defendant had committed the offenses of attempted murder,aggravated battery with a firearm,and aggravated discharge of a weapon.
in february of,the state petitioned to have defendant tried as an adult under this state criminal laws.pursuant to that petition,a transfer hearing was conducted by the circuit court in accordance with the standards set forth in section of the juvenile court act of ilcs west,which had been enacted as part of public act,eff.january,commonly known as the safe neighborhoods law.that provision stated that if a juvenile was charged with a class x felony other than armed violence or various other serious offenses and the court determined that there was probable cause to believe that the allegations were true,there was a rebuttable presumption that the minor was not a fit and proper subject to be dealt with under the juvenile court act of and that the cause should to be transferred to criminal court.
the circuit court allowed the petition and ordered defendant case to be heard under this state criminal laws.defendant was subsequently indicted on two counts of attempted first degree murder,one count of aggravated battery with a firearm and four counts of aggravated battery.
the following october,defendant agreed to plead guilty to one count of attempted first degree murder of a peace officer,a class x felony ilcs c west,in exchange for dismissal of all other charges and imposition of a sentence of years imprisonment.defendant never moved to withdraw his plea or sentence,nor did he bring a direct appeal.in march of,however,he filed a petition under the hearing act ilcs et west alleging that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel because one of the public defenders who represented him had misled him about the circumstances regarding his guilty plea and the length of the prison term he would receive.
defendant petition was summarily dismissed by the trial court on the grounds that it was frivolous and patently without merit.see ilcs a west.defendant failed to timely appeal from the circuit court judgment,and his motion for leave to file a late notice of appeal was denied.
there were no further developments in the case until june of,when defendant filed a new postconviction petition.although successive postconviction petitions are generally not permitted see ilcs west,defendant argued that fundamental fairness called for relaxation of that rule in this case see people morgan,because the safe neighborhoods law,which added the rebuttable presumption provision under which he was transferred to criminal court,had since been declared unconstitutional and void ab initio by our court in people cervantes,on the grounds that it violated the clause of the illinois constitution of.const,art.iv,d.
the circuit court rejected defendant argument.as it had with defendant initial postconviction petition,it dismissed his successive petition as frivolous and patently without merit.defendant appealed.the appellate court unanimously reversed.in so doing,it did not rely on the fundamental fairness exception to the normal prohibition against successive postconviction petitions.rather,based on a previous decision by the appellate court in people pena,d,the court reasoned that because the statutory provisions under which defendant was transferred from juvenile to criminal court and then sentenced were found to be void ab initio,defendant transfer,plea and conviction were likewise void.invoking the principles that a claim that a judgment is void is not subject to waiver and may be raised at any time,either directly or collaterally,and that courts have an independent duty to vacate void orders and may vacate a void order sua sponte even if it is not challenged by the parties see people thompson,the court concluded that it was obliged to vacate defendant conviction and remand for a new transfer hearing.d at.
having reached that conclusion,the court next considered what law should govern the new transfer hearing following remand.the reason this was problematic was that after our court invalidated the safe neighborhoods law in people cervantes,the general assembly enacted public act,eff.january,commonly known as the juvenile justice reform provisions of.the new law,codified at ilcs a west,contains a presumptive transfer provision virtually identical to the safe neighborhoods law provision under which defendant original transfer was carried out.for the purposes of this appeal,the only difference is that unlike the safe neighborhoods law,the juvenile justice reform provisions of have not been challenged on grounds.
while the new law was not a departure from the standards which governed defendant original transfer,it did represent a change as compared to the law in effect before the safe neighborhoods law was enacted.under the former law,there was no presumption in favor of transfer.see ilcs west.except in certain circumstances not present in this case,the determination as to whether a juvenile should be tried under the criminal laws was a matter for the court sound discretion based on its assessment of various statutory factors and any other relevant matters.see people clark.in light of this difference,defendant argued that if he is subject to the new law on remand rather than the law as it existed before the safe neighborhoods law took effect,it will be significantly easier for the state to obtain his transfer to criminal court and greatly increase the possibility that the punishment he ultimately receives will be more severe.according to defendant,such a result would contravene the intent of the legislature and violate the prohibitions against ex post facto laws set forth in the united states constitution 
the appellate court disagreed.it held that application of the provision would not violate the prohibition against ex post facto laws because the provision does not provide for a greater punishment.it merely affects the procedure by which punishment is determined.similarly,the court reasoned that while the provision does contain a burden of proof standard not present in the prior law,ex post facto concerns are not implicated because the new burden does not affect the determination of guilt or innocence,does not make it easier for the state to obtain a conviction,and does not alter any available defenses.d at.the court therefore held that the new provision set forth in the juvenile justice reform act may be applied to defendant case on remand.d at.
in its appeal to our court,the state argues that the appellate court analysis of defendant claims is erroneous.as previously indicated,the appellate court decision was predicated on our holding in people cervantes,that public act,the statute pursuant to which defendant was transferred to criminal court and subsequently sentenced,is void.the state does not take issue with that holding.rather,it contends that the appellate court applied the holding incorrectly.specifically,it argues that while the statute itself may be void,defendant transfer,conviction and sentence are merely voidable.as a result,defendant may not avail himself of the rule that void judgments may be attacked at any time.instead,the challenge to his transfer,conviction and sentence must meet the normal requirements governing successive petitions for postconviction relief.
the state contends that those requirements have not been satisfied by defendant in this case.in the state view,the arguments upon which defendant postconviction petition is premised have been waived.while the waiver rule may be relaxed based on considerations of fundamental fairness,the state argues that under people pitsonbarger,establishing fundamental fairness requires a showing that there was a legally cognizable cause for defendant failure to raise the claim in his initial postconviction proceeding and that actual prejudice would result if defendant were denied consideration of the claimed error.according to the state,defendant has failed to meet either prong of this test.it asserts that the circuit court was therefore correct in summarily denying defendant postconviction petition.
defendant,for his part,contends that the circuit court judgment was properly reversed by the appellate court.in his view,the appellate court was correct in holding that the constitutional defects in the safe neighborhoods law rendered his transfer,conviction and sentence void,not merely voidable,and that he was entitled to a new transfer hearing on remand.where defendant parts company with the appellate court is with respect to the law which should govern the proceedings on remand.defendant asserts that the appellate court erred in rejecting his ex post facto claims and that his case should be governed by the law as it existed prior to enactment of the safe neighborhoods law and juvenile justice reform provisions of.
in analyzing the parties respective arguments,we begin by noting that our review of this case is de novo.that is so because the matter comes before us on review of the summary dismissal of a postconviction petition and presents only questions of law.see people boclair,people daniels.
the first question we must address is whether the appellate court was correct in concluding that defendant transfer from juvenile to criminal court was void.we believe that it was.as indicated earlier in this opinion,the statutory provisions pursuant to which defendant transfer was carried out were enacted as part of the safe neighborhoods law public act,a statute which we found to be unconstitutional in people cervantes.under the established precedent of this court,a statute which violates the clause is void in its entirety.people carrera.as a result,all of the provisions of the safe neighborhoods law,including the specific provisions amending the juvenile court act of pursuant to which defendant was transferred to criminal court,are invalid.more than that,they are void ab initio.as such,they have no force or effect.it is as if they had never been passed.people carrera,at.
when a court exercises its authority over a minor pursuant to the juvenile court act of,as the court did here in entertaining the state transfer petition,it must proceed within the confines of that law and has no authority to act except as that law provides.see people jaime.because the particular statutory provisions under which defendant was transferred are void ab initio and have never had any valid legal force,it necessarily follows that the transfer itself can be afforded no legal recognition.the transfer is void just as the transfer statute is void.defendant must therefore be granted a new transfer hearing.
the same conclusion was reached by the appellate court and conceded by the state under similar circumstances in people pena,d,a decision upon which the appellate court in this case relied.unlike pena,in which the validity of the transfer was challenged on direct review of a judgment imposed following a bench trial,the attack on the transfer here comes in the context of a successive postconviction petition following entry of judgment based on a guilty plea.these distinctions,however,do not alter our analysis.a guilty plea does not preclude a defendant from challenging a circuit court judgment as void ab initio people guevara,and,as the appellate court in this case correctly pointed out,an attack on a void judgment may be raised at any time.it does not depend on the hearing act for its viability.people thompson.
having concluded that defendant is entitled to a new transfer hearing,we must next consider what statute should govern that proceeding.because the safe neighborhoods law is void ab initio,the version of the juvenile court act in existence prior to its amendment by that legislation remained in effect.harshman dephillips.the neighborhoods law version of the statute was therefore the controlling law in,when defendant committed the offenses which gave rise to this case.
the juvenile justice reform provisions of,which reinstituted the rebuttable presumption standard of the safe neighborhoods law,were not enacted until the following year and did not take effect until the year after that.as we have indicated,defendant argues that to apply the juvenile justice reform provisions to his case would violate the united states constitution prohibition against ex post facto laws.he further asserts that subjecting his case to the new statute would contravene the intent of the legislature as set forth in the statute.
statutes are presumed constitutional,and the courts of this state have a duty to construe enactments by the general assembly so as to uphold their validity if there is any reasonable way to do so.people jones.consistent with this obligation,our court will not consider a constitutional question if the case can be decided on other grounds.if a court can resolve a case on grounds,it should do so.people lee.constitutional issues should be reached only as a last resort.in re.
in the case before us today,the appellate court elected to resolve the parties disagreement regarding which version of the law should apply by focusing on defendant ex post facto challenge.under the principles we have just reviewed,this approach was improper.rather than addressing the ex post facto claims,the court should have begun its analysis with consideration of defendant nonconstitutional contention,namely,that application of the new law to his case would be contrary to the legislature intent.
where,as here,a case implicates a statute enacted after the events giving rise to the litigation,illinois courts evaluate the temporal reach of the new law in accordance with the standards set forth by the united states supreme court in landgraf usi film products,d.commonwealth edison will county collector.under the landgraf standards,the threshold inquiry is whether the legislature has expressly prescribed the statute temporal reach.if it has,that expression of legislative intent must be given effect absent some constitutional prohibition against doing so.allegis realty investors novak.
the juvenile justice reform provisions of contain such a provision.although the law was enacted in june of,section of the statute called for its delayed implementation.the provisions contained in article were not to take effect until january.the remaining sections of the law,including the provisions containing the rebuttable presumption on transfers,were to take effect on january.in light of these terms,it is clear that the law was intended to have only prospective application.the state has not directed our attention to anything in the united states or illinois constitution which would prohibit the law from being applied in that way.we must therefore give effect to the legislature intent and conclude that the rebuttable transfer provisions of the juvenile justice reform provisions of are applicable only to juvenile proceedings which commenced on
