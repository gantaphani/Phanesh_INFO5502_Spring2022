introduction 
donald schmidt,age,seeks his release on parole from the california department of corrections and rehabilitation,division of juvenile facilities formerly,the department of the youth authority in the juvenile court sustained a welfare and institutions code section petition alleging that year old schmidt had committed sodomy and first degree murder of a girl.schmidt was committed to the cya on october.at the age of his commitment was extended by trial court order pursuant to section,which at that time authorized a extension of commitment where discharge of a person from the control of the cya would be physically dangerous to the public because of the person mental or physical deficiency,disorder,or abnormality.former in re howard cal th,d.subsequently,schmidt cya commitment was extended under section for three additional periods.his current commitment began on november,and expires on november.
on june,the youthful offender parole board parole board ordered that schmidt be released on parole.six days later,on june,the parole board vacated its parole release order on the ground that it did not have the authority to parole a person committed under section.schmidt then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in which he sought reinstatement of the original parole release order.the trial court granted the petition on the ground that under the statutory scheme for extended commitment,section et,the parole board maintained control of the committed person subject to the provisions authorizing parole and discharge.
on appeal,the people contend that the parole board acted lawfully in vacating its original parole order because the statutes governing extended commitment,section et,do not authorize release on parole.schmidt disagrees.he construes the statutes governing extended commitment to provide that the cya control over a person committed under section includes the power to release the committed person on parole.after carefully examining the relevant statutes,we conclude that the cya is not authorized to release on parole a person committed under section.
however,we also determine that the cya is authorized under the statutory scheme for extended commitment to conditionally release schmidt during his current extended commitment period.therefore,we will reverse the order granting schmidt petition for a writ of habeas corpus and remand the matter to the trial court with instructions to vacate its order reinstating the june,parole release order and to issue a new order remanding the matter to the parole board for further proceedings in accordance with due process and the views expressed in this opinion.
ii.factual and procedural background 
cya commitment proceedings 
on january,a section petition was filed alleging that schmidt had committed the sodomy and first degree murder of a girl the evidence presented at the jurisdictional hearing showed that schmidt was years old on december,when he visited the home where the victim,resided with her family.while and her sister were taking a bath,their mother allowed schmidt to enter the bathroom and wash his hair.while schmidt was still in the bathroom,mother took sister out of the bathtub and went to a bedroom to get clothing.remained alone in the bathtub.
when mother came out of the bedroom five minutes later,she encountered schmidt carrying from the bathroom and exclaiming,i sorry.i did mean to do it.was taken to the hospital by ambulance but died two days later,on january.the autopsy showed that died as the result of a brain injury caused by drowning.additionally,the autopsy revealed a recently inflicted two and inch hemorrhage consistent with forcible penetration of rectum by either a penis or a object.
at the end of the jurisdictional hearing the trial court found true the allegations of sodomy and first degree murder based on homicide during the act of a felony sexual assault.schmidt was committed to the cya for a maximum life term.after two appeals in re donald,supra,in re donald,supra,this court struck the first degree murder finding and affirmed a finding of second degree murder.
schmidt was not released from the cya when he reached the age of in march.his commitment was extended for two years pursuant to section by a february trial court order.before the extended commitment ended on february,the parole board initiated proceedings to release schmidt on parole.the district attorney opposed schmidt release and retained a psychiatrist who reported that schmidt was physically dangerous to the public due to a mental disorder or abnormality.at a hearing held january,the parole board considered the opinion of the district attorney psychiatrist as well as the opinion of a cya psychologist who recommended that schmidt be released on parole.after the hearing,the parole board denied parole and recommended an expedited section proceeding.
on february,the district attorney filed a section petition to extend schmidt commitment for a second period and the matter proceeded to a jury trial.after a mistrial,a second jury found in september that schmidt was physically dangerous to the public and the trial court extended schmidt cya commitment for two more years.schmidt trial testimony included his admission that he picked as his victim because she could not fight back and because he felt like destroying her life in the same way his own life had been destroyed by child abuse.he decided to sodomize only after he entered the bathroom,and he thought of his girlfriend in order to get an erection.schmidt further admitted that he left in the tub,went to the kitchen and smoked a cigarette,and then returned to the bathroom and pretended to discover that had accidentally drowned.cya staff testified that schmidt had given varying accounts of his offense,including telling them that he had held underwater to keep her from crying and that she was flailing when he sodomized her.on appeal,this court affirmed the order extending schmidt commitment to the cya.people schmidt,supra,wl.
schmidt cya commitment was further extended by two subsequent section proceedings his current commitment commenced on november,after he waived a section hearing.according to schmidt,he submitted to the section petition knowing that his cya treatment team was planning to recommend that he be paroled in maybe a few more months.schmidt commitment expires on november.
current parole proceedings 
in february,the cya treatment team recommended that schmidt be paroled at the time of the parole hearing that was to be held in may.the recommendation was included in a parole consideration hearing report,dated february.in the report,the treatment team reviewed the circumstances of schmidt offense,his current behavioral issues,his exemplary interactions with peers and staff,his educational and employment background,and other matters relevant to the team parole recommendation.the report concluded,donald has completed all of his board ordered and staff identified group requirements several times over.he has utilized every program the youth authority has to offer with the exception of parole supervision.the treatment team recommends parole at his projected board date of may in order to take advantage of parole services and support during his reintegration into the community.
thereafter,in a letter dated february,the parole board notified the trial court,the public defender,the county sheriff,and the district attorney that the board would review schmidt for consideration of parole on or after days.after the parole hearing was held the parole board issued its june,order releasing schmidt on parole on or after.the order specified numerous conditions of parole,including,among other things,placement in the plaza hotel,electronic monitoring,participation in a management program,hours of community service,drug and alcohol testing,and counseling.additionally,schmidt was prohibited from being present in the area of nightclubs and where minors congregate.he was also prohibited from associating with minors or using the internet to contact minors.
however,schmidt was not released on parole in accordance with the june,order.on june,the parole board placed a stay on schmidt release.four days later,on june,the parole board held a special agenda,nonappearance hearing.the parole board then issued an order dated june,which stated,review of section indicates that the parole board does not have parole over court commitment orders pursuant to section.therefore,the board order and decision in this case of june,is vacated and nullified.
schmidt challenged the parole board june,order by filing a petition in the superior court for a writ of habeas corpus directing the parole board to reinstate its june,parole release order.schmidt argued that the parole board had authority to parole a person committed under section under the statutory scheme for cya commitment.further,schmidt asserted that the parole board improper rescission of its decision to grant parole had been influenced by the district attorney protests to government officials.
the superior court granted the habeas corpus petition in its order of january.as stated in the superior court order,the court ruled that the parole board had the authority to grant parole pursuant to section because that section provides the cya with control over all persons in the custody of the cya under a section extended commitment,subject to the section provisions authorizing parole and discharge.relying on this interpretation of section,the superior court found that the parole board decision to revoke parole was not based upon evidence but upon the erroneous conclusion that it lacked authority to grant parole.
the superior court also noted in its order that the parole board erroneous determination of its parole power would allow the cya to discharge someone,but would not authorize the more restrictive order for parole,an unlikely legislative intention.accordingly,the trial court granted schmidt habeas corpus petition and directed the cya to reinstate its june,parole release order.
iii.discussion 
appealability 
the people appeal of the trial court january,order granting schmidt habeas corpus petition and directing the parole board to reinstate its original parole release order is authorized under penal code section,which provides,in pertinent part,that w here an application for a writ of habeas corpus has been made by or on behalf of any person other than a defendant in a criminal case,an appeal may be taken to the court of appeal from a final order of a superior court granting all or any part of the relief sought,in re carr th,d.while the appeal was pending,we granted the people petition for a writ of supersedeas and stayed enforcement of the trial court order until final determination of the appeal.
standard of review 
on appeal,the people contend that the trial court erred in its interpretation of sections through,which comprise the statutory scheme for extended cya commitment.they assert that section authorizes the cya to either discharge a person committed under section or seek recommitment,but provides no parole authority.schmidt disagrees.in his view,the trial court correctly determined that section authorizes release on parole because that section provides that the cya has control of a person committed under section subject to other statutory provisions authorizing parole and discharge.
we begin our analysis with a determination of the appropriate standard of review where,as here,the issue to be decided involves statutory interpretation.on appeal,we review questions of law under the de novo standard of review.amdahl county of santa clara th,d.matters of interpreting and applying a statute are questions of law.citations.ibid.thus,we independently construe statutory law and administrative rules and regulations.ibid.
the scope of our independent review is governed by california supreme court authority.in statutory construction cases,our fundamental task is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the statute.citation.estate of griswold cal th,d.we begin by examining the statutory language,giving the words their usual and ordinary meaning.citation.id.at,d.if the terms of the statute are unambiguous,we presume the lawmakers meant what they said,and the plain meaning of the language governs.citations.ibid.
if there is ambiguity,however,we may then look to extrinsic sources,including the ostensible objects to be achieved and the legislative history.citation.estate of griswold,supra,cal th at,d.in such cases,we select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the legislature,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute,and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.citation.ibid.
additionally,however,we must consider the statutory language in the context of the entire statute citation and the statutory scheme of which it is a part.phelps stostad cal th,d.when used in a statute words must be construed in context,keeping in mind the nature and obvious purpose of the statute where they appear.citations.moreover,the various parts of a statutory enactment must be harmonized by considering the particular clause or section in the context of the statutory framework as a whole.citations.ibid.
having determined the applicable standard of review for trial court rulings that involve statutory interpretation,we turn to an overview of the statutory scheme for extended cya commitment,section et.
c.the statutory scheme for extended commitment,section et.
the welfare and institutions code specifies the maximum time that a person may be detained by the cya in section a person committed by the juvenile court,section a person committed after a misdemeanor conviction and section a person committed after a felony conviction the cya maximum jurisdiction accordingly varies dependent upon whether the offense was a misdemeanor or a felony and whether there has been a conviction and discharge is generally mandatory when jurisdiction terminates.in re valenzuela d,fn.in most instances an offender can not be held in the youth authority beyond his or her birthday.chaparro superior court d.
prior to,detention of a youth beyond the age of was not authorized,with one exception.where cya believed that the youth remained a danger to the public and the maximum term prescribed for his or her offense had not expired,former section authorized the cya to petition the committing court for an order sending the youth to state prison or placing him or her on probation.former,in re mcinturff cal d.
in,the legislature added a second statutory exception to the general rule of mandatory discharge no later than the age of.sections through were added and sections,and were amended at the request of the cya to provide that an order for further detention could be made by the committing court pursuant to sections et.in re valenzuela,supra,d at.youth authority extended time of detention state bar.by enacting sections through,the legislature intended to provide procedures whereby a person in the custody of the youth authority who is otherwise required by age or passage of time to be discharged,but who is,by reason of mental or physical deficiency,disorder,or abnormality,a physical danger to the public,can be detained for a further period upon proper application by the youth authority and order of the court.legis.counsel on bill reg.sess.
the statutory scheme set forth in section et provides for the civil commitment of persons under the control of the cya.in re gary cal d.t he scheme involves neither a juvenile proceeding nor an extension of a prior juvenile court proceeding.in re howard,supra,cal th at,d,howard instead,a proceeding under section results in a modification of the dispositional order.in re steven th,d.
under the current version of section,when the cya determines that discharge of a person from the control of the department at the time mandated by other statutes would be physically dangerous to the public because of the person mental or physical deficiency,disorder,or abnormality which causes the person to have serious difficulty controlling his or her dangerous behavior,the department must request the filing of a petition for continued commitment of the person.howard,supra,cal th at,d,construing former.the petition must be filed at least days before the time discharge would otherwise be required.
where the trial court determines that the section petition on its face supports a finding of probable cause,the court is required to hold a probable cause hearing.the trial court reviews the evidence and determines whether there is probable cause to believe that discharge of the person would be physically dangerous to the public because of his or her mental deficiency,disorder,or abnormality which causes the person to have serious difficulty controlling his or her dangerous behavior,subd.b.if the trial court decides that probable cause exists,the person is entitled to a jury trial.in re gary,supra,cal d.
the jury or the trial court if jury trial is waived determines at trial whether,under the reasonable doubt standard of proof,the person is physically dangerous to the public because of his or her mental or physical deficiency,disorder,or abnormality which causes the person to have serious difficulty controlling his or her dangerous behavior,subd.b.a person may be committed for up to two years if the trier of fact finds that the person satisfies the statutory criteria for dangerousness.howard,supra,cal th at,d.section also provides that the person must be discharged from cya control unless a new petition for extended commitment is filed and a new order for continued detention is made.thus,under section a person may be recommitted for periods indefinitely upon compliance with the statutory procedure set forth at section et.howard,supra,at,d.
having reviewed the statutory scheme for extended commitment,our next task is to determine whether a person committed under section may be released on parole.
release on parole 
the statutory scheme for the extended commitment of a person in the custody of the cya,section et,does not expressly provide that the cya has the authority to release on parole a person committed under section.the extent of the cya control over a person committed under section is generally prescribed by section.thus,as the trial court and the parties correctly determined,in order to decide whether the cya has the authority to parole a person committed under section it is necessary to construe the provisions of section.
section provides in its entirety,when an order for continued detention is made as provided in section,the control of the authority over the person shall continue,subject to the provisions of this chapter,but,unless the person is previously discharged as provided in section,the authority shall,within two years after the date of that order in the case of persons committed by the juvenile court,or within two years after the date of that order in the case of persons committed after conviction in criminal proceedings,file a new application for continued detention in accordance with the provisions of section if continued detention is deemed necessary.these applications may be repeated at intervals as often as in the opinion of the authority may be necessary for the protection of the public,except that the department shall have the power,in order to protect other persons in the custody of the department to transfer the custody of any person over years of age to the director of corrections for placement in the appropriate institution.each person shall be discharged from the control of the authority at the termination of the period stated in this section unless the authority has filed a new application and the court has made a new order for continued detention as provided above in this section.
the people argue that section does not authorize parole because that section only authorizes discharge or recommitment of a person committed under section.in the people words,the cya authority to grant early release to a section commitment is limited solely to those instances when it determines that a person may be discharged consistent with the protection of the public,based on the language of section providing the cya with the authority to discharge as provided in section.the people further assert that the only applicable provision under section regarding discharge is subdivision a,which provides that the cya may d ischarge him or her from its control when it is satisfied that discharge is consistent with the protection of the public.
the people also maintain that the provisions of the welfare and institutions code giving the cya parole authority,apply only to wards serving a criminal sentence,consistent with the dictionary definition of parole as a term applying to release from a sentence or commitment based on a crime,as opposed to a civil commitment for mental health care.
schmidt disputes the people interpretation of section,arguing that the trial court analysis was correct.the trial court determined that the parole board has the authority to grant parole because section expressly provides the cya with control over all persons in the custody of the cya under a section extended commitment,subject to the section provisions authorizing parole and discharge.schmidt emphasizes the trial court construction of the phrase subject to the provisions of this chapter in section as the key to a finding of parole authority,because the provisions of this chapter that apply to a person committed under section include the parole authority provided by section.
schmidt further contends that section can not be logically construed to limit the cya authority to either discharging the person or seeking recommitment and thus,as the people argue,to implicitly preclude parole of a person committed under section.schmidt asserts that the language in section limiting the cya authority merely prohibits the cya from seeking recommitment under section if the cya has previously discharged the person.
applying the rules of statutory interpretation,we conclude that the cya does not have statutory authority to release on parole a person committed under section.as we will further explain,it is apparent upon close examination of the provisions authorizing parole that the cya does not have authority to parole a person after the date of mandatory discharge because the cya parole authority is coextensive with the length of maximum cya jurisdiction.
section,subdivision a,expressly provides that the parole board may retain the minor or the young adult on parole status for the period permitted by sections,and.as we have discussed,sections,and prescribe the length of maximum cya jurisdiction and the corresponding date of mandatory discharge.thus,the statutory scheme for parole of youthful offenders et authorizes the parole board to retain a minor or young adult on parole during the period prior to the date of mandatory discharge prescribed by sections,or.for that reason,as our supreme court has stated,a parolee must acknowledge that he or she is still under the control of the authority and that violations of parole conditions may result in return to an authority institution for the remainder of the commitment period.people olivas cal d.
thus,since the purpose of a section commitment is to extend the detention of a dangerous person beyond the date discharge would otherwise be mandatory under the applicable statute either,or,a person committed under section may not be released on parole because the cya no longer has parole authority pursuant to section,subdivision a.
in the present case,the record reflects that schmidt reached the age of in march,and his commitment was extended for two years pursuant to section by a february trial court order.the parole board authority to parole schmidt therefore expired in march when he reached the age of mandatory discharge under sections through.accordingly,the trial court erred in ruling that the parole board had the authority to parole schmidt pursuant to section.
conditional release 
our determination that the cya is not authorized to parole a person committed under section does not end our inquiry.we asked the parties to submit supplemental briefing on the following issue whether any provisions of the welfare and institutions code,including but not limited to section,subdivision a,authorize the conditional release of a person committed under section.
in their supplemental briefing,the parties apply their arguments regarding parole authority to the question of whether conditional release is authorized for a person committed under section.the people contend that conditional release is not authorized because section limits cya early release authority solely to discharge as provided in section,subdivision a,which authorizes the cya to discharge a person from its control when it is satisfied that discharge is consistent with the protection of the public.schmidt again disagrees,arguing that statutory authorization for conditional release is provided by section,subdivision a,which provides that the parole board may permit the ward his or her liberty under supervision and upon conditions it believes are best designed for the protection of the public.schmidt also asserts that conditional release or outpatient treatment is a hallmark of virtually every confinement and commitment scheme,benefiting both the public and the individual by providing a tool for successful reintegration into society 
having carefully reviewed the statutory scheme for extended cya commitment et,we conclude that the cya has the authority to conditionally release a person committed under section.our analysis is founded on the following language of section when an order for continued detention is made as provided in section,the control of the authority over the person shall continue,subject to the provisions of this chapter,giving these words their usual and ordinary meaning,as we are required to do estate of griswold,supra,cal th at,d,we read section to provide that when a person cya commitment is extended under section,the cya control over that person continues to the extent authorized by the other provisions of the chapter containing section,which is chapter of division of the welfare and institutions code.
the provisions of chapter of division of the welfare and institutions code include section,which,as schmidt emphasizes,provides that the cya has the authority to permit a person committed to the department his or her liberty under supervision and upon conditions it believes are best designed for the protection of the public,subd.a.this language implicitly authorizes conditional release because it allows the cya to release a person from custody under supervision and with conditions.moreover,section has been construed to vest the cya with wide discretionary power in the treatment of a person committed to it.in re herrera cal d,disapproved on other grounds in people olivas cal d.
accordingly,we find that section does provide that a person committed under section,and who therefore is not eligible for parole,may be conditionally released under supervision as authorized by section,subdivision a.we also find that that the period of conditional release may not extend beyond the expiration of the section commitment period,because,pursuant to section,the cya is required to discharge a person when the section commitment period expires absent the filing of a petition for continued detention.
our determination is consistent with the requirement that we consider statutory language in the context of the entire statute and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part.phelps stostad,supra,cal th at,d.following this rule of statutory interpretation,we reject the people contention that section limits the cya control over a person committed under section to either discharge or recommitment.the people argument depends upon a phrase from section,discharged as provided in section,which is included in the first sentence of section when an order for continued detention is made as provided in section,the control of the authority over the person shall continue,subject to the provisions of this chapter,but,unless the person is previously discharged as provided in section,the authority shall file a new application for continued detention 
the people interpret the phrase discharged as provided in section to provide that discharge is the exclusive means by which a person committed under section may be released.to the contrary,as we have discussed,section incorporates the provisions of section implicitly authorizing conditional release,subdivision a,since those provisions are included in chapter of division of the welfare and institutions code.section also authorizes the cya to discharge a ward from its control when it is satisfied that discharge is consistent with the protection of the public,subd.a.the provisions of section authorizing discharge thus apply to a person committed under section.however,there is no language in either section or section that expressly restricts the cya options with respect to a person committed under section to either discharge or recommitment,or that precludes conditional release.
f.other statutory schemes for involuntary commitment 
our determination that a person committed under section may be conditionally released is in accord with other statutory schemes for involuntary commitment that provide for conditional release or some form of supervised control other than confinement.one example is the sexually violent predators act,section et,which provides for conditional release.a person committed as a sexually violent predator may be placed in the community under supervision and treatment if it is unlikely that the person will engage in sexually violent criminal behavior due to his or her diagnosed mental disorder,pursuant either to proceedings initiated by the department of mental health or upon petition by the committed person people collins th,d people cheek cal th,d.
other involuntary commitment schemes provide for outpatient treatment.the mentally disordered offender law,et provides that a defendant with a severe mental disorder,who meets certain other statutory criteria including posing a serious threat of physical harm to other people,may be involuntarily committed as a mentally disordered offender as a condition of parole or upon termination of parole and be required to submit to mental health treatment,subd.a.where the committing court determines that there is reasonable cause to believe that the person can be safely and effectively treated on an outpatient basis,the committed person may be released for outpatient treatment,subd.a,subd.d.
similarly,a defendant involuntarily committed as a narcotics addict pursuant to welfare and institutions code section may be released on outpatient status where the parole board determines that the defendant has recovered from narcotics addiction or imminent danger of addiction.pursuant to penal code section,placement on outpatient status is also possible for a person committed to a state hospital or other treatment facility pursuant to penal code section not guilty by reason of insanity,or penal code section mentally incompetent to stand trial.thus,in several other involuntary commitment schemes,the legislature has expressly provided for a form of supervised release during the commitment period and the procedure by which the committed person may be released.
conclusion 
we recognize that the statutory scheme for extended commitment,section et,does not include detailed procedures for conditional release.for example,there are no provisions for initiation of conditional release proceedings,notice,a hearing,appointment of counsel,or supervision of a person conditionally released into the community.we respectfully invite the legislature to review the statutory scheme for extended commitment,to provide statutory direction regarding the appropriate procedures for conditional release of persons committed under section in accordance with the requirements of due process,and to specify that the period of conditional release may not extend beyond the expiration of the section commitment period.
we emphasize that our determination that the cya has authority to conditionally release a person committed under section is consistent with the legislative purpose of the juvenile law,as expressed in section the purpose of the juvenile delinquency laws is twofold to serve the best interests of the delinquent ward by providing care,treatment,and guidance to rehabilitate the ward and enable him or her to be a and productive member of his or her family and the community,and to provide for the protection and safety of the public in re charles th,d noting also that,subd.b,authorizes punishment consistent with rehabilitative objectives,subds.a,b,d.
we believe that conditional release serves the purpose of rehabilitation by facilitating the transition of a committed person from confinement in a cya facility to life as a productive member of the community.at the same time,conditional release serves the purpose of public safety,because conditional release requires supervision and compliance with certain conditions,and the cya retains the authority to return a person to confinement where conditional release is unsuccessful.additionally,information regarding the committed person performance on conditional release is relevant to the determination of whether confinement is no longer necessary because the committed person does not continue to be a danger to the public.
in the present case,we will reverse the trial court order granting schmidt habeas corpus petition and remand the matter to the trial court with instructions to vacate its order reinstating the june,parole release order and to issue a new order remanding the matter to the parole board for further proceedings in accordance with due process and the views expressed in this opinion.we express no opinion with regard to the merits or outcome of any future proceedings.
iv.disposition 
the order of january,granting respondent schmidt petition for a writ of habeas corpus is reversed and the matter is remanded to the trial court with instructions to vacate its order reinstating the june,parole release order and to issue a new order remanding the matter to the parole board now the board of parole hearings for further proceedings in accordance with due process and the views expressed in this opinion.the stay issued february,is vacated.
effective july,the california youth authority is known as the department of corrections and rehabilitation,division of juvenile facilities,welf.for ease of reference and because the name change occurred during the course of the proceedings at issue in the present appeal,we will use the acronym cya throughout this opinion to refer to the california department of the youth authority and its new name,the department of corrections and rehabilitation,division of juvenile facilities.
all further statutory references are to the welfare and institutions code unless otherwise indicated.
the california supreme court in in re howard,supra,cal th at,d,determined that to preserve its constitutionality,the statutory scheme for extended commitment,section et,should be interpreted to contain a requirement of serious difficulty in controlling dangerous behavior.the legislature amended section,effective july,to expressly include that requirement.stats,ch.
on july,the youthful offender parole board and youth authority board was replaced by the board of parole hearings.for ease of reference and because the name change occurred in the course of these proceedings,we will refer to the board of parole hearings as the parole board throughout this opinion.
in,former section provided,any person who is under the age of years when he violates any law of this state or of the united states or any ordinance of any city or county of this state defining crime other than an ordinance establishing a curfew based solely on age,is within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court,which may adjudge such person to be a ward of the court.
we take judicial notice of this court opinion in three previous appeals,in re donald may,nonpub.opn,in re donald,nonpub.opn,and people schmidt,wl nonpub.opn,subd.d.our summary of the pertinent factual and procedural background of this case includes some background information taken from our prior opinions that was not included in the record on the present appeal.
in,former section provided,whenever the youthful offender parole board determines that the discharge of a person from the control of the youth authority at the time required by section,or,as applicable,would be physically dangerous to the public because of the person mental or physical deficiency,disorder,or abnormality,the board,through its chairman,shall request the prosecuting attorney to petition the committing court for an order directing that the person remain subject to the control of the authority beyond that time.the petition shall be filed at least days before the time of discharge otherwise required.the petition shall be accompanied by a written statement of the facts upon which the board bases its opinion that discharge from control of the youth authority at the time stated would be physically dangerous to the public,but no such petition shall be dismissed nor shall an order be denied merely because of technical defects in the application.the prosecuting attorney shall promptly notify the youthful offender parole board of a decision not to file a petition.
the record on appeal lacks any further information with respect to the section commitment proceedings that took place between and.
section provides,a every person committed to the department of the youth authority by a juvenile court shall,except as provided in subdivision b,be discharged upon the expiration of a period of control or when the person reaches his or her birthday,whichever occurs later,unless an order for further detention has been made by the committing court pursuant to article commencing with section.b every person committed to the department of the youth authority by a juvenile court who has been found to be a person described in section by reason of the violation of any of the offenses listed in subdivision b,paragraph of subdivision d,or subdivision e of section,shall be discharged upon the expiration of a period of control or when the person reaches his or her birthday,whichever occurs later,unless an order for further detention has been made by the committing court pursuant to article commencing with section.section provides,every person convicted of a misdemeanor and committed to the authority shall be discharged upon the expiration of a period of control or when the person reaches his birthday,whichever occurs later,unless an order for further detention has been made by the committing court pursuant to article commencing with section.section provides,every person convicted of a felony and committed to the authority shall be discharged when such person reaches his birthday,unless an order for further detention has been made by the committing court pursuant to article commencing with section or unless a petition is filed under article of this chapter.in the event such a petition under article is filed,the authority shall retain control until the final disposition of the proceeding under article.
prior to the amendment,section provided,if the date of discharge occurs before the expiration of a period of control equal to the maximum term prescribed by law for the offense of which he was convicted,and if the authority believes that unrestrained freedom for said person would be dangerous to the public,the authority shall petition the court by which the commitment is made.the petition shall be accompanied by a written statement of the facts upon which the authority bases its opinion that discharge from its control at the time stated would be dangerous to the public,but no such petition shall be dismissed merely because of its form or an asserted insufficiency of its allegations every order shall be reviewed on its merits.
the issue of whether section is unconstitutional unless the statute is construed to require that the petition allege,and the trial court find,that there is a serious and risk that the petitioner would reoffend if not committed,is presently pending in the california supreme court.in re lemanuel.d,review granted,for supreme court opinion,see cal th,d.
section provides,a if a petition is filed with the court for an order as provided in section and,upon review,the court determines that the petition,on its face,supports a finding of probable cause,the court shall order that a hearin
