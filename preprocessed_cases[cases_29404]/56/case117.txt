when the united states charges a juvenile with an act of juvenile delinquency under the federal juvenile delinquency act the fjda,the district court must follow u.e if it commits the juvenile for a study of the juvenile competency to stand trial.because the district court in this case instead committed lkav under d,we reverse.
facts and procedural history 
tribal authorities of the tohono nation charged lkav age with murder in may after being charged,he remained in tribal custody from until.while in custody,he was found incompetent,but was not sent to a treatment facility for restoration to competency.in late,the united states filed its own charge against lkav and obtained a writ of habeas corpus to remove him from tribal custody.to obtain federal jurisdiction over lkav,the united states filed a certification to proceed against juvenile pursuant to title,united states code,section,as amended.the united states certified that lkav charge warranted federal jurisdiction and signaled the united states intent to proceed against lkav as an alleged juvenile delinquent under the fjda.
in november,the united states moved to commit lkav,pursuant to,to an adult medical facility for psychiatric evaluation.lkav did not oppose the united states request to proceed under,but asked for a local evaluation.lkav also requested a competency hearing take place before he was committed under.deferring to these requests,the government withdrew its motion to proceed under,and the magistrate judge did not decide at that time whether governed lkav commitment.the magistrate judge granted lkav request for a preliminary examination to take place in phoenix,arizona.after extensive neuropsychological examination,the examining psychologist deemed lkav incompetent to stand trial.
lkav then filed a motion to proceed with commitment under the fjda,e.at a status conference before the magistrate judge in july,the united states stipulated to lkav incompetency.however,the united states maintained its position that lkav should be committed to an adult facility under d.the united states filed a motion to that effect the next day.
the magistrate judge granted the united states motion to proceed under and denied lkav motion to proceed under e.the magistrate judge order of commitment committed lkav to the custody of the attorney general to be hospitalized in a suitable facility for a reasonable period of time,not to exceed four months,as is necessary to determine whether there is a substantial probability that in the foreseeable future he will attain the capacity to permit the trial to proceed.in its own written order the order,the district court affirmed the order of commitment.lkav filed a timely,interlocutory appeal of the order,challenging his d commitment.
after the appeal was filed,the united states transported lkav to fmc butner,an adult medical facility,pursuant to the order.fmc butner completed its competency evaluation of lkav in january.fmc butner report concluded that lkav was incompetent to stand trial.however,the report further concluded that,with an additional period of hospitalization and treatment,lkav could be restored to competency.the report also suggested a day extension of the previous commitment deadline set to expire in january for such hospitalization and treatment.the united states filed a motion for the requested extension,based on the report.on lkav motion,the district court decided to hear the motion for extension of time rather than refer it to the magistrate judge.on february,the district court granted the united states motion and extended lkav commitment for up to an additional days.
jurisdiction 
we ordinarily hear appeals only from a district court final decision.united states loughner,cir citing.however,under the collateral order doctrine,we review a district court preliminary or interim decision when it conclusively determines the disputed question,resolves an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action,and is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.id.quoting sell united states,d.
here,lkav challenge to the order is appealable under the collateral order doctrine,and no party challenges our jurisdiction.the order conclusively determines lkav rights with respect to his commitment.further,the issue before us whether d applies to lkav is completely separate from the ultimate issue of lkav delinquency.finally,delay would render the order effectively unreviewable.lkav seeks only release from commitment at fmc butner.lkav release from fmc butner would obviate the need for our court to issue an order and could render lkav appeal moot see id.at finally,the issue is effectively unreviewable because b y the time of trial loughner will have undergone forced medication the very harm that he seeks to avoid.alterations in original internal quotation marks omitted.
standard of review 
we review the district court interpretation of d and e de novo.see united states juvenile male,cir we review a district court construction or interpretation of a statute de novo.
discussion 
as in any case of statutory construction,our analysis begins with the language of the statute.united states harrell,cir internal quotation marks omitted.to aid our inquiry,we rely on our established rules of statutory construction id.we also look to similar provisions within the statute as a whole and the language of related or similar statutes to aid in interpretation.see jonah carmona,cir.s tatutory interpretations which would produce absurd results are to be avoided.arizona bd.for charter schs.dep t of,cir internal quotation marks omitted.if a statute is ambiguous,we may consult the legislative history,to the extent that it is of value,to aid in our interpretation.merkel comm r,cir.finally,in some cases,a statute purpose may shed light on the interpretive question.see jonah,at.
we conclude that each of the foregoing tools of statutory interpretation indicate that the district court should have applied e,rather than d.the plain language of e makes clear that it applies to commitment and study of alleged juvenile delinquents like lkav.other textual evidence supports this conclusion as well.our interpretation would not lead to an absurd or irrational result.finally,even assuming that the statutory language is ambiguous,commitment under e rather than d is consistent with the purpose of the fjda,as evidenced by the statute legislative history.
plain language 
words in statutes usually carry their plain,natural,ordinary and commonly understood meanings.united states romo romo,cir.in addition,courts try to avoid,where possible,an interpretation of a statute that renders any part of it superfluous and does not give effect to all of the words used by congress.bosley med,kremer,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the united states acknowledges that it filed a certification to proceed against lkav as an alleged juvenile delinquent pursuant to,thereby invoking the fjda.indeed,the united states conceded at oral argument that e applies to alleged juvenile delinquents.however,the united states argues that e does not mention competency and,thus,can not supplant the mandatory competency evaluation and commitment procedure for all defendants set forth in.this argument overlooks the plain language of e.
section e provides 
if the court desires more detailed information concerning an alleged or adjudicated delinquent,it may commit him,after notice and hearing at which the juvenile is represented by counsel,to the custody of the attorney general for observation and study by an appropriate agency.such observation and study shall be conducted on an outpatient basis,unless the court determines that inpatient observation and study are necessary to obtain the desired information.in the case of an alleged juvenile delinquent,inpatient study may be ordered only with the consent of the juvenile and his attorney.the agency shall make a complete study of the alleged or adjudicated delinquent to ascertain his personal traits,his capabilities,his background,any previous delinquency or criminal experience,any mental or physical defect,and any other relevant factors.the attorney genera
