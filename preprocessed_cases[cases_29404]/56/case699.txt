factual and procedural background 
on march,appellant,then years old,approached victim adalvero roman as he was driving into a parking space on an unlit block of beaver street,near market street in san francisco.holding what appeared to be a gun in his right hand,appellant ordered roman out of the vehicle and to turn over his wallet.appellant took about from roman wallet and told him to w alk that way and do turn around or i blast your head off.he then drove off in roman vehicle,where police found and arrested him about minutes later.roman later identified appellant at a cold show as the perpetrator of the crime.
appellant was charged with three felonies second degree robbery,carjacking,and criminal threats.appellant admitted the robbery charge,and the other charges were dismissed.in september,the juvenile court declared wardship over appellant,and committed him to cya for a period of confinement at the herman stark youth correctional facility stark facility up to six years eight months 
on march,after about two and a half years of confinement,appellant filed a motion to modify his cya,to vacate the ground cya had failed to keep him safe or provide him adequate educational and treatment services.as an alternative placement,appellant,a bisexual,requested to be sent for probation to the ark house in san francisco,a transitional living facility designed to meet the needs of homeless lesbian,gay,bisexual and transgender young adults.
in moving to vacate his cya commitment,appellant argued he had been,and would continue to be,subjected to serious acts of physical and mental abuse from cya staff and wards based on his sexual orientation.since being confined to the stark facility,appellant had,among other things,been cut severely in the face by a ward with a razor blade confined by cya to his cell and excluded from school and other group activities for his own safety for up to hours a day nearly every day for several weeks forced by two wards to perform oral copulation on another ward and singled out repeatedly by staff and wards based on his sexual orientation.appellant also argued he had not received an adequate education at cya,an issue plaintiff conceded at the hearing.by january,when appellant was years old,he had completed only of the credits required to earn a high school diploma,in part because cya had at times removed him from school out of concern for his safety.
the juvenile court denied appellant motion on april,reasoning that,under section,it would lose jurisdiction over him were it to set aside the cya commitment.but for that reason alone,the juvenile court stated,it would have no problem doing what has been requested.
on appeal,appellant claims the juvenile court misinterpreted section in denying his motion.we agree.
discussion 
welfare and institutions code section.
we review a juvenile court commitment decision for abuse of discretion,indulging all reasonable inferences to support its decision.in re angela th,d in re darryl d.we review matters involving statutory interpretation,however,as a matter of law.in re wanomi d.
when a juvenile is declared a ward of the juvenile court,the juvenile becomes subject to its continuing jurisdiction.people sanchez cal d.section provides that any person who is under the age of years when he or she violates any law of this state is within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court,which may adjudge him or her to be a ward of the court.further,section permits the juvenile court to retain jurisdiction over a ward until he or she turns years old,subd.a,or years old if the ward was committed to the department of the youth authority for a crime listed in subdivision b,paragraph of subdivision d,or subdivision e of section,subd.b.section also bars the juvenile court from discharging from its jurisdiction a ward committed to cya so long as the ward remains under cya jurisdiction,subd.c.
here,the juvenile court denied appellant motion to modify his cya commitment on the ground that,under section,it would lose jurisdiction over him were it to grant the motion.specifically,the court reasoned that,under subdivision c,vacating appellant cya commitment would eliminate subdivision b as a source of jurisdiction because he would no longer meet the provision requirement that the ward was committed to cya.because appellant was years old when he sought modification,subdivision a was already eliminated as a source of jurisdiction.
appellant offers a contrary interpretation.he argues the juvenile court retains jurisdiction over him until age because he was committed to cya for second degree robbery,a crime listed in subdivision b of section,subd.b.the court jurisdiction continues,appellant reasons,regardless of whether his commitment is subsequently vacated or modified.moreover,subdivision c is not to the contrary.it mandates retention of jurisdiction in certain cases but nowhere limits the court jurisdiction.we agree.
when interpreting a statute,we ascertain the legislature intent in order to effectuate the purpose of the law.in re charles th,d in re tino th,d.we begin with the statute language.if the language is clear and unambiguous there is no need for construction,nor is it necessary to resort to indicia of the intent of the legislature.in re tino,supra,th at,d,quoting delaney superior court cal d,see also in re charles,supra,th at,d.we examine the language in context,keeping in mind the nature and obvious purpose of the statute and harmoniz ing the various parts of it by considering the particular clause or section in the context of the statutory framework as a whole.in re charles,supra,th at,d,citations omitted.in so doing,we avoid interpretations that would produce absurd results,which we presume the legislature did not intend,citing people mendoza cal th,d.
thus,to determine whether the juvenile court below misinterpreted section,we consider as a whole the statutory framework for juvenile delinquency.in so doing,we keep in mind its purpose to serve the best interests of the delinquent ward by providing care,treatment,and guidance to rehabilitate the ward and enable him or her to be a and productive member of his or her family and the community,and to provide for the protection and safety of the public in re charles,supra,th at,d,quoting,subds.a,b,d.
to accomplish the juvenile delinquency laws stated purposes,the legislature offers the juvenile court many statutory tools.under section,subdivision b,for example,the court may order delinquent wards to receive care,treatment and guidance which is consistent with their best interest,that holds them accountable for their behavior,and that is appropriate for their circumstances.see also in re eddie cal th,d,acknowledging the juvenile court broad discretion to choose probation various forms of custodial confinement in order to hold juveniles accountable for their behavior,and to protect the public.
more specifically,section,subdivision a,permits the court to make any and all reasonable orders for a ward care,supervision,custody,conduct,maintenance,and support subject to further order of the court,subd.a,emphasis added.under section,any and all reasonable orders include placing a ward on probation subject to any and all reasonable conditions of behavior as may be appropriate under th e disposition,subd.a see also in re charles,supra,th at,d in re ronny th,d juvenile court has broad discretion to make dispositional orders and impose conditions of probation under section.section explicitly acknowledges the power of the court to retain jurisdiction over a minor and to make appropriate orders pursuant to section for the period per
