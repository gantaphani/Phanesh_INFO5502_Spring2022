in,juvenile female was found guilty of juvenile delinquency based on her violation of assault on a federal officer.she now appeals the denial of her motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction,as well as the denial of her motion for a judgment of acquittal.we affirm both of the district court orders.
factual and procedural background 
on september,border patrol agent anthony ponzio,who was stationed about a quarter of a mile away from the united states mexico border,heard a radio dispatch that a suspicious vehicle had been spotted.a few minutes later,he saw a white chevrolet impala idling on the side of the road.after finding that the license plate was registered to a rental car company that was frequently involved in illicit activities,ponzio drove up to the impala and asked the driver if he was lost.juvenile female jf was sitting in the passenger seat of the car.
supervisory border patrol agent leo miele ordered ponzio to clear the area because he thought the impala might be in the area to pick up narcotics.miele then waited in a driveway about miles down the road.after the impala passed miele vehicle,he pulled up behind it.the driver pulled off to the side of the road and signaled for miele to pass.agent miele indicated that the impala ought to keep on driving.about miles later,the impala pulled over once more and signaled again for miele to pass.at this point,miele pulled up next to the car and identified himself as a border patrol agent.in doing so,he recognized the driver as someone he had arrested,in december,for transporting about pounds of marijuana in a disguised truck.the driver agreed to speak to miele.miele indicated a driveway where the car could pull over.the impala did not stop,however,and miele followed in pursuit.
miele radioed other agents,including border patrol agent alexander djokich,and notified them that he was following a suspected drug smuggler.the impala eventually stopped and the driver fled,leaving the driver side open.miele chased the driver.
the first agent to reach the impala was djokich.he noticed jf moving inside the vehicle,and ran to the open door with his gun drawn.jf was climbing across the front seat.djokich identified himself,and ordered her to exit the car.jf,however,was screaming and kicking towards him.a scuffle ensued,during which jf stabbed djokich in the back of his left leg with a small knife.
on september,the united states attorney for the southern district of california the government filed an information charging jf with juvenile delinquency,in violation of a,b,and.the information stated,in relevant part,that jf 
did knowingly and intentionally and forcibly assault,resist,oppose,impede and interfere with a person named in title,united states code,section,namely,united states border patrol agent djokich,in that defendant in an attempt to resist apprehension,kicked agent djokich and stabbed agent djokich with a knife,a deadly and dangerous weapon,while agent djokich was engaged in the performance of his official duties in violation of title,section and title,section a and b.
the government also filed a certification,pursuant to,stating that the offense charged is a crime of violence that is a felony and that there is a substantial federal interest in the case to warrant the exercise of federal jurisdiction.on september,jf filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction,arguing that was not categorically a crime of violence.the district court denied the motion.
the case then proceeded to trial.jf moved for a judgment of acquittal after submission of the government case,and again at the close of evidence,arguing that agent djokich was not engaged in an official duty,one of the elements of the offense.the district court denied both motions.the court subsequently found that jf had committed an act of juvenile delinquency,and sentenced her to three years probation.jf then timely appealed to this court.
standard of review 
we generally review de novo a district court assumption of jurisdiction.united states juvenile male,cir.whether or not an underlying offense is a crime of violence is a question of statutory interpretation reviewed de novo.id.at.a district court ruling on a motion for a judgment of acquittal is also reviewed de novo.united states mcneil,cir.
discussion 
the government charged jf with violations of a and b.when jf was charged,provided as follows 
a in general.whoever forcibly assaults,resists,opposes,impedes,intimidates,or interferes with any person designated in section of this title while engaged in or on account of the performance of official duties shall,where the acts in violation of this section constitute only simple assault,be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year,or both,and in all other cases,be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than years,or both.

jurisdiction over juvenile female 
a juvenile alleged to have committed an act of juvenile delinquency shall not be proceeded against in any court of the united states unless the attorney general,after investigation,certifies to the appropriate district court of the united states that the offense charged is a crime of violence that is a felony,and that there is a substantial federal interest in the case or the offense to warrant the exercise of federal jurisdiction.
certification is a jurisdictional requirement.united states juvenile male kenneth,cir internal quotation marks omitted.jf argues that a violation of is not a crime of violence,and that the district court erred in assuming jurisdiction over her.
when exercising jurisdiction over a juvenile,this court follows what has been termed a categorical approach to determine whether an offense is a crime of violence.see leocal ashcroft,d using a categorical approach to determine whether a crime was a crime of violence warranting deportation united states david,cir united states baker,cir,overruled on other grounds by united states nordby,cir.
under the categorical approach,the generic,rather than the particular,nature of the predicate offense is determinative in defining a crime of violence.baker,at internal quotations omitted.a crime qualifies as a crime of violence if and only if the full range of conduct covered by it falls within the meaning of that term.valencia gonzales,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
we recently held that sets out three separate crimes.united states chapman,cir s everal of our sister circuits have held that creates three distinct offenses,one misdemeanor and two felonies.we agree that this formulation of the statute is required.internal citations omitted.
unfortunately,t he statute itself offers little guidance on the precise contours of the three separate offenses created by.united states hathaway,cir see also chapman,at section a is inartfully drafted.in chapman,we held that v iolations of the simple assault provision constitute misdemeanors.violations of the all other cases or dangerous weapon or bodily harm provisions constitute felonies.at internal citation omitted.
in differentiating between the two offenses described in section a,simple assaults and all other cases,some of our sister circuits require physical contact,whereas others require physical contact or a similar aggravating factor,such as the intent to commit a murder or a serious felony id.at.in chapman,we declined to adopt a rule,and held that under either approach,while a defendant could be charged with resisting,opposing,impeding,intimidating,or interfering,he could not be convicted unless his conduct also amounted to an assault.id.emphasis added.
the third offense,which is the one at issue in this case,was not specifically addressed in chapman.id.our sister circuits,however,have held that section b describes an assault involving a deadly or dangerous weapon or resulting in bodily injury.united states vallery,cir see
