what started as a drug buy ended as a carjacking.an adult held a gun on the owner and demanded the keys to the car while travis and another person forced the owner to his knees.when the owner produced the keys,it was travis who took them.travis himself never held the gun.the primary issue presented by this timely appeal is whether the juvenile court was correct in concluding that what travis did constituted c arjacking while armed with a dangerous or deadly weapon within the meaning of welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b which was the basis of travis commitment to the california youth authority for a period not to exceed ten years.
the offense for which defendant was committed is described in subdivision b as follows carjacking,as described in section of the penal code,while armed with a dangerous or deadly weapon.the issue before us is whether armed means that the minor must be personally armed with a dangerous or deadly weapon when the offense was committed,or whether it applies to principals to the offense who were not personally wielding the weapon.
we begin by examining the words of the statute if the statutory language is not ambiguous,then we presume the legislature meant what it said,and the plain meaning of the language governs.if,however,the statutory language lacks clarity,we may resort to extrinsic sources,including the ostensible objects to be achieved and the legislative history.in such situations,we strive to select the construction that comports most closely with the legislature apparent intent,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the statute general purposes.we also try to avoid any interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences,people walker cal th,d,people coronado cal th,d.
viewed in isolation,the language of subdivision b does not dispel all doubt as to its meaning.it lacks the unambiguous clarity of various provisions specifying penal consequences for someone who is either personally armed,subds.b,i,subd.a,subds.c,d or who personally us es a weapon in the commission of a crime,subds.a,b,subd.c,subd.b f,subd.b,subd.a.numerous statutes use the word armed in describing forbidden conduct,subds.a,c,h,j,subd.a,subd.a,subd.b defendant bases his contention upon one such statute.
the current version of penal code section directs that probation shall not be granted to any person who is convicted of a specified offense including carjacking and who was armed with a deadly weapon,other than a firearm at the time the offense was committed,subd.e.this provision has been construed to require that the defendant have personal control of the deadly weapon.the prohibition against probation does not apply if it was not the defendant,but an accomplice,who was armed.in short,at least for purposes of probation ineligibility,one could not be derivatively or vicariously armed.courts reached this conclusion after examining the statute language and finding no indication that the legislature intended the more expansive liability.see people alvarez th,d and authorities cited.travis contends that analysis of the language of section,subdivision b will compel this court to reach the same construction.
travis statutory argument is not implausible.courts of appeal have come to differing conclusions as to whether enhancement statutes not containing the words personal or personally cover vicarious use a decisive factor is whether there is any legislative direction that the statute is to be applied to persons who do not themselves commit the prohibited act for the reasons that follow,we reject travis contention that subdivision b must be construed to be inapplicable to a principal who is not personally armed.
both parties cite in re christopher cal th,d.the issue considered there by the supreme court was whether the offense of r obbery while armed with a dangerous or deadly weapon designated by subdivision b of section covered only instances where the perpetrator was personally armed.the court concluded the statute reach was broad enough to cover vicarious arming because the courts had held that the same language person being armed with a dangerous or deadly weapon contained in the robbery statute,included persons vicariously armed.it was in that the legislature added subdivision b,including subdivision b,to section.citation.in,former section of the penal code stated all robbery which is perpetrated by torture or by a person being armed with a dangerous or deadly weapon,and the robbery of any person who is performing his duties as operator of any motor vehicle,streetcar,or trackless trolley used for the transportation of persons for hire,is robbery in the first degree.all other kinds of robbery are of the second degree.citation.it covered vicarious as well as personal arming.citations.in view of the foregoing,we answer the question stated above thus by specifying the criminal offense of r obbery while armed with a dangerous or deadly weapon in subdivision b of section,the legislature referred to the felony described in former section of the penal code.in re christopher,supra,at,d,fn.omitted.
travis argues that the underlying basis for the decision in christopher is absent here.in the case of carjacking,subdivision b was added to section at the same time that the legislature created the substantive crime.see stats,ch,adding,adding subd.b.thus,unlike the phrase robbery while armed,there could be no existing judicial construction of the words carjacking while armed that the legislature could be deemed to have taken into account with the enactment of subdivision b.we agree with this portion of appellant analysis.assuming that christopher is not conclusive in our situation,we turn now to an analysis of the essential nature of carjacking.
carjacking is defined as the felonious taking of a motor vehicle in the possession of another,from his or her person or immediate presence,or from the person or immediate presence of a passenger of the motor vehicle,against his or her will and with the intent to either permanently or temporarily deprive the person in possession of the motor vehicle of his or her possession,accomplished by means of force or fear,subd.a.robbery is defined as the felonious taking of personal property in the possession of another,from his person or immediate presence,and against his will,accomplished by means of force or fear.the similarities between the definition of carjacking and the definition of robbery are apparent at once.both involve the felonious taking of property that is in the possession of another person.both require that the taking be from the person or immediate presence of the person.both are accomplished by means of force or fear.true,there are differences.robbery can involve any type of personal property,while carjacking deals with a single form of property.also,robbery requires an intent to permanently deprive the victim of possession of the property,while carjacking can be committed with the intent of temporary dispossession.by virtue of these differences,neither carjacking nor robbery is a necessarily included offense of the other.people green th,d people dominguez th,d.nevertheless,there is an undeniable measure of overlap between robbery and carjacking.
it has been long and widely recognized by courts that the essence of robbery is the fear of the victim yielding to real or threatened coercion,todd state alaska,goodwine state,state fulks and feurt,state dibattista,people bodkin,state redmond,state luhano,state perley me,state burke,james state,long state.the most common form of the coercion is physical harm from violence.death is always a possibility.see people alvarado d.people pendleton d.the defining features of robbery are the taking of property,from a person,accomplished by force or fear,people butler cal d,in re albert th,d people mungia d.blackstone commentaries witkin epstein,law ed.crimes against property.a comparison of the statutory language demonstrates that all of these features are also elements of the offense of carjacking.the legislative history of the carjacking statute leaves no doubt that the new offense of carjacking is a direct offshoot of the crime of robbery.
