factual and procedural background 
in a petition filed on may,appellant was charged with three counts of robbery and one count of possession of a firearm by a minor.the petition was sustained as to two robbery counts and the firearm count,and the juvenile court ordered appellant to be placed in the camp community placement program camp for a period not to exceed years.additionally,as a condition of his probation,appellant was ordered to avoid contact with the robbery victims,including ivan appellant spent weeks in camp and was released on june.
in a petition filed november,appellant was charged with one count of public intoxication.the petition was sustained and appellant again was placed in camp for days,with an order that he could not be confined for more than years.the prior probation conditions remained in effect.
the petition in the instant case was filed on march,charging appellant again with public intoxication.at a hearing on april,appellant admitted the charge of public intoxication and the juvenile court found it to be true beyond a reasonable doubt,and appellant was sentenced to two months at cya.thereafter,at defense counsel request,the matter was continued for a contested disposition and probation violation hearing.
on april,the juvenile court held the hearing on the contested disposition and on the allegation that appellant violated the terms of his probation by contacting ivan l.at the hearing,over appellant hearsay objection,the juvenile court allowed appellant probation officer,jerome spurlin spurlin,to testify regarding the allegation that appellant had been harassing ivan spurlin testified that on february,he spoke with ivan and ivan mother.they informed spurlin that on february,appellant had been looking for ivan on the campus.appellant later called ivan and asked him do he know who he was and told him to watch his back.ivan was very serious,concerned,and sincere.in fact,following appellant telephone call,ivan withdrew from school and began a home study course because he was afraid of appellant.in a march,preplea report,spurlin recommended that the alleged offenses be considered a probation violation and that appellant be returned to camp for the maximum amount of time.
after hearing all of the evidence,the juvenile court stated the following now,we have appellant here on a public intoxication offense,which is a minor offense now,having read the doctor report,i do think that a placement in an alcohol treatment program would be appropriate.but then also looking at the probation violation,the fact that appellant continues to be in violation of this court order about contacting the victims as indicated in the report and presented by spurlin,is a very,very serious concern to me.because we have a young victim who is being threatened for coming in here and telling us what happened,and i find that to be very,very serious.i find that the cya would be the appropriate disposition therefore,i find that the previous order of camp is terminated,and that was made on october,and i find that a more restrictive placement is necessary and i am sentencing him to the cya.not on the alcohol offense but rather on a probation violation as to the original offense.
on may,appellant timely filed a notice of appeal from the juvenile court order.
discussion 
i.the juvenile court application of amended section at the probation revocation hearing did not violate the ex post facto clauses of the united states and california constitutions 
the heart of the ex post facto clause,art.i,bars application of a law that changes the punishment,and inflicts a greater punishment,than the law annexed to the crime,when committed calder bull,dall.emphasis deleted.to prevail on this sort of ex post facto claim,appellant must show both that the law he challenges operates retroactively that it applies to conduct completed before its enactment and that it raises the penalty from whatever the law provided when he acted.johnson united states,d johnson see also cal,art.i,people castellanos cal th,d,holding that the ex post facto clause in the california constitution is analyzed in the same manner as its federal counterpart.the ban against ex post facto laws prohibits four general categories of laws a law that makes criminal an action that was not criminal when done,a law that aggravates a crime or makes it greater than it was when it was committed,a law that increases the punishment for a crime after it was committed,and a law that alters the legal rules of evidence and requires less or different evidence to convict the offender of a crime than the law required at the time the crime was committed.carmell texas,d carmell.it is well recognized that ex post facto protections are applicable to juvenile proceedings.in re melvin th,d melvin.
appellant argues that application of amended section to his probation revocation hearing violated the fourth category of ex post facto laws.relying heavily upon melvin,he contends that his probation violation relates back to the date of his original offense,which was committed prior to the enactment of amended section.it follows,appellant argues,that amended section should not have been applied at his probation revocation hearing.we disagree.
preliminarily,we note that melvin factually is distinguishable from the instant case.in melvin,all relevant events occurred prior to the enactment of amended section the juvenile committed the underlying offense,was declared a ward of the court,was placed on probation,committed the offense that violated probation,and had his probation revoked.melvin,supra,th at,d.here,although appellant committed the underlying offense and was placed on probation before amended section was enacted,he violated his probation one year after the statute took effect.this distinction is critical in melvin,the minor conduct constituting the probation violation occurred before the effective date of amended section.under carmell,amended section appears to have ch
