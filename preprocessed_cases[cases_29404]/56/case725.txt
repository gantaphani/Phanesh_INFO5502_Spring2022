plaintiff colmore rinehart,iv,a minor,by and through his guardian ad litem angela combs,appeals from a judgment entered against him and in favor of the defendant boys and girls club of chula vista bgccv or club,after the trial court granted bgccv motion for summary judgment on plaintiff amended complaint alleging personal injury based on both premises liability and negligence.plaintiff essentially claimed that bgccv was responsible for rinehart head injuries resulting from a rock thrown by a nonmember of the club from a hillside to the playground below because bgccv violated applicable laws and regulations in numerous ways by negligently failing to protect and ensure his safety,failing to provide adequate supervision,and failing to enforce the rules and regulations necessary for his safety.
plaintiff contends the trial court erred in granting bgccv summary judgment motion because it found there were no disputed material facts as to the supervision on the club playground at the time of the incident,incorrectly categorized the incident as a criminal act thereby improperly utilizing the third party criminal assault duty analysis of ann pacific plaza shopping center cal th,d,ann to find the incident was not foreseeable,and incorrectly utilized the reasoning of noble los angeles dodgers,d.noble as determinative of causation rather than applying the body of law pertinent to public school supervision cases.we affirm.
factual and procedural summary 
the unverified first amended complaint filed january,against bgccv alleged it owned and operated an after school program in chula vista,california.on information and belief,rinehart alleged in the first cause of action for premises liability that he was enrolled in bgccv program on april,and that a group of boys had been throwing sticks and rocks at children on the playground for a period of five to ten minutes when he was struck in the head with a rock thrown at him by a boy standing on the hill in the playground area of bgccv property.there were no supervisors on the playground area at the time of the incident.bgccv was in a loco parentis relationship with rinehart thereby owing him a higher duty of care.had a supervisor been on duty and on the playground,the injury to rinehart would not have occurred.
in his second cause of action for general negligence,rinehart essentially realleged the above and added allegations he was years old at the time of the incident which occurred while he was playing on the playground at the rear of bgccv facility and that such caused him serious injuries.he further alleged bgccv was an operator of a licensed daycare program for minor children.as such,it is required to abide by certain statutory regulations including the california code of regulations,health safety code and welfare institutions code.he also alleged that had the facility been adequately staffed and a supervisor present at the time,the incident would not have occurred and he would not have sustained injury.bgccv violated applicable laws and regulations in numerous ways by negligently failing to protect and ensure his safety,failing to provide adequate supervision,and failing to enforce the rules and regulations necessary for his safety.rinehart alleged the failure to have a supervisor present on the playground was a breach of bgccv duty of care and that as a result of such breach or negligence bgccv caused him to sustain serious injuries.
bgccv moved for summary judgment,arguing there were no triable issues of material fact regarding foreseeability and causation and that without rinehart being able to establish such elements,neither of his causes of action against bgccv could be proven.bgccv also argued that even if it had owed a duty to rinehart and had breached that duty,rinehart could not prevail on either cause of action because he can not show the breach bore a causal connection to his injury.bgccv claimed it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because the acts of rinehart assailant were unforeseeable and he could not establish bgccv alleged negligence was an actual,legal cause of his injuries.
declarations and discovery submitted in support of the motion revealed that bgccv is a organization which offers after school recreation programs to boys and girls who may otherwise be unsupervised and that rinehart was enrolled in such a program at bgccv from april through april.the club playground area was located at the base of a hill just below greg rodgers park,a public park with baseball fields.a fence ran across the top of the hill,dividing the area into the park on one side and the hill and the club on the other.the city of chula vista leased the hill adjacent to the playground to bgccv.club members were not allowed to play on the hill.the club also had rules that members were not to throw sand or objects outside.
on april,rinehart was struck in the head with a rock which a young unidentified male on the hill next to the club playground area had thrown at him as he was playing outside on the club playground.before the incident,rinehart had seen members walk across the top of the hill,but he had never seen any nonmember stop while on the hill or throw rocks from the hill.rinehart sister,who also was a club member,had seen nonmembers go through the fence in the back to hang out with their member friends,but had never seen anybody throw rocks.although rinehart had seen some members throwing rocks about five times before the incident,a supervisor had told them to stop,and they had not thrown the rocks from the hill or at another person.
on the afternoon of the incident,rinehart was outside playing cards and talking with some friends as they sat in tires that had been placed on the club playground.at some point,rinehart noticed two or three rocks come down the hill.when he looked up he saw two boys about years old near the top of the hill throwing rocks.rinehart told his friends the boys were throwing rocks and that they should move.as rinehart stood up and began to move his tire he was hit by a rock and fell.rinehart did not remember the boys or his friends saying anything either before or after he was hit.rinehart believed the boys had thrown a total of four rocks,including the one that hit him,and a object that landed in the bushes.although rinehart believed he had seen his assailant before the incident at the baseball field above the club and that he would be able to identify him if he saw him again,he had never seen him again.
neither john clingan,the president and chief executive officer ceo of bgccv,nor employees henry steven cross henry or briana joy baker had ever seen nonmembers throw rocks from the hill.although rinehart and his sister do not recall seeing a supervisor in the playground area the day of the incident,baker testified she was in the vicinity of the sidewalk near the playground,possibly playing a game with some girls,when she saw rinehart and his friends on the tires playing in the sand.henry confirmed that baker had been assigned to supervise the outdoor activities on the playground that afternoon and that from the sidewalk vicinity she would have had an unobstructed view of rinehart and his friends.approximately to minutes before the incident,baker had walked around the playground to make sure there were no children behind some trailers on the club property or up on the hill,and to make sure that everyone was playing fair and well with each other.baker did not see any boys on the hill,on the baseball field,or near the fence,or hear anyone yell before she saw rinehart lying on the ground after he was hit and she ran over to him.no one had come to baker to report any rock throwing on the hill before rinehart was hit with the rock and his assailant fled.the boy who threw the rocks was never apprehended and his identity is unknown.
an incident report prepared by employee sally cross sally indicated baker was outside at the time of the accident,and noted baker had stated she had not seen or heard anything.the report also noted that two of the boys with rinehart at the time of the incident told sally there were some big boys on top of the hill and they were hiding behind the bushes and one came out and threw the rock and took off running.
rinehart opposed the summary judgment motion,claiming bgccv had a duty to supervise its facility to provide a safe place for him to learn and grow with supervision as promoted in its rules and regulations and that its failure to adequately do so caused his injuries.in support of these claims,rinehart submitted copies of the club policy and procedure manual,representations made by the club in its advertising and membership information form,excerpts of depositions and the declaration of alison vredenburgh,cpe,a retained human factors and safety expert.
in her declaration,vredenburgh stated she had read all the depositions taken in this case,had conducted a site inspection of the club property,had read all the policy and procedure manuals before concluding the incident was foreseeable and bgccv had failed to provide adequate and effective barriers,both physical and administrative,to prevent the subject incident.vredenburgh opined that the physical presence of a supervisor would have served as a deterrent to aggressive behavior of both members of the club and nonmembers and that bgccv failed to provide continual supervision as required by its own stated policies and by state law regulating child care facilities.she also provided photographs she had taken of the premises,noting the fence did not fully enclose the club property as testified to by clingan.
bgccv filed reply documents,raising evidentiary objections to statements in rinehart separate statement and points and authorities,and to vredenburgh declaration.the club also filed a portion of baker deposition stating there were no holes in the fence at the time of the incident like those depicted in vredenburgh photos which were take two years after the incident.
on september,the court issued a tentative ruling granting bgccv summary judgment motion,finding t he incident was too unforeseeable to impose a duty on the club to take affirmative measures to prevent from throwing rocks from the hill,and there is no evidence that the club actions were a substantial factor in causing plaintiff injuries.in doing so,the court relied upon the law in ann,supra,cal th,d,with regard to the issues of duty and foreseeability,stating 
a duty to take affirmative action to control the wrongful acts of a third party will be imposed only where such conduct can be reasonably anticipated.in this,as in other areas of tort law,foreseeability is a crucial factor in determining the existence of duty.citing ann,supra,cal th at,d.based on the evidence presented,plaintiff can not show the incident was foreseeable such that the club owed a duty to take measures to prevent such incidents.in general,the greater the burden of imposing a duty,the greater the level of foreseeability is required.citation.the requisite degree of foreseeability can rarely be proven in the absence of prior similar incidents.citation.here,there is no evidence that the club should have been aware that nonmembers would enter the property and throw rocks.while there is some evidence that nonmembers traversed the hill,nobody stopped and threw objects towards the playground.the few incidents that occurred were by members on the playground.the club has rules prohibiting,and a supervisor acted to stop such conduct when it occurred.
regarding the issue of causation,the court relied on noble,supra,d,saelzler advanced group cal th,d,saelzler,and thompson sacramento city unified school dist.th,d thompson to find that rinehart had not raised a triable issue of fact regarding this element of his causes of action.the court specifically stated 
plaintiff contention that the incident might not have occurred had the club placed more supervisors on the playground or repaired the fence is speculative.plaintiff argument is similar to that in noble,supra,d.where the plaintiff was injured in a altercation in the parking lot of the dodger stadium.plaintiffs theory in that case was purely and simply that the dodgers were negligent in failing to effectively deter any and everyone from acting in such a manner.citation.the court rejected a security expert opinion that there should have been seven more individuals employed by the dodgers for security purposes and that the personnel should have been deployed differently than they were.the court noted the expert could not say that the additional seven persons or a different deployment pattern would have prevented the plaintiff injury.here,plaintiff safety expert,vredenburgh,opines the club failed to provide adequate physical and administrative barriers to prevent the incident.she states the fence and supervisors were inadequate and ineffective,but does not specifically indicate what the club could have done to prevent the incident from occurring.she suggests the presence of a supervisor would serve as a deterrent to aggressive behavior by members and,but there was a supervisor on the playground baker.plaintiff can not say that additional supervisors or a better fence would likely have deterred the unknown person from throwing rocks.one is left to guess how many additional supervisors would have been needed.further,the fence borders a public park and it is just as possible that the assailant would have thrown rocks from over the fence if he could not walk across the hill.
the court sustained bgccv objections to vredenburgh declaration,but declined to rule on objections to statements in rinehart pleadings stating such were not evidence.
following oral argument on september,the tentative ruling became the order of the court and a formal written order granting bgccv summary judgment motion and judgment in its favor was filed september.notice of entry of judgment in bgccv favor was filed september,and this appeal followed.
discussion 
because plaintiff appeals from the judgment entered after the trial court granted bgccv summary judgment motion,we review the court ruling on the motion de novo.lunardi life assurance th,d.in doing so we apply the same rules and standards that govern a trial court determination of a motion for summary judgment.citation.distefano forester th,d.summary judgment should be granted if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c.
to satisfy this burden,a moving defendant is not required to conclusively negate an element of the plaintiff cause of action all that the defendant need do is to show that one or more elements of the cause of action can not be established by the plaintiff.citation.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,aguilar.once this defendant burden is met,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists code civ,subd.p.in opposing the motion,t he plaintiff may not rely upon the mere allegations or denials of its pleadings to show that a triable issue of material fact exists but,instead,shall set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists brundage hahn th,d.
in performing our de novo review,we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,liberally construing the plaintiff submissions while strictly scrutinizing the defendant showing,and resolving any evidentiary doubts or ambiguities in the plaintiff favor.saelzler,supra,cal th at,d.we are not bound by the trial court stated reasons for its ruling on the motion,as we only review the ruling and not its rationale.muller automobile club of southern california th,d disapproved on another point in colmenares braemar country club,cal th,fn,d.summary judgment will be upheld when,viewed in such a light,the evidentiary submissions conclusively negate a necessary element of plaintiff cause of action,or show that under no hypothesis is there a material issue of fact requiring the process of a trial,thus defendant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.citation.thompson,supra,th at,d.
here,rinehart position on appeal is that there are disputed material facts as to the presence and level of supervision of the playground of bgccv at the time of the incident which are critical to his actions against the club.he claims the court erred in finding it was undisputed there was a supervisor on the playground when he and his sister testified they did not see one there that afternoon.rinehart further claims the trial court improperly utilized the duty and foreseeability analysis of ann,supra,cal th,d,because the incident was not a criminal act,and failed to use the law applicable to the special relationship between a school district and its students which requires a duty to supervise at all times because bgccv stated policies essentially had created such relationship with its members.rinehart argues that because it was foreseeable an inadequately supervised playground area by bgccv combined with easy access to the area by nonmembers would permit those to endanger the safety of its members,bgccv had a duty under the school district supervision cases to adequately supervise its members and facility on the day of the incident.
in addition,rinehart contends the club breach of its duty to exercise due care in its supervision on its premises proximately caused his injuries under the rational of the school district cases and that the court erred in utilizing the reasoning of noble,supra,d,saelzler,supra,cal th,d,and thompson,supra,th,d to determine the absence of causation.
as bgccv points out in its respondent brief,rinehart fails to appreciate that even assuming it owed and breached a duty of care to him,he has not,and can not show that the harm was reasonably foreseeable because the actions of the rock thrower were clearly criminal,and even if those actions were only negligent,he can not show additional supervision would have prevented the incident.as we explain,the trial court correctly determined upon the competent evidence presented in this case that,similar to the situations presented in noble,supra,d.and saelzler,supra,cal th,d,rinehart could not establish the causation element of his causes of action based on principles of negligence and premises liability,and accordingly,properly granted bgccv summary judgment.
pertinent general principles 
it is well established that to succeed on a claim based on negligence,it must be shown that the defendant owed the plaintiff a legal duty,that the defendant breached the duty,and that the breach was a proximate or legal cause of injuries suffered by the plaintiff.citations.ann,supra,cal th,d.in the case of a landowner liability for injuries to persons on the property,the determination of whether a duty exists,involves the balancing of a number of considerations the major ones are the foreseeability of harm to the plaintiff,the degree of certainty that the plaintiff suffered injury,the closeness of the connection between the defendant conduct and the injury suffered,the moral blame attached to the defendant conduct,the policy of preventing future harm,the extent of the burden to the defendant and consequences to the community of imposing a duty to exercise care with resulting liability for breach,and the availability,cost,and prevalence of insurance for the risk involved.citations.wiener southcoast childcare centers,cal th,d,wiener.
when,as here children are the focus of care,the landlord duty is to protect the young from themselves and guard against perils that are reasonably foreseeable.citation.the determination of the scope of foreseeable perils to children must take into consideration the known propensity for children to intermeddle.citation.the existence of a duty and foreseeability,when analyzed to determine the scope of a duty,is a question of law that an appellate court will determine de novo.citation.wiener,supra,cal th at,d.
generally,landowners are required by law to maintain land in their possession and control in a reasonably safe condition.citations.in the case of a landlord,this general duty of maintenance,which is owned to tenants and patrons,has been held to include the duty to take reasonable steps to secure common areas against foreseeable criminal acts of third parties that are likely to occur in the absence of such precautionary measures.citations.ann,supra,cal th at,d.however,a duty to take affirmative action to control the wrongful acts of a third party will be imposed only where such conduct can be reasonably anticipated.id.at,d.
our supreme court has reevaluated the scope of a landowner duty to protect persons from random criminal conduct several times in the recent past.in general,the court has stressed the necessity of balancing the foreseeability of the harm against the burden of the duty to be imposed.where the burden of prevention is great,a high degree of foreseeability is usually required whereas where there are strong public policy reasons for preventing the harm,or the harm can be prevented by simple means,a lesser degree of foreseeability may be required.ann,supra,cal th at,d.thus,duty is determined by balancing the foreseeability of the criminal acts against the burdensomeness,vagueness,and efficacy of the proposed security measures,or as here,the supervision measures.id.at,d.
although the supreme court has observed that random,violent crime is endemic in today society,and i t is difficult,if not impossible,to envision any locale open to the public where the occurrence of violent crime seems improbable ann,supra,cal th at,d,the court has also reiterated that landowners are not insurers of public safety and will have no duty to provide highly burdensome measures of protection absent a showing of a high degree of foreseeability of the particular type of harm,which normally requires evidence of prior similar incidents of violent crime on the premises.id.at,d.in other words,t he dispositive issue remains the foreseeability of the criminal act.absent foreseeability of the particular criminal conduct,there is no duty to protect the plaintiff from that particular type of harm.alvarez jacmar pacific pizza th,d.
for example,in holding that a violent attack in an underground parking garage was not sufficiently foreseeable to support a requirement that the owner of the garage secure the parking garage area against that crime,our supreme court in sharon arman,cal th,d,disapproved on another ground in aguilar,supra,cal th at,fn,d,stated,it is difficult to quarrel with the abstract proposition that the provision of improved lighting and maintenance,operational surveillance cameras and periodic of the tenant garage owned and operated by defendants might have diminished the risk of criminal attacks occurring in the garage.but absent any prior similar incidents or other indications of a reasonably foreseeable risk of violent criminal assaults in that location,we can not conclude defendants were required to secure the area against such crime.sharon,supra,at,d.
in addition,in saelzler,our supreme court held,in the context of evaluating causation where duty had been conceded,that an apartment owner who had provided nighttime security guards in a large complex with a history of serious violent crime would not be liable for its failure to provided daytime security guards and failure to maintain functioning locked gates without an actual causal link showing that the additional security measures would have prevented the assault on the plaintiff.saelzler,supra,cal th at,d.the court found the plaintiff argument that increased security might have prevented the harm was speculative,observing that crime can occur despite the highest level of security.id.at,d.the court recognized its decision requires the balancing of two important and competing concerns society interest in compensating persons injured by another negligent acts,and its reluctance to impose unrealistic financial burdens on property owners conducting legitimate business enterprises on their premises.id.at,d.
the court in saelzler,supra,cal th,d,in holding that a plaintiff must establish,by nonspeculative evidence,some actual causal link between the plaintiff injury and the defendant failure to provide adequate security measures citations,id.at,d,relied upon and cited noble,supra,d.with approval,as well as several other court of appeal cases.saelzler,supra,cal th at,d.it also relied upon the restatement second o
