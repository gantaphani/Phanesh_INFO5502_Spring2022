introduction 
proposition the gang violence and juvenile crime prevention act of,approved by the voters at the march,primary election,effected a number of significant changes to juvenile court law,including amendments to welfare and institutions code section which governs modification of the placement of a ward of the court based upon subsequent acts of misconduct.prior to amendment by proposition,section provided for the filing of a supplemental petition requesting the modification of a previous disposition order by reason of additional misconduct that either constituted a crime or violated a condition of probation that did not amount to a crime.the alleged misconduct had to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.in re arthur cal d,arthur in re marcus th,d in re melvin th,d.
amended section now provides,the facts alleged in the notice shall be established by a preponderance of the evidence at a hearing to change,modify,or set aside a previous order.the court may admit and consider reliable hearsay evidence at the hearing to the same extent that such evidence would be admissible in an adult probation revocation hearing,subd.c.the amended statute also eliminates the requirement that the juvenile court find the past placement has been ineffective in rehabilitating the minor before ordering a new,more restrictive placement.however,if the minor is a court ward or probationer under section in the original matter,the modified section procedures may be used only if the notice alleges a violation of a condition of probation not amounting to a crime,subd.a,italics added.
this appeal requires us to decide whether proposition relaxation of the standard of proof pursuant to section in proceedings alleg ing a violation of a condition of probation not amounting to a crime applies only to requests for more restrictive placement based on subsequent conduct that could not be charged as a crime or whether those procedures may properly be used in any proceeding in which the minor is alleged only to have violated conditions of probation not amounting to a crime,even if the misconduct itself may also constitute a crime.we conclude that amended section may be used to initiate proceedings to impose a more restrictive placement based on any violation of a condition of probation,including one that involves arguably criminal conduct,provided no new criminal offense is alleged.we also hold that section reduced burden of proof for noncriminal probation violations is constitutional.
factual and procedural background 
the section adjudication and commitment to supervision 
in october eddie,age,was a ward of the juvenile court under an order of supervision.on october,a los angeles county deputy sheriff contacted eddie on the street and observed that he exhibited signs of the use of a controlled substance.eddie told the deputy he had used methamphetamine that morning.a small quantity of methamphetamine was later discovered in eddie wallet.
subsequent juvenile wardship 
a new petition was filed pursuant to section,and on november,eddie admitted he had possessed methamphetamine and was under the influence of a controlled substance.health,subd.a,subd.a.at disposition the juvenile court read and considered a social study indicating eddie had a history of contacts with law enforcement and two prior commitments.he was a gang member and the father of two children.after considering the social study and counsels comments,the court rejected a commitment to the california youth authority cya and instead committed eddie to the,supervision program.
the section proceedings to modify placement 
on may,eddie probation officer filed a petition and probation officer report,identifying six incidents of misconduct by eddie at his camp placement.each incident allegedly violated both condition number one of eddie probation,that he obey all laws,and condition number two,that he follow all instructions of probation staff.several incidents also allegedly violated additional probation conditions that required eddie to maintain good grades and citizenship in school and not leave camp without permission.the probation officer recommended that eddie be committed to the cya.
at the hearing on the request to modify placement,the people introduced evidence only as to four of the six incidents.
los angeles county probation officer darren deckard testified that in the early evening of december,the wards were showering and deckard was conducting a clothing exchange.eddie refused to turn in his sweatshirt to obtain a clean one.eddie said he had purchased the sweatshirt in juvenile hall and the dirty sweatshirt was his.deckard testified that all sweatshirts worn while in confinement in camp or juvenile hall are.deckard testified eddie attitude was defiant.deckard had to go into eddie locker personally and put the dirty sweatshirt into the laundry.deckard explained that the other wards heard his exchange with eddie and stopped what they were doing to see what would happen.another probation officer then took eddie to the security housing unit shu to discipline him.deckard opined that incidents like this have the potential for creating an unsafe situation for the staff and other minors confined in camp.
probation officer cesar arroyo testified that,at about on march,one hour after the usual bedtime,eddie was reading a book.arroyo asked eddie several times to put the book away.the other minors in the dormitory were sleeping,but woke up during the disturbance.eddie was transferred to the shu because he failed to follow camp rules and staff instructions.
arroyo testified that on april,the camp had a special dads program for the fathers of children.eddie,along with the other participating minors,was instructed to remain seated at the end of the program.despite the instruction,eddie walked out of the gym with his girlfriend and his two children and headed toward the camp security gate.at this point,he was out of supervision.arroyo radioed a supervisor who stopped eddie before he reached the security gate.the supervisor told eddie he would be getting a notice of substantial penalty.that upset eddie,who defiantly replied to the supervisor,go ahead,take me to the shu.
probation officer salvador nunez testified that,at about on april,eddie refused to shave as required by camp rules.the camp supervisors counseled eddie about the rule violation.back in the dormitory,nunez encouraged eddie to shave and comply with the rules.eddie partially complied,then asked nunez for some personal photographs of his family kept in the staff control area.nunez told eddie to shave first and then eddie could have the photographs.eddie told nunez,no i want to see them now.nunez directed him,look,just finish shaving and i let you see your pictures.supervisors again counseled eddie about failing to shave.when eddie refused to finish shaving,he was asked to go to the shu.on his way to the exit,eddie dove into the staff control center and tried to grab his photographs.probation officer glover stopped eddie,who then became argumentative and refused to follow glover instructions to step out of the control center.glover handcuffed eddie eddie refused to move.eventually it took five probation officers to wrestle eddie to the ground and carry him to the shu.
testimony in defense 
eddie testified in his own defense and claimed he was running a very good program.he admitted he read the book in defiance of staff instructions,refused to shave and entered the control center without permission.he explained that,to avoid serious confrontations with the staff,he would just tell the staff to take him to the shu.with respect to each of the four incidents as to which evidence had been presented,eddie denied wrongdoing except to the limited extent just described.he claimed he was neither defiant nor confrontational.
the court sustained the supplemental petition 
the people argued that each incident of misconduct had been proved by a preponderance of the evidence and that the evidence demonstrated eddie has a problem with authority and resists and defies staff.the court found eddie committed incident,and.
disposition hearing 
following its decision sustaining the allegations of misconduct,the court spoke at length with nunez,who was eddie counselor,regarding disposition.nunez opined that eddie did not have sufficient discipline to get along as an adult and cya had better counseling facilities than were available in camp.cya also had better facilities for maintaining discipline for an unruly and older ward.local resources were exhausted.
counsel for eddie argued that the disciplinary incidents in camp were themselves insignificant,and the nature of the underlying methamphetamine violations and eddie m insignificant history of law enforcement contacts did not warrant a cya commitment.according to defense counsel,eddie,who would soon be,was simply too old to benefit from camp.counsel urged an order of home on probation and,if any further confinement was required,that eddie be confined in jail for a short period of time.
the court indicated it was having some difficulty reaching a decision as to disposition.however,after listening to argument of counsel,the court expressly found a probable benefit from a cya commitment and held that eddie was in violation of the conditions of probation.the court ordered a cya commitment.
the court then calculated the maximum theoretical period of confinement as three years four months a base term of three years for felony possession of methamphetamine and a consecutive term of four months the maximum for the misdemeanor offense of being under the influence of a controlled substance.
contentions 
eddie asserts that three of the four probation violations for which he was tried by the juvenile court involved misconduct amounting to a crime count,theft of a sweatshirt,count,attempted escape welf.inst.code,subd.a and count,resisting a peace officer,subd.a or executive officer.relying on in re marcus,supra,th at page,d alleged probation violation that amounted to a criminal offense should not have been pursued in proceedings initiated under the amended version of section,eddie contends the juvenile court violated section and deprived him of due process by ordering a more restrictive placement after finding he had violated probation in each of those incidents utilizing a preponderance of the evidence standard of proof.
eddie also contends the juvenile court improperly calculated the maximum theoretical length of his confinement by including consecutive terms for possession of methamphetamine and for the misdemeanor offense of being under the influence of a controlled substance,rather than staying the latter term pursuant to penal code section.
the attorney general has essentially conceded the juvenile court committed error in proceeding pursuant to section with respect to incidents,and,but argues that any error is harmless.nonetheless,we directed the parties to submit supplemental letter briefs answering the following questions.did eddie waive his claim that proceedings were improperly brought under section by failing to raise the issue in the juvenile court.can the people elect to proceed under section by alleging that conduct constitutes only a violation of a condition of probation other than the obey all laws condition even if such conduct would also constitute a crime should this court follow in re marcus,supra,th d.even if the people could elect to proceed under section as described in question,does the formal allegation in a section notice that the conduct at issue violated the obey all laws condition of supervision preclude a section proceeding 
discussion 
eddie has not waived his claim that proceedings were improperly brought under section.
eddie trial counsel failed to argue in the juvenile court that it was error to proceed under section with respect to allegations that eddie had violated conditions of his probation that amounted to a crime.if eddie complaint were simply directed to a pleading defect,we might well conclude the issue had been waived.see,people price cal th,d,by not demurring to charge of conspiracy in information,defense waived claim that charge was ambiguous or uncertain.the error asserted,however,is that adjudication in the juvenile court proceeded with a standard of proof lower than that mandated by the structural defect in the constitution of the trial mechanism affecting the framework within which the trial proceeds,rather than simply an error in the trial process itself.citation.people flood cal th,d.constitutional issues affecting the substantial rights of a defendant may be reviewed on appeal despite the failure to raise the issue in the trial court.see people allen d,fn.people norwood d.a matter normally not reviewable upon direct appeal,but which is shown by the appeal record to be vulnerable to habeas corpus proceedings based upon constitutional grounds may be considered upon direct appeal.citations.we therefore address eddie constitutionally based challenge to the propriety of the section hearing at which his probation was revoked.
section may be used to adjudicate alleged violations of probation conditions if the notice does not allege commission of a new crime.
historical overview of section and implementing rules of court.
former section governed the modification of disposition orders in delinquency cases when the previous orders had proved ineffective and the recommendation was to impose a more restrictive placement,including commitment to the cya.supplemental petitions are authorized in juvenile proceedings by section,which provides in part that an order changing or modifying a previous order by directing commitment to the youth authority shall be made only after noticed hearing upon a supplemental petition.the supplemental petition procedure is designed for situations where it is necessary to substitute a more restrictive placement because the original disposition by the juvenile court has not been effective in the rehabilitation or protection of the minor.citation.typically,a section supplemental petition will be required to move a minor from a foster home or juvenile hall to the custody of the youth authority.citations.since this modification results in a greater intrusion on the minor liberty,a section petition must contain a statement of the facts which it is alleged demonstrate a need for youth authority placement citation and can only be sustained after notice and hearing.in re ronald cal d.
when the child wardship was the result of a sustained petition under section,the supplemental petition filed under former section had to allege either a new criminal offense or a violation of a condition of probation not amounting to a crime.former,subd.a,as amended by stats,ch.if the juvenile court upheld the supplemental petition,including a finding that the previous disposition had been ineffective in the rehabilitation or protection of the child,it could commit the child to the cya and set a maximum theoretical time of confinement,which could include aggregation of the maximum confinement periods for all previously sustained section petitions.in re ernest th,d.
the california supreme court considered the burden of proof necessary to sustain a supplemental petition filed pursuant to former section in arthur,supra,cal d.significantly,at that time former section required only that the supplemental petition allege facts sufficient to support the conclusion that the previous disposition has not been effective in the rehabilitation or protection of the minor stats,ch,see arthur,at,fn,although o ften,as in the instant case,such a supplemental petition alleges that the ward has disobeyed an order of the juvenile court by his commission of a criminal offense.arthur,at.relying on principles enunciated by the united states supreme court in in re gault,d,and in re winship,d,the supreme court held that due process requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt to establish acts of misconduct or crimes charged in a supplemental petition pursuant to section w hen a supplemental petition charges acts of misconduct or crimes which may lead to substantially more restrictive punishment or custody the bifurcated hearing procedure established for original proceedings by sections and should be utilized and the juvenile accorded the same constitutional and statutory rights that he has on an original petition.arthur,at.
in reaching this result,the arthur court rejected as superficial the asserted similarity between proceedings under former section and adult probation violation hearings.arthur,supra,cal d at.unlike adult criminal proceedings in which probation may be granted as an act of leniency in appropriate cases,but where denial or probation and imposition of sentence to a term of imprisonment is ordinarily not an abuse of discretion,the juvenile court law contemplates a progressively restrictive and punitive series of disposition orders in cases such as that now before,home placement under supervision,foster home placement,placement in a local treatment facility and,as a last resort,youth authority placement.citation.thus,while the adult whose probation is revoked may not be subjected to any greater punishment than that provided for the original offense,a juvenile adjudged a ward as the result of noncriminal conduct,and a ward adjudged so on the basis of a minor offense,may be removed from the parents home and subjected to increasingly severe and restrictive custody which exceeds that which would have been permissible initially,if he is later found on a supplemental petition to have committed additional acts of misconduct.for this reason,respondent suggestion that a hearing on a supplemental petition is a hearing on disposition,not subject to the reasonable doubt standard,rather than an adjudicatory hearing can not withstand scrutiny.id.at.
the year following the arthur decision the judicial council adopted comprehensive juvenile court rules,effective july,governing the procedures in dependency and delinquency cases.former california rules of court,rule d as initially approved in,required use of the reasonable doubt standard of proof in the determination of all supplemental petitions,not simply those that alleged commission of a new crime d requirement for bifurcated hearing the hearing on a supplemental petition shall be conducted as follows the procedures relating to jurisdiction hearings prescribed in chapter commencing with rule which include in rule b the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt supported by evidence legally admissible in the trial of criminal cases to sustain as true allegations in a petition under section shall apply to the determination of the allegations of the supplemental petition 
the advisory committee comment expressly addressed the expansion of the reasonable doubt requirement to include situations in which the more restrictive placement was sought based on misconduct not charged as a new criminal offense the statutory law is silent on the nature of the hearing on a supplemental petition.citations.in accord with the practice in most counties citation,and as now required in certain instances by case law see in re arthur,supra,cal d,subdivision d prescribes that a hearing be held on the supplemental petition,analogous to the jurisdiction and disposition hearings held on the original petition.this is required by judicial decisions in those cases where the supplemental petition charges new and different criminal acts not included in the original petition in re arthur,citation.this rule would extend the same panoply of protections to all hearings on supplemental petitions.advisory com.com.pt.west ann codes,rules ed.foll.former rule,italics added.
the use of the phrase violation of a condition of probation not amounting to a crime first appeared in former section in amendments adopted in.prior to,supplemental petitions seeking to impose a more restrictive placement for a child under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court were to be filed by a probation officer if the child was a ward of the court under section and by the prosecuting attorney at the request of the probation officer if the child had been declared a ward of the court or probationer under section see stats,ch.as amended in,former section provided for the filing of a supplemental petition b y the probation officer if the minor is a court ward or probationer under section in the original matter and the supplemental petition alleges a violation of a condition of probation not amounting to a crime.by the prosecuting attorney at the request of the probation officer if a minor has been declared a ward or probationer under section in the original matter and the petition alleges a violation of a condition of probation amounting to a crime stats,ch,italics added.
in contrast to the supreme court dismissal of the analogy between supplemental petition proceedings and adult probation revocation proceedings as superficial,the intent of the legislature in enacting the amendments was to enable probation officers supervising juvenile offenders to take advantage of expeditious procedures which are currently available to probation officers supervising adult offenders,and to provide for the development of consistent standards of accountability for wards of the juvenile court similar to those in existence for adult probationers.stats,ch.
as amended effective january,former rule b reflected the legislature decision to authorize probation officers to initiate a request to modify a prior placement order in all cases except where the supplemental petition alleged a new criminal offense.the amended rule provided that a supplemental petition under former section shall be filed by the prosecuting attorney at the request of the probation officer where the minor has been declared a ward or probationer under section when the petition alleges commission of a crime and by the probation officer when the petition alleges violation of a condition of probation not amounting to a crime.italics added.
former rule was repealed and replaced by rule,effective july.as initially adopted,former rule b continued the distinction between supplemental petitions alleging commission of a crime,which were to be filed only by the prosecuting attorney if the child has been declared a ward pursuant to section,and petitions alleging the ward has violated a condition of probation not amounting to a crime,which could be filed by the probation officer.that distinction continued in the subsequent iterations of rule until the judicial council amendments effective january,eliminated all reference to section in rule 
amendment of section by proposition.
proposition amended section in several significant respects,in addition to eliminating the supplemental petition itself and permitting modification proceedings to be initiated simply by giving notice of the hearing to the child and other concerned individuals,subd.a.first,the amendments eliminate the necessity for a finding by the juvenile court that the prior disposition had been ineffective in the rehabilitation of the child.see in re jorge th,d.second,the burden of proof in a section hearing has been lowered from proof beyond a reasonable doubt to a preponderance of the evidence,subd.c.third,by direct reference to the analogous rule in adult probation revocation hearings,the juvenile court is now authorized to admit and consider reliable hearsay evidence in proceedings pursuant to section.ibid.finally,imposition of a more restrictive placement through a proceeding under section is now limited to proof of a violation of a condition of probation not amounting to a crime,subd.a.
viewed collectively,proposition amendments to section were plainly intended to conform the procedures applicable in juvenile probation revocation hearings to those in adult probation hearings,thereby completing the process begun by the legislature in see stats,ch,intent of amendment to was to enable probation officers supervising juvenile offenders to take advantage of expeditious procedures which are currently available to probation officers supervising adult offenders.in particular,by authorizing a modification of placement based on a violation of a court order,rather than a determination of the ineffectiveness of the placement in the rehabilitation of the child,proposition its unsuccessful legislative predecessors expands the authority of the juvenile court to revoke probation while simultaneously reducing the procedural requirements for doing so.
section permits adjudication of any violation of a condition of probation provided no new criminal offense is alleged.
in in re marcus,supra,th,d,division two of the court of appeal,fourth appellate district,after observing that section was dramatically changed by the passage of proposition id.at,d,held that misconduct that might be charged as a new criminal offense could no longer be alleged as a violation of a condition of probation under section.ibid.the juvenile court had sustained an allegation that marcus violated a condition of his probation by possessing cigarettes in contravention of the rules of the juvenile facility in which he was placed.based on this probation violation,the juvenile court ordered him committed to the cya the court of appeal reversed s ince he was under the age of,marcus possession of cigarettes was a criminal offense,subd.b.because this alleged probation violation occurred after the amended statute effective date and amounted to a criminal offense,it should not have been pursued in proceedings initiated under the amended version of section.ibid.
although the attorney general has accepted marcus cramped construction of the scope of amended section we do not.from the historical development of section and former rules and described above,it is plain that the legislature and the judicial ultimately the voters in adopting proposition supplemental petitions into two categories 
petitions actually alleging commission of a new criminal offense,which could be filed only by the prosecuting attorney and which,at the election of the prosecutor,could be the subject of a new section petition.see,in re michael cal d,a practice has developed,therefore,of filing new section petitions,rather than section supplemental petitions,to charge new offenses even when the minor is already a section ward.citation.this practice is not contrary to law.
petitions alleging a violation of a court ordered condition of probation,which could be filed by the child probation officer.see,in re ernest,supra,th at,d.
nothing in the language of either the statute or rules or in the relevant case law supports the view that this second category did not include supplemental petitions alleging as a violation of a condition of probation specific misconduct for example,fighting in violation of the rules of the placement facility that might also constitute a new criminal offense,assault but has not been alleged as such.see,in re tyrone d.probation officer filed petition under former section alleging juvenile refused to submit to intake procedures and repeatedly threatened to commit suicide or to run away if forced to stay.
in limiting the grounds for an order imposing a more restrictive placement,the proposition amendments simply removed from section the first category of subsequent is,allegations of the commission of a new crime by a section ward.while previously a new criminal offense could result in an additional section petition,a section petition or a unitary petition containing the requisite allegations from both sections in re michael,supra,cal d at,after proposition the district attorney can bring subsequent criminal conduct to the attention of the juvenile court only through a new petition.proposition,however,left undisturbed the second category of supplemental petitions although eliminating the need for the petition itself the probation officer or district attorney may still seek a more restrictive placement based on the violation of a condition of probation not alleged as a new crime.see,subd.a rule a notice of a hearing to be held under section shall be prepared by the probation officer or the district attorney if the child is a ward or is on probation under section,and the alleged violation of probation is not a crime.
thus,in the case at bar,eddie probation officer initiated section proceedings not by alleging that eddie had committed theft,resisted a peace officer and attempted to escape from camp,but by properly alleging a series of incidents of misconduct that demonstrated a complete lack of respect for authority,continual dorm disturbances,and the use of passive aggressive manipulation when confronted by officers minor was often argumentative and defiant.it would make little sense to construe section as precluding eddie probation officer from seeking a more restrictive placement in this case simply because elements of some actual crimes might be lurking within this pattern of defiant and disruptive behavior.see,fair employment housing com.cal d,statutes are to be given reasonable and commonsense interpretation consistent with the apparent legislative purpose and intent and which,when applied,will result in wise policy rather than mischief or absurdity.citation.accordingly,we hold that amended section may be used to initiate proceedings to impose a more restrictive placement based on any violation of a condition of probation,including one that involves arguably criminal conduct,provided no new criminal offense is alleged 
section reduced burden of proof for noncriminal probation violations is constitutional.
amended section provides that t he facts alleged in the notice of a probation violation shall be established by a preponderance of the evidence at a hearing to change,modify,or set aside a previous order,subd.c.eddie argues that permitting the juvenile court to proceed under a standard of proof less than reasonable doubt violates his right to due process.we disagree use of a reduced burden of proof to establish noncriminal probation violations in a juvenile proceeding does not violate the child constitutional right to due process.see people rodriguez cal d,preponderance of the evidence standard is constitutional in adult probation revocation proceedings.
to be sure,in arthur,supra,cal d,a case involving a supplemental petition charging commission of a new crime robbery as the basis for committing the juvenile to the cya,the supreme court held that due process requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt to establish the misconduct alleged in a section supplemental petition.id.at.as recognized by division four of our court in in re john d,and by the advisory committee that drafted former rule,however,the holding of arthur is limited to situations where the supplementary petition charges new and different criminal acts not included in the original petition.advisory com.com.pt.west,rules ed.foll.former rule,adoption of rule will extend arthur panoply of protections to all hearings on supplemental petitions.adoption of the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt for all supplemental petition hearings was the result of a change in court rules,not constitutional decision.in re antonio,supra,d.arthur holding has now been adopted by rule to apply to all supplemental petitions the governing rule of court applies the procedural safeguards attendant to jurisdictional hearings on original petitions to hearings on all supplemental petitions there is no room for distinguishing or excluding petitions based on the case history,type of offending conduct,or recommended disposition.
having been extended by rule of court beyond its constitutional bedrock,the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt in juvenile probation violation proceedings can be restricted to proceedings involving allegations of additional criminal offenses which now must be initiated by a new section petition without violating the juvenile due process rights.see crawford los angeles board of education,d no constitutional violation when state repeals remedial legislation that provided greater protection than constitutionally required.moreover,changes in juvenile law since the decision in arthur have eliminated the primary ground upon which the supreme court rejected the analogy between a section proceeding and adult probation revocation hearings at which use of the lower standard of proof had been upheld.these changes ensure that the juvenile basic rights will not be jeopardized by utilization of the preponderance of the evidence standard adopted by the voters in proposition 
at the time of the arthur decision,the juvenile court was not required when ordering a child committed to the cya to specify a maximum period of confinement.as the supreme court observed,commitment to the cya was not limited to a period that is proportionate to the original act or acts of misconduct or criminal behavior upon which jurisdiction over the minor was first asserted.arthur,supra,cal d at.accordingly,the arthur court was properly concerned that,while the adult whose probation is revoked may not be subjected to any greater punishment than that provided for the original offense,a section ward may be subjected to increasingly severe and restrictive custody which exceeds that which would have been permissible initially,if he is later found on a supplemental petition to have committed additional acts of misconduct.id.at.
amendments to section made in late after the arthur decision and in,ch,ch,now require the juvenile court,whenever it removes a child from the custody of his or her parent or guardian,to specify that the minor may not be held in physical confinement for a period in excess of the maximum term of imprisonment which could be imposed upon an adult convicted of the offenses which brought or continued the minor under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court,par.although revocation of probation may cause a change in placement imposing greater restrictions on the juvenile liberty,he or she remains a ward of the court subject to the same maximum term of physical confinement,calculated based on the underlying offense that resulted in the sustained original section petition and any subsequent petitions.see in re ernest,supra,th at,d.like revocation of an adult offender probation,therefore,revocation of probation under section deprives an individual,not of the absolute liberty to which every citizen is entitled,but only of the conditional liberty properly dependent on observance of special restrictions.citations.even though deprivation of this conditional liberty is a serious deprivation requiring that the probationer be accorded due process,citation,revocation is not part of a criminal prosecution citation and,a ccordingly,probation may be revoked despite the fact that the evidence of the probationer guilt may be insufficient to convict him of the new offense.citation.people rodriguez,supra,cal d at.
in sum,section reduced burden of proof for any alleged violation of juvenile probation not charged as a new criminal offense is constitutional.if a new crime is alleged as the basis for ordering a more restrictive placement of a section ward,a new section petition must be filed.the juvenile will continue to have the benefit of the reasonable doubt standard of proof in contesting the truth of the allegations of the petition rule e,but will also be subject to an additional period of confinement if the new petition is sustained.in re michael,supra,cal d at.if only probation violations are alleged,even if the misconduct is also arguably criminal,use of section and a preponderance of the evidence standard of proof is proper.at such a hearing,the juvenile confronts neither additional periods of confinement beyond those attributable to the criminal offenses on which his or her wardship is based nor the possible collateral consequences of a new determination.see,subd.d defining certain section wardship adjudications to be strikes within the meaning of the three strikes law.
the juvenile court improperly calculated the theoretical maximum period of confinement.
section provides that,if the minor is removed from the parent physical custody based on an order of wardship,the minor may not be held in physical confinement for a period in excess of the maximum term of imprisonment which could be imposed upon an adult convicted of the offense or offenses which brought or continued the minor under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.eddie contends the juvenile court improperly calculated his maximum theoretical period of confinement by including consecutive terms for the two drug offenses he of a controlled substance and being under the influence of a controlled than staying the latter term pursuant to penal code section we agree.
penal code section principles apply to juvenile wardship proceedings with respect to calculating the maximum theoretical term of confinement in cases involving consecutive sentencing.in re michael,supra,cal d at,fn,see in re robert d,has no application to determination of juvenile theoretical maximum length of confinement if periods of confinement for multiple offenses are not aggregated.in people holly d,division one of this court held that penal code section precludes sentencing for both possession of a small amount of heroin and the condition of being under the influence of heroin when the evidence supports the inference that the possession and use and being under the influence constitute an indivisible course of conduct.id.at.as in holly,eddie was charged with being under the influence of methamphetamine at the time of his arrest.at the same time he was in possession of a small quantity of methamphetamine,apparently found in his wallet.the meager record before the juvenile court does not support an inference that the amount of methamphetamine found on eddie exceeded his need for personal use within a reasonable time.id.at.
under these circumstances,including consecutive terms for both offenses in calculating the maximum theoretical term of confinement violated penal code section the juvenile court was required to stay the misdemeanor term for being under the influence of a controlled substance.accordingly,we modify the juvenile court order to reduce the maximum theoretical period of confinement to a period of three years.
disposition 
the order under review is modified by striking four months from the maximum theoretical period of confinement of three years four months as calculated by the juvenile court.in all other respects,the order under review is affirmed.
i concur in the judgment but not the rationale of the majority opinion.in my view,proposition has effectively precluded the use of amended section of the welfare and institutions code to initiate proceedings for the purpose of increasing a minor confinement based on additional misconduct that is criminal in nature the prosecution erred by electing to initiate proceedings pursuant to section of the welfare and institutions code 
in this particular case,however,the evidence the prosecution proffered easily met the elevated standard of beyond a reasonable doubt even though the trial court purported to apply a preponderance of the evidence standard.i conclude the court would have sustained the allegations of the supplemental petition had it applied the correct standard.accordingly,i concur in the result if not the reasoning of the majority opinion.
in re marcus held amended section is only applicable to acts of misconduct not amounting to a crime in that case the court found the alleged probation violations were criminal in nature and had occurred after the effective passage of proposition.consequently,the prosecution was not permitted to initiate proceedings under section the people conceded they had committed an error by initiating proceedings under section accordingly,it was necessary to prove the alleged violation beyond a reasonable doubt in order to satisfy due process.
the instant case is similar to in re marcus all but one of the allegations of misconduct against appellant constituted a violation of the criminal law.hence the prosecution should have been barred from initiating proceedings pursuant to amended section in regard to those acts of misconduct.as in in re marcus,the prosecution here concedes it erred with respect to these allegations.but the prosecution contends this error is harmless because of count,the charge that did not amount to a violation of the law but was still considered a violation of probation.the fact a single count was filed correctly under the applicable statutory provision section does not negate the fact the other counts constituting criminal behavior should have been held to the reasonable doubt standard.the prosecution should not be able to manipulate pleadings in order to obtain a lower burden of proof
