tiffany seeks a writ of prohibition directing the lower court to set aside its order denying her motion to preclude the use of physical restraints upon all minors who appear in juvenile court proceedings in the lancaster juvenile delinquency court absent an individualized determination of need for the restraints.petitioner complains the juvenile delinquency court general policy requiring all minors to be shackled is contrary to the established law concerning the appropriate use of physical restraints during court proceedings.the real party in interest,the people and amicus curiae,the los angeles county sheriff department assert,inter alia,the requisite showing of need for the use of restraints depends on the type of court proceeding.they claim that where the proceedings are before a judge rather than a jury,do not involve witnesses,and are brief uncontested,the necessary showing of need is far less,and does not have to be particularized as to the individual.thus,as the respondent court did in denying the motion below,they defend the general policy arguing the use of restraints in the lancaster courtroom for all minors is warranted based on safety concerns arising from the design of the courthouse facility as well as the lack of sufficient numbers of security personnel available to monitor the courtroom.finally,they defend the use of the policy claiming that the case law limiting the use of restraints in the courtroom arises only in the context of criminal proceedings involving adults,and thus this case law should not be applied in the context of juvenile delinquency proceedings.as we shall explain,the court reasons for denying the petitioners motion,and the real party and the sheriff department reasons for defending the policy,are without merit.in our view,the use of physical restraints upon minors who appear in the lancaster juvenile delinquency court must be based on a showing that such restraints are necessary for each individual minor irrespective of the type of hearing or proceeding.consequently,we issue the writ of prohibition.
factual and procedural background 
the policy for the use of ankle restraints on minors 
juvenile delinquency matters are heard in department in the alfred mccourtney juvenile justice center in lancaster california.though a total of six sheriff deputies are assigned to the courthouse,only one deputy is assigned as a bailiff in department department has four exit doors from the courtroom and a number of those doors lead to unsecured exits,public areas to outside the building.
the juvenile court in department has a practice and policy to put ankle shackles on all detained minors who appear in the courtroom for all proceedings.this policy has been in place for at least two years the policy of shackling minors while in the courtroom was adopted because of the number of unlocked exits and unsecured hallways in the courtroom and because the lack of sheriff personnel available to monitor the facility.according to the sheriff sergeant in charge of the security and custody at the courthouse,the risk of minors escaping the courtroom is significant given the design of the courtroom and location of the courthouse.the sheriff sergeant opined the use of shackles on all minors has prevented escape attempts and allowed order to be maintained in the courthouse.the sheriff sergeant concluded the use of ankle restraints upon minors is like having another deputy present just as having a deputy at the minor side causes him or her to think twice about any attempt to escape or to cause trouble,so to do ankle restraints,which every minor immediately realizes eliminates any possibility of making a serious escape attempt.if we had a different locked doors,secured hallways and courtrooms,sally ports,might be possible to maintain security without the use of the ankle restraints.but in this facility,ankle restraints are the simplest,least intrusive method of maintaining security.
the case of tiffany 
petitioner became the subject of a wardship petition brought under welfare and institutions code section.the petition alleged tiffany committed the crime of unlawful taking of a vehicle,a car belonging to her mother in violation of vehicle code section,subdivision a.on june,at an uncontested hearing,tiffany objected to the fact that she was shackled with leg chains during the proceedings.
her counsel stated your honor,tiffany is shackled with leg chains because she is in custody.we would object to her being shackled because of the fact that the court can not use restraints without showing a manifest need,we citing people frier sic cal th,d.so at this point we would ask the court to remove the shackles.
the court okay.your request is denied.the case you are citing does not apply to juveniles the main reason the minors that are in custody are shackled is because we do not have a secure egress and ingress to this courtroom like we did in the old building.but your objection is noted and overruled 
thereafter on june,petitioner filed a motion to prohibit the use of shackles upon minors in the courtroom asking the court to make an order prohibiting the sheriff from using such physical restraints,unless the shackling had been ordered by the court based on an individualized evidentiary showing of manifest need.petitioner counsel also attached her declaration stating that all of her clients are brought into the courtroom in leg shackles for all court appearances.she also stated she had been told the reason for the use of the restraints related to the inadequate security in the building housing the courthouse.
at the june,hearing on the motion,the court ruled as follows 
a s i said before on this subject,there are no cases in california law dealing with minors on this issue.
from what i am reading,that a lot of these cases started out dealing with the defendant being handcuffed,shackled in the presence of the jury.and that was ruled by the court,you ca do that,understandably so,you do want the jury to be prejudiced.there is not jury in juvenile.the court is the jury.they have even of these cases,they indicate that the defendant ca be shackled at arraignment or any post hearing unless there is a showing that they need to be.and again,however,though nothing to address juveniles.
as i said before,in this courthouse,before the minors even get to the courtroom,once they are taken from the secure holding area that probation maintains,there are multiple avenues of escape that could be used by any minor who is detained.and the court,because of that security issue,has always required that the minor come into court in a contained status,to remain shackled to prevent escape.
so the court has reviewed your motion.and for the reasons i have stated,the court will deny it.
on august,petitioner filed this petition for a writ of prohibition,requesting an order directing the superior court to its june,order denying her motion to prohibit shackling minors by the sheriff department absent an individualized showing of need for the restraints and directing the superior court to issue an order granting the motion the people,designated as the real party in interest,filed a return to the petition and this court permitted the sheriff department to file an amicus brief in the matter.
on september,petitioner was released from custody.
discussion 
in this court,petitioner asserts the juvenile delinquency court in lancaster erred in denying her request for an order prohibiting the use of physical restraints on all minors appearing before it without first making an individual determination for the need of the restraints.before addressing this issue,however,we consider a few preliminary matters concerning whether this court should reach the merits.specifically,the people and the sheriff department assert this court should not consider the petition because it is moot as to the petitioner.the sheriff department also requests that rather than ruling on the merits of the petition this court should order an evidentiary hearing so that the sheriff department can appear as a party and present evidence concerning the court policy.to these preliminary issues we now turn our attention.
petitioner concedes she has been released from custody and may not be subject to the juvenile court shackling policy again.thus,she admits the relief sought in the petition is effectively moot as to her.nonetheless petitioner requests this court exercise its inherent discretion to resolve the issue presented by the petition because it concerns a current and ongoing policy of the juvenile delinquency court in lancaster that requires all minors remain shackled throughout court proceedings.consequently,she argues that the harm to minors will on a daily basis and yet may,given the nature of the proceedings,evade review.both the people and the sheriff department urge this court to deny the petition for mootness.the sheriff department also points out that in her petition,petitioner sought an order preventing her from being shackled,and that the court was not asked to address the larger issue of any policy regarding the shackling of all minors at the lancaster court.
the courts have developed various doctrines to permit the appellate review of a case in which it is no longer possible to remedy the injury giving rise to the request for review.one exception to the mootness doctrine applies to those controversies that are capable of repetition and yet evading review.in re william cal d,united states howard cir.this is such a case.in our view,this petition poses an issue of important public interest concerning the treatment of minors in our juvenile delinquency court system that is likely to reoccur in view of the juvenile court policy of shackling of all minors during court appearances.see oregon advocacy center mink cir,cases are capable of repetition in this context where a party is challenging an ongoing government policy.yet,given the relatively short duration of the proceedings,and the pace through which many minors move through the court and the wardship system,this issue may evade review for a significant period of time.in addition,although the petitioner styled her petition to request only a remedy for herself,it is also clear that even if she had fashioned it broadly to request relief for all minors who appear in the lancaster juvenile delinquency proceedings,the result would have been the lower court would have denied it.indeed,the court sought to defend the policy generally for all minors the court rationale for denying the motion was not focused specifically on petitioner.
consequently,this court exercises its discretion to resolve the underlying issue in the petition concerning the legality of the lower court shackling policy even though as to the petitioner the matter is moot.in re sheena cal th,d,see also united states howard cir,circuit reviewed the propriety of a policy of shackling all criminal pretrial detainees during their first court appearance even though the claim was moot as to the named defendants.
ii.evidentiary hearing.
the sheriff department requested that rather than rule on the merits of the petition and grant the relief requested,this court should appoint a special master or a referee pursuant to code of civil procedure section and california rules of court rule to conduct an evidentiary hearing into the policy.we decline this request.
we observe the sheriff department and the people have submitted declarations from the deputy district attorney assigned to department and from the sheriff department sergeant in charge of courtroom security and juvenile detentions at the courthouse.these declarations attest in detail and at length concerning the practices and policies relating to the use of physical restraints for detained minors at the facility.both declarations provide evidence concerning the security concerns in the courtroom and courthouse and the need for the use of physical restraints in all juvenile delinquency matters.notwithstanding this evidence,the sheriff department asserts that such declarations are no substitute for a full evidentiary hearing,at which multiple witnesses can be examined and,documents can be introduced into evidence and views can be taken of the relevant portions of the courthouse.nonetheless,the sheriff department has not specifically identified any additional evidence it would present at such a hearing,nor explained how such evidence would improve upon or supplement that already submitted to this court.moreover,at bottom the issue before this court is not whether the juvenile delinquency court and the sheriff department concerns over security at the lancaster juvenile courthouse are credible.instead,the issue before this court is whether the juvenile delinquency court can legally adopt a blanket policy requiring the use of physical restraints for all minors at all court proceedings without requiring an additional showing of need for restraints for each minor.we are simply not convinced that delaying these proceedings to conduct an evidentiary hearing would prove useful for our resolution of the issues.
iii.policy for the use of physical restraints.
before this court,petitioner asserts the juvenile delinquency court erred in concluding that courtroom safety,standing alone,is a sufficient justification to establish a general policy to shackle all minors who appear before it at every court proceeding.petitioner contends that to justify the use of physical restraints in the courtroom the court must first make an individual determination of manifest need for each minor.
the people and the sheriff department disagree,contending where the proceeding does not require the appearance of witnesses,or a jury is not present,or the proceeding is brief in duration manifest need for the use of restraints is not required an individual determination as to each minor is not legally required to justify the use of restraints and the law limiting the use of shackles should only apply in the context of criminal matters involving adults,not to juvenile delinquency proceedings with the contentions of the parties in mind,we turn to the prevailing law governing the use of physical restraints in the courtroom.
the decision whether to shackle a defendant is discretionary a reviewing court will uphold the court decision absent an abuse of discretion.see people hawkins cal th,d,people duran cal d,in interest of minimizing the likelihood of courtroom violence or other disruption the trial court is vested,upon a proper showing,with discretion to order the physical restraint most suitable for a particular defendant in view of the attendant circumstances.while a trial court discretionary order is presumed correct,and error must be affirmatively shown,nonetheless an abuse is demonstrated where the court order appears to lack all evidentiary support in the record or is based on erroneous legal principles.see in re cortez cal d,the term judicial discretion implies absence of arbitrary determination,capricious disposition or whimsical thinking.it imports the exercise of discriminating judgment within the bounds of reason.to exercise the power of judicial discretion all the material facts in evidence must be both known and considered,together also with the legal principles essential to an informed,intelligent and just decision.
as early as the california supreme court recognized placing the criminal defendant in shackles imposes physical burdens,pains and restraints upon a prisoner during the progress of his trial,inevitably tends to confuse and embarrass his mental faculties,and thereby materially to abridge and prejudicially affect his constitutional rights of defense people duran,supra,cal d at,duran,quoting people harrington cal.in harrington and later in duran the supreme court recognized that shackling a criminal defendant prejudicially affects the defendant constitutional right to be presumed innocent as well as the defendant right to present and participate in the defense.people duran,supra,cal d at,people harrington,supra,cal.at.
the duran court stated the potential harms resulting from shackling the possible prejudice in the minds of the jurors,the affront to human dignity,the disrespect for the entire judicial system which is incident to unjustifiable use of physical restraints as well as the effect such restraints have upon a defendant decision to take the stand,all support our continued adherence to the harrington rule.duran,supra,at.in addition,as the duran court observed,the united states supreme court acknowledged that physical restraints should be used as a last resort not only because of the prejudice created in the juror minds but also because the use of this technique is itself something of an affront to the very dignity and decorum of judicial proceedings that the judge is seeking to uphold.illinois allen,d.
thus,the california supreme court stated in duran,it had reaffirm ed the rule that a defendant can not be subjected to physical restraints of any kind in the courtroom while in the jury presence,unless there is a showing of a manifest need for such restraints.people duran,supra,cal d at,italics added.need in this context was deemed to arise only when a defendant demonstrated through his or her conduct unruliness or an intent to escape,or engaged in other nonconforming conduct or planned nonconforming conduct that would disrupt the judicial process unless restraints were in place.id.at.the duran court stated the nonconforming conduct must be shown on the record and the use of restraints without such a record would constitute an abuse of discretion.ibid.in fact,in duran the supreme court concluded the trial court had abused its discretion in ordering the defendant shackled during the trial because no reasons appeared on the record.the duran court noted that there was no showing the defendant threatened to escape or behaved violently before coming to court or while in court.the duran court stated the fact of the defendant status as a state prison inmate charged with a violent crime was insufficient to justify the use of restraints,holding the decision to shackle a defendant must be made on a basis and can not be based on a general policy of imposing such restraints upon those charged with violent crimes.id.at.
while duran involved shackling of a defendant during proceedings before a jury,the california courts subsequently considered whether the reasoning in duran and harrington applied to the use of restraints during other,nonjury criminal proceedings.in solomon superior court d,division four of this district and ten years later,the california supreme court in people fierro cal th,d,considered the use of physical restraints upon defendants in the context of preliminary hearings.in both fierro and solomon the courts concluded the principles announced in duran applied equally to court proceedings other than jury trials.the fierro court stated the rule of evident necessity serves not merely to insulate the jury from prejudice,but to maintain the composure and dignity of the individual accused,and to preserve respect for the judicial system as a whole these are paramount values to preserve irrespective of whether a jury is present during the proceeding.people fierro,supra,cal th at,d.the fierro court held that as at trial,shackling could not be used at a preliminary hearing absent some showing of necessity for their use.nonetheless,the court also concluded while the dangers of unwarranted shackling at the preliminary hearing are real,they are not as substantial as those presented during the trial.therefore,a lesser showing than required at trial is appropriate.ibid.in fierro,however,because no reasons for the shackling appeared in the trial court record,the supreme court did not have an opportunity to explain what constituted a sufficient lesser showing.
recently in deshaun th,d,the first district considered a challenge to the use of physical restraints on minor during a jurisdictional hearing in the juvenile delinquency proceeding.the court adopted the legal principles announced in fierro,concluding a s in a preliminary hearing setting,however,while some showing of necessity for the use of physical restraints at a juvenile jurisdictional hearing should be required,it should not be as great as the showing required during a jury trial.w hile the dangers of unwarranted shackling at the preliminary hearing are real,they are not as substantial as those presented during trial.therefore,a lesser showing than that required at trial is appropriate.fierro,supra,cal th at,d.similarly,while there are dangers in using unwarranted shackling at a juvenile hearing,they are not as substantial as those presented during a jury trial and a lesser showing should suffice.deshaun,supra,th at,d at.
in addition,whatever the amount of need necessary,the burden is upon the people to establish it.people prado d.finally,the requirement that the record must show a need for shackles also presupposes that it is the trial court,not law enforcement personnel,that must make the decision an accused be physically restrained in the courtroom.a trial court abuses its discretion if it abdicates this responsibility to security personnel or law enforcement.people hill cal th,d,fn.omitted.
from this authority we glean several principles.first,the type of proceeding determines the amount of need that the court must find to justify the use of restraints.if the proceeding is before a jury,manifest necessity is clearly required.however,where the proceedings do not require a jury a lesser showing of need is apparently sufficient.
the second principle,of more paramount importance here,relates to the source of the need.every california state court that has considered the use of physical restraints in the courtroom,irrespective of the type of proceeding,has looked to the conduct of the individual defendant to determine the need for restraints.see,people cox cal d,supreme court reaffirmed duran,concluding that while no formal hearing is required to demonstrate need for shackles,the record must contain substantiation of violence or threat of violence by the accused a general policy to restrain all persons charged was not sufficient.indeed,in deshaun,the court,citing duran noted that a court must not have a general policy of shackling all defendants.deshaun,supra,th at,d at.italics added.in fact,because the juvenile court failed to make any findings concerning the necessity of using physical restraints on the minor for the jurisdictional hearing,the court of appeal found error and proceeded to examine whether deshaun suffered prejudice.ibid.
we note that no california state court case has endorsed the use of physical restraints based solely on the defendants status in custody the lack of courtroom security personnel,or the inadequacy of the court facilities.in solomon,for example,the court found an insufficient showing of need based on insufficient security personnel to secure the courtroom.the court observed the lower court record disclosed nothing more than the fact that there were two defendants charged with armed robbery in the courtroom at the same time during the preliminary hearing and that only one bailiff was present to guard them.the solomon court observed that there was no evidence in the record to show that either defendant had posed a particular threat or had engaged in conduct warranting the use of restraints.the court noted,if the magistrate believed that a single bailiff was insufficient to guard prisoners who had not yet shown nonconforming behavior,his only recourse under the duran standard was to send for more bailiffs.solomon superior court,supra,d.
in addition,in prado the court found that the defendant had been improperly shackled when the only showing of necessity for the measure was the existence of inadequate facilities.people prado,supra,d at.
this authority and the legal principles emanating from it dispose of the bulk of the people and the sheriff departments arguments before this court.following supreme court,fierro,cox and hawkins and the court of appeal in deshaun conclude that any decision to shackle a minor who appears in the juvenile delinquency court for a court proceeding must be based on the conduct and behavior of that individual minor.moreover,the decision to shackle a minor must be made on a basis.in accord with duran and fierro the amount of need necessary to support the order will depend on the type of proceeding.however,the juvenile delinquency court ma
