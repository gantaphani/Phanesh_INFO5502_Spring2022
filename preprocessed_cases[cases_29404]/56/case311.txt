aarica appeals from an order of wardship welf,following a finding that she committed the crime of soliciting prostitution,subd.b appellant contends that because she was a victim of human trafficking,the juvenile court erred in denying her motion under evidence code section,subdivision a,to exclude evidence that she committed a commercial sex act,namely,the solicitation of prostitution underlying the wardship petition.we hold that evidence code section,subdivision a,applies only when there is a specific causal connection between the person status as a victim of human trafficking and the commission of the commercial sex act at issue.because,supported by substantial evidence,the juvenile court found that appellant was not a victim of human trafficking in relation to the solicitation of prostitution at issue here,we conclude that evidence code section does not apply,and affirm the juvenile court order.
