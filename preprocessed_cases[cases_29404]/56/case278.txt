introduction 
the dependency statutes authorize designated social workers to petition the juvenile court to declare a child a dependent of the court.these statutes also permit private individuals,including a parent,to petition the social worker to file a dependency petition.if,after conducting an investigation,the social worker declines to do so,the concerned individual can seek review of that decision in the juvenile court.if the juvenile court affirms the social worker decision,no dependency petition is filed.is that decision of the juvenile court an appealable order we conclude it is not,and therefore dismiss a father appeals from two orders affirming the decisions of social workers not to commence dependency proceedings on behalf of his sons.
factual and procedural background 
a.the family 
michael,michael and his former wife,kelly are the parents of michael,michael and quincy quincy.the parents have a history of domestic violence and live separately.in june the family law court awarded the parents joint legal and physical custody of the children and specified the times the children could be with each parent.
b.the prior dependency proceedings 
in april the los angeles county department of children and family services department received a referral alleging that kelly had physically abused michael the department received a similar referral in may,which included an allegation that kelly had used a belt with studs,a wooden spoon,and a paddle to discipline her children.the department offered michael and kelly voluntary family maintenance services,but both parents refused.during the course of its investigation,the department confirmed that both parents disciplined michael with corporal punishment.at a team meeting the department concluded that the children would remain in the home of their parents under the existing family law order,directed the parents not to use corporal punishment,and determined that the department would file a dependency petition.on august,the department filed a petition pursuant to welfare and institutions code section,subdivisions a,b,and j,on behalf of michael and quincy,who then were seven and six years old,respectively,but did not detain the children.
on september,the juvenile court determined that the department had made a prima facie showing that michael and quincy were persons described by subdivisions a,b,and j of section.the juvenile court ruled that it would defer to the family law court with respect to educational issues,visitation,and primary placement,and that it intended to follow the visitation schedules ordered by the family law court.the juvenile court therefore released the children to their parents in accordance with the terms of the family law order.
on september,the family law court granted kelly primary custody of michael and quincy.the court granted michael visitation and ordered him to pay child support.
on october,the department filed a first amended petition alleging that michael and kelly had physically abused their sons by disciplining them inappropriately and that michael and kelly have a history of engaging in violent altercations.the department further alleged that michael and kelly had an unresolved history of volatile and serious conflicts and that michael had demonstrated behaviors consistent with a disturbing and unstable obsession regarding kelly 
on may,the juvenile court dismissed the first amended complaint without prejudice prior to adjudication.michael appealed.on november,this court dismissed michael appeal pursuant to in re phoenix cal th and in re sade cal th,after his attorney had advised that she could not identify any arguable issues and after michael had filed a supplemental brief that failed to identify any legally cognizable error in the juvenile court order.in re michael,et,case no.
on june,michael filed a petition pursuant to section asking the juvenile court to grant him sole physical custody of michael and quincy,with kelly to have monitored visitation.the court denied the petition,finding that the requested change was not in the best interests of the children,and michael appealed.on november,this court dismissed his appeal pursuant to in re phoenix,supra,cal th and in re sade,supra,cal th.in re michael,et,case no.
in december michael submitted applications pursuant to section asking the department to commence dependency proceedings on behalf of his sons.the record in this appeal does not disclose the resolution of those applications.
c.the current proceedings 
in february michael filed another application pursuant to section.in his supporting declaration he described his concerns about kelly parenting style,including her use of corporal punishment and lack of continuous supervision.
children social worker csw marquita johnson decided not to commence proceedings as requested by michael h.she explained that,after considering michael second section application,she decided not to commence proceedings in juvenile court on these allegations because a thorough investigation was conducted which included numerous interviews and a review of the case file.the department interviewed the children,mother,father,and a neighbor regarding the current allegations and any other abuse or neglect issues.although the family has a history in both family law and juvenile dependency court,the results of the investigation are that there is an insufficient basis to file a section petition at this time.
on march,the juvenile court received michael application pursuant to section to review csw johnson decision not to file a section petition.on april,the trial court affirmed csw johnson decision.michael timely appealed from this order.
on may,michael filed a third set of section applications asking the department to commence dependency proceedings on behalf of michael and quincy.these applications are not in the record on appeal.
on june,csw lisette ruggiero decided not to commence dependency proceedings in the juvenile court because t here were no indications of abuse or neglect found for the children in the home and there were n o marks,injuries or any other signs to show children at risk with mother.csw ruggiero explained that she responded to the section on this referral received by the department on.csw interviewed mother and children multiple times regarding allegations of abuse and neglect in current referral.the department did not find any evidence to support the filing of section and no issues of concern regarding the well being of the children to warrant opening a voluntary or court case.this referral will be closed unfounded as to any abuse or neglect for the children in the home.
on july,the juvenile court received michael section application to review csw ruggiero decision not to commence proceedings.on july,the court affirmed csw ruggiero decision.michael timely appealed from the court july,order the notices of appeal from the april,and the july,orders have the same case number in this court.
