in a delinquency proceeding involving appellant maria son jeffrey,the juvenile court ordered maria jointly and severally liable for restitution to the victim of jeffrey offense in the amount of.jeffrey,who was age years at the time of the offense,but at the time of the disposition order,entered a plea of no contest to battery on a peace officer.the offense occurred when an officer supervising a school dance placed a hand on jeffrey shoulder,asking him to go with the deputy to the front office to call maria,because it was time for jeffrey to leave the dance.jeffrey was on probation for an earlier offense and had a curfew.jeffrey pulled away,causing the officer to lose his balance and fall,injuring his ring finger.

discussion 
appealability 
the order of the juvenile court making maria jointly and severally liable for restitution to the victim is an appealable order.although section does not expressly afford a minor parent the right to appeal a judgment or order of the juvenile court made in a section or proceeding,a parent has the authority to appeal to protect their own interests.dana superior court cal d,in re dargo d.also,section expressly authorizes the juvenile court to make the mother jointly and severally liable for the restitution ordered pursuant to civil code section.judgments obtained pursuant to civil code section are reviewable on appeal.code civ,subd.a.
ii.propriety of the restitution order 
section provides as follows 
a in a case in which a minor is ordered to make restitution to the victim or victims,or the minor is ordered to pay fines and penalty assessments under any provision of this code,a parent or guardian who has joint or sole legal and physical custody and control of the minor shall be rebuttably presumed to be jointly and severally liable with the minor in accordance with sections and of the civil code for the amount of restitution,fines,and penalty assessments so ordered,up to the limits provided in those sections,subject to the court consideration of the parent or guardian inability to pay.when considering the parent or guardian inability to pay,the court may consider future earning capacity,present income,the number of persons dependent on that income,and the necessary obligations of the family,including,but not limited to,rent or mortgage payments,food,children school tuition,children clothing,medical bills,and health insurance.the parent or guardian shall have the burden of showing an inability to pay.the parent or guardian shall also have the burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the parent or guardian was either not given notice of potential liability for payment of restitution,fines,and penalty assessments prior to the petition being sustained by an admission or adjudication,or that he or she was not present during the proceedings wherein the petition was sustained either by admission or adjudication and any hearing thereafter related to restitution,fines,or penalty assessments,subd.a,italics added.
maria argues that section allows parental liability only when the restitution order is imposed upon a person who is a minor,and that the operable date is the date of the restitution order.she argues that the purpose behind section is not to impose liability on parents per se,because this is contrary to the general rule found in the common law that parents are not liable for damages arising out of the torts of their children.perry simeone cal,van den eikhof hocker d.she contends that the statute simply recognizes the support obligation arising out of the relationship and that,once jeffrey turns,the premise for the vicarious liability provided in section disappears.before age,jeffrey is not an emancipated person.once,however,he is,and the victim may recoup his losses directly from jeffrey future earnings,consistent with the legislature intent that restitution be imposed directly on jeffrey.he is no longer a minor and the statute does not authorize vicarious liability.see,subd.a victim shall receive direct restitution from minor.using this analysis,maria contends that she can not be held liable for the restitution order because jeffrey was on the date the order was imposed.
we have found no cases addressing the term minor as used in section.the term is not defined in the welfare and institutions code per se.the family code defines minor as traditionally understood,anyone under the age of.we accept this definition as far as it goes.the issue in this case becomes,however,at what time must the person in question be a minor for purposes of section the time of the offense,the date of the dispositional hearing,the date of the restitution order,or some other time 
section sets the time for determining whether a person falls within the jurisdiction of the juvenile delinquency law as one who is under the age of at the time he or she violates the law of the state.the statutory scheme uses various words throughout to describe persons subject to delinquency jurisdiction and the orders of the juvenile court.ward,dependent child,person,and minor are all used,alone and in combination.see.section uses only the word minor.to determine the meaning of a word or term used in a statutory scheme,we must look at the context of the statutory scheme.lakin watkins associated industries cal th,d,meaning of a statute may not be determined from a single word or sentence but must be construed in context provisions relating to same subject matter must be harmonized if possible see also webster superior court cal d,when interpreting statute each sentence must be read in light of the statutory scheme.
maria relies on in re jesse d.to support her contention that the legislature intended the vicarious liability provisions of section to apply only where the restitution order is made at a time where the delinquent was still a minor and has not reached the age of majority.in jesse,the issue was whether a county could seek reimbursement pursuant to section from the parents of a section ward for the reasonable costs expended for the support and maintenance of a ward placed outside the family home after the ward turns.section provides that a parent or guardian liable for the support of the minor who is placed outside the home is liable to the county for the cost of the minor placement up to the statutory limits.the county argued,as does the respondent here,that the term minor should be interpreted throughout the welfare and institutions code to mean all wards of the juvenile court,any person who is a minor at the time of the offense.in a brief discussion,we rejected this argument by looking at section,another related provision dealing with the cost of support for a ward placed outside the home.in section,the legislature used multiple terms to describe persons subject to its provisions,ward,dependent child,or other minor person.we concluded that the legislature must not have intended the term minor to apply to all wards of the juvenile court in section,because it limited its reference to a minor.rather,we reasoned that by not including a ward or dependent child in section,the legislative implication is that the term minor,as used in section,was intended in the traditional sense,a person under years of age.in re jesse,supra,d at.we agree with this analysis as far as it goes,but do not believe the same result is compelled here
