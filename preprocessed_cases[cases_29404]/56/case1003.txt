in this appeal we determine whether section of the juvenile court act of the act,which requires a trial court to provide a factual basis for its determination in writing,is satisfied if the court orally announces the basis for its finding and a court reporter records those statements.see ilcs west.the appellate court concluded that the plain language of section requires that the basis for the court determination be contained in the court written order.d.on this point,we disagree with the appellate court.however,we affirm the appellate court for the reasons discussed below.
background 
respondent,mandi,and her husband,jimmy,are the parents of madison,born july,in monmouth,illinois hospital staff contacted the department of children and family services dcfs immediately after madison birth due to their concerns about the ability of respondent and jimmy to care for the newborn.both respondent and jimmy are developmentally disabled.following its receipt of a child report on july,dcfs developed a safety protection plan.under this plan,mary goodwin,respondent stepmother,would live with respondent and jimmy and provide primary care to madison.the safety plan expressly stated that mary boyfriend was not permitted contact with madison due to his prior criminal and child abuse history.on september,dcfs received a second child report alleging that the safety plan was not being followed,and that mary allowed her boyfriend to live in respondent and jimmy home.the child report also alleged that mary failed to properly care for madison,resulting in madison hospitalization for a high fever and urinary tract infection caused by a kidney reflux condition.on september,dcfs took protective custody of madison,and the state filed a petition for adjudication of wardship alleging that madison was a dependent minor and that she lacked proper care.madison was then placed in the temporary custody of dcfs.
at the adjudicatory hearing,on november,respondent and jimmy stipulated that madison was a dependent minor who was lacking adequate care because of the mental disability of her mother and father.at the hearing,the state supported the stipulation with the following factual information both respondent and jimmy are moderately mentally retarded respondent and jimmy failed to follow the safety plan developed by dcfs madison was in need of ongoing medical attention and monitoring for her kidney reflux condition,and the failure to adequately care for her led to her hospitalization for a fever and respiratory infection on september,respondent and jimmy were unable to monitor the temperature of madison formula and therefore unable to feed madison respondent and jimmy were unable to monitor the temperature of madison bathwater and therefore unable to clean madison and despite numerous parenting classes both respondent and jimmy were unable to retain information from one class to the next and therefore unable to learn proper parenting skills.the trial court found that both respondent and jimmy had a developmental disability,and that madison was a dependent minor based upon the stipulated facts.he ordered that respondent and jimmy cooperate with dcfs and comply with the terms of the service plan.he further set the case for a dispositional hearing.
after several agreed continuances,on march,respondent appeared at the dispositional hearing with her attorney.also present for the hearing were jimmy,and his attorney jacqueline bryant,a dcfs child welfare specialist and brandon scott,respondent brother.the court considered the testimony of jacqueline bryant,brandon scott,and respondent.bryant recommended guardianship with dcfs due to respondent and jimmy inability to care for madison current needs.bryant testified that despite their best efforts to learn from family support workers who provided them with weekly parenting instruction,their cognitive ability made it unlikely that they could ever improve their ability to provide for madison.scott testified that he would live with respondent and jimmy to supervise the care of madison.he believed that respondent was capable of caring for madison.he testified that on one occasion he left his infant son with respondent for several hours,and her care was satisfactory.bryant testified that dcfs recommended against placement with scott based on his work situation and his inability to transport madison to medical appointments on a regular basis.last,respondent testified about her desire to care for madison and discussed the type of care she would provide to madison if given the opportunity.respondent testified that she had a book that told her how to care for madison.
the court further considered several reports,including a home study report exploring placement with brandon scott several client service plans prepared by dcfs a diagnostic report prepared by patty cook of the child abuse council,which included psychological evaluations prepared by elizabeth lonning a psychological report prepared by joseph cress and a report prepared by joe terronez,a social worker.based upon his observations of respondent and jimmy with madison,terronez concluded that respondent and jimmy limited comprehension may cause madison to be at risk of harm if left alone with respondent and jimmy without supervision.lonning reported that she questioned respondent ability to provide a safe and nurturing environment for her child.she stated that respondent does not seem to have a clear understanding of cause and effect kinds of relationships and tends to give up easily when she is faced with a challenge.following interviews and psychological testing with respondent,cress wrote that respondent does not appear to be able to figure out solutions to problems but even more important she does seem to be able to identify when there is a problem and when there is not.overall,the way respondent prioritizes her life,it is difficult to see where a child would be at the top of her list.i would see her as having a very difficult time being consistent,dependable,and reliable in providing for a child.he recommended that madison not be returned to the independent care of her parents.
at the conclusion of the hearing,the court adjudged madison a dependent minor,made madison a ward of the court,and placed guardianship in dcfs.the trial court findings are recorded in a preprinted dispositional order form and in brief statements in the record.in particular,at the conclusion of the hearing,the trial judge stated on the record 
first i find that it is in the child best interest that the child be made a ward of the court.i find that the health,safety and in the interest of the minor,as well as the public,requires sic that the minor be placed outside the home.i find that the parents at this time are unable to care for,protect,train,properly discipline,although the child is not at an age appropriate for that at this point,but i am basing this on the ability of the parents,and that the child health,safety and best interest would be jeopardized if the child remained in the parents custody at this time.i also find that services that would be aimed at preservation of the family would be inappropriate at this time and that it would be in the best interest of the minor that custody and guardianship be given to with right to place.
respondent and jimmy,as the assistant state attorney stated,and i find this as well,every indication here is that you love madison very much and i do doubt that at all,and i do doubt that you are trying your hardest to be the best parents that you can to madison.i do have concerns about your skills at his sic point,the things that you learning in your parenting classes.i think it sounds like you cooperating,you doing what you need to do.i think you need to have more of that and continue to educate yourselves on being good parents.so i am going to award guardianship with the power to place and right to consent to medical and dental care to madison will remain in foster care at this time.i also going to order that jimmy and respondent be ordered to cooperate with the client service plan and 
respondent and jimmy,i need to tell you something else so this is really important so pay attention.it is important that you continue to cooperate with and any other agencies that they assign you to cooperate with.your failure to comply with the service plan and continue to cooperate and correct the conditions which has made madison a dependent minor could result in termination of your parental rights,and what that means is she could take your rights away as parent s and someone else would adopt the child.so it is important that you continue to cooperate with the agencies.
in the preprinted dispositional order form,the court checked the box that respondent is for reasons other than financial circumstances alone unable to care for,protect,train,educate,supervise or discipline the minor and placement with her is contrary to the health,safety and best interest of the minor because.the empty space following the because on the order form was left blank.the court further checked the box that reasonable efforts and appropriate services aimed at family reunification can not prevent or eliminate the necessity for removal of the minor from the home at this time and leaving the minor in the home is contrary to the health,welfare and safety of the minor.the following facts form the basis for this finding.the empty space included on the form to write the factual basis was also left blank.
respondent appealed,arguing that the circuit court finding was not supported by a written factual basis as required by section of the act.the appellate court reversed and remanded for a new dispositional hearing and written order,holding that the plain language of section requires that the dispositional order contain a written factual basis for its determination.d at.we granted the state petition for leave to appeal.see.
as an initial matter,we address the state contention that the issue in this appeal is waived because respondent failed to object to the trial court failure to make a written finding at the dispositional hearing or in her posttrial motion.the record reveals that respondent did in fact raise the instant issue for the first time on appeal.the rule of waiver,however,is a limitation on the parties and not on the courts.in re marriage of sutton.our concern for reaching a just result may override considerations of waiver.in re timpone.under the circumstances in the present matter,where the of a child and parental rights are at issue,we elect not to apply the rule of waiver and will consider the case on the merits.
article ii of the act governs proceedings involving abused,neglected and dependent minors.see ilcs west.in this case we review the requirement found in section,that the court put the factual basis for its finding that a parent is unfit or unable to care for,protect,train or discipline his or her child in writing.ilcs west.
the state argues that the writing requirement contained in section is satisfied when the trial court orally announces the factual basis for its finding and a court reporter records that statement.respondent counters that an oral statement made on the record is not a sufficient writing under section.respondent argues that only a written order containing the court findings satisfies the statute.respondent maintains that a trial court failure to comply with this requirement is reversible error.the appellate court agreed with respondent.the appellate court held that a trial court failure to provide the required written factual basis in its dispositional order is reversible error.d at.we review the appellate court statutory interpretation de novo.in re,in re.
our primary objective in construing section is to give effect to the intent of the legislature,presuming the legislature did not intend to create absurd,inconvenient or unjust results,at,in re,at.we look first to the plain language of the statute because statutory language is the most reliable indication of the legislature intent,at,at.section provides,in relevant part 
if the court determines and puts in writing the factual basis supporting the determination of whether the parents,guardian,or legal custodian of a minor adjudged a ward of the court are unfit or are unable,for some reason other than financial circumstances alone,to care for,protect,train or discipline the minor or are unwilling to do so,and that the health,safety,and best interest of the minor will be jeopardized if the minor remains in the custody of his or her parents,guardian or custodian,the court may at this hearing and at any later point 
d commit the minor to the department of children and family services for care and service.ilcs west.
section instructs that the court put in writing the factual basis for its finding.the act does not define writing or set forth what type of writing is required.the state argues that a literal reading of the statute would yield an absurd result and unjust consequences not contemplated by the legislature,and that an oral statement on the record is consistent with the purpose of the statute.in giving effect to legislative intent,the court should consider,in addition to the statutory language,the reason for the law,the problems to be remedied,and the objects and purposes sought.people donoho.thus,in construing a statute we consider other interpretative aids,such as the reason and necessity for the statute and the purpose served by it.donoho,at,people whitney.
the purpose of the act is to secure care and guidance for minors and to serve the safety and moral,emotional,mental,and physical welfare of minors and the best interest of the community.ilcs west.accord,at,the overriding purpose of the act is to ensure that the best interests of the minor,the minor family,and the community are served.the act grants circuit courts authority to make custody determinations in the best interests of the child.ilcs c west.further,under the appropriate circumstances,the act directs that the state secure permanency for minors at the earliest opportunity.ilcs west.see also ilcs west in all proceedings under this act the court may direct the course thereof so as promptly to ascertain the jurisdictional facts and fully to gather information bearing upon the current condition and future welfare of persons subject to this act in re,it is not in a minor best interests for his status to remain in limbo for an extended period of time,the circuit court should consider,in an expedited manner,cases involving such children,so that the minors whose futures are at stake in juvenile proceedings can obtain a prompt,just,and final resolution of their status,quoting in re,in re tekela,from the child perspective,the best solution is an expeditious resolution of the appeal.the act is to be liberally construed to carry out its stated purpose and policy.ilcs west.
a dispositional hearing held pursuant to section concerns the legal custody and guardianship of a minor and permits the removal of the child from a parent under the appropriate circumstances.see ilcs west.the purpose of a dispositional hearing held pursuant to section is not to terminate parental rights,but rather to decide what future actions are in the best interests of the child and whether to make the child a ward of the court.see generally,at,see also in re april,d,discussing the different standards of proof of unfitness in a proceeding seeking to remove custody pursuant to section compared to a proceeding seeking the termination of parental rights held pursuant to section.thus,where the state does not also seek to terminate parental rights,a proceeding held pursuant to section is concerned only with placement of the minor.see april,d at.
with this in mind,we conclude that the writing requirement contained in section exists to give the parties notice of the reasons forming the basis for the removal of the child and to preserve this reasoning for appellate review.explicit oral findings stated during a dispositional hearing advise the parties of the basis for the removal of the minor and,once transcribed,provide an equal opportunity to review the validity of the findings on appeal as well as written findings contained in an order respondent suggested interpretation of section unnecessarily elevates form over substance and disrupts the
