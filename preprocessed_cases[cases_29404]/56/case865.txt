sheena,a minor,appeals from an order declaring her a ward of the court pursuant to welfare and institutions code section by reason of her having committed misdemeanor battery,the juvenile court committed appellant to the supervision of the probation officer for placement in the camp community placement program for a minimum of weeks under specified terms and conditions,including that she not associate with anyone disapproved of by her probation officer,not use or possess dangerous or deadly weapons,and not remain with any person known to be unlawfully armed.appellant sole contention is that these conditions are vague and overbroad,violating her federal and state constitutional rights to due process,to travel,to associate and to assemble,and must therefore be modified to require that she know the persons with whom she can not associate and the weapons she can not use or possess.
we conclude that the probation condition that appellant not associate with anyone disapproved of by the probation officer is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.accordingly,we modify the judgment and otherwise affirm.

discussion 
the juvenile court found appellant to be a person described in section of the welfare and institutions code and placed her in the camp community placement program under the supervision of a probation officer subject to the probation conditions announced by the court at the dispositional hearing,including that she not associate with anyone disapproved of by probation.specifically do not participate in any type of street gang activity she not use or possess any dangerous or deadly weapons and she not remain with anyone she know s is unlawfully armed.she did not object to any of these conditions in the trial court.
appellant contends that these conditions are unconstitutionally overbroad.she argues that the conditions that she not associate with anyone disapproved by her probation officer or anyone unlawfully armed infringe on her freedom of association,right to travel and right to assemble.she also argues that the condition that she not use or possess a deadly or dangerous weapon is unconstitutionally vague because it can not reasonably be determined what objects constitute such weapons.she urges that these conditions must provide that she have knowledge of whom the probation officer disapproves,who is unlawfully armed and what is a deadly or dangerous weapon.
respondent contends that because appellant did not object to these conditions in the juvenile court,she waived her appellate challenge to them.it argues that,in any event,r easonably read,do not associate with anyone disapproved by probation implies that the person appellant is to refrain from associating sic has already been disapproved by probation,and that appellant is aware of the disapproval.
our supreme court has indicated that constitutional objections must be interposed in the trial court in order to preserve them for appeal.see people williams cal th,d.the purpose of this waiver doctrine is to encourage a defendant to bring errors to the attention of the trial court,so that they may be corrected or avoided and a fair trial had people walker cal d,d.
in people welch cal th,d,welch the california supreme court applied the waiver doctrine to challenged conditions of probation.there,the defendant was sentenced to probation on the terms and conditions in the probation report.the defendant failed to object in the trial court to the conditions.on appeal,the defendant urged that the conditions were improper on grounds and that his failure to object in the trial court did not preclude appellate review because the type of error constituted an unauthorized sentence,entered in excess of jurisdiction and thus could be raised at any time.id.at,d.the supreme court held that the failure to timely challenge the reasonableness of a probation condition on grounds waived the claim on appeal because a timely objection discouraged imposition of invalid conditions and reduced costly appeals brought on that basis.ibid.it excluded from this general waiver rule claims challenging probation conditions involving pure questions of law that can be resolved without reference to the particular sentencing record developed in the trial court.ibid.thus,welch dealt with unreasonable and inappropriate conditions that should not have been imposed because they failed to relate to the defendant offense,did not relate to future criminality and regulated conduct.
our colleagues in division four of this court,in in re justin th,d justin,had occasion to consider the application of welch to a minor failure to object in the trial court to a probation condition that a defendant not associate with any gang members and anyone disapproved of by parent s justin,at,d.on appeal,the minor challenged the condition as vague and overbroad.the court of appeal concluded that while the welch holding applied to juvenile proceedings,it was limited to probation conditions challenged on the ground that they were unreasonable.welch did not apply to the condition with which it was faced which was a pure question of law that can be resolved without reference to the particular sentencing record developed in the trial court justin,at,d,quoting from welch,supra,cal th at,d,and thus did not require a prior objection to the condition in the trial court.
we conclude that the claims asserted here have not been waived because,similar to justin,they present pure questions of law that can be resolved without regard to the sentencing record in the trial court and are not therefore within the waiver rule announced in welch.furthermore,unlike in welch,appellant does not contend that the probation conditions are unreasonable under and therefore improperly imposed.rather,she does not dispute the propriety of the subject matter of the conditions but only claims that they must be modified so as not to infringe on her constitutional rights.
respondent reliance on in re josue th,d is misplaced.in that case,the court of appeal found welch controlling because the probation condition involved was challenged on the ground that it bore no reasonable relationship to the facts underlying the wardship,a ground.this was the very type of challenge that welch concluded required objection in the trial court to preserve for appeal.that is not the type of challenge mounted here.
validity of conditions.
the trial court has broad discretion to impose conditions on probation.section,subdivision j provides in part the court may impose and require any or all of the terms of imprisonment,fine,and conditions,and other reasonable conditions,as it may deter
