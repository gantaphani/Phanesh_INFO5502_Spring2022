placements 
the underlying facts of this juvenile dependency matter are set out in a related appeal we set out the facts pertinent to the issues raised in the matter now before us.
in june,a supplemental petition was filed after then dependent child was removed from the home of his uncle,with whom he had lived since he was an infant.had been de facto parent since september.the supplemental petition alleged that had inflicted corporal punishment on,leaving marks on the minor body.in november,a juvenile court commissioner sitting as a temporary judge found the allegations of physical abuse to be true.despite this fact,it sought the ultimate reunification of with and 
at the close of the hearing on the supplemental petition,the agency made an oral motion to set aside de facto parent status based on the commissioner physical abuse findings.the motion was denied without prejudice.in december,the agency filed a written motion to terminate de facto parent status,citing the fact that was no longer living in his home.opposed the motion.
while the motion to terminate was pending,placement shifted again.he had displayed anxious,impulsive and aggressive behavior in his foster placement.a november,psychological assessment diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd and child physical abuse.it also noted sexual preoccupations that were unusual for a child of his age,and multiple indications of historic trauma.a group home placement was recommended,to provide more structure and resources than a foster placement could.the psychologist hoped that this setting would help modulate aggressive externalizing behaviors.neither the juvenile court commissioner nor the agency had this report at the time of the november,findings on the supplemental petition.
on december,was removed from the foster home in which he had been placed in june.he threatened to assault a new caregiver and was placed temporarily in a group home in oakland.by the end of the year,had been moved to a therapeutic group home in marin that met the requirements of the psychologist recommendations.the juvenile court approved this placement,subject to later revision,in january.in this placement,displayed aggressive and sexually provocative behavior.
had regular supervised visits and telephone calls with and sought additional contact with,but refused agency entreaties to participate in family therapy with the minor.the agency sought to engage in his own therapeutic exploration of the factors leading to his physical abuse of,which also resisted.the agency viewed therapy as a fundamental precondition to the safe return of to care.continued to deny any abuse of,questioned the need for an placement,and challenged the wisdom of the residential treatment placement.
at the group home,was diagnosed as suffering from adhd,posttraumatic stress disorder,physical abuse and possible sexual abuse.he participated in numerous therapeutic programs there,including individual and group psychotherapy,anger management and communication skills development.he received a psychiatric consultation in order to identify effective medical treatment for his hyperactivity and aggression.a neuropsychological evaluation was conducted to identify factors that could guide treatment and medication.he expressed his desire to live with rather than at the group home.continued to display disruptive and aggressive behavior.a group home worker advised that if reunification with and was the ultimate goal,then more contact with them in family therapy was needed.
in march,the agency recommended continued placement in the group home setting,over objections.complained that the agency did not want to provide him with services.the agency reported that it had been trying to facilitate services,but that refused to participate in therapy.at the conclusion of that hearing,the juvenile court found that the agency had complied with the case plan and had provided reasonable services.it adopted for a permanent plan of placement in the group home with a goal of a less restrictive foster placement.
several hearings on de facto parent status issues were held between january and april.by march,a court order determining his own de facto parent status.the agency opposed this request.
on april,the agency argued that once the juvenile court found physical abuse had occurred,automatically forfeited his de facto parent status.counsel for and all argued in favor of continued de facto parent status.counsel stated that the juvenile court commissioner knew that excessive physical punishment had occurred but that her primary concern was that the agency not relegate to an placement until he reached age.
the agency argued that the law required an automatic termination of de facto parent status.the juvenile court took a more nuanced view of the case law.it found that a psychological bond existed between and,and that terminating de facto parent status would not be in the minor best interests.it denied the agency motion to terminate de facto parent status and granted application for de facto parent status the agency appeals these two rulings.
ii.standing 
preliminarily,and assert that the agency lacks standing to appeal the juvenile court orders.they argue that the agency is not an aggrieved party because their de facto parent status exists to benefit the juvenile court and which does not adversely affect any legally cognizable interest held by the agency.
any party aggrieved in a civil action may appeal.code civ,county of alameda carleson cal d,see in re paul th,juvenile dependency case.one has no standing to appeal if one is not aggrieved.without standing,there is no justiciable controversy for a court to entertain.to have standing,a person must have rights that may suffer actual or threatened injury.in re th,clifford superior court th,county of alameda carleson,supra,cal d at.the party must have a legally cognizable interest that is injuriously affected by the juvenile court decision.in re paul,supra,th at in re carissa th.
by law,a county social services agency acts as a representative of the state,standing in loco parentis to the minor in a proceeding which has as its primary consideration the welfare of the minor.in re jennifer d.the agency serves as a special arm of the juvenile court,investigating the status of the child and reporting its findings to the court.in re malinda cal d,fn.if it concludes that de facto parent status is no longer appropriate,the agency has the authority to file a noticed motion asking the juvenile court to terminate de facto parent status.in re brittany th,brittany in re patricia th,patricia.
given its status in loco parentis and its authority to oppose or seek termination of de facto parent status,we conclude that the agency has a legally cognizable interest that was injuriously affected by the juvenile court decisions.see in re paul,supra,th at in re carissa,supra,th at.the agency was aggrieved by the juvenile court denial of its motion to terminate de facto parent status and the grant of application for de facto parent status over its objection.thus,it has standing to raise challenges to the juvenile court determinations of de facto parent status by appealing the relevant orders.having determined that the agency appeal is properly before us,we turn to the merits of the issues raised in its appeal.
