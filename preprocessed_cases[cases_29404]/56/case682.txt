in the published portion of this opinion,we hold that when a criminal defendant or delinquent ward is convicted of aiding and abetting two felony firearm assaults,he can not also be convicted of being an accessory to those felonies solely on the basis of his immediate flight from the scene and later denials of his own involvement,even if that conduct incidentally helped the shooter escape.
the juvenile court declared eduardo a delinquent ward after the court found that he committed two assaults with a firearm by aiding and abetting the actual perpetrator,in both of which a principal was armed with a firearm counts and,and that he was also an accessory to the assaults count welf,subd.a,subd.b,subd.a all further undesignated section references are to the welfare and institutions code.based on this case and an earlier sustained delinquency petition in which the court found that eduardo had violated the terms of his probation,the court committed eduardo to the youth authority for a maximum period of years and months 
eduardo appeals,contending that i the finding that he was an accessory count must be reversed because his acts in aiding and abetting the assaults counts and and helping the shooter escape did not sufficiently demonstrate a separate intent to aid the shooter escape ii the findings that a principal was armed during both assaults counts and,and any related potential custody time,must be stricken because being armed with a firearm is an element of assault with a firearm and iii the court made several errors in its dispositional order,including a failing to determine whether eduardo had exceptional educational needs b failing to exercise its discretion in calculating his maximum confinement time c declaring the accessory finding count to be a section,subdivision b offense d incorrectly calculating his predisposition custody credits e preparing the youth authority commitment form and f committing him to the youth authority.the attorney general concedes issues ii and iii b,c,and e.
as explained in the published portion of the opinion,we agree with contention i and reverse the finding that eduardo was an accessory count.in the unpublished portion of the opinion,we agree with contentions ii and iii a,b,d,and e.we modify the adjudication and dispositional orders to strike the findings that a principal was armed during the commission of counts and,and any related potential custody time.we also modify the dispositional order to strike the calculation of eduardo maximum confinement time and to award eduardo rather than days of predisposition custody credit.because we reverse with prejudice the count finding that eduardo was an accessory,we need not address whether count qualified as a section,subdivision b offense.we remand for the court to conduct a new dispositional hearing at which it should determine whether eduardo has special educational needs and determine his maximum possible confinement time,taking our opinion into account.because those determinations may affect the court decision whether a youth authority commitment is appropriate,we also vacate the youth authority commitment order,which the court should reconsider on remand.in all other respects,we affirm the judgment order of wardship.
i.the adjudication hearing.
on december,the juvenile court declared eduardo,who was born in april,a delinquent ward based on his admission that on july,he illegally drove a vehicle belonging to someone else,subd.a.the juvenile court placed eduardo home on probation on condition,among others,that he obey all laws and not participate in any type of gang activity,or associate with any known gang members.
approximately one year later,at about on december,hugo bahena and his cousin miguel morales were walking to a store in compton.bahena had been,but no longer was,part of a graffiti tagging crew that fought with rival taggers.a blue van with tinted windows drove up and stopped less than feet from the two men.in addition to the driver,the van contained two other people,but neither bahena nor morales could identify any of the van occupants.the van passenger window was down,and a young male shouted,where you from the two men understood the question asked whether they belonged to a gang.bahena replied,nowhere,meaning he and morales were not gang members.the passenger then fired one shot from a pistol through the open window,hitting bahena in the leg.morales ran out of the line of fire,and the van drove off.morales suspected that the van occupants fired at bahena because they belonged to a rival tagging crew with whom bahena had fought in the past.
morales helped bahena walk to a nearby gas station,where someone called the police.about five minutes later,eduardo drove up to the gas station in the van.bahena and eduardo were friends.eduardo asked what happened,and bahena replied that he had been shot.morales said that eduardo van was the same one from which the shot was fired,and that eduardo was involved in the shooting.eduardo replied that he was not involved in the shooting,did not know who was,and that someone had carjacked the van,which he had just gotten back.while eduardo was still at the gas station,sheriff deputies and paramedics arrived.when deputy mark raffalelli arrived,he saw eduardo seated in the back of a patrol car,and heard bahena yell at eduardo,why did you let your friends shoot me.raffalelli saw eduardo reply by shaking his head,no,he did.
raffalelli advised eduardo of his miranda rights,which he waived.miranda arizona,d.eduardo began the interview by claiming that he did know that the van was involved in a crime and that his sister owned the van.later,eduardo changed his story he admitted he was driving the van with two passengers,both gang members,one of whom he knew had a gun similar to the one bahena saw the shooter fire.eduardo passengers were looking for rival gang members.when they saw the victims,whom eduardo recognized,he pulled alongside and his armed passenger said he wanted to see who the victims were.the passenger called out,where are you from when the victims replied that they were not gang members,eduardo passenger reached out and fired one shot,hitting bahena.the shooter then told eduardo to step on it and get out of there.eduardo said he agreed,drove a short distance,and stopped.both his passengers got out and ran away.he drove back to the crime scene because he was a friend of the victims.eduardo claimed he did not know his armed passenger intended to shoot anyone.
the juvenile court found that eduardo assaulted bahena and morales with a firearm by aiding and abetting the shooter,and that in both assaults a principal was armed with a firearm counts and the court also found that eduardo was an accessory to the same crime count.based on those findings,the court found that eduardo had violated the terms of his probation in his case.
ii.the disposition hearing.
discussion 
i.the court erred in finding that eduardo both aided and abetted and was an accessory to the assaults.
eduardo contends the juvenile court erred in finding both that he aided and abetted the two assaults,making him liable as a principal counts and,and that he was an accessory to the same assaults count.he does not challenge his two assault convictions but contends that his accessory conviction must be reversed and dismissed.we agree.we hold that because eduardo was convicted as a principal in both assaults,he can not also be convicted as an accessory to those assaults solely on the basis of his immediate flight from the scene of the crime and his subsequent denials of his own involvement,even if that conduct incidentally helped a to escape.
in california both perpetrators and aiders and abettors are equally liable as principals.penal code section defines principals as,among others,a ll persons concerned in the commission of a crime,whether it be felony or misdemeanor,and whether they directly commit the act constituting the offense,or aid and abet in its commission,or,not being present,have advised and encouraged its commission 
a person aids and abets the commission of a crime when he,i with knowledge of the unlawful purpose of the perpetrator,ii and wit
