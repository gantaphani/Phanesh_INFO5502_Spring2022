procedural posture 
because the issue before us is a purely legal one,the factual and procedural context in which the case arises may be summarized briefly.as set forth in defendant demurrer,on the evening of october,police officers saw a car drive slowly along west myrtle street in santa ana.officers believed occupants of the car were los compadres gang members.police ultimately stopped the car,found a loaded revolver,and arrested the occupants,including defendant isaias arroyo.

defendant was arraigned and initially pleaded not guilty.he later demurred to the indictment on the ground that welfare and institutions code section d requires the prosecution to proceed by way of a preliminary hearing and information when filing criminal charges against a minor in adult court,and because he was a juvenile at the time of the alleged commission of the offenses the grand jury had no legal authority to inquire into the offenses charged,subd.demurrer challenging grand jury authority.the trial court allowed defendant to withdraw his plea sustained his demurrer,agreeing with him that welfare and institutions code section d requires a magistrate determination that a juvenile qualifies for prosecution in adult court and dismissed him from the indictment.

in adopting proposition at the march,primary election,voters expanded prosecutorial authority to file charges against minors in adult court.before proposition became law,a minor could not be prosecuted in a court of criminal jurisdiction unless a juvenile court first found the minor unfit for treatment under juvenile court law.exceptions existed for minors who were alleged to have committed certain very serious offenses enumerated in welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b,and were consequently required to be charged in adult court,and for minors who had previously been found unfit.welf,former,as amended by stats,ch,welf,former,subds.a c,as amended by stats,ch,welf,former,subd.a.
as amended by proposition,section gives prosecutors discretionary authority to file charges against minors directly in criminal court for specified offenses and under specified circumstances.the provisions of subdivision d through set out those offenses and circumstances,subd.d.section,subdivision d provides in any case in which the district attorney or other appropriate prosecuting officer has filed an accusatory pleading against a minor in a court of criminal jurisdiction pursuant to this subdivision,the case shall then proceed according to the laws applicable to a criminal case.in conjunction with the preliminary hearing as provided in section of the penal code,the magistrate shall make a finding that reasonable cause exists to believe that the minor comes within this subdivision.if reasonable cause is not established,the criminal court shall transfer the case to the juvenile court having jurisdiction over the matter.italics added.
penal code section provides that b efore an information is filed there must be a preliminary examination of the case against the defendant and an order holding him to answer made under section.the proceeding for a preliminary examination must be commenced by written complaint,as provided elsewhere in this code.in turn,penal code section,among other things,specifies that when it appears from the examination that a public offense has been committed and there is sufficient cause to believe the defendant is guilty,the magistrate must hold the defendant to answer.sections and,which apply to all prosecutions initiated by information,read together articulate the applicable requirements for proceeding against a defendant by way of information they do not limit the prosecutor options for commencing a prosecution.
defendant contends section d entitles him to a preliminary hearing.he first focuses on the language of the statute,in particular the sentence italicized above.he observes that the court of appeal in people superior court gevorgyan th,found this language unambiguously provides such a right and concluded that because there is no right to a postindictment preliminary hearing under california law see cal,art.i,the prosecution of a juvenile in criminal court can not be initiated by indictment.in support,he notes that while proposition eliminated the express right to a preliminary hearing formerly conferred by welfare and institutions code section,subdivision c,it at the same time added the reference to a preliminary hearing in section d.
the people acknowledge that welfare and institutions code section d requires the magistrate,at the preliminary hearing,to make a finding that reasonable cause exists to believe the minor comes within the provisions of the statute,but they contend the requirement of a magistrate finding comes into play only if prosecution of the minor is commenced by information the statute does not itself require that a prosecution be initiated by information.as the people soundly point out,welfare and institutions code section d,provides that in any case in which the district attorney has exercised discretion to file against a juvenile in criminal court,the case shall then proceed according to the laws applicable to a criminal case.the penal code defines the initial pleading in a felony case as the indictment,information,or the complaint in any case certified to the superior court under section.consequently,as the people contend,a prosecution that is commenced by indictment proceed s according to the laws applicable to a criminal case.welf,d.
