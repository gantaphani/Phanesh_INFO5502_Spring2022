the court then proceeded with the trial and addressed the petition filed on behalf of cole.the court indicated that although the petition concerning cole was almost identical to the girls petitions,the issues were different because in cole case,the issue was whether the allegations created a risk to cole.

the court found it had jurisdiction and declared cole a dependent,removed him from mark care and placed cole with heather.the court also found that the agency made reasonable efforts to prevent or eliminate the need for removal,and it ordered mark to comply with a reunification plan.
discussion 
mark argues the juvenile court erred by preventing kimberly corbett,heather and the girls therapist,from testifying at trial and making statements in agency reports based on the privilege.mark asserts william giddens,the girls attorney,could not raise the privilege on behalf of the girls because the counseling they received from corbett had been obtained before giddens was appointed as their attorney heather held the privilege and because she waived the privilege,he is entitled to the information and the court should have allowed corbett statements in evidence because the evidence was exculpatory.
background 
on may,heather filed a motion requesting that the juvenile court return the girls to her care and custody.the court held a special hearing to address heather request.in support of her request,heather submitted a letter from corbett.corbett indicated she started meeting heather and the girls for therapy sessions before the start of the dependency proceedings.she met with heather on an individual level to address heather divorce from dean and to assist with integrating mark into the girls lives.corbett also met with heather and the girls in a group setting,and sometimes with chloe on an individual level.corbett letter submitted by heather provided details surrounding her therapy sessions with heather and the girls.
mark argues that after the initial submission of corbett letter,giddens did not raise any objections.mark notes that on may,the agency filed a report containing statements made by corbett.no party asserted the privilege.on july,mark filed a motion to dismiss the case and submitted the same letter written by corbett.on july,mark and heather submitted their witness lists for trial,and corbett was listed as a witness.on july,giddens asserted the privilege on behalf of the girls.the court found the privilege applied and struck corbett letter from heather may,motion.the court permitted mark to call corbett as a witness regarding any therapy provided to heather but denied any testimony as to chloe and ella.
relevant law 
it is established that the privilege applies to the relationship between a dependent minor and his or her therapist.in re daniel d.in re eduardo d.t he purpose of the privilege is to protect the privacy of a patient confidential communications to his or her psychotherapist.citations.in re daniel,supra,at.in this relationship between a patient and a therapist,the patient generally is the holder of the privilege unless the patient has a guardian or conservator.in re kristine th,d.
for dependency proceedings,counsel that is appointed for a minor serves as the child guardian ad litem.see see in re josiah cal th,d.a guardian ad litem is responsible for both evaluating the situation and needs of the child and mak ing recommendations to the court concerning the best interests of the child.b a xiii i ii.the guardian ad litem is required to represent and protect the rights and best interests of the child.in re josiah,supra,at,d,citing g.july.the guardian,therefore,becomes a fiduciary whose role is to investigate the child circumstances and advocate for the child best interests.in re josiah,supra,at,d.
section,subdivision f provides that in dependency proceedings either the child or the counsel for the child,with the informed consent of the child if the child is found by the court to be of sufficient age and maturity to so consent may invoke the privilege counsel shall be holder of th is privilege if the child is found by the court not to be of sufficient age and maturity to so consent thus,once an attorney has been appointed for a minor in a juvenile dependency matter,the attorney holds the privilege to therapeutic communications sought to be introduced in evidence.see,subd.f.
in ruling on the admissibility of evidence,the trial court is vested with broad discretion.t he court ruling will be upset only if there is a clear showing of an abuse of discretion.the appropriate test for abuse of discretion is whether the trial court exceeded the bounds of reason tudor ranches,state comp.ins.fund th,d.
counsel for chloe and ella held the privilege 
mark and the agency argue that the consideration before this court is who holds the privilege when the privileged communication arose before the onset of dependency proceedings and before the court appointed counsel for the minors.we conclude that the holder of the privilege is determined at the time the disclosure of the confidential communications is sought to be introduced in evidence.
mark sought to introduce in evidence statements made by corbett after giddens had been appointed counsel for chloe and ella.accordingly,giddens had authority under sections and to assert the privilege on behalf of the girls during the course of the proceedings regardless of whether the conversations between corbett and the girls took place before the start of the proceedings,giddens still had the authority to assert the privilege on the girls behalf.as discussed,a child guardian ad litem is charged with the most important assess the needs of a child and make recommendations to the court concerning the child best interests.see in re josiah,supra,cal th at,d.to deny the child guardian ad litem the ability to assert the privilege at the time the disclosures are sought would leave all discussions that took place in advance of the dependency proceedings without protection.therefore,the proper time for the guardian to invoke the privilege is at the time the disclosure of confidential discussions is attempted.the court did not err by allowing giddens to assert the privilege on behalf of the girls 
d.the court did not abuse its discretion when it disallowed corbett statements and testimony 
mark asserts the court abused its discretion and violated his due process rights by disallowing corbett statements in evidence because the statements were exculpatory and would have allowed him to refute the allegations against him.specifically,he asserts the girls did not disclose abuse to corbett and the information was favorable to him due to its exculpatory nature.
the privilege is not absolute and communications may be disclosed to those to whom disclosure is reasonably necessary for the accomplishment of the purpose for which the psychotherapist is consulted.in the juvenile dependency context therapy has a dual of the child to ameliorate the effects of abuse or neglect and the disclosure of information from which reasoned recommendations and decisions regarding the child welfare can be made.in re mark th,d.
the conversations the girls had with corbett in this case took place before the dependency proceedings began.the focus of those sessions was not for the girls to address their reactions to mark parenting techniques or alleged sexual abuse.therefore,the purpose of therapy with corbett was not to assist the dependency court in making its findings at the jurisdiction and disposition hearing,and the court did err by preserving the privilege and disallowing corbett statements.in any event,mark still had the option of presenting exculpatory evidence.he was allowed the opportunity to present corbett as a witness to testify concerning therapy provided to heather.mark also had the opportunity to call numerous other witnesses on his behalf,which he did even had corbett testified that the girls never disclosed abuse to her during therapy,the girls consistently disclosed the abuse to others,including social workers,dean and their nanny.the court did not abuse its discretion or violate mark due process rights by disallowing corbett statements and testimony in evidence.
due process claims 
mark contends he was denied his due process rights and a right to a fair hearing.specifically,he asserts the court erred when it found true chloe and ella petitions for physical abuse before it heard evidence concerning cole petition.mark also asserts the court should have declared a mistrial or dismissed the minors petitions because of bias on the part of social workers,discovery abuses and failure of the agency to follow protocols 
legal principles 
due process in the context of dependency law tends to focus on the right to a hearing,the right to notice and an opportunity to present objections.in re crystal th,d in re melinda d.the parent in a dependency proceeding has a due process right to confront and witnesses.in re mary d.the essence of due process is fairness in the procedure employed.ingrid superior court th,d.
background 
before the start of the contested jurisdiction and disposition hearing,mark filed numerous motions for the court consideration.the motions included a request that the court find social worker clark biased and strike her reports and a request that the court issue an order disallowing any testimony at trial relating to voice mail messages previously erased by the agency.the court denied mark motion concerning clark after finding that her conduct was not biased or unprofessional.concerning mark second motion,mark argued the agency destroyed evidence in the form of voice messages.mark argued he had requested a copy of various voice messages,but the agency claimed they had been inadvertently erased.after hearing the motion,the court ordered that any information surrounding the erased messages would not be allowed in evidence.at the conclusion of the hearing relating to cole petition,mark renewed his motion claiming clark was biased against him.the court,after hearing additional argument on the issue,denied the motion.
on september,after hearing evidence relating to the petitions filed on behalf of the girls,the court accepted a partial settlement of the case.the terms of the settlement provided that heather and dean submit on the reports and agree to the amended language of the petitions.heather and dean submitted to the section,subdivision b allegations as to both girls.heather also submitted to cole section,subdivision j petition.the agency requested a dismissal of the section,subdivision d claims
