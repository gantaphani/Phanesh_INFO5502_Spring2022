a minor,appeals from the order declaring him a ward of the court welf,entered following the juvenile court findings he possessed a concealable firearm,subd.a.the juvenile court ordered placed in the camp community placement program for a maximum confinement period of three years,two months.contends the juvenile court erred by denying his suppression motion.we disagree,and affirm.
factual and procedural background 
on july,the people filed a petition under welfare and institutions code section alleging that possessed a concealable firearm on june,subd.a.filed a motion to suppress evidence welf.at a combined hearing on both the suppression motion and the merits,the following evidence was adduced.
on june,at approximately,los angeles police department officer edgar hernandez,who was assigned to the rampart gang detail,was on patrol in the area of street and alexandria avenue in los angeles with his partner,officer godoy.the area was a stronghold of the street gang and was covered by the street gang injunction.hernandez was at the location due to numerous complaints from citizens about gang members,especially street,shooting at passing vehicles,selling narcotics and just hiding out.hernandez had personally made numerous arrests in the area for robbery,vandalism,weapons possession,and narcotics activity.
as hernandez and godoy were citing several street gang members for tobacco possession,detective george magallon,who was also assigned to the rampart division,came by to speak with them regarding an apparent shooting that had occurred the previous day.magallon had worked as a detective with the rampart gang investigative team for three months,and had worked patrol in the area between and.as officer hernandez and detective magallon spoke,they observed sprint across street through heavy traffic towards them,causing motorists to slow and honk.was sweating profusely and kept looking back.his facial expression suggested he was trying to get away from something.he appeared confused and nervous,as if something was happening.
officer hernandez had encountered on several prior occasions and knew his home,which was approximately block away,was an street gang stronghold.had admitted to hernandez that he was an street gang member,and had a tattoo indicating gang membership on his wrist.hernandez had previously served with the street gang injunction at his home and,within two weeks thereafter,had arrested him for unlawfully associating with gang members.
detective magallon had not had prior contacts with and did not recognize him.however,as was running,either hernandez or godoy looked in direction and mentioned name in a conversational tone.because the other officer recognized,magallon concluded he had had contacts with in the past.
detective magallon immediately detained for crossing the street illegally,but was more concerned about why was running.magallon was unsure if he had robbed someone,if he had been shot at or if he had shot at someone.based on demeanor and behavior,and the fact they were in gang territory,magallon believed was running away from something,whether he had just victimized someone or he had been a victim.because the area was documented street gang territory,magallon did not know if maybe rival gang members were in the area and maybe there was a victim a few blocks away.i just wanted to investigate if any criminal activity had taken place.magallon concerns were based on j ust knowing the area,prior experience,having worked that area demeanor,his actions.magallon decided to perform a pat search because he believed he needed to investigate whether a crime had occurred.he explained,if some type of crime had taken place,i thought that a weapon had been used,either by or against 
magallon grabbed hand or wrist and ordered him to step towards a wall.when magallon,he discerned a hard object in front trouser pocket and asked what it was.replied,it a,sir.magallon then retrieved a small semiautomatic handgun,which was loaded with six live rounds.
was arrested.after being advised of and waiving his rights,during an interview at the police station told officer hernandez that he had found the gun five days earlier and kept it for protection from his enemies.
the juvenile court denied the suppression motion.it concluded there was no dispute the initial stop for the traffic violation was legal.the facts that was running through traffic in an area known for street gang activity,was looking around,appeared nervous,and was known to one of the officers,coupled with magallon experience in the area and the fact he was present to investigate a shooting that had occurred one block away the day before,justified the pat search.
as noted,the juvenile court sustained the petition,declared the offense a felony,and placed in the camp community placement program for a period of confinement not exceeding three years,two months.
discussion 
contends the juvenile court erred by denying his suppression motion,and therefore the court order sustaining the july,petition must be reversed.we disagree.
the fourth amendment guarantees the right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures by law enforcement personnel,terry ohio,d people maury cal th,d,people camacho cal th,d.on review of the trial court denial of a suppression motion,we defer to the trial court express or implied factual findings if supported by substantial evidence,but exercise our independent judgment to determine whether,on the facts found,the search or seizure was reasonable under the fourth amendment.people maury,supra,at,d,people camacho,supra,at,d,people jenkins cal th,d,people medina th,d.challenges to the admissibility of a search or seizure must be evaluated solely under the fourth amendment.people carter cal th,d.
it is clear that detective magallon initial stop of was lawful,and does not argue to the contrary.a n officer may,consistent with the fourth amendment,conduct a brief,investigatory stop when the officer has a reasonable,articulable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot.illinois wardlow,d.although police officers may not arrest or search a suspect without probable cause and an exception to the warrant requirement,they may temporarily detain a suspect based only on a reasonable suspicion that the suspect has committed or is about to commit a crime.citations.such detentions are permitted,notwithstanding the fourth amendment requirements of probable cause and a search warrant,because they are limited intrusions that are justified by special law enforcement interests.citations.citation.people durazo th,d.an ordinary traffic stop is treated as an investigatory detention,a terry stop.ibid.a terry stop is justified if it is based on at least reasonable suspicion that the individual has violated the vehicle code or some other law.id.at,d.here,run across the street constituted a traffic violation for which he could lawfully be stopped.see,pedestrians not crossing in a crosswalk are required to yield the to all vehicles so near as to constitute an immediate hazard people superior court brown d.where officer saw pedestrian commit a traffic violation,he had the right and duty to detain and cite.
contends,however,that even if the initial stop was lawful,the subsequent pat search violated the fourth amendment.according to,after he was stopped for the traffic infraction,he ought to have been told why he was being stopped,given a citation and then been allowed to leave freely.see people mcgaughran cal d,people medina,supra,th at,d.
when an officer reasonably suspects that an individual whose suspicious behavior he or she is investigating is armed and dangerous to the officer or others,he or she may perform a pat search for weapons.terry ohio,supra,at.giovanni superior court th,d people dickey th,d people garcia th,d.the sole justification for the search is the protection of the officer and others nearby,and the search must therefore be confined in scope to an intrusion reasonably designed to discover weapons.terry ohio,supra,at.a pat search is a serious intrusion upon the sanctity of the person,which may inflict great indignity and arouse strong resentment,and it is not to be undertaken lightly.i
