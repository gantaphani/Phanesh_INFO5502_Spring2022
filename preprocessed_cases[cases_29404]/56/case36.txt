background 
on july,was arrested in lake township,pennsylvania,for indecent conduct.he was taken to the center,a secure detention facility for children alleged to be delinquent or adjudicated delinquent and awaiting final disposition and placement,and remained there until august,
while at the center,was physically assaulted by other juvenile residents on numerous occasions.on july,reported that other residents had,among other things,spit on him,punched him in the arm,put his head in a garbage can,and thrown urine on his bed.an incident report completed by one of the center workers,dated august,states that was hit on the back of the head with a paddle thrown by another resident.another incident report,dated august,relates that sustained a wound to his chest.the wound would not stop bleeding,and was taken to the hospital for treatment.other incident reports were completed by the center workers on an almost daily basis between august and august.these reports reveal that other residents punched in the face,hit him,choked him,whipped him in the eye with a towel,and threatened him with physical harm.the assaults left with multiple bruises over his body,puncture wounds,black eyes,and swollen lips.the assaults also caused to suffer humiliation,fear,and emotional distress.
prior to his detention,had eleven prior psychiatric inpatient hospitalizations for behavior problems,was seeing a psychiatrist in the community,and had been taking medication to treat his attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd.suffered from several other mental and behavioral disabilities,including anxiety disorder,depressive disorder,atypical bipolar disorder,and intermittent explosive disorder.the center administrators and supervisors were made aware of these facts upon admission to the center or shortly thereafter.mental and behavioral problems were reflected in his behavior at the center,which included teasing and provoking other residents.after admission to the center,he initially did not receive any medication for his adhd because the center could not obtain the necessary authorization to refill his prescription.
on july,a psychiatric evaluation was performed on by paul gitlin for the purpose of assessing current mental health treatment needs.during the evaluation,complained to gitlin about the treatment he was subjected to by other residents,and gitlin observed that had a bruise on his arm.gitlin noted that had a long history of mental health and behavioral problems and that was having difficulty at the center because of his untreated adhd.gitlin diagnosis of included a global assessment functioning scale of out of a possible,indicating behavior that is considerably influenced by delusions or hallucinations or serious impairment in communication or judgment or inability to function in almost all areas.diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders ed.gitlin stated that it was medically necessary for to have a highly planned day,days a week,days a year,and for to receive medication on a continual basis in order to reduce his impulsiveness and motor restlessness.gitlin entered an order for to receive the medication dexedrine,and began receiving the medication on july.after gitlin evaluation of,and during the remainder of his detention,no mental health professional was called in to see or consult with the center staff about behavior,despite the ongoing difficulty workers were having with him.
during detention,the center administrators directed that should be placed on the girls side of the center for a majority of the day.however,workers periodically failed to abide by this directive,which resulted in being placed with boys who had previously assaulted him.on one occasion,was sent from the girls side to the boys side because he was getting on the nerves of a worker on the girls side.
on august,appeared in the luzerne county court of common pleas,juvenile division,for a disposition hearing.at the conclusion of the hearing,the court committed to northwestern intermediate treatment facility northwestern in northumberland county,pennsylvania,for an indeterminate period of time.
on the day of his admission to northwestern,john deangelo,a counselor at northwestern,saw that was bleeding from a puncture wound on his chest.when deangelo asked about the wound,told him that he had been stabbed with an unknown object while at the center.went on to describe to deangelo other physical assaults visited upon him by residents of the center.deangelo proceeded to complete an incident report concerning the alleged physical assaults.deangelo reported that told him staff at the center knew about the assaults but did not do anything to stop them.in addition to the incident report,deangelo completed a report of suspected child abuse,dated august,in which he recounted allegations of abuse while at the center and inaction by the center staff.the report states that feared this type of abuse would continue at each of his future placements.deangelo and another member of the northwestern staff observed that eyes were black and blue when he arrived at northwestern and that appeared to be very scared.northwestern staff indicated that expressed fear that he would be hurt by other children at northwestern.
in july of,by and through his next friend and mother,commenced a and state tort action against the center and the following administrators and staff sandra brulo,the center chief juvenile probation officer,who acted as the center chief administrator louis kwarcinski,the center deputy chief of juvenile probation jerome prawdzik,the detention supervisor at the center chris traver,michael considine,and chris parker,former workers at the center elaine yozviak,a former registered nurse at the center and mark puffenberger,a physician who provided contract services to the center.the suit alleged that the defendants violated substantive due process rights under the fourteenth amendment to be free from harm and to receive appropriate medical treatment while in their custody.
ii.district court opinion 
after discovery,the defendants moved for summary judgment.the district court granted the defendants motion on june.in its memorandum accompanying the order granting summary judgment,the district court addressed each of claims against the defendants.
count one.count one of complaint alleged that the center and brulo and kwarcinski,in their official capacities,were liable for failing to protect from harm and failing to treat him,and that puffenberger was liable in his official capacity for failing to treat 
alleged several deficiencies on the part of the center,brulo,and kwarcinski as the basis for liability on count one.the first allegation concerned deficient hiring and staffing practices.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of brulo and kwarcinski on this allegation,after concluding that failed to show a direct causal link between injuries and the alleged hiring of employees without the requisite educational degree or the alleged understaffing of the center.the second allegation concerned inadequate training of the center staff.the district court granted summary judgment on this allegation because failed to present evidence from which deliberate indifference could be inferred.the third allegation concerned the lack of a written policy or protocol to ensure youth safety.the district court granted summary judgment to brulo and kwarcinski on this allegation because there was no direct causal link between the lack of a policy and alleged injuries.the final allegation concerned the lack of policies and procedures to address the mental and physical health needs of residents.on this allegation,the district court held that there was no evidence to suggest that the defendants actions were deliberately indifferent.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of puffenberger on claims that puffenberger failed to develop adequate medical policies for the center.the district court assumed,for purposes of summary judgment,that puffenberger was responsible for developing such policies.however,the district court held that summary judgment was appropriate because there was no direct causal connection between injuries and the allegedly deficient medical policies.
count two.count two alleged that brulo,kwarcinski,and prawdzik were liable in their individual capacities for failing to protect from harm and failing to treat him.the claims against brulo,kwarcinski,and prawdzik in count two were based on their failure to develop policies and their failure to adequately supervise the center workers.because the district court found that no workers under the supervision of these defendants violated constitutional rights,it granted summary judgment in favor of brulo,kwarcinski,and prawdzik in their individual capacities.
count three.count three alleged that prawdzik,traver,parker,and considine were liable,in their individual capacities,for failing to protect from harm.claims against prawdzik,considine,traver,and parker were based on allegations that the staff failed to intervene soon enough when violence between and other residents began to develop and failed to take for medical care.
regarding claims that the staff did not intervene soon enough,the district court compared the situation to a prison disturbance and considered whether the staff acted maliciously and sadistically to cause harm.see fuentes wagner,cir.in the district court view,there was no evidence that the staff acted maliciously or sadistically.with regard to the alleged failure of the staff to take to the nurse on certain occasions,the district court held that the evidence did not support a conclusion that this was done with deliberate indifference to a serious medical need of,since he sustained mostly bruises from the altercations.
count four.count four alleged that puffenberger and yozviak were liable in their individual capacities for failing to treat.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of puffenberger and yozviak,concluding that any omissions by yozviak did not amount to a wanton infliction of pain and the evidence against puffenberger suggested,at most,negligence.
iii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,viewing the underlying facts and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.coal ass babbitt,cir.summary judgment is appropriately granted where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.however,summary judgment should not be granted where there is a genuine dispute about a material fact,that is,if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.anderson liberty lobby,d.
substantive due process 
in order to maintain a claim,a plaintiff must show that the defendant deprived him of a right or privilege secured by the constitution or laws of the united states while acting under color of state law.williams borough of west chester,cir.analysis of a claim begins by identifying the exact contours of the underlying right said to have been violated and then determining whether the plaintiff has alleged a deprivation of a constitutional right at all.nicini morra,cir county of sacramento lewis,d.
there appears to be no dispute between the parties that has a liberty interest in his personal security and,which is protected by the fourteenth amendment.see youngberg romeo,d.the question thus becomes whether has adduced sufficient facts from which a reasonable jury could conclude that the defendants conduct constituted a violation of his constitutional rights.to answer this question,we must determine what level of conduct is egregious enough to amount to a constitutional violation and whether there is sufficient evidence that the defendants conduct rose to that level.nicini,at.
when executive action is at issue,a violation of the fourteenth amendment right to substantive due process may be shown by conduct that shocks the conscience.lewis,at.negligent conduct is never egregious enough to shock the conscience,but conduct intended to injure most likely will rise to the level of.see id.at.in between these two extremes is a middle range of conduct known as deliberate indifference,which may rise to the level of in certain circumstances.id.at.the question of whether conduct amounting to deliberate indifference is sufficient to shock the conscience requires an exact analysis of the circumstances in a given case.id.at.
the deliberate indifference standard is sensibly employed only when actual deliberation is practical.id.at.as in a prison setting,we believe the custodial setting of a juvenile detention center presents a situation where forethought about a resident welfare is not only feasible but obligatory.id.we therefore conclude that this case is properly analyzed using the deliberate indifference standard.the circumstances of this case present a situation where the persons responsible for during his detention at the center had time to deliberate concerning his welfare.see leamer fauver,cir.we now turn to the claims against each of the defendants.
claims against yozviak and puffenberger 
as to the claims in count one and count four against puffenberger and yozviak,we sustain the district court grant of summary judgment in their favor.we find no error in the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of yozviak on claim that she is liable for failing to treat him.like the district court,we find no evidence in the record to support claims that yozviak acted with deliberate indifference in her alleged failure to disseminate information to the center staff about mental health history or take other steps in response to the information.
likewise,we find no error in the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of puffenberger.the evidence reveals that puffenberger is a general physician who was under contract with the center to perform a medical evaluation of each resident,including a physical examination,within hours of admission.puffenberger saw on only one occasion when he conducted the physical examination,and the record does not include any evidence that puffenberger was asked,or required,to conduct a psychiatric evaluation of even if we assume for the purposes of summary judgment that puffenberger had some responsibility for formulating policies for the center,our review of the record leads us to the conclusion that failed to present sufficient facts that any failure of puffenberger with respect to his duties rose to the level of deliberate indifference.
claims against the center and brulo and kwarcinski in their official capacities 
asserts claims against brulo and kwarcinski in their official capacities,based on their status as policymakers for the center,and the center itself.a suit against a governmental official in his or her official capacity is treated as a suit against the governmental entity itself.see hafer melo,d.a governmental entity,like the center,can not be liable under a theory of respondeat superior or vicarious liability.see monell new york dep t of social,d.rather,in order for a governmental entity generically referred to as a municipality to be liable for the violation of a constitutional right under,the plaintiff must identify a policy or custom of the entity that caused the constitutional violation.bd.of county comm rs of bryan county,brown,d.a plaintiff can establish causation by demonstrat ing that the municipal action was taken with deliberate indifference as to its known or obvious consequences.id.at.
has identified the following policies or customs of the center as providing a basis for liability deficient hiring and staffing policies and practices lack of an adequate training program for the center workers in critical areas such as conflicts between youths and managing youth behavior generally lack of established protocols to ensure youth safety,including the management of problematic youth behavior,of conflicts,and identification and protection of children at risk of victimization and lack of established policies to address the mental and physical health needs of youth residents.
the district court did not focus on whether had produced evidence of the existence of the alleged policies or customs.instead,the district court directed its analysis to whether there was a direct causal link between the alleged policies or customs and the harms suffered by see kneipp tedder,cir stating a plaintiff must establish that the government policy or custom was the proximate cause of the injuries sustained.in the district court view,evidence of a causal connection was lacking.our review of the record leads us to hold there exist sufficient facts to prevent the grant of summary judgment such that a jury should make the ultimate determination as to the violation of the alleged policies or customs,as we discuss more fully below.once evidentiary proof is adduced,the issue of proximate cause is best left to the determination of a trier of fact.see id.
deficient hiring and staffing 
presented evidence that a number of the center workers did not meet state standards for educational training.under state law,the center workers had to possess,at a minimum,either an associate degree in one of the social sciences or exceptional ability in lieu of the academic credentials.b.employment applications produced for certain workers reveal that these workers did not possess the requisite educational degree and there is no evidence that they had the credentials that would render them otherwise qualified for the job.
more significantly,presented evidence from which it may be inferred that the center failed to ensure that there were enough workers on duty to appropriately supervise youth at all times.although brulo testified in her deposition that the center complied with staffing ratios,other evidence suggests that the number of workers supervising the residents was inadequate.christopher traver testified that he had to supervise as many as ten residents at one time,and he submitted a resignation letter in which he complained that only one worker would be left with the residents while he would be directed to complete tasks unrelated to supervising the residents,such as cleaning and other duties.
there is also evidence in the record that the center was having problems with the supervision of residents by workers at or around the time was a resident.for example,there are letters of reprimand from the center administrators to individual workers,rebuking those workers for failing to adequately supervise the residents and failing to follow certain security measures.
the above evidence is at least sufficient to create a fact issue as to whether the center had a policy or custom of deficient hiring and staffing.in addition to this evidence,submitted the unrebutted testimony of a corrections expert,paul demuro,who opined that the problems with inadequate supervision of residents directly contributed to the abusive treatment endured at the center.the district court did not discuss this evidence,but we believe the evidence provides a causal link between the hiring and staffing policies and injuries.as long as the causal link between the alleged policy or custom and the constitutional injury is not too tenuous,the question whether the municipal policy or custom proximately caused the constitutional infringement should be left to the jury.bielevicz dubinon,cir.based on this standard,we conclude the evidence of the causal connection between these policies and injuries presented a jury question.
inadequate training 
analysis of substantive due process claims requires full consideration of all the circumstances of a given case.see lewis,at.therefore,the evidence of deficient hiring and staffing policies must be considered in context with the evidence submitted concerning the lack of an adequate training program for the center workers.contends the center failed to train its workers with respect to deescalating conflicts between youth,managing youth behavior generally,dealing with sex offenders,and identifying and protecting youth in the population who would be easily victimized.
a municipality may be liable for failing to train its employees if that failure amounts to deliberate indifference.see city of canton harris,d explaining that failure to train may amount to a policy or custom that is actionable under when in light of the duties assigned to specific officers or employees,the need for more or different training is so obvious,and the inadequacy so likely to result in the violation of constitutional rights,that the policymakers of the city can reasonably be said to have been deliberately indifferent to the need.the deficiency of a municipality training program must be closely related to the plaintiff ultimate injuries.id.at.
the record discloses the following with respect to the training of the center workers.workers received a orientation after they were hired,which essentially involved training with respect to such issues as the center physical plant and fire safety.brulo testified that the orientation included training on dealing with behavioral issues,but she did not identify any specific training in this area.brulo also spoke generally about training in the areas of mental health and dealing with children,but she failed to describe with any specificity the training program for workers.
kwarcinski testified that the entire staff of the center received training on dealing with physical threats to their own safety and threats from bombs or weapons.although kwarcinski testified that staff received training on defensive tactics in dealing with conflicts between residents,he stated that there was no training on how to conflicts between youths or identify children that could be easily victimized by other residents in the center.other testimony indicates that workers received training in cpr and first aid but did not receive training in youth conflicts or identifying and protecting youths that could be easily victimized.
against this evidence,presented the unrebutted testimony of his corrections expert,demuro.demuro opined that the center did not have an adequate training program for its staff and did not meet nationally recognized standards for training,which included having forty hours of training.in demuro opinion,the center failure to train its staff and follow other recognized standards for the operation of juvenile detention facilities directly contributed to the inappropriate treatment of while he was detained.
the center suggests that the numerous incident reports filed by workers demonstrate that claim can not be sustained.however,we fail to see the logic in this argument.rather than support the center position,we see how a jury could view the incident reports as additional evidence of the lack of training for the workers.several of the incident reports indicate that workers watched conflicts between and other residents escalate without intervening,resulting in physical injury to viewing the incident reports in the light most favorable to,they demonstrate the need for more or different training of workers to deal with residents like,who have significant behavioral and mental health problems.the incident reports also support an inference that recurrent harm to at the hands of other residents was predictable.see bryan county,at.a high degree of predictability may also support an inference of causation that the municipality indifference led directly to the very consequence that was so predictable.
in our view,the evidence supports an inference that the potential for conflict between residents of the center was high.taken as a whole,we believe the evidence concerning the center failure to train its workers in areas that would reduce the risk of a resident being deprived of his constitutional right to security and was sufficient to prevent the grant of summary judgment.in other words,we can not hold that the center was not deliberately indifferent to the risk as a matter of law.berg county of allegheny,cir.viewing the record in the light most favorable to,we conclude the evidence concerning the center training program presents a genuine issue of material fact as to the sufficiency of that program and whether the inadequacies in the program bear a causal relationship to injuries.
lack of policies to ensure youth safety 
on appeal,argues he presented sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could infer that the center lack of established policies and procedures to ensure youth safety may have caused his injuries at least in part.bielevicz,at.in this regard,focuses primarily on the center lack of a written policy or procedure for reviewing and following up on incident reports.
there is contradictory testimony in the record regarding who was responsible for reviewing incident reports and deciding what course of action should be taken in response.brulo and kwarcinski believed jerome prawdzik was responsible for reviewing all incident reports in the first instance,investigating them,and giving feedback to the workers.however,prawdzik testified that incident reports would first go to kwarcinski,who would decide which reports should go to prawdzik.prawdzik indicated that either brulo or kwarcinski had responsibility for deciding what course of action should be taken in response to the incident reports.
demuro testified that the center had diffuse accountability and poor communication in key areas such as reviewing and following up on incident reports.in his opinion,deficiencies like these illustrated that the center had seriously flawed policies and procedures that contributed to injuries and abusive treatment.in addition to relying on this testimony,asserts that a written policy clarifying the roles and responsibilities of the center administrators and staff with respect to the incident reports would have at least minimized the chance that would be inappropriately placed with youth who had previously assaulted him.
although this issue presents a close question on whether the center failure to establish a written policy and procedure for reviewing and following up on incident reports amounts to deliberate indifference,we conclude that a reasonable jury could conclude from the evidence that by failing to establish such a policy the center disregarded an obvious consequence of its action,namely,that residents of the center could be at risk if information gleaned from the incident reports was not reviewed and acted upon.similarly,a reasonable jury could infer that the failure to establish the policy was causally related to the constitutional violations of which complains.see natale camden county corr.facility,cir holding that a reasonable jury could conclude that a governmental entity failure to establish a policy to address the immediate medication needs of inmates was deliberately indifferent.
lack of policies regarding residents physical and mental health needs 
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the center,brulo,and kwarcinski on claim that the lack of policies or procedures to address the physical and mental health needs of residents led to a violation of his constitutional rights.the district court concluded that there was insufficient evidence that the center was deliberately indifferent to medical needs,and insufficient evidence that any policy or custom of not providing mental health care worsened condition or otherwise caused him constitutional injury.
we first address the district court conclusion that presented insufficient evidence to suggest that the center was deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs.in this regard,the district court applied the deliberate indifference standard for eighth amendment claims brought by prisoners against prison officials for.takes issue with the application of this standard,noting that he was not a convicted prisoner but merely a juvenile detainee.given his status as a detainee,maintains his claims must be assessed under the fourteenth amendment.
we do not dispute that claims are appropriately analyzed under the fourteenth amendment since he was a detainee and not a convicted prisoner.however,the contours of a state due process obligations to detainees with respect to medical care have not been defined by the supreme court.see city of revere,d.yet,it is clear that detainees are entitled to no less protection than a convicted prisoner is entitled to under the eighth amendment.see see also fuentes,at.in estelle gamble,d,the supreme court held that a prisoner may state a cause of action under upon showing that a prison official was deliberately indifferent to his serious illness or injury.id.at.it is under this standard that we assess whether has presented sufficient evidence to show that the center was deliberately indifferent to his serious mental health needs.
presented evidence that the center administrators were aware,upon his admission,that he had serious mental health and behavioral problems,which required medication and psychiatric care.there is conflicting evidence in the record regarding whether the center ever contacted treating psychiatrist to discuss his medication and treatment needs.also presented evidence that after gitlin evaluation of him on july,no other mental health professionals were consulted or asked to treat,despite the ongoing difficulties the center was having in managing his behavior.rather than attending to the underlying mental health issues contributing to the difficulties in managing,the center viewed him as merely a behavior problem.
presented the unrebutted testimony of his psychiatric expert,annie steinberg,who stated that the center did not provide appropriate treatment for mental health condition while he was a resident.according to steinberg,the center did not monitor,or recognize the exacerbation of psychiatric symptoms,warning signs and the need for modifications to the intervention,or demonstrate the fundamental principles relevant to the care of juveniles.at.
we conclude the evidence presented was sufficient to survive summary judgment on whether the center was deliberately indifferent to mental health needs.a reasonable jury could conclude from the evidence that the center knew about significant mental health issues but was unprepared to take the steps necessary to address those issues.we believe a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether the center failure to establish policies to address the mental health needs of residents like amounted to deliberate indifference.
we next turn to argument that he presented ample evidence that the center lack of policies to address the physical and mental health needs of residents caused him harm.presented the unrebutted testimony of demuro that the center had a seriously flawed intake and assessment system,which failed to provide for the sharing and dissemination of critical information about his mental health history.demuro opined that poor staff communication,particularly concerning the medical and mental health needs of residents,contributed to ongoing abuse by other residents.in addition to demuro testimony,presented evidence that the center never contacted his treating psychiatrist after his admission and had no protocols to address when a resident treating psychiatrist was to be contacted,what was to be done once a resident received a mental health evaluation,and who was responsible for communicating information about a resident mental health concerns to the staff.there were also the specific recommendations made by gitlin for managing mental health problems and behavior,which do not appear to have been read by the center administrators,shared with the workers,or incorporated into a plan for safety or treatment.finally,steinberg opined that the center failure to provide appropriate treatment for mental health illnesses and protect from harm worsened mental health condition.argues this testimony demonstrates that the combination
