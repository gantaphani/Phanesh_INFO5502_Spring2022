discussion 
section and california rules of court rule,which control the dissemination of confidential juvenile records,reflect a determination by the legislature that the juvenile court has both the sensitivity and expertise to make decisions about access to juvenile records.pack kings county human services agency th,d in re keisha th,d.section permits only certain identified categories of individuals to inspect juvenile records without prior leave of the juvenile court.see,subd.a a l subparts a l.any other person not included in one of the categories of subparts a l who wants to see juvenile records must secure the permission of the juvenile court.subpart m.subpart m gives the juvenile court the exclusive authority to determine when juvenile records will be released to an other person.superior court cal d,in re tiffany th,d in re michael th,d.
because it is not among the chosen of subparts a l,a grand jury has no right to inspect juvenile records and thus must petition the court as any other person under subpart m in re keisha,supra,th at,d.rule,subdivision c,requires that a subpart m applicant 
petition the court for authorization using judicial council form,petition for disclosure of juvenile court records.the specific records sought shall be identified based on knowledge,information,and belief that such records exist and are relevant to the purpose for which they are being sought.petitioner shall describe in detail the reasons the records are being sought and their relevancy to the proceeding or purpose for which petitioner wishes to inspect or obtain the records.rule,subd.c.
when such a petition is presented,the juvenile court duty is to balance the interests of the child and other parties to the juvenile court proceedings,the interests of the petitioner,and the interests of the public.rule,subd.b.to do so,the court must take into account any restrictions on disclosure found in other statutes,the general policies in favor of confidentiality and the nature of any privileges asserted,and compare these factors to the justification offered by the applicant in order to determine what information,if any,should be released to the petitioner.pack kings county human services agency,supra,th at,d.the court may permit access only insofar as is necessary,and only if there is a reasonable likelihood that the records will disclose information or evidence of substantial relevance to the pending investigation.rule,subd.b.the process may be lengthy,and the balance of the concerns weigh predominately against access.pack kings county human services agency,supra,th at,d.
here,appellant made no showing,under the provisions of rule,subdivision c or otherwise,to warrant the release of any of the desired records or information.appellant simply made a general request to the court for a ll documents within the dependency case file and information contained therein,and appellant only justification was the statement grand jury investigation pursuant to penal code.because appellant did not provide the court with any specific facts concerning appellant need for the records or their relevance to any legitimate grand jury activity,the juvenile court had no basis upon which to determine whether and to what extent the request was appropriate.the court was unable to balance the confidentiality interests of the juvenile with the interests of the grand jury acting in its public watchdog function.the court therefore properly denied appellant subpart m petition.
appellant stance on this appeal is the same as its stance in the juvenile court.appellant claims the juvenile court was compelled to grant it unrestricted access to the identified juvenile records with no questions asked because it is a grand jury and there is a public interest in the unfettered investigative power of the grand jury which overrides what appellant characterizes as the public lesser interest in the confidentiality of juvenile court records.citing superior court th,d,appellant takes the position its status as a grand jury armed with the power to investigate matters of public concern established,without more,the required good cause for an access order under subpart m.appellant argument rests upon the premise that there is an irreconcilable conflict between section and penal code section which must be resolved in favor of the public policy concerns underlying penal code section 
we agree that strong public policy underlies the civil investigative function of a grand jury.people superior court grand jury cal d.but strong public policy also underlies the confidentiality accorded to juvenile proceedings superior court,supra,cal d at,in fact,the policy is so substantial it has resisted unrestricted intrusions based upon federal first amendment rights.see san bernardino county of public social services superior court d.
appellant does not suggest a principled basis upon which we might prefer its interests over those of the juvenile system appellant merely assumes that its identity as a grand jury suffices.whether this is so is beside the point,because we think any conflict between the competing public policies has already been resolved by the branch of with the constitutional power to decide what is wise and what is unwise public policy and which policy considerations are entitled to preeminence.see superior court county of mendocino cal th,d,the choice among competing public policy considerations in enacting laws is a legislative,not a judicial,function superior court,supra,cal d at,legislature decision in favor of the confidentiality of juvenile records represents a policy choice.thus far,the lawmakers have not been of the mind to permit a grand jury to have access to confidential juvenile records in the absence of a court order entered upon an adequate showing of need and relevance.title of part of the penal code,including sections and,was first enacted in.stats,ch.penal code section was amended in.stats,ch.other provisions of title have been amended and added to regularly over the years.the supreme court jurisprudence on the strict rule of grand jury secrecy extends back to at least.see daily journal,supra,cal th at,d.section was first enacted in stats,ch,and has been amended virtually every year since it first appeared see historical and statutory notes west.ed.foll.we must presume from this history that the legislature had the principle of grand jury secrecy in mind when it produced,and as it has continuously changed,section and thus that the legislature intentionally omitted grand juries from the select list found in the p
