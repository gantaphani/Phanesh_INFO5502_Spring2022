in a juvenile delinquency matter,the minor,real party in interest,was granted an order releasing names and contact information related to complaints against police officers following a properly noticed pitchess pitchess superior court cal d,motion.the minor counsel returned to court seeking additional information,claiming the originally disclosed information was inadequate.petitioner,the city of tulare,objected to this supplemental pitchess hearing on the basis petitioner had not received proper notice,resulting in inadequate time to prepare for the motion.the juvenile court found the hearing was merely a continuation of the previous hearing and ordered disclosure of additional information.on request of petitioner,the court stayed its order.petitioner filed a petition for writ of mandate seeking a noticed hearing before any additional information was disclosed.we issued an order to show cause to determine if the second pitchess hearing was subject to the notice requirements contained in evidence code section and code of civil procedure section.for the reasons that follow,we will grant mandate relief.
background 
the minor was charged with assault on a peace officer and eluding a peace officer.according to the officers,one officer threw a flashlight at the car the minor was driving as he tried to flee,breaking the front windshield.the minor disputed this report and claimed the officers used excessive force.the minor filed a pitchess motion seeking records maintained by the tulare police department that might aid in his defense.
on march,the juvenile court granted the motion,releasing certain names and contact information of complainants and witnesses on may,the minor counsel communicated by with counsel for petitioner.the minor counsel wrote that he had investigated each of the four complainants but had been unable to secure any witnesses.he stated he would be moving for discovery of the complaints themselves on may,the date set for trial.petitioner counsel responded that the police department has a strict policy of requiring parties seeking discovery to follow statutory procedures and recommended that the minor file an order shortening time as well as a motion for additional pitchess disclosure.even then,disclosed petitioner counsel,he would object to both.
a notice dated may,was filed stating that on may,the minor would be seeking an order for discovery of all of the relevant complaints themselves because the contact information that had been provided proved fruitless.attached to the motion was a declaration from counsel.it provided in relevant part 
i am informed and believe that my office received on or about april,the names and addresses of complainants and potential witnesses under the seal of the court.
i am informed and believe that an investigator from my office has diligently investigated the information with the following results 
complainant number reported deceased to the investigator.
complainant number unable to be located because address is for new purchaser after foreclosure.
complainant number unable to be located in mobile home park.
complainant number apparently in prison and the associated witness did not wish to testify.
i am therefore informed and believe that the discovery provided by this court has proven inadequate inasmuch as minor has not secured any witnesses.
on may,a readiness hearing was held.counsel for petitioner was not present.counsel for the minor and the people were present.at that time,the minor counsel offered to file an order shortening time.the court told him that would not be necessary.
on may,petitioner filed points and authorities in opposition to the supplemental pretrial pitchess discovery motion.petitioner argued that the minor was required to comply with the notice requirements contained in evidence code section and code of civil procedure section.petitioner claimed that notice was required in order to allow petitioner the proper opportunity to protect confidential and statutorily protected records of the police department.
the court considered the motion on may.at the outset,the court questioned whether a new pitchess motion needed to be filed or whether this was an extension of the originally granted motion.the court stated its belief that this was merely an extension and new information was not being disclosed because the court had already ruled that the minor had the right to investigate certain claims.petitioner responded that it needed proper notice for the police department to get someone to the hearing with the records and also needed time to follow up on whether the witnesses the minor claimed were unavailable were,in fact,unavailable.the court responded that it was relying on the declaration by the minor counsel and that the court had no reason to believe the declaration was not a true and accurate declaration.the court pointed out that if complainant is deceased,why would petitioner need to investigate any further the unavailability of the complainant.the court questioned how likely it was that petitioner would be able to contact any of the four witnesses the minor counsel said he could not gather information from.
petitioner responded that,while the standard of having exercised due diligence in searching for witnesses may be low,it was not convinced by the declaration that there was due diligence and petitioner would simply like the opportunity to try and locate the witnesses before there is full disclosure of copies of the complaints.the court again questioned what effort the police department would be able to put forth that was not already done by counsel for the minor.to this,petitioner counsel responded that he did not know but would like the opportunity to verify the facts as presented and believed he was entitled to notice so he could do so.
the court reiterated that it thought the matter was beyond the question of whether disclosure needed to be made because the decision to disclose was made at the time of the original motion.petitioner responded that the minor needs to show that he has exercised due diligence in seeking out information and has been unsuccessful.petitioner pointed out that,because minor is seeking additional information,privacy issues are involved,and those issues require fair and reasonable notice to be given.petitioner counsel emphasized that it was his understanding that any hearing involving pitchess requires notice.
the court pointed to people matos d.as authority for the theory that a court can release more information when the originally disclosed information is inadequate thus the motion for more information is merely an extension of the original pitchess motion and notice is not required.
counsel for the minor offered to provide an offer of proof regarding the declaration of due diligence the court said it would not require that at this time.the court questioned petitioner regarding what authority there was that petitioner should be able to challenge the due diligence of the minor.
the court ruled that evidence code section does not apply when there is a request to extend the original discovery orders.the court said the next question was the adequacy of the records previously disclosed and then whether the minor exercised due diligence in locating the witnesses.the court stated,the court does not believe that,as a matter of right,the police ought to contest that effort of due diligence.
the court then went through every reason offered by the minor concerning unavailability.the court found there would be no reason to check to see if complainant was available because he was dead.for complainant,no purpose would be served by the police looking for the party after a new purchaser bought the property owned by this person.for complainants and,the court merely restated the reasons listed in the declaration without any elaboration.the court found no further investigation would lead to the location of witnesses.thus the court found that further investigation would be fruitless.
the court ordered the custodian of records to appear with the records so the court could review the complaints in camera and determine whether any information should be redacted.p
