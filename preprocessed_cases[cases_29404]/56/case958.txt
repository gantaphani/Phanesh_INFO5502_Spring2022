the juvenile court sustained a petition alleging the minor,michael,violated penal code section,exhibiting an imitation firearm against another in such a way as to cause a reasonable person apprehension or fear of bodily harm.on appeal,the minor asserts,among other things,he did not violate penal code section because the person against whom he exhibited the imitation firearm did not experience apprehension or fear.instead,a bystander experienced apprehension or fear.we conclude the minor violated the statute and therefore affirm.
on january,kathy russell was employed at john sloat basic elementary school as an office manager.around,while school was in session and the children were in their classes,russell heard people talking on the playground next to the of people older than the elementary school children.she went to the window and saw three boys on the playground,apparently acting silly and laughing.the minor,who was one of the boys on the playground,was holding what appeared to be a handgun.he was pointing it straight out at a smaller boy,andre,from a distance of about feet.andre was ducking and had an odd expression on his face,as if he was pleading not to be shot.
immediately after russell saw the minor had a gun in his hand,she dropped to the ground,exclaimed they have a gun,moved away from the window,and immediately took steps to alert the teachers,the principal,and the police of the unsafe situation.russell and some of the teachers in an adjoining room initiated the school emergency procedures by locking down the school.
the three boys,including the minor,were detained at a nearby convenience store,and russell and a teacher who also witnessed the boys through the window were transported to that location to determine whether an identification could be made.they identified the minor as having been the one who had the gun.the boys,however,did not have a gun with them when they were detained,so they were released.soon thereafter,the police,acting on a tip from another boy,searched the three teenagers again and found an inoperable replica of a handgun in andre clothing.
the minor was the subject of several petitions alleging violations of criminal statutes over time.the allegations found true included such crimes as unlawful taking and driving of a vehicle,subd.a,battery,further unspecified statutory references are to the penal code,and escape welf,subd.a.the subsequent petition at issue here was filed on january,and alleged several crimes relating to the incident at john sloat basic elementary school.during the jurisdictional hearing and on the prosecution motion,the court amended the petition to allege a violation of section.the court found this allegation true.later,the court committed the minor to the california youth authority for a total term of three years eight months,which included a term of two months for the violation of section.
the minor appeals.he asserts error only in the true finding on the allegation he violated section.

iinterpretation of penal code section 
section provides every person who,except in,draws or exhibits an imitation firearm in a threatening manner against another in such a way as to cause a reasonable person apprehension or fear of bodily harm is guilty of a misdemeanor the phrase draws or exhibits an imitation firearm in a threatening manner against another in such a way as to cause a reasonable person apprehension or fear of bodily harm can be interpreted two ways.as the minor asserts,under one interpretation,the statute could apply to those situations where the perpetrator draws or exhibits an imitation firearm against another person in a threatening manner and this display causes the person against whom the imitation firearm is drawn or exhibited to experience reasonable apprehension or fear of bodily harm.alternatively,the phrase could apply to situations in which the perpetrator displays or exhibits an imitation firearm against another with the result that any reasonable person witnessing the event,even a reasonable bystander,experiences apprehension or fear of bodily harm.
in interpreting a statute where the language is clear,courts must follow its plain meaning.citation.however,if the statutory language permits more than one reasonable interpretation,courts may consider various extrinsic aids,including the purpose of the statute,the evils to be remedied,the legislative history,public policy,and the statutory scheme encompassing the statute.citation.in the end,we must select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the legislature,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute,and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.citation.citation.torres parkhouse tire service,cal th,d.
legislative history 
the legislative history of section reveals the policy concerns of the enacting legislature.this historical context shows the legislature intended to proscribe drawing or exhibiting an imitation firearm in a way that causes any reasonable person,even a reasonable bystander,to experience apprehension or fear of bodily harm.
the provision that later became section was enacted in as section,subdivision a.stats,ch.it stated every person who,except in,draws or exhibits a replica of a firearm in a threatening manner against another in such a way as to cause a reasonable person apprehension or fear of bodily harm is guilty of a misdemeanor.ibid.subdivision b of former section defined replica of a firearm as any device with the apparent capability of expelling a projectile by the force of air or an explosion and which is reasonably perceived by the person against whom the device is drawn or exhibited to be an actual firearm,including starter pistols and air guns.thus,to violate former section,the perpetrator had to draw or exhibit against another a device with the apparent capability of expelling a projectile and the person against whom the object was drawn had to perceive the device to be an actual firearm.
in,the legislature moved the provision from section to section.in doing so,the legislature changed the term replica of a firearm to imitation firearm,with a different definition.an imitation firearm is a replica of a firearm,which term is no longer defined in the code,that is so substantially similar in physical properties to an existing firearm as to lead a reasonable person to conclude that the replica is a firearm.consequently,the prohibited device is no longer defined in terms of what the person against whom the device is drawn reasonably perceives it to be.instead,it is defined in terms of what a reasonable person would conclude.the amendment did not speak to the ambiguity,noted above,concerning who must experience apprehension or fear of bodily harm.that language remained the same.however,the legislature change concerning how the device is defined indicates that the perception of the person against whom the device is drawn is not the only relevant consideration in determining whether a violation of section has occurred.
the legislative record suggests former section and current section were never intended to be limited to situations in which the person against whom the device was drawn experienced apprehension or fear of bodily harm.in early support of assembly bill,the bill that resulted in former section,the los angeles unified school district stated at this time the need exists to address the problem of individuals brandishing replicas of firearms in a threatening manner against individuals or peace officers.as reported by the news media in recent months,general law enforcement officers have shot,wounded,and even killed persons who displayed weapons in a threatening manner.los angeles unified sch,statement regarding assem.bill reg.sess.june.the district continued ab addresses the problem of replica weapons by categorizing the brandishing of these replicas within the same penal code provisions that apply to flaunting an actual firearm.this measure would impose a misdemeanor penalty on a replica weapon being drawn on a private citizen or a police officer.ibid.a july report of the senate judiciary com
