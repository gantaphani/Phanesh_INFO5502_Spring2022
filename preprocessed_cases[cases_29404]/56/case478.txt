under welfare and institutions code section et,which governs deferred entry of judgment dej,juvenile felons may have their charges dismissed and records sealed upon successfully completing probation spencer minor,a juvenile misdemeanant,contends the dej law violates equal protection principles by denying him the benefits afforded juvenile felons.we conclude there is a rational basis for the dej law focus on juvenile felons.accordingly,the dej law does not violate the equal protection clauses of the state and federal constitutions.
minor also contends a probation condition forbidding him from associating with persons he knows to be on probation is unconstitutionally overbroad and must therefore be modified.for reasons explained below,we disagree.
accordingly,we affirm the judgment.
at a party on august,a fight broke out between about people including minor and a male gang member named trevor,during which the group of people attacked trevor,threw bottles and chairs at him,and chased him into the street.amanda,a good friend of trevor,tried to break up the fight by pushing people out of the way.according to amanda,when she shoved minor,he socked her in the face.christina,amanda friend,saw minor throw amanda on the ground,get on top of her,and hit her.christina pushed minor off amanda.according to christina,minor got up and hit christina on the cheek.according to minor,he never hit either girl.
in a pretrial report,the probation department stated minor had been referred to the delinquency prevention program almost four years earlier for disruptive behavior and being unable to function properly in a regular school setting.he was currently attending a high school.he had participated in family counseling seven years earlier and in fourth grade had been caught with a marijuana like substance.the probation department concluded minor needed structure in his life and a higher level of supervision than could be provided if placed on a diversion program.the probation department therefore referred the matter to the district attorney.
the people petitioned to have minor declared a ward of the court under section on grounds he committed misdemeanor assault,and misdemeanor battery,on both amanda and christina.
minor denied all allegations in the petition and never requested the court to determine his eligibility for dej.at the jurisdictional hearing,defense counsel argued minor acted in.
the juvenile court found minor did not act in and found the petition allegations to be true beyond a reasonable doubt.it declared minor a ward of the court and placed him on formal,supervised probation with conditions.those conditions included a prohibition forbidding minor from associating with anyone who he knows to be on probation 
discussion 
because minor is a misdemeanant,the court did not err by failing to consider whether he was eligible for dej 
minor argues that limiting dej to minors charged with felonies violates his right to equal protection of the laws.he concludes the court erred by failing to determine whether he was eligible for dej.
minor may raise the equal protection issue for the first time on appeal 
on appeal,minor questions for the first time the constitutionality of the dej law exclusion of juvenile misdemeanants from its coverage.the people contend minor has forfeited his right to raise the question on appeal because he contested the petition allegations,failed to object below.
as to the people contention minor forfeited dej by contesting the petition,the people cite no section of the dej law that requires a minor,in order to retain a claim to dej,to admit a petition allegations even before receiving notification he or she is eligible for dej.we review the relevant dej provisions and rules on whether and when a minor who is otherwise eligible for dej must admit the petition allegations.
section,subdivision b requires a prosecutor,upon determining that a minor is eligible for dej,to provide the minor with information about dej.under section,subdivision a,the prosecutor written notification to the minor must include a clear statement that,in lieu of jurisdictional and disposition hearings,the court may grant dej with respect to any offense charged in the petition,provided that the minor admits each allegation contained in the petition and waives time for the pronouncement of judgment,italics added.under section,subdivision b,i f the minor consents and waives his or her right to a speedy jurisdictional hearing,the court may refer the case to the probation department or the court may summarily grant dej if the minor admits the charges in the petition and waives time for the pronouncement of judgment.italics added.the court may grant dej to the minor summarily under appropriate circumstances cal.rules of court,former rule d,and if not must conduct a hearing at which the court shall consider the declaration of the prosecuting attorney,any report and recommendations from the probation department,and any other relevant material provided by the child or other interested parties.in re luis th,d luis.
from the foregoing,it is clear that a minor must first admit a petition allegations in order to obtain a summary grant of dej.in addition,because the prosecutor notice must inform the minor that he or she must admit the petition allegations in lieu of a jurisdictional hearing,we can infer with respect to nonsummary grants that the minor must make such an admission sometime prior to the court grant of dej at the hearing on the minor suitability for dej 
here,however,because the prosecutor never initiated the prerequisite procedure for the court to consider granting dej to minor,minor never had an opportunity to admit the petition allegations in exchange for being considered for dej.under these circumstances,minor denial of the petition allegations at the jurisdictional hearing does not foreclose his dej claim on appeal.
the people also assert minor forfeited his equal protection claim by failing to object below.people burgener cal th,fn,d,see also in re aaron th,d.it is true that a constitutional right may be waived either directly or by inaction.people workman d.nonetheless,appellate courts have discretion to address constitutional issues raised on appeal punsly ho th,d,particularly where the issue presented is a pure question of law turning on undisputed facts in re samuel d.or when important issues of public policy are at issue people halvorsen cal th,d.minor points out he has not found a reported case involving an equal protection challenge to the dej law.we are cognizant,too,that if we fail to address this issue now,it may return as a habeas corpus petition alleging ineffective assistance of counsel.we therefore exercise our discretion to consider the merits of minor contention that the dej law violates the equal protection clauses of the california and federal constitutions.
the dej law does not violate minor right to equal protection 
the dej law was enacted as part of proposition,the gang violence and juvenile crime prevention act of,in march.the dej law provide s that in lieu of jurisdictional and dispositional hearings,a minor may admit the allegations contained in a section petition and waive time for the pronouncement of judgment.entry of judgment is deferred.after the successful completion of a term of probation,on the motion of the prosecution and with a positive recommendation from the probation department,the court is required to dismiss the charges.the arrest upon which judgment was deferred is deemed never to have occurred,and any records of the juvenile court proceeding are sealed.martha superior court th,d.
to come within the dej law ambit,a minor must be a felony offender charged with a crime not listed in section,subdivision b serious or violent offenses creating presumption of unfitness for juvenile jurisdiction or penal code section crimes rendering offender ineligible for probation,subd.a.if a minor meets the eligibility requirements for dej,the prosecuting attorney must provide notice thereof to the minor and the trial court must conduct the necessary inquiry and exercise discretion to determine whether the minor is suitable for dej.luis,supra,th at,d.a court may deny dej to a minor otherwise eligible if it deems the minor unsuitable for rehabilitation.in re sergio th,d.
minor asserts there is no rational basis for denying misdemeanants the benefits of the dej law,and therefore the dej law violates the state and federal constitutions equal protection guarantees.
when a statute is challenged on equal protection grounds,a court initial inquiry is twofold.it must first determine whether the state has adopted a classification that affects two or more similarly situated groups in an unequal manner.citations.this initial inquiry is not whether persons are similarly situated for all purposes,but whether they are similarly situated for purposes of the law challenged.cooley superior court cal th,d.
if the statute affects similarly situated groups unequally,the court must then decide whether to apply the strict scrutiny or rational basis test in analyzing the statute constitutionality.for most legislation a court will apply the rational basis test.the standard formulation of the test for minimum rationality citation is whether the classification is rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose.board of supervisors local agency formation com.cal th,d.a classification must be reasonable,not arbitrary,and must rest upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation,so that all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike.reed reed,d.
a reviewing court may correct a discriminatory classification by invalidating the invidious exemption and thus extending statutory benefits to those whom the legislature unconstitutionally excluded.sykes superior court cal d.a statute,once duly enacted,is presumed to be constitutional.unconstitutionality must be clearly shown,and doubts will be resolved in favor of its validity.lockyer city and county of san francisco cal th,d.
as to the first prong of the inquiry described above,minor bears the burden of showing,as a foundational matter,that the challenged classification affects similarly situated groups unequally.people wutzke cal th,d.because we conclude the dej law does not violate equal protection principles,we will assume,without deciding,that juvenile felons and juvenile misdemeanants are similarly situated for purposes of the dej law.
as to the second prong,minor acknowledges his claim is subject to the rational basis standard of review.people edwards d,d equal protection challenges based upon statutory ineligibility for diversion are reviewed under the rational basis standard.he contends that provisions which give preference to felons over misdemeanants in benefits can not survive a rational basis analysis.
for this proposition,minor relies on newland board of governors cal d,newland,where the defendant college board denied the plaintiff a community college teaching credential because he was a misdemeanant and ineligible for a certificate of rehabilitation.id.at.the board based its denial on former education code section the college credential statute,which barred issuance of a credential to anyone convicted of a sex offense newland,at,unless the applicant,inter alia,applied for or obtained a certificate of rehabilitation.ibid.such certificates,however,were limited to convicted felons.ibid.our supreme court concluded that this rather startling statutory preferential treatment for felons as contrasted with misdemeanants denies misdemeanants the equal protection of the laws.consequently the statutory requirement for a certificate of rehabilitation can not constitutionally be applied to deny plaintiff,a misdemeanant,a community college credential.id.at.
newland observed that no particular verbal formula for the rational basis test exists.newland,supra,cal d at.some decisions require that the classification bear some rational relationship to a conceivable legitimate state purpose citation others,that the classification must rest upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation.ibid.at bottom,however,a ll of the formulas require the court to conduct a serious and genuine judicial inquiry into the correspondence between the classification and the legislative goals ibid.accordingly,application of the rational basis test always requires an identification of the purpose of the statute.ibid.
the purpose of the college credential statute in newland was not further to punish the miscreant,but to protect the students,faculty and others who might be harmed by the employment of an unfit teacher.newland,supra,cal d at.but the statute had the perverse effect of providing that a felony sex offender who applies for a certificate of rehabilitation and who is otherwise fit,can obtain certification to teach in the community college system but that an otherwise fit misdemeanor sex offender is forever barred.id.at.this statutory discrimination against misdemeanants can claim no rational relationship to the protective purpose of the statute.ibid.the legislature could not possibly or sensibly have concluded that misdemeanants,as opposed to felons,constitute a class of particularly incorrigible offenders who are beyond hope of rehabilitation.ibid.newland concluded the statutory classification discriminating against misdemeanants,lacking a rational relationship to the legislative goals,denies misdemeanants the equal protection of the laws.id.at,see also gebremicael california com.on teacher credentialing th,d gebremicael refusing to construe statute to impose ludicrous and anomalous result of barring plaintiff,now convicted of a misdemeanor,and who never served time in state prison,from ever obtaining a teaching credential but allowing a person convicted of a straight felony who served time in state prison to obtain a credential.
relying on newland and gebremicael,minor argues the categorical exclusion of juvenile misdemeanants from the dej law benefits is irrational because the purpose of the dej statutes is to aid rehabilitation of minors,while protecting the public from more dangerous ones.he concludes,as did newland,that the legislature could not have sensibly considered misdemeanants to be beyond hope of rehabilitation.newland,supra,cal d at.as we shall explain,however,minor has stated the purpose of the dej law too broadly.
the voters stated purposes in adopting the dej law can be found in proposition uncodified findings and declarations juvenile court resources are spent disproportionately on violent offenders with little chance to be rehabilitated.if california is going to avoid the predicted wave of juvenile crime in the next decade,greater resources,attention,and accountability must be focused on less serious offenders such as burglars,car thieves,and first time felons who have potential for rehabilitation.this act must form part of a comprehensive juvenile justice reform package which incorporates major commitments to already commenced youth early intervention programs and expanded informal juvenile court alternatives for offenders.these efforts,which emphasize rehabilitative protocols over incarceration,must be expanded as well under the provisions of this act,which requires first time,juvenile felons to appear in court,admit guilt for their offenses,and be held accountable,but also be given a opportunity to demonstrate through good conduct and compliance with a treatment and supervision program that the record of the juvenile offense should justly be expunged.voter information guide,primary,text of,subd.j.
to put these legislative goals in context,proposition findings and declarations described the following state of affairs a reverse trend of overall crime declining,but juvenile crime rising the expectation that the juvenile population would grow substantially by the next decade the realization that violent and repeat serious juvenile offenders were not good candidates for policies and the conclusion that d ramatic changes were needed in the way we treat juvenile criminals,criminal street gangs,and the confidentiality of the juvenile records of violent offenders if we are to avoid the predicted,unprecedented surge in juvenile and
