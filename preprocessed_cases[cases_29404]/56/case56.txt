this case concerns the transfer of two juveniles to adult status for criminal prosecution in federal court for multiple charges relating to several alleged carjackings in the new orleans area.one of the juveniles,was charged with crimes arising from one alleged carjacking committed when he was years old and one alleged carjacking committed when he was years old,and the district court ordered he be transferred to adult status for trial on all of the charges against him.the statute authorizing such transfer,however,is not capable of a construction that supports transfer of a charged with the crimes in this case.because is statutorily ineligible for transfer to adult status for the charges arising from the alleged carjacking committed while he was,we reverse the district court order of transfer as to these counts.we affirm the district court order transferring to adult status for prosecution on the charges stemming from the alleged carjacking committed after his fifteenth birthday.we affirm the district court order transferring to adult status for trial on the charges stemming from two alleged carjackings,both committed after his fifteenth birthday,as well.
background 
the three carjackings at issue in this case involved an overlapping set of assailants,some of them defendants in this case and some of them not,on three distinct days.the other two juveniles mentioned in the below recitation,and,were also arrested and charged,but their case was severed from the case against and that is currently before us 
on july,while standing near her car,lillian blood blood,an elderly woman living in jefferson parish,louisiana,was accosted by a black male,face covered in a white towel,who brandished a gun and demanded her car keys.blood handed them over,and the perpetrator drove away.approximately minutes later,in the carrollton area of louisiana,blood car was involved in an accident,and jumped out and ran around the corner,where they threatened alexandra mompoint mompoint with a gun and stole her vehicle,driving it away from the scene.a neighbor,michael gaspard gaspard,who had witnessed the carjacking gave chase in his own car,and managed to stop the fleeing car by ramming the vehicle.gaspard approached the vehicle but the driver shot at him,missing him,and then drove away.other witnesses testified that about an hour after the second carjacking,three youths driving the stolen car engaged in a shooting in the carrollton area of new orleans,wounding three men none of them fatally.another witness told the police that handed a pistol to and that shot the men.

ii.analysis 
provides for federal jurisdiction over juveniles accused of certain crimes 
a juvenile alleged to have committed an act of juvenile delinquency shall not be proceeded against in any court of the united states unless the attorney general,after investigation,certifies to the appropriate district court of the united states that the juvenile court or other appropriate court of a state does not have jurisdiction or refuses to assume jurisdiction over said juvenile with respect to such alleged act of juvenile delinquency,the state does not have available programs and services adequate for the needs of juveniles,or the offense charged is a crime of violence that is a felony or certain drug crimes not at issue in this case,and that there is a substantial federal interest in the case or the offense to warrant the exercise of federal jurisdiction.
the statute also provides for the transfer of certain juveniles to adult status,upon motion of the attorney general,if such transfer would be in the interest of justice.specifically 
w ith respect to a juvenile fifteen years and older alleged to have committed an act after his fifteenth birthday which if committed by an adult would be a felony that is a crime of violence or an offense described in section of the controlled substances act,or section a,or of the controlled substances import and export act a,or section x of this title,or in section b,g,or h of this title,criminal prosecution on the basis of the alleged act may be begun by motion to transfer of the attorney general in the appropriate district court of the united states,if such court finds,after hearing,such transfer would be in the interest of justice.in the application of the preceding sentence,if the crime of violence is an offense under section a,b,c,or,if the juvenile possessed a firearm during the offense,section,a,or c,thirteen shall be substituted for fifteen and thirteenth shall be substituted for fifteenth.
this court has jurisdiction over the interlocutory appeal of a district court transfer order of a juvenile to adult status under the collateral order doctrine.united states juvenile,cir.
we must address one preliminary matter before turning to the merits of the transfer decision made by the district court below,namely whether was eligible for transfer to adult status upon the attorney general motion for the carjackings allegedly committed on july,when he was only fourteen years old.it is elemental that the starting point for interpreting a statute is the language of the statute itself.consumer prod.safety comm.gte sylvania,d,reproduced above,begins by establishing the circumstances under which a juvenile fifteen years or older is eligible for a transfer hearing when he is alleged to have committed an act after his fifteenth birthday which if committed by an adult would be a felony that is a crime of violence or an offense described in section of the controlled substances act,or section a,or of the controlled substances import and export act a,or section x of this title,or in section b,g,or h of this title.it then provides that when a juvenile is between the ages of thirteen and fifteen,he shall be eligible for adult criminal prosecution if the crime of violence is an offense under section a,b,c,or,if the juvenile possessed a firearm during the offense,section,a,or c.the most logical reading of this sentence is that if a juvenile is between the ages of thirteen and fifteen he is eligible for a transfer hearing if he is alleged to have committed a crime of violence that is an offense under section a,b,c,or,or he is alleged to have committed an offense that is a crime of violence under section,a or c and to have possessed a firearm while doing so.in other words,a juvenile between the ages of thirteen and fifteen must either be alleged to have committed an offense that is a crime of violence under the first set of statutes,or must be alleged to have possessed a firearm while committing an offense that is a crime of violence under the second set of statutes.in those two circumstances,the word thirteen in the provision concerning transfer hearings is substituted for fifteen.therefore,any juvenile between the ages of thirteen and fifteen who has not committed one of the first set of offenses listed or possessed a firearm while committing one of the second set of offenses listed,is not eligible for a transfer hearing 
this interpretation accords with the general purpose of the juvenile justice system,which has historically been one of rehabilitation.see generally application of gault,d discussing the history of the juvenile justice movement in the united states.the main purpose of the juvenile justice and delinquency prevention act,is to remove juveniles from the ordinary criminal process in order to avoid the stigma of a prior criminal conviction and to encourage treatment and rehabilitation.united states bilbo,cir internal citation and quotation marks omitted.see also united states juvenile male,cir except for that limited group of crimes to which mandatory transfer to adult status applies,the focus of the juvenile statutes is still on rehabilitation within the state systems.the purpose of this transfer provision is clearly to differentiate between certain ages and certain crimes,and the combination of the two,in determining which juveniles must be treated as juveniles and which may be treated as adults.it is logical to read the text as permitting all juveniles over age fifteen who have committed certain serious crimes to be eligible for a transfer hearing,but limiting the eligibility of younger juveniles for transfer hearings based on the type of crime committed and the severity of the offense.certain offenses,the first set,are considered severe enough that any alleged commission makes a juvenile between the ages of thirteen and fifteen eligible for a transfer hearing.the second set are of less severity,and therefore only make a juvenile between the ages of thirteen and fifteen eligible for a transfer hearing if they are aggravated,so to speak,by the additional element of possession of a firearm during the alleged commission.
the charges against for the carjackings allegedly committed on july,when he was fourteen,do not fall within either of the groups of enumerated statutes.is not alleged to have committed either offenses that would be crimes of violence under assault within federal maritime or territorial jurisdiction,murder,attempted murder or manslaughter within federal maritime or territorial jurisdiction or possession of a firearm during offenses that would be crimes of violence under robbery or burglary in federal maritime or territorial jurisdiction,bank robbery,a aggravated sexual abuse in federal maritime or territorial jurisdiction or c sexual abuse of a child in federal maritime or territorial jurisdiction or after crossing state lines.it thus does not appear that is eligible for a transfer hearing for the charges arising from the alleged carjackings committed on july.
this issue was not raised by the parties,but we will nevertheless address certain claims sua sponte in some circumstances 
we may raise an issue sua sponte even though it is not assigned or specified,when plain error is apparent.united states pineda ortuno,cir citing silber united states,d and united states adams,cir.unit a january we review an issue not raised below only for plain error,see,which is defined as an error that is clear or plain that affects the defendant substantial rights and that seriously affects the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states vasquez,cir.
united states gonzalez,cir.the error in this case is plain on the face of the statute.a juvenile between the ages of thirteen and fifteen may not be subject to a hearing concerning transfer to adult status unless he or she has allegedly committed one of the offenses as enumerated in the statute.has not been charged with an offense that brings him within the ambit of the statute.this error affects substantial rights.although a transfer hearing is not a determination on the merits of the charge,it subjects the defendant to the possibility of criminal conviction as an adult and the substantially more severe penalties that accrue to such conviction,while also increasing the risk that he will not be provided with rehabilitative services in an appropriate juvenile facility.courts and scholars have enumerated the many disadvantages of adult prosecution to a juvenile.see,ross martin,conspiratorial children the intersection of the federal juvenile delinquency act and federal conspiracy law,courts have noted that after transfer,a federal district court takes full adult jurisdiction over the case,in re sealed case juvenile transfer,that a transfer hearing can result in greatly increased punishment while never inquiring into the specifics of the alleged offense,and that a transferred juvenile loses rights to separate pretrial incarceration,see united states baker,cir,cert.denied,d,as well as protection against pretrial publicity that the accused can not regain,see sealed case,at.finally,it seriously affects the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings to prosecute a juvenile in a manner that congress has not authorized.therefore may not be prosecuted as an adult for any charges arising from the july,carjackings,which transpired before his fifteenth birthday.
was however,eligible for transfer to adult prosecution on the charges arising from the alleged carjacking on march,because he turned fifteen on november.he was eligible for transfer to adult prosecution for this second set of charges so long as he was alleged to have committed an act after his fifteenth birthday which if committed by an adult would be a felony that is a crime of violence.carjacking is always and without exception a crime of violence.united states frye,cir internal citation and quotation marks omitted.conspiracy to commit a crime of violence also qualifies as a crime of violence.see united states elder,cir see also united states greer,cir.was therefore eligible for transfer to adult prosecution for the charges arising from the march,alleged carjacking.
having determined that was ineligible for transfer to adult status on the first set of charges,we still must consider the merits of the district court decision ordering transfer for as to the charges arising out of the march,carjackings and ordering transfer for as to all charges.this court reviews factual findings made by a district court considering a motion to transfer a juvenile to adult status for clear error,and reviews the overall decision to grant or deny the transfer motion for abuse of discretion.united states juvenile,cir.a finding of fact is clearly erroneous when although there is evidence to support it,the reviewing court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.anderson city of bessemer city,d internal citation and quotation marks omitted.
there is a presumption in favor of juvenile status and it is therefore the government burden to prove,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the transfer is in the best int
