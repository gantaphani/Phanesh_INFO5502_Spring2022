the petition alleged the minor assaulted another person with a firearm within the meaning of penal code section,subdivision a.in a case settlement,the people amended the petition to include an allegation the minor committed the felony of being a minor in illegal possession of a firearm.the minor admitted the latter allegation,and the assault charge was dismissed.the court accepted the admission after the minor waived the requisite constitutional rights.the court declared the minor a ward of the court.
the minor was informed that his admission meant the court would make a choice at disposition between home probation and camp.the minor was told he would be sent to the california youth authority only in the event he again was in serious trouble.
the court set a date for a contested disposition hearing and ordered an evaluation of the minor by a psychologist.

the probation officer suggested that in camp the minor could obtain counseling for his anger and aggressive behavior.there was a need to protect the community from the minor.if supervised at home,there was no guarantee the minor would not persist in misconduct.punishment would impress on the minor his misconduct affected the community,as well as his victim 
the minor submitted to the court a psychological evaluation.the psychologist made her evaluation during an interview of the minor in juvenile hall.the psychologist outlined the facts of the shooting as revealed by the arrest report.she said the victim,sean martin martin,told deputy sheriffs that the minor and a boy named jessie met with martin outside mike liquor store on slauson and fairfax avenues in los angeles.the minor got into an argument with martin.moments later,the minor shot at martin.martin chased the minor and jessie by car and on foot until martin fell in the street.the minor and jessie fled,and the minor hid a handgun in some ivy.deputy sheriffs took both the minor and jessie in custody.

the psychologist reported that the minor is the youngest of five children.his mother has older children from a prior marriage.the minor also has two older sisters,ages and,from his mother current marriage.the father is a veterans administration counselor.the mother is a united states district court bankruptcy analyst.the parents report that the minor has a learning disability.the parents spend a lot of time with the minor.because of the minor height,the parents were leery of holding him back in school and put him in special education classes.the parents explained that the minor functions at a higher level than the special education children,but at a lower level than the other school children.he is shy and is frequently teased by the other children.he has a hard time making friends.his parents enrolled the minor in sports to increase his socialization skills,and the minor has had some success in that area through sports.
the parents reported to the psychologist that the minor was doing well to age.at age,a teacher was severely critical of his academic skills,and the minor believed her,and he suffered from the criticism.also,there was a dispute with a neighbor.the neighbor refused to pay the minor for yard work the minor performed.the minor took the debris he had picked up from the neighbor lawn and dumped it on the lawn.when the neighbor saw what the minor had done,the neighbor pulled the minor off his bicycle and choked him,which traumatized the minor.the incident with the neighbor left the minor feeling vulnerable and disillusioned about fairness.in another incident,this time of mistaken identity,the police arrested the minor.the parents reported this latter incident further affected the minor sense of fairness and vulnerability.
the psychologist reported that school records support the parents report of the minor history.the minor intellectual skills are average,but his academic skill levels are well below average.he seems discouraged about learning and is too interested in social interaction.he was not described as a behavior problem.the minor was not doing well at westchester high school.the parents decided to put him in a tutorial situation at los angeles city schools to improve his academic skills.the mother was concerned there were youngsters at city of angels who were bad influences and she did not want the minor attending regular sessions and being exposed to such youngsters.the parents plan was to reenroll the minor in regular session as soon as his academic skills improved.
the minor reports his parents are supportive.the minor is sensitive about his school achievement and insists he can complete his study programs without special tutoring.the psychologist observed that the minor has no career goals and his verbal skills and seem wanting.
the psychologist reported the minor explained the offense by telling her that martin was talking behind his back and calling the minor a bitch.the minor was aware bitch was a slang term in prison and the term indicated the minor was weak.the minor challenged martin,and martin punched the minor in the head unexpectedly.the minor said,it was so quick.when i shot he was coming toward me.a bus rolled past and he waited for the bus to pass.i could run from him because he would have told everyone i had run from him.the minor reported that he used a gun since he could not fight martin all by himself martin would have beaten him up.the minor explained that he found the gun and shot to scare martin.the minor claimed he shot in.the minor explained if he had waited for martin to approach him,martin would have bested him in the fight.
the psychologist explained that the minor was afraid,since martin was an adult,a larger youth and belligerent.the minor told the psychologist about his experience with the neighbor and said he did not want anyone to do that to him again.the psychologist explained the minor thinking was as follows because the minor was a fairly young boy and had been attacked by an adult neighbor,he felt significantly threatened and also it caused him to feel more watchful and mistrustful of adult men.because of the way the adults around him responded,he lost the sense that others would protect him and that there was some kind of justice.this caused him to feel like he needed to take things into his own hands.in this incident with martin,he did not believe that police would help him.he felt that it would be his word against my word and there was no evidence.he added,a nd calling the police does do too much good.the last time i got assaulted,the police said that if i was their kid they would have whooped my ass.most of the police where i live always think i doing something wrong.
the minor psychological tests showed that he was normal.the minor felt vulnerable.the minor did not share features with other young people who have chronic delinquent behavior.the minor did not score on the tests as an aggressive youngster with potential.his testing indicated he has difficulty reaching practical solutions when confronted with a problem.the psychologist concluded that the minor was like other children who have poor social skills and poor judgment.his ability to solve problems is below normal.the minor is not angry or aggressive.he has parental support.his parents have more skills than the average parent in assisting the minor.the high degree of support makes home supervision a good risk.this is balanced by the likelihood camp would expose him to seriously delinquent youths.the minor might again feel vulnerable with the tougher youngsters in camp.the offense is serious,but the error in can be remedied with home intervention.
the psychologist concluded that the minor has been impacted by his stay in juvenile hall and sees his misconduct as a mistake.the minor has the kind of personal problems that can be addressed with home supervision.his educational needs are the same as other children in need of special education.the minor might benefit from placement,since class size is smaller.this latter option is probably better for the minor than independent study.there are no psychological problems,but a brief,focused program of therapy could address problem solving when the minor feels threatened.perhaps this could be combined with a volunteer program with the police department so he will see the police as friends rather than as adversaries.
