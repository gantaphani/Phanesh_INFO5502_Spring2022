elizabeth appeals a juvenile court order denying her petition to vacate the finding that her children stepmother was their presumed mother under family code section,subdivision d.we reverse.
introduction 
elizabeth is the natural mother of and.at each child birth,she and the children father,derrick,executed a voluntary declaration of paternity.elizabeth cared for the children until,when derrick was granted sole legal and physical custody.she stopped visiting and contacting the children after may.derrick wife,crystal,raised the children and held them out as her own.
in the san diego county health and human services agency agency initiated dependency proceedings on behalf of the children.elizabeth was not present at the jurisdictional hearing.the court granted crystal request for status as the children presumed mother under section,subdivision d.a short time later,elizabeth appeared in the dependency proceedings and petitioned the court to vacate its finding that crystal was the children presumed mother.the court denied elizabeth petition.
we conclude the juvenile court erred when it denied elizabeth petition to vacate its finding that crystal was the children presumed mother.elizabeth status as the children natural mother was established by proof of her having given birth to them,subd.a.the rebuttable presumptions of paternity described in section apply to determine the identity of a child natural mother only in very limited circumstances,none of which are present here.except in rare cases,a maternity claim against the natural mother of the child is not an appropriate action under section,subdivision a.when a natural mother has first assumed and later appears to have abandoned her parental rights and responsibilities to her child,as here,the appropriate mechanism for a stepparent to gain parental rights is through a stepparent adoption proceeding.accordingly,we reverse.
factual and procedural background 
derrick and elizabeth are the unmarried parents of,born september,and,born february together,the children.derrick and elizabeth have histories of homelessness,crime,substance abuse,domestic violence and child welfare referrals.elizabeth history is particularly troubled.
derrick married crystal in.at that time,he and elizabeth had joint legal and physical custody of the children.in march,derrick gained sole legal and physical custody of the children.elizabeth last saw the children in may and had no contact with them after that date.
in april agency detained the children in protective custody after derrick used methamphetamine,suffered hallucinations and hurt when he tried to carry her out of the house.crystal hit derrick to prevent him from leaving with welf,subds.a,b,j.
crystal asked the juvenile court to find she was the children presumed mother because she raised the children,met their medical,educational and needs,and held them out as her own.the children viewed crystal as their mother and called her mom.
at the may jurisdictional and dispositional hearing,the social worker said she tried to contact elizabeth,who lived in los angeles county,by mail and telephone,but did not receive any response.elizabeth attorney told the court she did not know whether elizabeth intended to appear in the proceedings and object to crystal request.the court,without objection,amended the petition to add crystal as the children presumed mother.the court declared the children dependents of the juvenile court,removed them from derrick and crystal custody and ordered a plan of family reunification services.the court relieved elizabeth counsel.
in june elizabeth telephoned the social worker to request family reunification services and visitation with and.at a special hearing in august,the court appointed counsel for her.in september elizabeth filed a petition for modification under welfare and institutions code section asking the court to vacate its finding that crystal was the children presumed mother.
a hearing on elizabeth welfare and institutions code section petition was held on september and.the juvenile court reviewed the family court file and found that derrick and elizabeth voluntary declarations of paternity conferred a conclusive presumption of parentage to derrick,but not to elizabeth.the court noted there was no case law holding that the statutory mechanisms to determine and establish paternity applied to maternity.it further found that elizabeth had qualified as the children presumed mother in their early years however,the presumption of maternity was rebutted by her subsequent lack of contact with the children and crystal maternal role in their lives.the court said the children would gain the greatest stability if they were reunified with derrick and crystal as their presumed parents,and elizabeth were involved in their lives as their biological mother.the court denied elizabeth petition to vacate its finding that crystal was the children presumed mother.it amended the welfare and institutions code section petitions to add elizabeth as the children biological mother and granted her request for family reunification services,including visitation services.
discussion 
athe statutory framework 
california enacted the uniform parentage act in stats,ch.at the time it was enacted,the primary purpose of the upa was to provide substantive legal equality for all children regardless of the marital status of their parents.upa prefatory note.the remainder of the upa is largely concerned with identifying the person against whom those rights may be asserted.ibid.
the upa provides that the parent and child relationship between a child and the natural mother may be established by proof of her having given birth to the child or under its provisions.upa,subd.a.with respect to identifying the father of a child,the upa describes a set of presumptions that,on appropriate proof,indicate a particular man is the probable father of a child.upa.a presumption arising under section is a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of proof and may be rebutted in an appropriate action only by clear and convincing evidence.upa,b,subd.a.
in the event of a rare case in which there may be uncertainty about the identity of the mother,the upa permits a declaratory action on the question of maternity.upa,prefatory note.to avoid adding a layer of complexity to the statute,the upa was drafted in terms of determining paternity.upa,comment.the upa provides that insofar as practicable,its provisions concerning the father and child relationship apply to determine the existence or nonexistence of a mother and child relationship rule.upa.the drafters believed that the lack of applicability of certain provisions of the upa to the mother and child relationship was obvious and actions to determine the mother identity would be rare.upa,comment.
in california,the uniform parentage act is only one part of a statutory scheme concerning the parent and child relationship and is set forth in part of division of the family code.et the act establishes the framework for judicial determinations of parentage,and governs paternity and custody disputes,private adoptions and dependency proceedings.in re th,in re th.parts and of division are also relevant to our analysis.part provides mechanisms to establish conclusive presumptions of paternity through marriage et seq.and voluntary paternity declarations et,and sets forth procedures to validate paternity through genetic testing,when contested et.part provides the statutory framework to declare a child free from parental custody and control as the first step toward a private adoption by the child stepparent or prospective adoptive parents.et.
under part,the statutory framework creates a conclusive presumption of paternity under certain conditions for a man who is married to the natural mother of the or if unmarried,executes a voluntary declaration of.et,et there are statutory mechanisms to set aside a conclusive presumption of paternity created through marriage or a voluntary declaration of paternity.these provisions are not part of the act itself.
when there is a judicial determination of parentage,the act provides the parent and child relationship may be established as follows a between a child and the natural mother,it may be established by proof of her having given birth to the child,or under this part.b between a child and the natural father,it may be established under this part.c between a child and an adoptive parent,it may be established by proof of adoption.
section creates a number of rebuttable presumptions of paternity a presumption of paternity arising under section is rebutted by a judgment establishing paternity of the child by another man,subd.c.when there are competing presumptions of paternity or,under a reading of the act,maternity,section governs the trial court determination of parentage.
at issue here is the scope of section,subdivision b to maternity claims.prior to,section,subdivision b,read if two or more presumptions arise under section which conflict with each other,the presumption on which the facts is founded on the weightier considerations of policy and logic controls.thus,only conflicting presumptions arising under section were subject to judicial resolution.amy th,abrogated by stats,ch,holding that section,subdivision b did not apply where a claim of parentage under section by a natural father wife,who was raising the child,conflicted with a maternity claim by the child natural mother under,subdivision a.
effective,the legislature amended section,subdivision b to read if two or more presumptions arise under section or that conflict with each other,or if a presumption under section conflicts with a claim under section,the presumption which on the facts is founded on the weightier considerations of policy and logic controls.italics added.thus,on its face,section,subdivision b now applies to a claim of maternity arising under section,subdivision a.
the parties contentions 
elizabeth and argue the legislature modification of section,subdivision b stripped women in california of their historical means of achieving a conclusive presumption of maternity by having given birth to the child,while allowing men to retain their ability to achieve a conclusive presumption of paternity through marriage,by executing voluntary paternity declarations and by obtaining judgments of paternity.they contend that as a matter of equal protection,the paternity provisions governing voluntary declarations under section et should apply to women as well as to men,and therefore the voluntary paternity declarations that elizabeth and derrick executed at the time of each child birth should confer a conclusive presumption of parentage to her,as well as to derrick.
elizabeth and agency further argue crystal can not achieve a presumption of maternity under section,subdivision d because she is not included in the class of women entitled to that presumption,which they contend is limited to the mother in a relationship.in addition,they argue the juvenile court erred because its findings left the children with three legal parents,contravening state law.finally,elizabeth contends that if crystal was entitled to a presumption of maternity under section,subdivision d,the juvenile court did not properly resolve the competing claims on the presumption founded on the weightier considerations of policy and logic,subd.b.
crystal,joined by the children,claims elizabeth presumptive status as the children natural mother was rebuttable under the plain terms of section,subdivision b,and the juvenile court properly found that elizabeth maternity status as the children biological mother was rebutted by crystal weightier claim to parentage under section,subdivision d.crystal contends the paternity provisions under section et do not apply to the mother and child relationship.she argues the biological mother is recognized as a parent by having given birth to the child,but an unmarried biological father must take affirmative steps to assert his parentage.crystal points out that the different statutory presumptions governing paternity and maternity,and the statutory mechanisms necessary to establish paternity,do not violate principles of equal protection.she asserts the juvenile court finding left the children with only two parents with legal parental rights and responsibilities,not three.finally,crystal contends elizabeth did not make the requisite showing that a modification of the prior order was in the children best interests under welfare and institutions code section.
standard of review and principles of statutory interpretation

in construing the meaning and significance of these revisions,we look to the words of the statutes to determine legislative intent and to fulfill the purpose of the law.citations.the language is construed in the context of the statute as a whole and the overall statutory scheme,and courts give significance to every word,phrase,sentence and part of an act in pursuing the legislative purpose.in re adrianna th,adrianna.a reviewing court is to avoid construing a statute in a manner that would render parts of the statute surplusage.elsner uveges cal th.a statute is read with reference to the entire scheme of law of which it is part.state farm mutual automobile ins.garamendi cal th,state farm.
traditionally,except in rare cases,the identification of the woman who has given birth to a child as that child natural mother,with all attendant parental rights and responsibilities,has not been subject to dispute.tuan anh nguygen,nguyen proof of motherhood is inherent in birth itself.identifying a child father is not as obvious.id.at it is not always certain that a father will know that a child was conceived,nor is it always clear that even the mother will be sure of the father identity.fathers and mothers are not similarly situated with regard to the proof of biological parenthood.id.at.the imposition of a different set of rules for making that legal determination with respect to fathers and mothers is neither surprising nor troublesome from a constitutional perspective.ibid.the differential treatment is inherent in a sensible statutory scheme,given the unique relationship of the mother to the event of birth.id.at.
we do not believe the legislature intended to create a statutory scheme that would permit maternity actions to be brought in california against any woman who has given birth to a child.such a reading of section,subdivision b would beget nothing but confusion.the better view is that a rebuttable presumption of maternity arises only in a limited class of cases,which to date have included surrogacy,relinquishment of a child for adoption by the natural mother,abandonment at birth,where there is no competing maternity claim or where a parent in a relationship seeks to establish his or her parentage against a biological parent of a child.in all other cases,an action raising a rebuttable presumption of maternity against a woman who has given birth to a child and intends to raise the child as her own is not appropriate,subd.a,subd.a nguygen,supra,at johnson calvert cal th,johnson.this view is supported by legislative history,the terms of the statute as a whole,case law and the entire scheme of law of which section is part.state farm,supra,cal th at.
