under the federal indian child welfare act of icwa et and the related california statutes governing custody proceedings involving indian children welf,et when a juvenile court in dependency proceedings knows or has reason to know that an indian child is involved,the party seeking the foster care placement of,or termination of parental rights to,that child must notify the child tribe of the pending proceedings and of the tribe right of intervention.a,subd.a.that notice must include,among other things,the names including maiden,married,and former names or aliases,birthdates,places of birth and death,tribal enrollment numbers,and any other identifying information,to the extent it is known,of the indian child biological parents,grandparents,and.a,d,subd.a.
the issue presented in this case is whether there is a duty under the icwa to send updated notices to the relevant tribes when additional information regarding the child ancestors such as previously omitted birthdates,aliases,alternate spellings is obtained after the original icwa notices were sent.we conclude there is such a duty.because the los angeles county department of children and family services the department in this case failed to send updated notices after it obtained additional information,we reverse the order terminating the parental rights of appellant mother with regard to her daughter,for the limited purpose of compliance with the icwa.
background
