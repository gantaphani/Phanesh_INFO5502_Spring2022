this appeal concerns the lawfulness of strip searches performed upon young girls in juvenile detention centers.the parents of two female children appeal from the september,judgment of the district court for the district of connecticut peter dorsey,district judge,ruling that,even though connecticut blanket strip search policy for all those admitted to juvenile detention centers jdcs violates the fourth amendment,the particular strip searches of their daughters,identified as and,were lawful.the appellants contend that the searches were unlawful for lack of a reasonable basis to believe either that the juveniles had done anything that would be a crime if committed by an adult or had possessed weapons or other contraband.the appellants also seek review of the district court denial of their motion for class certification.
we conclude that the searches conducted upon each initial entry into the custody of the state juvenile authorities were lawful,but that repetitive searches,conducted while the girls remained in custody,violated the fourth amendment in the absence of reasonable suspicion that contraband was possessed.we therefore vacate the judgment and remand to determine what relief,if any,should be awarded.
background 
connecticut judicial branch,through its court support services division cssd,operates three juvenile detention centers located in bridgeport,hartford,and new haven.connecticut also confines juveniles in other institutions with which it has contracts the girls detention center gdc,operated by defendant csi connecticut,and juvenile forensic services jfs,a center operated by defendant juvenile forensic services,llp.all of these facilities,collectively referred to as jdcs,admit thousands of juveniles annually.in connecticut,a juvenile is either a child,defined as any person under sixteen years of age,or a youth,defined as any person sixteen or seventeen years of age,id.
jdcs house juveniles detained for a wide variety of reasons,but the record is not entirely clear as to precisely what circumstances may result in confinement in jdcs.from the testimony of judge christine keller,chief administrative judge for juvenile matters,it appears that the principal basis for detention is to await trial following arrest for a serious juvenile offense.upon arrest for a juvenile offense that is not serious,detention could also occur if the parents refuse to take the child back into their home and the state department of children and families can not promptly find a bed in a suitable facility.
another frequent basis for detention arises from a designation known as families with service needs.families with service needs means a family that includes a child who has acted in one of five ways run away from home without just cause,become beyond the control of parents,engaged in indecent or immoral conduct,been a truant or overtly defied school rules,or if thirteen years of age or older,has engaged in sexual intercourse with a person of similar age id.judge keller explained that detention can result upon a judge finding that one of these five circumstances exists and that there is probable cause to believe that a delinquent act has been committed.of these five categories,the most common are runaways and truants.
the state policy.operational policy of connecticut judicial branch division of juvenile detention services the policy provides for various searches,including frisk searches,general facility searches,area searches,perimeter searches,vehicle searches,and,pertinent to this appeal,strip searches.the policy specifies that a strip search shall be conducted upon each detainee initial intake at a jdc and upon each detainee readmission,or after any detainee has left the supervision of detention center or judicial branch staff,a furlough or inpatient hospital admission,or an alternate detention program resident returning to the detention center to attend a court hearing.the policy also authorizes strip searches upon reasonable belief that a detainee may be carrying dangerous contraband.the policy applies at the three jdcs and the jdcs operated under state contract.
description of strip search.
the policy,as amended september,prescribes the following steps for a staff member conducting a strip search to follow 
inform the detainee of the strip search and the purpose of the search.
check the detainee ears,nose and mouth,including under the tongue.
have the detainee remove and step away from clothing and shoes and put on a robe.
have the detainee run own hands through hair.
check the bottom of detainee feet.
have the detainee raise one arm of the robe to and examine top and bottom of arm and hand with fingers spread.repeat the procedure with second arm and hand.
have the detainee raise the bottom of the robe to below the crotch to expose and inspect the front of the legs and feet.
have the detainee turn degrees and drop the robe off the shoulders in order to inspect the upper back and shoulders.
have the detainee raise the bottom of the robe to above the waist in order to inspect the buttocks and legs.
have the detainee turn degrees facing staff,and drop the robe off the shoulders and open the front of the robe,exposing the entire front of the body,shoulders,and upper arms.
instruct the detainee to shower and dress immediately in a clean uniform.
search all clothing and personal items,and label and store them appropriately.
prior to the september,revision,the policy permitted a strip search to include a visual inspection of vaginal and anal body cavities,but the revision now specifies that u nder no circumstances will visual,manual,or instrument inspection of the vaginal or anal body cavities be conducted.
strip searches of has a history of mental illness,suicide attempts,sexual activity with older men,drug and alcohol abuse,and.in july,then years old,was adjudicated a member of a family with service needs by the superior court as a result of her repeated failures to obey court orders requiring her to stay at home or at institutions in which she was placed.
testified,without contradiction,to having been strip searched eight times.the first occurred in july after wallingford police arrested her for running away from home in violation of a court order and brought her to the new haven juvenile detention center nhjdc.the strip search was conducted by a female staff member upon admission to nhjdc.was then presented before a superior court judge,who ordered her detained at the girls detention center gdc pending future placement.after her return from state court,she was transported from nhjdc to gdc in handcuffs and leg shackles.the second strip search occurred upon her admission to gdc.the third strip search occurred upon her return to gdc after being transported,in handcuffs and shackles,to court.was later released to her parents under a court order not to run away from home.
four more strip searches occurred in the fall of.after had violated the court order,her parents called the police,who took her into custody and brought her to nhjdc.upon her admission,a staff member performed a strip search.this was her fourth strip search.she was then presented in court,and ordered detained at jfs to which she was transported in handcuffs and shackles.the fifth strip search occurred upon her admission to jfs.the sixth and seventh strip searches were performed during detention at jfs when institutional searches were conducted due to concern over a missing pencil.was later released to her parents.
the eighth strip search occurred in january.after ran away from home again,the state court ordered her placed in stonington institute,a hospital,to await placement.ran away,but eventually turned herself in to the wallingford police department.when the police delivered her to nhjdc,a staff member strip searched upon admission.
during the second and third searches,was instructed to squat and cough,as she explained,to check if there is anything that might fall out of your cavities.the record is unclear as to whether visual inspection of vaginal or anal body cavities occurred during these two searches,but this ambiguity need not be resolved because the policy currently in effect prohibits such inspections,and,as discussed below,we conclude that these two searches were unlawful for other reasons.no contraband was found in any of the eight strip searches.
strip searches of was strip searched twice.in october,then a year old girl with a history of persistent truancy,and possibly mental health issues,had been adjudicated a member of a family with service needs due to her truancy.when she violated court orders requiring her to attend the seventh grade,the superior court ordered her detained at nhjdc,where a staff member strip searched her upon admission.the next day,she was transferred to gdc in handcuffs and leg shackles.upon admission,a gdc staff member performed second strip search.after one week,was released to her mother.
visual inspection of vaginal or anal body cavities was not performed during either of the two strip searches.no contraband was found in either search.
the lawsuit.and parents brought a suit under for damages and injunctive relief against the state of connecticut as well as various directors and supervisors of cssd,juvenile detention services,nhjdc,department of children and families of the state of connecticut csi connecticut,and juvenile forensic services,llp,individually and in their official capacities.the suit challenged the jdcs policy of strip searching all admittees,regardless of the cause for admission,as violative of and fourth amendment protection from unreasonable searches they sought to bring a damages suit on behalf of a class of juveniles held as members of families with service needs,arrested for noncriminal offenses,or charged with minor offenses in connecticut,all of whom were strip searched in the named juvenile detention facilities pursuant to the defendants policy.
district court ruling.after denying class certification,judge dorsey stated that the strip search policy,applicable to all confined children in jdcs,violated the fourth amendment but nevertheless ruled that the strip searches of and were reasonable.he concluded that the history of both girls suggest ed prospective behavior which would predispose them to bringing various contraband into a jdc.he found to be rebellious,defiant of authority,suicidal,belligerent,promiscuous,a drug user and dealer and mentally unstable.acknowledging that truancy was a quieter rejection of authority,he nonetheless found that her bouts of depression and expression of regret at having been born created a risk of that rendered the strip searches reasonable.the complaint was ordered dismissed.
discussion 
the fourth amendment prohibits unreasonable searches,a somewhat amorphous standard whose meaning varies with the context in which a search occurs and the circumstances of the search.in the enforcement of criminal law,a search generally requires the prior issuance of a warrant,supported by probable cause to believe that identified items will be found.see skinner railway labor executives ass n,d.in some circumstances a warrant is not required,but some quantum of individualized suspicion must be shown.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.less intrusive frisks are permitted upon articulable suspicion concerning the person to be stopped and frisked.see terry ohio,d.
outside the law enforcement context,in the context of safety and administrative regulations,a search unsupported by probable cause may be reasonable when special needs,beyond the normal need for law enforcement,make the warrant and requirement impracticable.board of education earls,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted i n certain limited circumstances,the government need to discover latent or hidden conditions,or to prevent their development,is sufficiently compelling to justify the intrusion on privacy entailed by conducting such searches without any measure of individualized suspicion.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.however,the special needs standard does not validate searches simply because a special need exists.instead,what is required is a balancing of the intrusion against the promotion of legitimate governmental interests.id.at.this is simply an application of the overarching principle that t he test of reasonableness under the fourth amendment requires a balancing of the need for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the search entails.bell wolfish,d.
these principles have been applied to permit reasonable searches,without warrants,in hospitals,see ortega,d schools,see new jersey,d government agencies,see national treasury employees union von raab,d and highly regulated industries,see skinner,at.pertinent to the pending case are decisions applying the special needs test to uphold suspicionless urinalysis of middle and high school students participating in extracurricular activities,earls,at,and students participating in school athletics,see vernonia school district acton,d.
especially pertinent to the pending case,the special needs standard applies to searches in penal institutions,see roe marcotte,cir,although the supreme court first use of the standard in this context occurred before the phrase special needs had been coined,see wolfish,at.in wolfish,the supreme court acknowledged that when a person has been convicted and lawfully confined,constitutional protections do not cease,see wolfish,at,but l awful incarceration brings about the necessary withdrawal or limitation of many privileges and rights,id.at.quoting price johnston.subsequently,the court formulated a variation of the special needs standard applicable to adjudication of constitutional claims of those lawfully confined w hen a prison regulation impinges on inmates constitutional rights,the regulation is valid if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.turner safley,d see overton bazzetta,d estate of shabazz,d.
strip searches performed on those lawfully confined have provoked considerable litigation.in wolfish,the supreme court upheld a strip search,including visual inspection of body cavities,of sentenced prisoners and pretrial detainees,after every contact visit with a person from outside the institution at.this court has upheld routine random strip searches,including inspections,performed on prison inmates.see covino patrissi,cir see also hurley ward,cir reversing portion of injunction prohibiting strip searches of prison inmates.however,in several decisions,we have ruled that strip searches may not be performed upon adults confined after arrest for misdemeanors,in the absence of reasonable suspicion concerning possession of contraband.see shain ellison,cir wachtler county of herkimer,cir walsh franco,cir weber dell,cir.but see shain,at cabranes,dissenting contending that weber had been superseded by the supreme court decision in turner and that this consequence should have led to upholding the strip search policies in shain,wachtler,and walsh.as far as we can tell,all the circuits to have considered the issue have reached the same conclusion with respect to strip searches of adults confined for minor offenses.see miller kennebec county,cir failure to pay fine logan shealy,cir drunk driving kelly foti,cir motor vehicle violations masters crouch,cir failure to appear for motor vehicle violation mary beth city of chicago,cir various misdemeanors jones edwards,cir refusal to sign complaint for leash law violation giles ackerman,cir motor vehicle violations chapman nichols,cir same.
strip searches of children pose the reasonableness inquiry in a context where both the interests supporting and opposing such searches appear to be greater than with searches of adults confined for minor offenses.where the state is exercising some legitimate custodial authority over children,its responsibility to act in the place of parents in loco parentis obliges it to take special care to protect those in its charge,and that protection must be concerned with dangers from others and harm.children are assumed to be subject to the control of their parents,and if parental control falters,the state must play its part as parens patriae in this respect,the juvenile liberty interest may,in appropriate circumstances,be subordinated to the state parens patriae interest in preserving and promoting the welfare of the child.schall martin,d quoting santosky kramer,d upholding pretrial detention.at the same time,the adverse psychological effect of a strip search is likely to be more severe upon a child than an adult,especially a child who has been the victim of sexual abuse 
in the pending case,neither side has called to our attention an appellate ruling on the reasonableness of strip searches of juveniles in lawful state custody,in the absence of individualized suspicion of possession of contraband.the seventh circuit has ruled unreasonable school officials strip search of a year old female student to find narcotics,in the absence of reasonable cause to believe she possessed any narcotics.see doe renfrow,cir.unlike and,the student searched in doe was not confined in a detention facility.the eleventh circuit has upheld strip searches of incarcerated juveniles,but only upon a showing of reasonable suspicion of possession of contraband.see justice city of peachtree city,cir.a district court has ruled unconstitutional strip searches of detained juvenile aliens conducted by the immigration and naturalization service.see flores meese.
against this background of pertinent but not precisely governing case law,we consider the claims in the pending case.connecticut acknowledges that its strip search policy is not related to the investigation of criminal acts,br.for appellees at,and contends that the individualized suspicion requirement associated with criminal law enforcement is therefore not applicable.instead,the state contends that the policy comports with the special needs test of earls and,alternatively,is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests so as to satisfy the test of turner.
in determining whether the strip searches of and violated the fourth amendment under the standards of either earls or turner,we first consider the nature of the intrusion upon the girls privacy.a strip search with inspection is the practice that instinctively has given the supreme court the most pause.wolfish,at.the seventh circuit has described strip searches as demeaning,dehumanizing,and terrifying.mary beth,at internal quotation marks omitted.the tenth circuit has called them terrifying.chapman,at.the eighth circuit has called them humiliating.hunter auger,cir.and since youth is a condition of life when a person may be most susceptible to psychological damage,eddings oklahoma,d,c hildren are especially susceptible to possible traumas from strip searches,flores.at.
in assessing the interests served by the strip searches,we think the searches must be considered separately since the justifications are not the same for each search.the second,third,and fifth searches of and the second search of were conducted after the children transfer from one facility to another.upon their initial admission to a detention facility,they had been strip searched,and they remained in custody throughout the transfer process.for example,after being searched upon admission to nhjdc,was transferred to court,transferred back to nhjdc,and then transferred to gdc.there is no indication that she had any unsupervised opportunity to acquire contraband during these transfers.whatever the justification for strip searches upon initial admission to a first detention facility,we see no state interest sufficient to warrant repeated strip searches simply because of transfers to other facilities see hodges stanley,cir second search of administrative detainee appears to be unnecessary and unreasonable when detainee had been under continuous escort after initial search.arguably,it was more convenient for the personnel at gdc to strip search upon her admission there,rather than determine whether she had been strip searched upon her prior admission to nhjdc and had remained in custody throughout the transfer process.mere convenience,however,can not be a sufficient interest to justify such a serious impairment of privacy.we recognize that unavoidable circumstances might arise,even during a period of continuous custody,that create opportunities for an inmate to acquire contraband,in which event a strip search might well be reasonable.no such circumstances were shown in this case.
of course,a prior strip search and continuous custody thereafter can not guarantee protection from subsequent access to contraband but the state opportunity to maintain surveillance during custody after an initial strip search,in addition to the availability of other search techniques,renders unreasonable a subsequent strip search in the absence of reasonable suspicion of possession of contraband.
the sixth and seventh strip searches of occurred at jfs,prompted by the disappearance of a pencil on two separate occasions.pencils had been handed out to a group of ten to twenty girls in a room,and one had not been returned.since had already been strip searched upon her initial admission to jfs,a repeated search to see if had taken the missing pencil on either occasion required at least some reasonable suspicion pointing to her as the culprit.we have ruled that strip searches of those arrested for misdemeanors require reasonable suspicion of possession of contraband.see shain,at.although we recognize the possibilities that a pencil could be used as a weapon and could be concealed in a,the combination of these possibilities alone is too unlikely to justify the serious intrusion of a strip search,in the absence of reasonable suspicion concerning possession of the missing item.such reasonable suspicion might arise if less intrusive searches such as of the girls in the room where the pencil disappeared failed to locate it,raising suspicion that one of the girls in that room had the pencil concealed 
with respect to the searches performed upon the girls initial admission to state custody,the issue is closer.to justify the searches under the turner standard would extend that standard beyond the context in which it was established a prison.at.and were confined in juvenile detention facilities.they had not been convicted of any crime,and were not confined awaiting trial on any criminal charges.on the other hand,contraband such as a knife or drugs can pose a hazard to the security of an institution and the safety of inmates whether the institution houses adults convicted of crimes or juveniles in detention centers.yet before we can uphold a search as reasonably related to penological interests,there must be some justification for placing the person searched into the type of institution where the turner standard applies.perhaps the turner standard applies to a state facility confining juveniles who have been convicted of conduct that would be a crime if committed by an adult,and,perhaps it even applies to juveniles awaiting trial for such conduct.this would be so if penological interests include the interests of a state in confining juveniles convicted of,or awaiting trial for,such conduct.if that is so,there would be a substantial argument that a strip search of juveniles upon their initial admission to such a facility would satisfy the turner standard of being reasonably related to valid penological interests.
but it is far from clear that the turner standard applies to juveniles confined for running away from home or failing to attend school,even where such conduct occurs in violation of a court order.whatever a state interests in confining such juveniles in order to discharge its substitute parent responsibilities,we doubt that such confinement serves the sort of penological interests the supreme court had in mind in fashioning a standard applicable to adult prisons.no doubt a state has a legitimate interest in confining such juveniles in some circumstances,but it does not follow that by placing them in an institution where the state might be entitled,under turner,to conduct strip searches of those convicted of crimes,a state may invoke turner to justify strip searches of runaways and truants.
moreover,there is some basis for doubting that the turner standard applies to a claim of constitutional protection from state action such as a strip search.turner concerned prisoners assertion of affirmative rights to correspond with other prisoners and to marry.at.the cases on which it relied,see id.at,concerned prisoners assertion of affirmative rights to mail uncensored letters,procunier martinez,d to media interviews,pell procunier,d to organize a union,jones north carolina prisoners union,d and to order books,wolfish,at.significantly,one of the factors the supreme court identified as pertinent to the reasonableness of a challenged prison regulation was the availability of ready alternatives for the prisoners to exercise their rights.turner,at.i f an inmate claimant can point to an alternative that fully accommodates the prisoner rights at de minimis cost to valid penological interests,a court may consider that as evidence that the regulation does not satisfy the reasonable relationship standard.id.at.the consideration of alternative ways for the prisoner to exercise affirmative rights was an understandable part of the overall reasonableness inquiry in turner and the cases it relied on,but has doubtful relevance to a prisoner claim to be free from a constitutionally unreasonable search.
was initially confined for violating a court order not to run away from home,and was initially confined for violating a court order to attend school.the justification for impairing their constitutional rights for such conduct under the turner rationale would seem to be less substantial even than that held insufficient for adults confined after arraignment on misdemeanor charges,see shain,at.although such adults have not been convicted,there was at least probable cause to believe that they had committed crimes.for all of these reasons,we doubt that the strip searches of and can be upheld under the turner rationale.
for several reasons,the state makes a more substantial contention in relying on the special needs standard of earls.first,although the age of the children renders them especially vulnerable to the distressing effects of a strip search,it also provides the state with an enhanced responsibility to take reasonable action to protect them from hazards resulting from the presence of contraband where the children are confined.the state has temporarily become the de facto guardian of children lawfully removed from their home,and when the government acts as guardian the relevant question is whether the search is one that a reasonable guardian might undertake,vernonia,at.the state has a more pervasive responsibility for children in detention centers hours a day than for the children in vernonia and earls who were under state authority for the few hours of the school day.second,a strip search serves the protective function of locating and removing concealed items that could be used for or even suicide approximately one half of the girls admitted to jdcs showed signs of.a child psychologist testified that children often in part because of their inability to articulate their feelings.third,a strip search will often disclose evidence of abuse that occurred in the home,and awareness of such abuse can assist juvenile authorities in structuring an appropriate plan of care.
the factor raises two issues that require further consideration.the first is whether the factor may be considered at all in view of the testimony of an assistant supervisor at nhjdc that finding evidence of abuse is not one of the purposes of performing strip searches in considering the subjective purpose for which a search is undertaken,the supreme court has distinguished between a search of a particular individual and searches undertaken pursuant to a general scheme without individualized suspicion.indianapolis edmond,d.a law enforcement officer subjective purpose is irrelevant to the lawfulness of the search of a particular individual,id.at.whren united states,d,but is relevant to the validity of a general search policy,such as one implemented incident to a roadblock,edmond,at.as to the latter,a primary purpose to advance the general interest in crime control,id.at.internal quotation marks omitted,will not suffice,id.at.thus,searches incident to a road block set up for the primary purpose of apprehending drug law violators were held unreasonable,see id.at,while a primary public safety purpose of removing drunk drivers from the highways justified road blocks for sobriety checks,see michigan department of state police sitz,d.
in the pending case,the evidence establishes the state primary enforcement purposes to protect the children from harm inflicted by themselves or other inmates,and to protect the safety of the institution.with these valid purposes established,we think the additional purpose of detecting abuse may be weighed in the reasonableness assessment,even if it was not subjectively entertained by state officials.whether or not this justification alone would support a strip search,it permissibly adds to the combination of special needs that confront the state at a child initial admission to a detention facility.discovery of abuse is not precluded from contributing to the reasonableness of searches undertaken primarily to protect the safety of the person searched and the institution.
the factor also encounters the ruling we have made that protects parents rights to control the care and custody of their children by assuring that intrusive examinations of their children for evidence of abuse will not be undertaken without parental consent or judicial authorization.see tenenbaum williams,cir van emrik chemung county department of social services,cir.however,those rulings concerned intrusions that serve primarily an investigative function.id.at.the purpose was not to provide medical treatment to the child,but to provide investigative assistance to the caseworker.id.moreover,the intrusions at issue were,id.at,and medical examinations,tenenbaum,at.these rulings do not necessarily bar visual examinations for evidence of abuse undertaken by custodians responsible for developing and implementing an appropriate plan of care and treatment.
the facts of this case do not yield an obvious answer to the question whether it was constitutionally reasonable to perform strip searches upon and upon their initial admission to detention facilities.assessing all of the circumstances the risks to the psychological health of the children from performing the searches and the risks to their and to institutional safety from not performing the searches,we conclude that the strip searches upon initial admission do not violate fourth amendment standards.however,since we do not reach the same conclusion with respect to repetitive searches undertaken after the children had been searched and remained in custody,absent any reasonable basis to think that they had acquired and secreted contraband while in custody,we rule that the second,third,and fifth searches of and the second search of were unlawful.as to the sixth and seventh searches of concerning a missing pencil,we will permit the parties on remand to amplify the record so that the district court can make findings as to the existence of reasonable suspicion.
class action ruling.the denial of class action certification was well within the district court discretion,for reasons set forth in judge dorsey opinion.
conclusion 
the judgment dismissing the action is vacated,and the case is remanded for further proceedings with respect to the sixth and seventh searches of and for determination of what relief,if any,is warranted as a result of our ruling that the second,third,and fifth searches of and the second search of were unlawful.
i concur with the majority holding that the second,third,and fifth searches of and the second search of were unlawful.absent an individualized basis to believe that the plaintiffs had acquired contraband while in custody of the authorities,these searches violated fourth amendment standards of reasonableness.with respect to the sixth and seventh searches of,i concur with the majority decision to remand to the district court to make factual findings as to the existence of reasonable suspicion.i also agree that the denial of class certification was well within the district court discretion.
i dissent,however,from the court decision to uphold the first,fourth,and eighth strip searches of and the first strip search of.our caselaw consistently has recognized the severely intrusive nature of strip searches and has placed strict limits on their use.the concerns animating our prior rulings in this area should be only heightened when the privacy interests of emotionally troubled children are at stake.here,the government has failed to demonstrate that its special needs should overcome these concerns and allow for strip searches,in the absence of individualized suspicion,of adolescents who have never been charged with a crime.accordingly,i would find that,regardless of whether the suspicionless strip searches occurred upon entry or,they were unlawful.
i agree with the majority that the proper framework for analysis of the strip searches at issue is the special needs balancing test of board of education earls,d,rather than the turner standard for penal institutions,turner safley,d.the source of my disagreement with the majority lies in the application of the balancing test to the facts before us.in my view,the government has not demonstrated adequately that the highly invasive suspicionless strip searches bore a close and substantial relationship to the government special needs.united states lifshitz,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
as the majority observes,strip searches as compared to other kinds of searches instinctively give us the most pause.bell wolfish,d.we have called a strip search a highly intrusive invasion,rivera united states,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted,an extreme intrusion upon personal privacy,burns loranger,cir,and an offense to the dignity of the individual,id.we hardly have been alone in this assessment.the eleventh circuit has accepted as axiomatic that a strip search represents a serious intrusion upon personal rights.justice city of peachtree city,cir.the seventh circuit has referred to strip searches as demeaning,dehumanizing,undignified,humiliating,terrifying,unpleasant,embarrassing,repulsive,signifying degradation and submission.mary beth city of chicago,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.other courts have reached similar conclusions.see roe texas dep t of protective regulatory,cir roberts rhode island,cir chapman nichols,cir thompson city of los angeles,cir hunter auger,cir doe renfrow,cir per curiam flores meese,rev on other grounds,reno flores,d.
we should be especially wary of strip searches of children,since youth is a time and condition of life when a person may be most susceptible to influence and to psychological damage.eddings oklahoma,d see also flores.at children are especially susceptible to possible traumas from strip searches.when officials are dealing with children who may be victims of sexual abuse,the concerns are even greater.see ante,at.
the case before us presents facts that provoke all of our typical concerns about strip searches.the detention facility officers on numerous occasions ordered appellants troubled adolescent girls facing no criminal charges to remove all of their clothes and underwear.the officials inspected the girls naked bodies front and back,and had them lift their breasts and spread out folds of fat.the young girls described the process as embarrassing and humiliating.indeed,cried throughout one of her searches.during one of searches,two other detainees were present.the juvenile detention facilities perform similar searches on every girl who enters notwithstanding the fact that many of them indeed,most of them have been victims of abuse or neglect,and may be more vulnerable mentally and emotionally than other youths their age 
given the uniquely invasive and upsetting nature of strip searches,it is not surprising that with the exception of the prison setting,see covino patrissi,cir,we have never found that a strip search in the absence of any individualized suspicion was reasonable.even in the context of lawful detention and confinement,we have recognized constitutional limits on the state authority to conduct strip searches limits that the majority disregards in the present case.in weber dell,cir,we held that reasonable suspicion was required in order to strip search a defendant arrested and detained for misdemeanors.we reached this holding even assuming the correctness of a sheriff assertion that seventy percent of such arrestees possessed contraband.id.at finding that even if such a statistic were proven,it did not provide the particularized suspicion required by the constitution to justify a strip search.furthermore,in weber,we did not state that a strip search of a felony arrestee,in the absence of individualized suspicion,would be lawful rather,we suggested that,among other things,the nature of the offense for which the felony arrestee is detained furnishes the individualized suspicion required to justify the search.id.we have applied and affirmed weber restrictions on strip searches in numerous cases.see shain ellison,cir wachtler county of herkimer,cir walsh franco,cir.as the majority notes,all of the circuits considering the issue of strip searches of adults confined for minor offenses have reached the same conclusion.see ante,at.
in three other cases not discussed by the majority,we have likewise held that at least some individualized suspicion is necessary in order to justify a strip search,even where the government demonstrated a special need.see sec.law enforcement employees,dist.council carey,cir anker,cir per curiam united states asbury,cir.
anker involved a strip search of a student conducted by a teacher.our decision foreshadowed the advent of the special needs doctrine by recognizing,in the context of searches performed at schools,that school administrators are entitled to greater flexibility with regard to fourth amendment concerns because of the unique relationship teachers have to their students,both in administering discipline as part of their educational function,and in protecting the of all children in their care and custody.anker,at.nevertheless,we held that when a teacher conducts a highly intrusive invasion such as the strip search in this case,it is reasonable to require that probable cause be present.id.thus,even in a school setting where special needs permit some searches in the absence of probable cause,our caselaw only allows strip searches when there is probable cause.
in carey,at,the plaintiffs subjected to strip searches were corrections officers searched pursuant to a policy authorizing random,suspicionless searches for the purpose of detecting and deterring contraband smuggling.although we acknowledged that the officers had a diminished expectation of privacy largely due to the nature of their work,id.at,and although we recognized the important governmental interest in maintaining prison security and preserving internal order and discipline,we nonetheless held that some individualized suspicion of possession of contraband was necessary to justify a strip search of the officers.id.at.
similarly,in asbury we held that strip searches conducted at national borders must be premised on some measure of individualized suspicion and that the suspicion should be substantial enough to make the search a reasonable exercise of authority.at.
although we recognized that the government asserted special needs justified a relaxation of the probable cause standard in each of these cases,we nonetheless held that at least some individualized suspicion was needed to conduct a strip search.
the only exception to this principle that we thus far have recognized is an exception for prison inmates,see covino,at,which the plaintiffs who have never faced any criminal charges indisputably are not.thus,to hold that the strip searches of the two girls in the instant appeal were reasonable is equivalent to saying that these girls are entitled to the same level of fourth amendment protection as prison inmates held on felony charges,and to decidedly less protection than people crossing the border,jail inmates detained on misdemeanor charges,prison corrections officers,or students in public school.
the majority opinion cites many cases upholding reasonable searches under the special needs doctrine,but none of these cases is remotely comparable to the case at hand,because with the exception of cases in the prison context none involved strip searches.see earls,at.upholding student drug tests vernonia sch.dist.acton,d same treasury employees union von raab,d upholding employee drug tests skinner ry.labor executives ass n,d same ortega,d plurality opinion establishing a reasonableness standard,instead of a probable cause standard,for searches of public employees personal papers new jersey,d upholding a search of a high school student purse.the majority suggests that one case,roe marcotte,cir,is e specially pertinent,ante at,but that case is not pertinent at all,as it involved blood tests of convicted adult sex offenders held in prison.see roe,at.the cases relied upon by the majority involve,at their most intrusive,suspicionless drug testing of students or employees.in all of these cases,however,the person subjected to the drug test had voluntarily undertaken the job or activity that required testing.see,earls,at.finding that students voluntarily engaged in extracurricular activities.more importantly,the drug tests never required anything as highly intrusive,rivera,at,as inspection by state officials of the plaintiff naked body.the majority does not rely on any case upholding strip searches in the absence of particularized suspicion,because,of course,no such case exists.
while the majority overstates the relevance of the cases,it downplays the significance of the most closely analogous case it cites,justice city of peachtree city,cir.in justice,the police detained two juveniles for loitering and truancy.at the police station,officers subjected one of them to a strip search.the eleventh circuit agreed with the defendants that a detention center,police station,or jail holding cell is a place fraught with serious security dangers.id.at quoting wolfish,at.however,because strip searches were such a serious intrusion upon personal rights,id.at,the court found that searches also had to be justified by the presence of individualized suspicion.id.at l aw enforcement officers may subject a juvenile who is lawfully in custody to a strip search based upon reasonable suspicion that the juvenile is concealing a weapon or contraband.the court explained we must determine whether the officers,based on the totality of the circumstances,had a particularized and objective basis for suspecting the particular person searched of criminal activity.id.at alterations in original citation and internal quotation marks omitted see also id.at considering six reasons reasonable individualized suspicion existed in that case.though the instant case occurred outside of the law enforcement context,i would nevertheless follow the eleventh circuit rationale and hold that reasonable suspicion must be present in order to strip search a juvenile who is not alleged to have committed a crime.
i turn next to the government concerns assertedly motivating the searches and the efficacy of the searches in meeting those concerns.the majority argues that the government special needs are even more compelling in the context of juvenile detention facilities than they are in cases involving public schools or correctional facilities.i agree.however,it is not enough for the government simply to assert a compelling special need.our special needs jurisprudence generally has also required that the search seek a minimum of intrusiveness coupled with maximal effectiveness so that the search bear s a close and substantial relationship to the government special needs.united states lifshitz,cir internal quotation marks omitted.this is not to say that the fourth amendment requires that only least intrusive means be used in order to effectuate the government interests,but a close and substantial relationship between the intrusiveness and the need must be demonstrated nevertheless.id.at,citation and internal quotation marks omitted.the government bears the burden of demonstrating this nexus between the search and the asserted special need.see bell manson,cir.
the government here has completely failed to demonstrate that the invasive strip searches bore a close and substantial relationship to any governmental need.this first becomes clear upon examining the event reports for the years through produced during discovery.the reports describe the occasions on which officers discovered contraband in the possession of the detainees.of the reports of contraband violations,describe contraband that either was discovered through a search that was less intrusive than a full strip search could have been discovered through a search that was less intrusive than a full strip search or could have been discovered through a policy that allowed strip searches only in cases of individualized suspicion.with regard to the remaining two reports,it is unclear whether a strip search was necessary for discovery of the contraband it is also unclear if individualized suspicion existed.thus,the detention centers own documentation of contraband discoveries provides absolutely no evidence that suspicionless strip searches were necessary,or even helpful,in any case.
other evidence in the record confirms the weakness of the government arguments.one supervisor testified that of the one hundred strip searches she personally conducted,not one yielded evidence of contraband.a director of one of the facilities testified that out of strip searches performed since that facility was built,only two strip searches revealed contraband that otherwise would not have been found.those two recovered items of contraband were a piece of jewelry attached to a child belly button and cocaine that was discovered in a child clothing.full nudity would not have been necessary to uncover these items 
the majority accepts the government argument that strip searches serve the special need of deterring children from smuggling contraband.i agree that,under certain circumstances,deterrence can be a legitimate special need that will justify some suspicionless searches.see von raab,at.wolfish,at.however,the deterrence rationale is not very compelling in this case,particularly when balanced against the degree of the invasion of privacy.while deterrence may be an important rationale for employees who know they will undergo drug tests,see von raab,at,or for prisoners returning from contact visits with outsiders,see wolfish,at,it has little applicability to a person who does not expect to be detained and subjected to a search.see hunt polk county,iowa,observing that even though a rationale for upholding strip searches in some cases is that prisoners awareness of the policy will deter them from attempting to smuggle contraband when their next opportunity arises,t he deterrence rationale has little applicability to a person arrested unexpectedly on the street see also john does boyd,finding that arrest and confinement are wholly unplanned events,so that the defendants strip search policy can hardly be expected to deter smuggling.in connecticut juvenile detention centers,it is common for children to be arrested unexpectedly and confined immediately.trial tr.at.in other cases the juveniles are brought first to their parents,who then must bring them to court.even in those cases,however,the child does not necessarily expect to be detained,as prosecutors do not seek to have the child detained in all cases id.at.the deterrence rationale might make some sense for searches,given that the detention and the searches are foreseeable by the detainee in those circumstances however,the majority concedes that strip searches are unlawful.in any case,even in the limited circumstances where the deterrence rationale could apply,the government has made no showing that a full strip search rather than other methods of searching is necessary to achieve the desired deterrent effect.
the evidence regarding the efficacy of strip searches in detecting child abuse is even more scant than the evidence of contraband discovered during strip searches.the record contains over reports of suspected abuse filled out by center employees.in each report,the employee is asked to describe
