danny,a minor,appeals from the order continuing wardship welf,entered following findings that he committed misdemeanor vandalism,subd.a count one,and possession of an aerosol container with intent to deface while on a public place,subd.e count two.he was ordered placed home on probation.
introduction 
we conclude that whether a person was on a public place within the meaning of penal code section,subdivision e,is determined by examining the totality of the facts and circumstances and,in the present case,there was sufficient evidence that danny violated that subdivision,including sufficient evidence that he was on such a public place.we also hold that there is no need to decide danny contention regarding penal code section,since that issue was relevant only to the calculation of a maximum theoretical period of confinement,and he was ordered placed home on probation.
factual summary 
people evidence.
viewed in accordance with the usual rules on appeal in re dennis cal d,the evidence established that at about on may,azusa police corporal randy phillips,in response to a radio call about someone painting graffiti,was driving a marked patrol vehicle in the area of the block of west foothill.he observed danny and another young man standing on the raised dirt area adjacent to railroad tracks and between two walls that paralleled the tracks.danny was holding a bicycle.no one else was present.there was no sidewalk in that area,and the area was not one in which phillips would have expected to see pedestrian traffic.
danny and his companion fled the scene,but were later apprehended by another officer,douglas ernst.phillips discovered a large amount of graffiti on the wall,some of which had just been sprayed.the graffiti which had just been sprayed consisted of black and yellow paint.several spray paint cans were in the area in which danny and the young man had been standing.one of the cans had fresh black paint along its outside edge.the freshly painted black graffiti included the words fuck school,and die.when phillips first observed danny,danny was about two feet from the vandalized wall,and about two feet from the black spray paint can.there were fingerprints on the back of the can.
after being detained,danny denied any wrongdoing and claimed that he and his companion were on the trestle because they were waiting for a friend.he did show up.officer ernst observed fresh black paint on danny hands.
following his arrest,danny admitted to officer ernst that he and his friend had picked up spray cans that had been left on the trestle and danny had spray painted words on the north and south sides of the trestle.danny spray painted the words die most,die,echo,and bp.echo was danny baldwin park gang moniker,but he no longer associated with that gang.danny said he wrote die most on behalf of his friend.
defense evidence.
in defense,danny testified his friend did all the spray painting,and that he was just standing there watching and sitting on my bike.he said that he had walked away when the police approached because he had always been told that being on the trestle was trespassing.he denied telling the police that he had spray painted the wall,but rather had told them that his friend did the spray painting.the paint on his hands came from painting model cars however,he said that he did not tell that to the police that day because he was nervous.he said that he was not a member of the baldwin park gang at the time of adjudication,and was not a member on may,
contentions 
danny contends the true finding on count must be reversed because there was no evidence danny possessed any aerosol paint container with intent to deface while on any public highway,street,alley,or way,or other public place,and if the true finding on count is valid,the sentence for that count should be stayed pursuant to penal code section.
discussion 
there was sufficient evidence that danny violated penal code section,subdivision e.
count two of the petition alleged in statutory language that danny violated penal code section,subdivision e following an adjudication,the court sustained counts one and two danny presents no sufficiency claim as to count one.as to count two,he concedes there was evidence he possessed an aerosol paint can,he was immediately adjacent to the trestle wall,and he was using the can to spray paint the wall.
danny disputes only that,as to count two,the requisite possession occurred while he was on any public place within the meaning of section,subdivision e.he urges,inter alia,that there was no evidence as to the ownership of the trestle,or of the ground immediately adjacent to the trestle wall.the only indication in the record as to the ownership of the location where the crimes allegedly occurred was the allegation of count of the petition that the trestle belonged to santa fe railway.neither the trestle wall itself nor the area around it was proven to be a public place.the issue is one of first impression.
the rules of statutory construction are familiar.as our supreme court stated in people jefferson cal th,d,the goal of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the legislature.citation.ordinarily,the words of the statute provide the most reliable indication of legislative intent.citation.when the statutory language is ambiguous,the court may examine the context in which the language appears,adopting the construction that best harmonizes the statute internally and with related statutes.citations.citation.when the language is susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation,we look to a variety of extrinsic aids,including the ostensible objects to be achieved,the evils to be remedied,the legislative history,public policy,and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part.citation.people jefferson,supra,cal th at,d.
section,subdivision e,provides,it is unlawful for any person under the age of years to possess an aerosol container of paint for the purpose of defacing property while on any public highway,street,alley,or way,or other public place,regardless of whether that person is or is not in any automobile,vehicle,or other conveyance.italics added.
the meaning of the phrase public place in section,subdivision e,is ambiguous.subdivision e,does not define the phrase,and the phrase,as a matter of common parlance,bears multiple meanings.the word public,as an adjective,includes such meanings as of or relating to a government,of,relating to,or being in the service of the community or nation,of or relating to people in general,general,popular,of or relating to business or community interests as opposed to private affairs,accessible to or shared by all members of the community,and exposed to general view open.capitalization omitted.different meanings might affect this case differently we must look outside the text of section,subdivision e,to determine the meaning of the phrase public place as used in that subdivision.
the legislature has used the phrase public place elsewhere in the penal code,sometimes with apparently conflicting meaning.thus,section,subdivision a,prohibits loitering in any public place with intent to commit prostitution.section,subdivision b,which defines the phrase public place as used in section,subdivision a,states,in relevant part,that public place means an area open to the public,italics added.on the other hand,section,prohibits,inter alia,obscene live conduct in any public place or in any place exposed to public view,or in any place open to the public or to a segment thereof italics added.thus,under section,subdivision b,a public place includes an area open to the public while,under section,a public place is expressly distinguished from a place open to the public.suffice it to say that the phrase public place is not used throughout the penal code with a clear and uniform legislative meaning from which we may deduce the meaning of that phrase at section,subdivision e.
the difficulty of determining the legislative meaning of the phrase public place at section,subdivision e,from the legislature uses of that phrase elsewhere in the penal code stems not only from apparently conflicting uses of that phrase by the legislature,but from the fact that,as shown below,the legislature has used the phrase public place in the penal code,usually without defining the phrase,and frequently distinguishing it from other terms with which,at least as a matter of common parlance,the phrase public place is arguably synonymous.
apart from section,there are sections of the penal code which use the phrase public place or public places.eleven of those sections simply use the phrase without defining it or otherwise shedding light on its meaning 
of the remaining sections which use the phrase public place,only define the phrase public place,and of those definitions is not very helpful nine other sections do not define the phrase,but merely distinguish it from arguably synonymous concepts from what is arguably a particular type of public place or from both two other sections make other distinctions 
the above further demonstrates that the phrase public place is not used in the penal code with a clear and uniform legislative meaning from which we may deduce the meaning of that phrase at section this fact encourages us to look to the legislative history of section,subdivision e,to determine the meaning of the phrase public place as it is used there 
assembly bill assem.bill was introduced in the assembly in march.assem.bill reg.sess.as introduced march,assem.final hist.reg.sess.in pertinent part,the bill,as introduced,would have added provisions to the business and professions code requiring retailers who sold aerosol paint containers to post signs in their businesses warning that vandalism was a crime,and to label such containers with such a warning.
assembly bill was amended on may,to delete the reference to the business and professions code,and to add proposed penal code section.assem.bill reg.sess.as amended may,assem.final hist.reg.sess.as amended,the bill,in proposed section,subdivisions a through c,added new crimes relating to the purchase of aerosol paint containers by minors and retained the requirements.in addition,as amended,the bill added proposed subdivisions d and e.
section,subdivisions d and e,in effect at the time of the present offenses,originate from subdivisions d and e,as proposed in assembly bill and amended in may.when the latter two subdivisions are read together,it is unclear whether the legislature intended that a public place,within the meaning of proposed subdivision e,be a place over which the government had jurisdiction for example,a place belonging to,or owned by,the government.
nonetheless,other parts of the legislative history of section,reveal that the legislature,in enacting that section,was seeking to address widespread problems resulting from the commission of vandalism upon government and privately owned property alike.
an analysis by the ways and means committee prepared for a june,hearing,and pertaining to assembly bill as amended may,comments that the bill prohibits possession of aerosol paint containers by persons under for the purpose of defacing property while on any public street or alley.assem.com.on ways and means,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended may,italics added.the italicized language suggests a limited scope of places affected by the bill.
however,a second comment only two sentences after the first comment states,the proposed measure responds to the serious problem in some communities of graffiti spray painted on walls and other open spaces.assem.com.on ways and means,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended may,italics added.this second comment provides evidence that the phrase public street or alley in the first comment was merely intended to be a shorthand characterization of the scope of the places affected by the proposed section,subdivision e but that second comment also provides evidence that the scope of the phrase public place in proposed section,subdivision e,was not intended to be limited merely to a public street or alley,or to places over which a government had jurisdiction,but was intended broadly to apply to the open spaces in which communities were finding graffiti to be a serious problem.
an analysis by the senate committee on the judiciary,and pertaining to assembly bill as amended may,notes that the source of the proposed legislation was the city of los angeles,supported by the city of san diego.the analysis also states,the purpose of this bill is to attempt to deter defacement of property with spray paint.com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended may.under the caption need for bill,the analysis states,proponents report that spray paint vandalism is a serious and very visible problem throughout the state,particularly in southern california.id.at.we note that this last statement referred to the problem of the visibility of spray paint vandalism,and neither of the above two quoted statements indicates that the proponents were concerned solely with vandalism to property,as opposed to private property.
indeed,the committee file of the senate committee on the judiciary contains a background information form pertaining to assembly bill,and the form was prepared for,and submitted to,the committee.the form was apparently filled out by the city of los angeles.the form,under the section entitled purpose,asks,what problem or deficiency under existing law does the bill seek to remedy the reply states,graffiti,in the los angeles area is still a serious problem.this measure is drafted so that it will not interfere with the legitimate use of paints,but will make it more difficult for individuals to deface properties.com.on judiciary,background information form re assem.bill reg.sess.as amended may,italics added.following additional amendments,assembly bill was,on september,enrolled and sent to the governor.assem.bill reg.sess.as amended september,assem.final hist.reg.sess.
various legislative documents confirm that the enrolled assembly bill was intended to address the widespread impact of graffiti on public and private property alike.a letter from the city council of the city of los angeles to the governor,dated september,stated,assembly bill is an attempt to alleviate the increasing problem of graffiti caused by the use of spray paint cans by minors.the letter later stated,the problem of graffiti caused by the use of spray paint cans by minors is evident throughout los angeles.governmental entities and private property owners,as a consequence,are faced with the expense of eradicating the graffiti and restoring the property damaged by the vandals.the city of los angeles budget in was over to eradicate the graffiti from public structures and certain private structures if the graffiti is obnoxious.city council of the city of los angeles,letter to governor brown reg.sess,italics added.the letter later stated,the city of los angeles feels that assembly bill is a very necessary step if we are to stem the tide of degradation of our inner city neighborhoods.letter to governor brown,supra,at.
a letter dated september,from assemblyman richard alatorre,who sponsored assembly bill,to the governor,stated,we all know that the blight caused by graffiti is detrimental to both the individual property owner and the community which must view it.assem.richard alatorre,sponsor of assem.bill reg.sess,letter to governor brown,italics added.
the widespread nature of the problem caused by graffiti was reflected in an enrolled bill report from the legal affairs department of the governor office dated september,and pertaining to assembly bill,which states,juvenile vandalism with spray paint is a widespread problem causing thousands of dollars in damages each year.however,the most serious use of paint is by youth gangs to establish their territory.these individuals will literally fight and die over their monikers.governor office,enrolled bill report on assem.bill reg.sess.the report also noted that the provisions of the proposed section were broad.ibid.on october,assem.bill was approved by the governor and,the next day,it was chaptered by the secretary of state as statutes,chapter.assem.final hist.reg.sess.
the above legislative analyses,reports,records,and correspondence,part of the legislative history of section,as enacted in,reveal that assembly bill was intended broadly to address the increasing and widespread problems,shared by the state and southern california community,of blight,eyesores,and costly property damage to our communities and open spaces caused by graffiti sprayed on government and privately owned property.section,as enacted in,was intended as a preliminary crime designed to deter such defacement of property and,thus,the commission of a completed act of spray paint vandalism.
we note that in,section,subdivision e,was amended with other subdivisions by the deletion of the requirement that the aerosol container of paint be larger than ounces net weight of contents,subdivision e,as amended by stats,ch,effecting a further legislative broadening of the reach of subdivision e 
in light of our above discussion,and mindful of the innumerable ways in which spray paint vandalism,and thus the preliminary crime proscribed by section,subdivision e,can be committed,we believe the legislative history of that subdivision supports a broad construction of the phrase public place found therein.accordingly,we reject the notion that whether a place is a public place within the meaning of subdivision e,is determinable by some rule,or that a single factor is dispositive,and look instead to the totality of the facts and circumstances presented in the record,viewed in light of the usual rules on appeal in re dennis,supra,cal d at,to determine whether there was sufficient evidence satisfying the public place element of subdivision e,in the present case.
there is no dispute that danny was on any place for purposes of section,subdivision e the issue is whether that place was a public place.we conclude that it was and substantial evidence supports that conclusion the trestle on which he stood was private property but that fact is not controlling the property did not belong to him and he had no ownership or possessory interest in the property.the trestle was readily accessible no member of the public wishing to access the trestle was prevented from doing so by any physical barrier.there were several spray cans in the area where danny had been standing,and officer phillips testimony established that,even before danny vandalized the wall,there was graffiti there these facts provided evidence that one or more persons already had accessed the trestle.
the trestle was unenclosed,visible to the public,and exposed to general view.thus,an anonymous caller had been able to see danny and his companion while they were on the trestle.officer phillips,still in his vehicle and about to feet from danny,observed him standing on the raised area of the trestle.the fact that there were walls on either side of the tracks does not alter the fact that the location where danny was standing was substantially an open space of a type with which section,subdivision e,according to its legislative history,is concerned.
danny obviously wanted his graffiti sprayed at a place where it would be visible.the record permits the inference that he wrote it for gang members to see a segment of the public,fellow vandals,previously had accessed the location to spray graffiti and he anticipated that his graffiti would be visible at least to such members of the public.we note that one of the reasons section,subdivision e,was enacted was to prevent gang graffiti.the graffiti also would have been visible to any persons being transported on the railroad tracks.moreover,we note that foothill was a major boulevard in a largely industrial area.there is no dispute that danny committed vandalism while on the trestle count one it seems incongruous,on the above facts,to accept that he committed a completed act of vandalism but not,seconds before,a preliminary offense designed to deter that act.
thus,we conclude that there was sufficient evidence that danny violated section,subdivision e,including sufficient evidence that he possessed an aerosol container of paint while on any public place within the meaning of that subdivision.none of the cases cited by danny,or his argument,compels a contrary conclusion 
there is no need to decide the section issue or to correct the trial court calculation of the maximum theoretical period of confinement.
at disposition,the trial court ordered that a previous order that danny be placed on home on probation would remain in effect.the trial court calculated danny maximum theoretical period of confinement,which appeared to include consecutive confinement periods on counts one and two danny claims the trial court erroneously failed to stay,pursuant to section,the term on count two two months.
there is no need to decide the issue.the section issue is relevant only to the issue of whether the trial court order calculating danny maximum theoretical period of confinement must be corrected.however,here,danny was ordered home on probation in the home of his parents.the court did not order danny removed from the physical custody of his parents.only when a court orders a minor removed from the physical custody of his parent or guardian is the court required to specify the maximum term the minor can be held in physical confinement.accordingly,there is no need to decide the section issue or to correct the trial court order calculating danny maximum theoretical period of confinement.in re joseph th,d welf.
disposition 
the order continuing wardship is affirmed.
at the september adjudication,danny displayed his hands to the court.they had paint on them and,according to danny,normally looked that way because danny painted model cars.danny was painting the day before the adjudication,and got blue paint on his fingers.the court looked at danny hands and commented that the middle right,the middle finger appears to have some black substance on it.
unless otherwise indicated,statutory references are to the penal code.section,reads,in relevant part,a it shall be unlawful for any person,firm,or corporation,except a parent or legal guardian,to sell or give or in any way furnish to another person,who is in fact under the age of years,any aerosol container of paint that is capable of defacing property without first obtaining bona fide evidence of majority and identity.b it shall be unlawful for any person under the age of years to purchase an aerosol container of paint that is capable of defacing property.c every retailer selling or offering for sale in this state aerosol containers of paint capable of defacing property shall post in a conspicuous place a sign in letters at least of an inch high stating any person who maliciously defaces real or personal property with paint is guilty of vandalism which is punishable by a fine,imprisonment,or both.d it is unlawful for any person to carry on his or her person and in plain view to the public an aerosol container of paint while in any posted public facility,park,playground,swimming pool,beach,or recreational area,other than a highway,street,alley,or way,unless he or she has first received valid authorization from the governmental entity which has jurisdiction over the public area.e it is unlawful for any person under the age of years to possess an aerosol container of paint for the purpose of defacing property while on any public highway,street,alley,or way,or other public place,regardless of whether that person is or is not in any automobile,vehicle,or other conveyance.as a condition of probation for any violation of this subdivision,the court may order a defendant convicted of a violation of this subdivision to perform community service f violation of any provision of this section is a misdemeanor.upon conviction of any person under this section,the court may,in addition to any other punishment imposed,if the jurisdiction has adopted a graffiti abatement program as defined in subdivision f of section,order the defendant,and his or her parents or guardians if the defendant is a minor,to keep the damaged property or another specified property in the community free of graffiti,
