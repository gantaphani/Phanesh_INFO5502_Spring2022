emiliano appeals from the juvenile court order,continuing him on probation after he violated a previous grant of probation by failing to pay restitution and fines and by possessing air pistols,live ammunition and gang paraphernalia.as a condition to the new grant of probation,the court ordered him to register as a gang member of the central myrtle street cms gang pursuant to the newly enacted section of the penal code emiliano contends this registration provision is unconstitutional even if valid,his condition to register must be stricken as the statute is inapplicable to him.one allegation constituting a crime must be stricken as the prosecution failed to properly charge it under the applicable procedural and jurisdictional statute.because the statutory authority for the gang registration fails to include probation violations not charged as crimes,the registration condition is reversed.the remainder of the order is affirmed.
emiliano is presently facing attempted murder charges in adult court for a shooting which occurred while he was on probation to the juvenile court for a variety of offenses.in the case before us,the juvenile court found him in violation of juvenile probation,originally granted five years ago for carrying a concealed loaded weapon in a car.over the course of the last five years,there have been five previous violations of probation sustained against emiliano,the present one comprising the sixth.this probation revocation involved his failure to pay fines and restitution in his earlier cases,and the possession of air pistols and live ammunition which violated conditions in his prior probation.these items were found during a search of his residence pursuant to a warrant issued in connection with the attempted murder investigation.he admitted the allegation that he failed to pay the restitution and fines,and submitted the issue of the contraband possession on the introduction of a police report.emiliano waived his rights to present a defense to the allegations and to have a probation report prepared.the juvenile court read the police report and sustained the petition alleging a probation violation.the court then readmitted emiliano to probation on the condition he serve a year in custody.it also ordered him to register with law enforcement agencies as a gang member pursuant to section,a part of the initiative known as the gang violence and juvenile crime prevention act of proposition,passed in march.
discussion 
emiliano contends that the statutory authority for gang registration,sections and,is vague and overbroad.emiliano argues that the registration requirements fail to give fair and adequate notice of prohibited conduct,encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement and reach constitutionally protected conduct.we need not resolve these issues as we agree with emiliano in his alternative argument that he did not qualify for a registration condition,under section,subdivision b that mandates such registration 
section,subdivision b mandates gang registration of any person convicted in a criminal court or who has had a petition sustained in a juvenile court in this state for any of the following offenses any crime that the court finds is gang related at the time of sentencing or disposition.emphasis added.emiliano registration order was not the result of a petition sustained in a juvenile court for any crime.section defines a crime as an act committed or omitted in violation of a law forbidding or commanding it,and to which is annexed,upon conviction,either of the following punishments.death.imprisonment.fine.removal from office or.disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor,trust,or profit in this state.emiliano was charged with violating certain conditions of his previous grants of probation,but none of those violations were charged as crimes,only as noncompliance with probationary conditions.moreover,only one of those acts of misconduct could comprise a crime.see discussion b,post.
crimes versus probation violations 
neither the allegations of nonpayment of fines nor the possession of air pistols and ammunition were brought or charged as crimes although the record is quite confused,all the parties proceeded on the assumption that all the charges were probation violations,not separate crimes supporting a modification of the wardship.the initial petition alleging the nonpayment of the fines was entitled,notice of hearing,probation violation.the proof of service attached to that notice asserted that the minor comes within section of the welfare and institutions code but denotes the hearing as a probation violation arraignment.similarly,the petition charging him with the contraband possession was also entitled,notice of hearing probation violation with the similar references on the proof of service.the probation department also approached the matter as strictly a probation violation proceeding,referring to this case in all of its reports as the seventh and ninth petition of probation violation under welfare and institutions code section.finally,the juvenile court referred to this case in all minute orders and on the record as strictly a probation violation proceeding never was the hearing referred to,or conducted as,a jurisdictional hearing under welfare and institutions code section 
the distinction is no longer insignificant.under the changes wrought by the passage of proposition,proceedings to revoke probation and modify previous orders under welfare and institutions code section are exclusively for charges not amounting to crimes.see in re marcus th,d.prior to those changes,welfare and institutions code section outlined two categories of misconduct which could warrant revocation of probation and increased restrictions,that which amounted to a crime and that which did not.id.at,d.by amending that code section,certain procedural rights are no longer secured to wards undergoing a revocation hearing under welfare and institutions code section.for instance,the juvenile court need only find the allegations in a supplemental petition under welfare and institutions code section true by a preponderance of the evidence,not beyond a reasonable doubt as was the case prior to the passage of proposition and is required for proof of a crime.see in re winship,d a minor can not be made a ward of the court due to commission of a crime unless a charge is proved beyond a reasonable doubt.likewise,hearsay evidence may be used in the hearings to prove these probation violation allegations in re marcus,supra,th at,d,but not to prove criminal charges.based on these dynamic changes,the court in marcus held that crimes charged as the basis to revoke juvenile probation must be brought under welfare and institutions code section,not section.ibid.
in marcus,a petition filed under welfare and institutions code section alleged that marcus,a ward of the court,had violated his probation by disobeying the dress code of his placement facility and by possessing cigarettes.the juvenile court held a hearing and found the dress code had never been clearly written.thus,marcus disobedience was not a willful violation of his probation.however,the court also found he possessed cigarettes and modified the wardship order by sending marcus to the california youth authority cya.in re marcus,supra,th at,d.
on appeal,this finding and the subsequent order were reversed because a minor in possession of cigarettes comprises a crime.see,subd.b.as this misconduct occurred after the passage of proposition,it should not have been pursued in proceedings initiated under the amended version of welfare and institutions code section.in re marcus,supra,th at,d.
thus,assuming emiliano hearing was conducted as a probation violation hearing under welfare and institutions code section,any charge comprising an independent crime must be reversed as it was not prosecuted as a crime with the attendant procedural protections afforded hearings under welfare and institutions code section.the attorney general responds that the record does not conclusively prove that the matter was decided under the abridged procedures of welfare and institutions code section,but might have be
