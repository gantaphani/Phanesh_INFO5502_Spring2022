under the lanterman developmental disabilities services act lanterman act welf,et,care for the developmentally disabled is provided by private contractors operating,among other services,residential care facilities.the coordination of the delivery of such direct services is the responsibility of private nonprofit community agencies called regional centers,subd.b.this case involves the tragic death of a developmentally disabled individual resulting from the negligence of the staff of the residential care facility in which he had been placed by a regional center.two questions are presented.may the regional center be held vicariously liable for the negligence of the residential care facility the court of appeal,in the second of its two opinions in this case,answered this question in the affirmative we disagree.did the court of appeal previous decision resolve the vicarious liability question,and is that decision controlling in this appeal under the law of the case doctrine we conclude the court of appeal previous decision did not resolve the vicarious liability question and,thus,is not controlling.
factual and procedural background 
bobby morohoshi,plaintiffs adult son,was developmentally disabled he was also an diabetic.in,harbor regional center harbor placed bobby in pacific home,a residential care facility bobby resided there until his death in.
harbor arranged for nurses to visit bobby twice a day to test his blood sugar and administer his insulin.pacific homes owner and her sister,who were registered nurses,originally performed this function.later,this function was performed by home health nurses and other members of pacific homes staff.
in,pacific home hired new staff,including esther sison.sison was responsible for testing bobbys level the night before he died.she failed to do so.the next morning bobby lay dead in his bedroom.
prior to trial,the morohoshis moved in limine for an order preventing harbor from contending the fault for bobbys death may or should be apportioned between harbor and pacific home.they based their motion on their contention harbor was vicariously liable for any negligence by pacific home in providing care to bobby.the trial court denied the motion.harbor moved in limine for an order prohibiting the morohoshis from presenting any evidence or arguing harbor could be held vicariously liable for pacific homes tortious conduct harbor contended it could only be held liable for failure to discharge its own nondelegable statutory duties.the trial court granted this motion.
later,in a discussion of the special verdict form,the trial court repeated its view harbor could not be held vicariously liable for pacific homes negligence and required the parties to draft a verdict form that would allow the jury to apportion negligence.
the jury found pacific home liable for bobbys death on the basis of negligence and found it guilty of abuse of a dependent adult.the verdict awarded the morohoshis economic damages of and noneconomic damages in the amount of the jury found harbor not negligent and awarded no damages against it 
on appeal by the morohoshis,the court of appeal ordered the judgment modified to provide harbor and pacific home are jointly and severally liable to the morohoshis for the economic and noneconomic damages sustained as a result of pacific homes negligence in the sum of plus costs as provided by law.in all other respects,the judgment was affirmed.the morohoshis were awarded their costs on appeal.
the court of appeal held harbor is vicariously liable to the morohoshis for pacific homes negligence pursuant to its nondelegable duty of care to bobby.in its view,the court of appeal had rendered the same holding in its previous decision in this case.therefore,the court of appeal concluded,this appeal is governed by the law of the case doctrine.
we disagree accordingly,we reverse the judgment of the court of appeal.
ii.discussion 
under the lanterman act,the state contracts with a network of regional centers private nonprofit community agencies,subd.b in order to provide fixed points of contact in the community for persons with developmental disabilities and their families,to the end that these persons may have access to the services and supports best suited to them throughout their lifetime,subd.a.regional centers are responsible for determining through testing and evaluation whether an individual has a developmental disability.if a regional center determines that an individual has a developmental disability and is eligible for services,a p lanning team,comprised of the individual with the disability,his or her parents or guardian,one or more regional center representatives,and any other person or entity invited to participate,draws up an individual program plan ipp,subd.j,subds.c,d.the ipp must identify the developmentally disabled person goals,objectives,and needed services and supports,taking into account the individual needs and preferences of the person and his or her family,subds.a,d.the ipp must include a schedule of the type and amount of services and supports to be purchased by the regional center or obtained from generic agencies or other resources in order to achieve the ipp goals and objectives,subd.a.
the most important role of the regional centers is this direct service coordination,subd.a.in approving regional center contracts,the department of developmental services shall ensure that regional center staffing patterns demonstrate that direct service coordination is the highest priority.ibid.the regional centers play this coordinating role by assist ing persons with developmental disabilities and their families in securing those services and supports which maximize opportunities and choices for living,working,learning,and recreating in the community,subd.a see,subd.a.the regional centers secure the needed services by purchasing or by obtaining them from direct service providers like pacific home,subd.a.the process of identifying and qualifying the vendors or contractors from which services are purchased is known as vendorization,subd.a.
the role played by regional centers in coordinating the delivery of the direct services indicated by a developmentally disabled person ipp is clearly a vital one indeed,the legislature declared this coordinating role is of such a special and unique nature that it can not be satisfactorily provided by state agencies,subd.b.
however,the court of appeal inflated harbor role in coordinating bobby care beyond all recognition by holding harbor had a nondelegable duty to provide bobby care itself,or to closely monitor pacific home provision of bobby care.a review of the applicable statutes and regulations reveals that direct provision of care is not a responsibility of regional centers and regional centers are not intended to monitor the care provided by their contractors on the,that would have been required to prevent bobby tragic death.
direct provision of care is not a responsibility of regional centers 
the court of appeal mistakenly concluded that harbor had authority to provide bobby care itself in lieu of contracting with a provider such as pacific home on its face,the lanterman act clearly imposes mandatory duties on harbor to ensure the consumer receives proper care and services,whether or not harbor chooses to vendorize the actual placement.
to the contrary,the responsibility of a regional center is to secure,not provide,care,subd.a.to read the list of services a regional center may be required to secure for a developmentally disabled individual is to understand that a regional center could not possibly be expected to provide those services itself indeed,e xcept in emergency situations,a regional center shall not provide direct treatment and therapeutic services,but shall utilize appropriate public and private community agencies and service providers to obtain those services for its consumers,subd.f.
as harbor suggests,the court of appeal conclusion that regional centers have the option of providing care themselves appears to have resulted from its having overlooked,through an unfortunate resort to ellipsis,key language in section,subdivision a.the court of appeal q
