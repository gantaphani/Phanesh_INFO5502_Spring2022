at the time of the detention hearing,the san diego county probation department probation department recommended that remain detained in juvenile hall because she posed a risk to herself and to the community as a result of her escalating violent behavior,history of substance abuse,and mental health needs.the court ordered that remain detained in juvenile hall and undergo a competency evaluation.the court further ordered the probation department and the agency to meet and confer in order to determine whether the dependency or delinquency system would better serve needs.

shortly thereafter,in late february,the san diego county district attorney amended the delinquency petition against to add allegations pertaining to the vandalism incident at school.the probation department requested a continuance of the delinquency proceedings to allow the agencies to discuss the new offense,because their prior recommendation was based solely on the battery charge.the juvenile court granted the request for a continuance and ordered the agency and the probation department to meet and confer regarding whether should be designated a dual status youth.

discussion 
ithe juvenile court acted within its discretion in designating a dual status youth 
argues that the juvenile court abused its discretion by designating her a dual status child.she contends that the juvenile court should have dismissed the delinquency petition against her and designated her solely a dependent of the juvenile court.we reject these arguments.
in california,the juvenile court jurisdiction over a minor can be invoked in two ways by a dependency petition,which alleges the child home is unfit due to parental abuse or neglect or by a delinquency petition,which accuses the child of either disobedience or truancy or the violation of a law that defines a crime.in re cal th.the dependency and delinquency systems serve overlapping but slightly different aims whereas the dependency system is geared toward protection of a child victimized by parental abuse or neglect,the delinquency system enforces accountability for the child own wrongdoing,both to rehabilitate the child and to protect the public.id.at.although california juvenile courts address the needs of dependent and delinquent minors differently,some minors who come before the court seem to fall under both systems.in general,however,california law prohibits a minor from simultaneously being declared a dependent child and a delinquent ward.ibid.
in,the legislature created a small exception to the ban on dual jurisdiction.section,subdivision e allows a minor to be designated a dual status child,and treated simultaneously under the court dependency and delinquency jurisdiction,but only in accordance with a precise written protocol.in re,supra,cal th at.the bill creating the exception was cosponsored by the judicial council of california and the children law center of los angeles to address the situation some children face when they are caught between the dependency and delinquency juvenile justice systems and need the interventions of both systems.assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended.the sponsors of the bill reco
