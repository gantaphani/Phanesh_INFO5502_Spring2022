david killinger owns a bar and restaurant in the village of port byron,illinois.because plaintiff establishment allegedly had sold beer to an underage man,the mayor of port byron temporarily closed the business,suspended killinger license,and imposed a fine.killinger subsequently filed this suit in federal court under against the mayor and the village,alleging violations of the equal protection and due process clauses of the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of both defendants.we hold that the mayor enjoys judicial immunity,and the alleged injuries were not caused by a port byron policy.accordingly,we affirm.
background 
every august,port byron holds a celebration known as tug fest.the celebration culminates in a across the mississippi river,pitting the residents of port byron against their rivals in le claire,iowa.tug fest attracts a fair number of tourists,swelling the population of both towns.port byron relaxes its liquor laws during the festival,allowing adults age and over to drink outside.to prevent underage drinking,local police and liquor licensees hand out wristbands to adults of legal age who present valid photo identification.
david killinger and his wife own an establishment in port byron named g riverfront caf√© g.g is a fine dining restaurant with an adjacent bar,located near the tug fest activities.during the festival,g converts its operations to accommodate the crowds,selling mainly beer,wine,liquor,and some fast food.
on august,the first night of tug fest that year,port byron police officers patrolling the festivities observed a man who was not wearing a wristband drinking beer from a can.after being questioned by the officers,the man admitted that he was underage,and that he had purchased the beer from g without being asked for identification.the officers knew from experience that g was the only nearby establishment selling beer in cans.
the officers relayed this information to chief of police steven rathburn.chief rathburn sent several underage people to attempt to buy beer from g,but these attempted stings were unsuccessful.chief rathburn then conferred with port byron mayor donald johnson.as mayor,johnson also acts as the local liquor control commissioner,charged with the administration of illinois liquor control act of the liquor act.see.comp.stat.mayor johnson decided,with the chief concurrence,that he should order g closed for the remainder of the evening.the mayor did not issue a written order explaining the reasons for this decision.
around,chief rathburn went to g and spoke with killinger.the chief explained that police had arrested an underage man who claimed to have purchased a beer at g without being asked for identification.despite killinger denial that his business had violated the law,chief rathburn directed plaintiff to close both the bar and restaurant areas of g.the business otherwise would have remained open until g was allowed to the next day.
on august,mayor johnson,acting as the local liquor control commissioner,held a public hearing on whether g had served an alcoholic beverage to a minor.killinger was represented by counsel,but it is unclear whether he was allowed to port byron witnesses.mayor johnson found that g had violated the act,suspended g liquor license for three days,and imposed a fine.on appeal of that order to the state liquor commission,killinger was represented by counsel,offered witnesses,and port byron witnesses.the state liquor commission affirmed the suspension and fine.killinger appealed the state liquor commission decision to the rock island county circuit court.the record is unclear as to the status of that appeal.
on may,killinger filed the instant action under.the complaint alleged that mayor johnson violated plaintiff procedural due process rights by failing to hold a hearing prior to the summary closing on august,and by ignoring procedures required by illinois law.killinger also claimed that the mayor violated his equal protection rights by singling out g for scrutiny.plaintiff sought to impose liability on both johnson and port byron for the mayor actions.
the district court per magistrate judge john gorman,presiding by consent granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on all counts.it ruled that mayor johnson enjoyed judicial immunity for his acts as the local liquor control commissioner.the court also held that killinger injury,if any,was not caused by a policy of port byron.it concluded,finally,that plaintiff had been afforded adequate process,and failed to establish an equal protection claim as a matter of law.
ii.analysis 
killinger appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants as to his due process claims summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.we review the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmovant,and draw all inferences in favor of that party.ziliak astrazeneca lp,cir.a district court grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo.sullivan ramirez,cir.
claim against mayor johnson 
the liquor act authorizes mayor johnson,as local liquor control commissioner,to impose fines or revoke or suspend licenses for violations of the act.see.comp.stat.selling alcohol to a person under the age of constitutes a violation of the act.a i.the liquor act establishes the procedures that must be followed before these sanctions may be imposed n o such license shall be so revoked or suspended and no licensee shall be fined except after a public hearing by the local liquor control commissioner with a day written notice to the licensee affording the licensee an opportunity to appear and defend.the liquor act also permits the temporary closing of a business without a prior hearing in certain limited circumstances 
if the local liquor control commissioner has reason to believe that any continued operation of a particular licensed premises will immediately threaten the welfare of the community he may,upon the issuance of a written order stating the reason for such conclusion and without notice or hearing order the licensed premises closed for not more than days,giving the licensee an opportunity to be heard during that period,except that if such licensee shall also be engaged in the conduct of another business or businesses on the licensed premises such order shall not be applicable to such other business or businesses.
killinger asserts that the mayor violated these procedures by summarily closing g without issuing a written order,explaining his reasons,or holding a hearing while the bar was ordered closed between on august and on august.the order summarily closing g was also overbroad,according to plaintiff,because it applied to both the bar and restaurant areas of g.although the mayor later held a hearing to address the propriety of imposing a fine and suspension,killinger contends that he was never afforded an opportunity to challenge the summary closing itself.
plaintiff argues that,by violating illinois law,the mayor also violated his federal due process rights.killinger also asserts that the due process clause requires the authorities to hold a hearing before temporarily closing his business,see,bell burson,d,even though the liquor act does not.we do not reach the merits of killinger due process claim against johnson,however,because we agree with the district court that the mayor is protected by judicial immunity.
absolute judicial immunity shields judicial and actors from liability for civil damages arising out of the performance of their judicial functions.butz economou,d.in determining whether an official enjoys judicial immunity,we examine the nature of the responsibilities of the official in question.tobin for governor.state,cir.i mmunity is justified and defined by the functions it protects and serves,not by the person to whom it attaches.forrester white,d.following this functional approach,we have held that an illinois local li
