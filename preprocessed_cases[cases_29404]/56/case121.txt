a male juvenile,appeals from a proceeding in which he was found to be a juvenile delinquent based on violations of a a ii transporting illegal aliens in the united states and a b ii bringing illegal aliens to the united states for commercial advantage or private financial gain.he contends that the juvenile information should have been dismissed because the government violated certain provisions of the juvenile justice and delinquency prevention act of,stat,codified at,jda with regard to the institution of proceedings against him in federal court,his interrogation and arraignment,and the timeliness of his trial.he also appeals from the district court judgment on the a b ii counts,maintaining that there was insufficient evidence that he obtained or aided another in obtaining commercial advantage or private financial gain.because we conclude that of the jda was violated,we remand to the district court to consider whether the violations were a cause of confession.
background 
statutory protections for arrested juveniles.
under the juvenile delinquency act,juveniles are entitled to distinct procedural protections with regard to interrogation and arraignment,the speed with which they are brought to trial,and the institution of delinquency proceedings against them in federal court.upon the arrest of a juvenile,the arresting officer must immediately advise the juvenile of his legal rights,in language that is comprehensi ble to a juvenile.the arresting officer must also notify the parents,guardian or custodian of the rights of the juvenile,and the juvenile must be taken before a magistrate judge forthwith.id.
before instituting delinquency proceedings in federal court,the attorney general must certif y to the appropriate district court that one of three conditions exists the juvenile court or other appropriate court of a state does not have jurisdiction or refuses to assume jurisdiction the state does not have available programs and services for juveniles or the offense charged is a crime of violence or a specified felony.id.the attorney general must also certify that there is a substantial federal interest in the case or the offense to warrant the exercise of federal jurisdiction.id.
lastly,a juvenile who is detained pending trial must be brought to trial within thirty days from the date upon which such detention was begun,unless additional delay was caused by the juvenile or his counsel,consented to by the juvenile and his counsel,or would be in the interest of justice in the particular case.id.
ii.november,arrest.
was arrested by federal border patrol agents on november,at approximately on suspicion of smuggling aliens into the united states.and the other occupants of the blue dodge ram in which he was traveling were then transported to the calexico border patrol station.at the station,border patrol agent jesus salazar asked his birth date.stated that he was born on january,making him years old.agent salazar was informed by his dispatcher,however,that dhs showed a number of earlier arrests for,and that the birth dates given on at least two of those occasions would make a juvenile on the day of this latest.neither agent salazar nor any of the other border patrol officers attempted to notify the mexican consulate or parents of arrest.
sometime after,agent salazar advised of his miranda rights and began a videotaped interview.in the interview,stated that he was a citizen of mexico and that he had no documents allowing him to legally enter or remain in the united states that he met a smuggler in the mexican city of mexicali who offered to smuggle him into the united states for and that he later agreed to drive a vehicle carrying illegal immigrants into the united states in exchange for a reduction of his smuggling fee to.
iii.proceedings before the magistrate judge.
challenges the timeliness of his trial under the speedy trial provision of the jda.we therefore lay out the course of the district court proceedings in some detail.
on november,at least hours after his arrest on november,was arraigned on a complaint charging him with illegal transportation of aliens in violation of.at the arraignment,appointed defense counsel informed the court that defendant is a minor,that he years old,and that just about days ago he was actually turned over to the mexican consulate in san luis and then taken to the mexican authorities as a juvenile.defense counsel presented no documents at that time to confirm age.the magistrate judge set a hearing date on the matter of juvenile status for december.
at the start of the december hearing,defense counsel requested a continuance because the mexican consulate had not yet interviewed.the magistrate judge set the hearing for december,and indicated to defense counsel that evidence that was previously removed as a juvenile would likely not be sufficient to convince him that was a juvenile.however,the magistrate judge stated that verifying documents and testimony from the mexican consulate as to their authenticity would lend a lot more credibility to claim that he was a juvenile.
at the december hearing,defense counsel stated that she had obtained faxed copies of birth certificate and the birth certificate of his mother by contacting mother in mexico.defense counsel also represented that a defense investigator was prepared to testify that he had contacted mother and obtained copies of the documents.the court informed defense counsel that i just give you a tentative ruling that the birth certificate alone is not going to satisfy the court without some other testimony,and that a faxed birth certificate with the testimony that somebody spoke to somebody on the telephone was not going to suffice.the court decided to give both sides time to prepare their cases,and set the hearing for december.
at the december evidentiary hearing,fourth appearance before the magistrate judge,defense counsel informed the court that the hearing obviously ca go forward at this time,because the mexican consulate had not yet received the birth certificate or other documentation,and no consular officer was available to testify.the magistrate judge then set the hearing for december,but noted that that going to be days out,and stated i do think there is a certain urgency that should be given this proceeding since it is in how is treated.
when the hearing reconvened on december the magistrate judge informed counsel that was not present because he had been transferred to san diego.defense counsel stated that she had with her birth certificate and a mexican consular official who was prepared to testify,and that mother was on standby over the phone.defense counsel also indicated that she wished to waive appearance.the government objected to the waiver,and the court refused to waive appearance,instead setting a hearing date for december.
defense counsel and the magistrate judge then proceeded to discuss which party bears the burden of demonstrating juvenile status and what type of proof would suffice to demonstrate that was a juvenile.the magistrate judge indicated that it is the d efense burden to prove that this individual is a juvenile,because he identified himself originally as an adult,and further stated there a presumption that he an adult.the magistrate judge did not say precisely what the defense burden was,but informed defense counsel,y ou going to have to convince me,and that a birth certificate in itself would not be sufficient because you can get anything in mexico that you want to pay for.he would consider it pretty good evidence,however,if someone from the mexican consulate testified as to the birth certificate authenticity.
the evidentiary hearing on juvenile status was finally conducted on december.the magistrate judge opened the hearing by telling the government i think you have the initial burden.the government presented the testimony of agent salazar,who identified and testified that had provided a birth date of january,at the time of his arrest.when he was asked by government counsel whether he had received additional information from his dispatcher regarding other arrests for,agent salazar maintained that the birth dates had given upon his other arrests were consistent with the birth date provided to him.after agent salazar testimony,the magistrate judge stated i think the burden has shifted to the d efense now.the defense then called the mexican consular official,who testified that he had contacted mother in mexico and that she had provided an original copy of his birth certificate indicating his date of birth as january,as well as a residence letter from their county of residence.the consular official testified that,based on this evidence,he believed that was a minor.he also noted that had been returned as a juvenile to mexico in october,through the mexican consulate in yuma,arizona.the magistrate judge then found,based on the credible evidence provided by the defense,that was a juvenile.
the government filed a juvenile information the next day,alleging that had committed acts of juvenile delinquency.counts one,three,and five of the information alleged violations of a b ii including aiding and abetting that crime counts two,four,and six alleged violations of a a ii including aiding and abetting that crime.
the same day,the government filed two additional documents.the first document,titled certification and signed by united states attorney carol lam,states that the juvenile court of the state of california does not have jurisdiction over the juvenile defendant and that there is a substantial federal interest in the case to warrant the exercise of federal jurisdiction.the second document,which is not dated,is entitled juvenile delinquency certification and is signed by john weis,an assistant united states attorney.on the document,a box has been checked next to the statement contacted joseph beard,assistant district attorney,imperial county state juvenile court,who declined prosecution.
iv.proceedings before the district court.
at the first motion hearing before the district court on january,moved to dismiss the information on the ground that he had been detained for more than thirty days without being brought to trial,in violation of.the court held that the speedy trial clock begins to run from the time a defendant is determined to be a juvenile by the court,not when the court is first put on notice that defendant may be a juvenile,and that there therefore was no violation of.the court then set a hearing on motions for january.
on january,defense counsel filed motions to dismiss the information for failure to provide a proper juvenile certification under to suppress statements as the fruit of the government failure to comply with and to dismiss the information for failure to comply with.the defense also renewed its motion to dismiss the information for failure to comply with the speedy trial provision of.both defense counsel and the government requested additional time to respond to motions and prepare for trial,and the court set a trial date of january.at the hearing on january,the court addressed defense counsel motions and held that there was no violation of,the jda provision regarding arrest and interrogation of juveniles,that would require either suppression of statements or dismissal.the court concluded that was not triggered at the time of arrest because gave an adult date of birth.the court again held that there was no violation of the speedy trial provision of the jda,but delayed ruling on the question whether certification was proper under.
at trial,the government presented testimony from border patrol agents and from aliens who were passengers in the blue dodge ram.two of the border patrol agents who participated in arrest identified as the driver of a blue dodge ram that was pulled over on november,with illegal aliens inside,and testified that he attempted to evade border patrol officers,first by swerving into oncoming traffic and later by running from the vehicle after it came to a stop.in addition,agent salazar testified that,after was transported to the calexico border patrol station,he took biographical information and found that he had six previous arrests,during some of which he had given birth dates that would indicate that he was a juvenile on november.agent salazar also testified to the contents of statement.
material witnesses neftali,javier tomas,and javier testified about their transportation to the united states.and both testified that they agreed to pay a smuggler,and that they followed the smuggler instructions to travel from mexicali to algodones and to then set out walking on a road,at which point they were picked up by a blue truck.testified that he traveled to mexicali with his brother,where they waited in a hotel until a man came and met them and gave his brother instructions.he and his brother then took a bus to algodones,and from there walked into the desert where a blue truck picked them up.testified that his father was going to pay for him to be smuggled into the united states.
after the government rested,defense counsel moved for acquittal under federal rule of criminal procedure a on counts one,three,and five,arguing that the government failed to provide sufficient evidence of an intent to receive financial gain,and also renewed the motion to suppress statement as obtained in violation of.the court denied the motion to suppress,holding that the defendant was properly advised of his rights per miranda as an adult,and denied the rule motion.the district court next addressed the motion to dismiss due to faulty certification under.the court held that the certification complied with because the attached document signed by an assistant united states attorney was essentially a declaration indicating that the united states attorney office had conducted the investigation required by the statute.
pronouncing its judgment,the district court held that was a juvenile delinquent with respect to all counts.with respect to counts two,four,and six the court found that knowingly drove a vehicle of undocumented aliens into the united states.regarding counts one,three,and five,the court further found that agreed to drive the vehicle to reduce his smuggling fee,and that this reduction constituted financial gain.the court also inferred from the evidence that knew that the other occupants of the vehicle were paying a smuggler.the court subsequently sentenced to ten and months imprisonment and a term of supervised release that expires on his birthday.
certification provision of the federal juvenile delinquency act 
argues that the government did not properly certify the case as required by because the certification signed by the attorney inaccurately stated that the california state court did not have jurisdiction over the juvenile for the crime at issue,rather than that it had refused jurisdiction.the statute indicates that,in a case in which federal court jurisdiction is premised on a lack of state court jurisdiction,the attorney must certify one of two things that the state court does not have jurisdiction,or that the state court has refused jurisdiction 
in this case,the attorney submitted a signed certification stating that the juvenile court of the state of california does not have jurisdiction over with respect to the charged offenses of bringing in illegal aliens for financial gain under u.a b ii,and aiding and abetting that crime,and transportation of illegal aliens and aiding and abetting that crime under a a ii and v ii.also submitted,apparently on the same day,was a second,undated form signed by an assistant attorney and entitled juvenile delinquency certification,on which a checkmark was placed next to the typed statement contacted joseph beard,assistant district attorney,imperial county state juvenile court,who declined prosecution.we conclude that the certification did not violate because the state court did not have jurisdiction over within the meaning of the statute 
the government and both initially assumed that,because the assistant district attorney in fact declined prosecution,a substantively accurate certification would have indicated that the state court refused jurisdiction,not,as the certification stated in this case,that the state court did not have jurisdiction.according to,this substantive inaccuracy in the certification rendered it invalid and deprived the district court of jurisdiction.but both parties failed to note that the second alternative of subsection of the statute refers to the decision by the state court,not the state prosecutor,to refuse to assume jurisdiction.when a state prosecutor in california declines to initiate proceedings against a juvenile in a california state court,the state court never obtains jurisdiction over the particular juvenile and thus has no occasion to refuse it 
here,the state prosecutor affirmatively declined to initiate prosecution.the assistant attorney statement so asserts,and,while the statement can not serve as the statutorily required certification,it provides evidence,which is not disputed,of two factors relevant to the attorney certification that the requisite investigation had been performed by the attorney office,and that the investigation established that the state prosecutor responsible for any juvenile proceeding had affirmatively declined to institute such a proceeding.in this set of circumstances,determined after an appropriate investigation,the attorney certification that the juvenile court does not have jurisdiction is accurate.
our conclusion that the certification is consistent with the assistant attorney report that the assistant district attorney declined prosecution rests upon two pillars 
first,the term jurisdiction is not defined in definitions or elsewhere in the governing statutes.thus,to determine its meaning in we must look to the language of the statute,assuming that legal terms are used in their usual sense.see dolan postal service,interpretation of a word or phrase depends upon reading the whole statutory text,considering the purpose and context of the statute,and consulting any precedents or authorities that inform the analysis.buckhannon bd.and care home,west virginia dep t of health and human resources,words that have acquired a specialized meaning in the legal context must be accorded their legal meaning.absent a more specific statutory definition,j udicial jurisdiction implies the power to hear and determine a cause united states.in addition,specifies that the jurisdiction certified must be exercised over said juvenile and with respect to such alleged act of juvenile delinquency.the word over and the phrase said juvenile indicates that the power to hear and determine a cause must have come into over a particular person said juvenile.the reference to such alleged act of juvenile delinquency reinforces the conclusion that is concerned with an than of the court to decide a specific,existent case,concerning a particular alleged illegal act.
further reinforcing this interpretation of the term jurisdiction in is the reference to the court refus ing to assert jurisdiction.courts may not,of course,relinquish their authority to decide classes of cases generally but,in some circumstances,may relinquish their authority over a particular case sought to be brought before them,comm of pullman.
all of these linguistic considerations,then,support the conclusion that for purposes of,the reference to a state court jurisdiction over said juvenile with respect to such act of juvenile delinquency refers to the court authority with regard to the particular juvenile and a specific alleged illegal act.general subject matter jurisdiction over classes of juveniles or classes of acts is insufficient.
second,although federal law determines the meaning of the term jurisdiction in,we must look to the law of the affected state to determine whether its courts have jurisdiction over with respect to such alleged act of juvenile delinquency.in other words,we must look to whether the juvenile courts of california had the power to decide this case involving 
as we have seen,the california courts clearly have subject matter jurisdiction over claims that a juvenile violated federal criminal immigration laws even if no specific california statute addresses the same conduct.cal.welf.a see also in re jose,at.argues that this conclusion determines the matter.he is in error.as we have explained,the fact that certain crimes are within the subject matter jurisdiction of a california court does not mean that a specific california court has the power to hear and determine particular charges against a specific individual.thus,the question becomes did the juvenile court or other appropriate court of california acquire the authority to determine whether violated federal immigration law 
california views this question as one concerning the separation of powers.the california constitution divides governmental powers among the legislative,executive and judicial branches.cal.const.art.iii.in the view of the supreme court of california,the legislature determines which acts shall be deemed criminal and grants the courts subject matter jurisdiction.the executive in the person of the district attorney is given discretion to determine which individuals shall be charged with offenses until charges are brought no court acquires jurisdiction over a violation of law.only once charges are filed do the courts acquire jurisdiction over the particular case.thereafter,the determination of charges is a judicial function.see manduley superior court,cal davis municipal court,cal noting that the jurisdiction of a court is invoked and a judicial proceeding initiated only when an accusatory pleading is filed.
in this case,no charges were ever brought against in any california court.consequently,no california court ever acquired jurisdiction over him,no california court ever acquired the power to determine whether had illegally crossed the border in violation of the laws of the united states.thus,the certification by the attorney was correct no california court had jurisdiction over p,who was said juvenile.
presents a number of arguments seeking to avoid this result.we briefly address those arguments.first,he argues that it is fundamental that parties may not by stipulation grant a court jurisdiction that it would not otherwise have.but is misled by ambiguities in the term jurisdiction.where the legislature has denied a court subject matter jurisdiction,the parties may not,of course,grant it by stipulation.but a plaintiff may always prevent a court from having jurisdiction over a particular civil case by determining not to file a claim and so failing to file it courts have no authority to reach out to decide cases never brought before them.similarly,a prosecutor may prevent a court from acquiring jurisdiction over a criminal matter by deciding not to file charges and so not filing them.
second,argues that this solution ignores congress preference for state responsibility for juveniles where state proceedings are available.misunderstands the law.section requires the attorney to investigate and determine whether the matter is going forward in state juvenile or other appropriate court.if so,federal authorities must step aside.the department of justice criminal resource manual implements this responsibility appropriately,directing that i n cases of concurrent jurisdiction,the appropriate local prosecutor should be briefed on the facts of the case,and a determination made as to whether is accepting or refusing prosecutorial responsibility in the matter.dep t of justice,united states attorneys manual,tit,criminal resource manual.if the prosecutor does accept prosecutorial responsibility,and the state court acquires jurisdiction,the matter remains in state court unless state charges are for some reason dismissed,the state court refuses to assert jurisdiction.see united states,cir where a state court initially assumes jurisdiction over a juvenile but later dismisses the case,it has refused to retain jurisdiction,thus satisfying.then federal prosecution may go forward.this procedure fully implements preference for federal abstention in favor of state court juvenile adjudication.see untied states sechrist,cir.
california recognizes that where there is concurrent jurisdiction between state and federal courts regarding criminal matters,the california constitution gives the prosecutor discretion to consent to the case proceeding in federal court,thus denying state courts jurisdiction.manduley,at.this permission is part of the general california rule that gives the prosecutor,as part of his charging decision,the power to control which,if any,of the available state forums will receive the case.id.
finally,objects that our interpretation makes the language or refuses to assume jurisdiction redundant.we do not agree.like the does not have jurisdiction clause,the refuses clause also applies to the juvenile court or other appropriate court of a state,not to a prosecutor,and refers to jurisdiction.see.so the refuses clause refers at least to situations in which a state court has the option not to hear a juvenile case and exercises that option,see,at whether there are other circumstances covered as well we do not decide.
in sum,we hold that the attorney can certify to the absence of state court jurisdiction under if he learns that the appropriate state prosecutor has decided not to prosecute a particular juvenile for the specific crime at issue.
ii.the speedy trial provision of the juvenile delinquency act.
also alleges a violation of the speedy trial provision of the jda,which requires trial of detained juveniles within days of the start of their detention,absent certain exceptions.we hold that there was no violation of the jda speedy trial provision because caused the delay in the start of his trial by lying about his age.
it is now established that the speedy trial clock begins to run at the commencement of federal detention of the juvenile on the federal delinquency charge.united states doe,cir en banc doe i.doe i also specifies that the detention must be on the charge of alleged delinquency,so that unrelated federal detention does not cause the clock to run before federal authorities became aware of the facts giving rise to a charge of delinquency.id.at.
the government and disagree about when the relevant federal detention began for purposes of the speedy trial clock.the government argues that the district court correctly held that the speedy trial clock only begins to run once a determination has been made that an individual is a juvenile,because it is only at that point that the juvenile becomes an alleged delinquent.contends instead that the clock begins to run from the moment federal detention begins on the underlying acts that form the basis for the juvenile delinquency charge.doe i did not address whether unrelated federal detention includes,as the government contends,detention as an adult for the same underlying act,or whether an ultimate determination that an individual is a juvenile is one of the facts giving rise to a charge of delinquency that must occur before the speedy trial clock begins to run.id.at citing united states juvenile male,cir holding that federal immigration detention prior to being charged with an act of delinquency did not start the speedy trial clock.we need not resolve these questions,however,because even if the clock began to run at the moment was first taken into custody on november,there was no violation of the act.
the jda speedy trial provision excludes from the limit delay that is caused by the juvenile or his counsel,consented to by the juvenile and his counsel,or in the interest of justice in the particular case.we have held that delays occasioned by motions of defense counsel are caused by the juvenile or his counsel.see united states.baker,cir,overruled on other grounds by united states nordby,cir.
one of our sister circuits has held that delay occasioned in part by a juvenile lying about his age is excludable as either consented to or caused by the juvenile.in united states romulus,cir,the actual date on which the juvenile was taken into federal custody was unclear,but he was brought before a magistrate judge on july,at which time he provided a false birth date and a false name.id.at.only on july,did the government determine his true name and age.id.at.the fourth circuit held that because the government was unaware that romulus was a juvenile until july,any period of time prior to july was properly excluded as delay caused by the juvenile.id.at.see also united states doe,cir excusing a delay was in the interest of justice where doe misrepresentations as to his age and identity,defense counsel tactical delay,and his extending that delay beyond days in hopes of gaining a dismissal with prejudice were the cause.
this case is slightly different from romulus,because the,agent on notice from the dhs records that might be a juvenile.still,in this case,as in romulus,created the need for proceedings to determine his juvenile status by lying about his age.thus,the time spent in determining age is excludable as delay caused by the juvenile.
applying these principles to this case,there was no jda speedy trial violation once the excludable time is removed.was arrested on november,and placed in federal custody.his trial began on january,days after he was arrested.the period from january is excludable as caused by the juvenile or his counsel,because it was brought about by the filing of motions by the defense.the period from november,when defense counsel first provided notice to the court of alleged juvenile status,to december,when defense counsel first appeared with an original copy of birth certificate and a witness from the consulate,is also excludable,as delay caused by the juvenile.the passage of time was necessary to make a determination of juvenile status,and the need for that determination resulted from his false response when first asked his date of birth 
argues that it took until december to determine that he was a juvenile only because the judge inappropriately put the burden of proof on him to show that he was a juvenile and refused to consider an uncertified birth certificate from mexico.as a result,the defense argues,no portion of the time from december,when a copy of the birth certificate was first proffered,to december,when was finally determined to be a juvenile,should be excluded.
the record shows,however,that no delay was caused by a failure correctly to apply the burden of proof.there is a paucity of cases addressing the appropriate allocation of the burdens and standard of proof in a hearing to determine juvenile status,and the statute itself is silent on the question.having reviewed the available cases from other circuits and the district courts,we are persuaded that the government bears the initial burden of proving defendant age and must offer prima facie evidence of defendant adult status.united states,d.we also conclude that,as has been suggested by the second circuit,a previous statement from the juvenile that he is an adult can constitute such prima facie evidence.see united states,cir.the burden then shifts to the defense to come forward with evidence of his juvenile status,and the government then has an opportunity to rebut with any additional information.see,d at.
here,the magistrate judge correctly applied these burdens.at the ultimate hearing on december,the court appropriately required the government to present prima facie evidence of age,and appropriately treated own previous statements as such evidence.only then did the judge require that come forward with proof to rebut that presumption.similarly,the requirement imposed by the judge at earlier hearings that come forward with evidence was simply an appropriate application of the shifting burdens.
further argues that,even if his statements constituted prima facie evidence of his adult status so as to shift the burden to the defense,the defense presented sufficient evidence of juvenile status by december,so that the time from december through december is excludable.he argues,in particular,that the copied birth certificate should have been admissible,without authentication through consular testimony.the question,however,is not the admissibility of the birth certificate but rather the weight to be accorded it.the magistrate judge was not compelled to find that the copied,unauthenticated birth certificate was sufficient to show that was a juvenile.
we conclude that the time from january through and from november through december is excludable.as a result,the government was responsible for only days of the delay in bringing to trial as a juvenile.we therefore affirm the district court refusal to dismiss the information for failure to comply with 
iii.warning,notification,and arraignment requirements of the jda.
alleges that the district court erred in failing to suppress his statements or dismiss the information despite the government failure to comply with.he argues that when an arresting officer is aware of conflicting information about an arrestee age,the officer is obligated to comply with the requirements of.the government argues,in contrast,that it is not obligated to comply with those requirements when,as happened here,the juvenile indicates that he is an adult.
we agree with that the government was obligated to comply with the requirements of the jda,but for a somewhat different reason.we conclude that under the plain language of the statute,the determinative factor in the application of is whether the arrestee is in fact a juvenile,regardless of whether he indicates that he is an adult.because was,as the district court ultimately determined,a juvenile at the time of his arrest,he was entitled to the protections of.
in interpreting a statute,we look first to its plain language.united states mohrbacher,cir quoting nw.forest res.council glickman,cir.section provides that 
whenever a juvenile is taken into custody for an alleged act of juvenile delinquency,the arresting officer shall immediately advise such juvenile of his legal rights,in language comprehensive to a juvenile,and shall immediately notify the attorney general and the juvenile parents,guardian,or custodian of such custody.the arresting officer shall also notify the parents,guardian,or custodian of the rights of the juvenile and of the nature of the alleged offense.
the juvenile shall be taken before a magistrate judge forthwith.in no event shall the juvenile be detained for longer than a reasonable period of time before being brought before a magistrate judge.
section begins w henever a juvenile is taken into custody emphasis added.on its face,then,the statute does not allow for exceptions in situations in which an officer has no reason to know of an individual juvenile status or in which the juvenile lies about his age.instead it requires that its protections be provided w henever a juvenile is taken into custody.
a comparison of to other provisions of the jda suggests that congress did not intend to contain an exception for instances in which a juvenile lies about his age.section of the jda specifically provides an exception for instances in which delay was caused by the juvenile or his counsel,while contains no such language regarding failure to provide the protections of.congress could have included similar language in,excusing compliance with the requirements of when the juvenile himself hinders the government compliance,but it did not.
nor is there any support in the language of the statute for a requirement that the protections of apply only when an arresting officer reasonably should have known that an arrestee was a juvenile.the united states code contains numerous civil and criminal provisions that are triggered only when an individual or the government reasonably should have known a particular fact.see,e a a person entitled to written notice in any civil forfeiture proceeding may file a motion to set aside a declaration of forfeiture if the g overnment knew,or reasonably should have known,of the moving party interest and failed to provide notice f b ii an exemption for certain otherwise prohibited transactions is not available if the person knew or reasonably should have known that the transaction was prohibited.had congress wished to make the protections of turn on whether the arresting officer had reason to know that an individual was a juvenile,it could have done so.the plain language of the statute thus compels the conclusion that juveniles are entitled to the protections of whenever they are taken into custody,regardless of the information available to police officers about the juvenile age.
the use of the phrase alleged act of juvenile delinquency does not change this conclusion.a juvenile by definition can only be arrested for an alleged act of juvenile delinquency the statute would be plainly inconsistent if it read w henever a juvenile is taken into custody for an alleged crime.see j uvenile delinquency is the violation of a law of the united states committed by a person prior to his eighteenth birthday which would have been a crime if committed by an adult.although a juvenile may be transferred to adult court when certain requirements are met and there convicted of a crime,such a transfer can not occur prior to arrest or arraignment.see delineating requirements and standard for transferring a juvenile to criminal prosecution.more importantly,the language of the phrase does not require that the officer realize that the arrestee is in custody for an alleged act of juvenile delinquency rather than a crime.thus,alleged act of juvenile delinquency does not introduce any ambiguity about whether an arresting officer must know that an individual is a juvenile before the statutory protections apply.
when we find the terms of a statute unambiguous,judicial inquiry is complete except in rare and exceptional circumstances.demarest manspeaker.we may only reject the application of the statute as written if it will produce a result demonstrably at odds with the intentions of its drafters.id.at quoting griffin oceanic contractors,see also middle mountain land produce,sound commodities,cir.not only is there no evidence in this case that application of the unambiguous text of the statute will lead to a result in conflict with the intentions of congress,there are a number of reasons congress might have concluded that precisely such a bright line rule is preferable.
congress did not indicate expressly in any of its reports on the jda its reason for adopting the language of.the legislative history of the jda does,however,reflect that congress meant substantially to increase the procedural safeguards available to juveniles immediately after their arrest.the jda was intended,among other things,to provide basic procedural rights for juveniles who come under federal jurisdiction and to bring federal procedures up to the standards set by various model acts,many state codes and court decisions,reprinted in.congress purpose was thus to provide for the constitutional safeguards fundamental to our system of justice.united states female juvenile,cir quoting,reprinted in at.
as this purpose suggests,the act was adopted in part in response to the supreme court decision in in re gault,in which the court emphasized that juvenile delinquency proceedings must measure up to the essentials of due process and fair treatment.id.at quoting kent united states.see also united states doe,cir the jda amendments were intended to guarantee certain basic procedural and constitutional protections to juveniles as required by gault internal quotation marks omitted.gault focused in particular on police interrogation of juveniles,noting that the greatest care must be taken to assure that any confessions obtained as a result of interrogation are not the product of ignorance of rights or of adolescent fantasy,fright or despair.at strengthening procedural protections for juveniles before and during interrogation was thus a key purpose of the act.
given this emphasis on strong procedural protections,there are several reasons congress might have believed that requiring the protections of w henever a juvenile is taken into custody is preferable to a rule allowing for exceptions based on the information provided by the juvenile.as the supreme court has repeatedly emphasized,a child is less capable than an adult of understanding the consequences and seriousness of arrest and detention.a juvenile 
is unlikely to have any conception of what will confront him when he is made accessible only to the police.that is to say,we deal with a person who is not equal to the police in knowledge and understanding of the consequences of the questions and answers being recorded and who is unable to know how to protect his own interests or how to get the benefits of his constitutional rights.
gallegos colorado,see bellotti.baird,noting that minors often lack the experience,perspective,and judgment to recognize and avoid choices that could be detrimental to them.the likelihood that juveniles will not appreciate the significance of detention underlies this circuit conclusion that a juvenile can not waive the protections of the jda.see united states juvenile,cir holding that the statute does not permit the juvenile to waive notification see also united states,cir noting,because the issue is likely to recur,that it is highly doubtful that a juvenile can waive consular notification.congress could have believed that a juvenile should also not be able to waive the jda interrogation protections by lying about his age.the very premise of the jda,indeed,is that juveniles will often make the choice to appear to be adults when they are are not in their own interest.
congress might also have concluded that the practical consequences of a rule that permits of no exceptions are more desirable than the consequences of,for example,a rule that would require courts to determine what information was available to the arresting officer.the strict rule adopted by congress should,as a practical matter,induce arresting officers initially to treat an arrestee as a juvenile if there is some basis for doing example,the arrestee appearance,information about past arrests,or some other indication.the rule builds in the likelihood that arresting officers will evaluate all the available information and,when in doubt,treat the arrestee as a juvenile.the result would be a de facto reasonable knowledge rule,while at the same time avoiding difficult judicial line drawing concerning whether or not a sufficient quantity of evidence existed to trigger juvenile protections.
finally,congress may have concluded that compliance with the requirements of is an effective way to determine quickly whether an individual is in fact a juvenile.prompt notification of an individual parents and,if relevant,the consulate should immediately reveal information confirming or refuting the individual juvenile status.and bringing the individual before a magistrate judge promptly will allow the judge to make a determination as to juvenile status as quickly as possible.here,several hearings and the speedy trial dispute might well have been avoided had the arresting officers,faced with conflicting information as to age,informed his mother or the mexican consulate of his arrest.
our discussion of the legislative history and identification of sensible justifications for the statute clearly stated rule shows that this is not one of those rare cases when application of the plain language of the statute is demonstrably at odds with the intentions of its drafters.see demarest,at.there is no evidence in the legislative history that congress did not intend the protections of to apply w henever a juvenile is taken into custody,nor is the result of application of the statute unambiguous text so bizarre that congress could not have intended it.id.at internal quotation marks omitted 
for the foregoing reasons,we conclude that juveniles must be provided with the protections of w henever they are taken into custody,regardless of the evidence available to officers at the time of arrest about the individual age.as was a juvenile at the time of his arrest,he was entitled to the protections of of the jda.we therefore proceed to the question whether was violated.

in analyzing a claim under,we must first address whether the government violated the requirements of,at quoting united states doe,cir doe ii.the government bears the burden of showing compliance with.united states,cir.if was violated,we have generally then turned to the question whether the government conduct was so egregious as to deprive the juvenile of his right to due process of law,at quoting doe ii,at.if the government conduct denied the juvenile due process,then the conviction must be reversed.united states wendy,cir if we do not reverse based on a due process violation,we consider whether the violation was harmless to the juvenile beyond a reasonable doubt,at quoting doe ii,at quotation marks and alteration omitted if the violation did prejudice the defendant,we have discretion to reverse the conviction or order other more limited remedies so as to ensure that the prophylactic safeguard for juveniles not be eroded or neglected.wendy,at quoting.
section contains several distinct requirements.first,officers must immediately inform the arrested juvenile of his rights,in language that is comprehensible to him.second,officers must immediately contact the parents of the arrested juvenile and inform them of the juvenile rights and custodial status,and of the nature of his alleged offense.id.in the case of an alien juvenile whose parents live outside the united states,if it proves impossible to contact the juvenile parents with reasonable efforts,the consulate of his home country may instead be contacted,at.third,the juvenile must be brought before a magistrate judge forthwith and i n no event shall the juvenile be detained for longer than a reasonable period of time before being brought before a magistrate judge.
the government has not contended,either before the district court or on appeal,that it provided any of the protections of,instead maintaining throughout that was not entitled to any such protections.in particular,the government has not contested assertion,in his opening brief on appeal,that there is no factual dispute that none of the procedures outlined in the jda were followed after was placed in custody.given legal and factual representations and the absence of any opposing government argument that was complied with if it applies,we conclude that the provisions of were violated see united states,cir holding that government waived an alternative argument when it did not raise it in its response brief or before the district court.
having determined that was violated in every respect,we turn to the issue of prejudice.this circuit has adopted a test for determining prejudice,at.we must first assess whether any of the violations of the jda were a cause of statement to agent salazar.id.if so,the second step is to determine whether was prejudiced by his statement.id.whether violations of contributed to a juvenile confession is a factual question to be explored on remand.doe ii,at.a juvenile not provided any of the protections of experiences isolation from family,friends,and representatives of his country,confusion as to his rights,and a lengthy delay before being taken before a magistrate judge.see,at see also,at quoting doe ii,at.the protections of were formulated on the assumption that failure to provide them is likely to lead to coercive interrogations of juveniles,so the burden is on the government to show lack of causation when every provision of was violated.see,united states lopez,cir the burden of proving a constitutional error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt rests upon the government.united states,cir holding that it is the government burden to show the harmlessness of the error where the district court committed nonconstitutional evidentiary error.the district court on remand will need to determine whether the government can meet that burden in this case.
we remand to the district court,because we are not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the confession,if caused by the violation of the jda,was harmless.in assessing harmlessness,we must be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the government misconduct did not give rise to any prejudice,at citing wendy,at.a defendant is prejudiced by his confession if his statements are a major part of the proof of the crime at trial,at holding that there was prejudice when the confession was the primary basis of evidence on which defendant was convicted doe iv,f d at holding there was prejudice where the statement was the sole source of proof of his knowledge of the drugs.
