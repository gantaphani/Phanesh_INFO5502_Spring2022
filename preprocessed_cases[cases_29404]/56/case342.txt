facts and proceedings 
the infant minor was removed from parental custody and adjudged a dependent child in.mother claimed indian heritage and the minor was enrolled as a member of the tribe of burney california.mother failed to reunify after months of services and in may,the court set a selection and implementation hearing to choose a permanent plan for the minor.the department recommended termination of parental rights and a permanent plan of adoption.
prior to the selection and implementation hearing,mother filed a petition for modification seeking reinstatement of reunification services.after a hearing on the petition in december,the court denied the request for services believing it lacked authority to order services past the statutory month time limit,subd.a.at the selection and implementation hearing in january,the court found guardianship was in the minor best interests based on evidence that termination of parental rights would result in the minor losing his membership in the tribe if not adopted by a tribal member.the court wanted the tribe to consider tca.
mother appealed the denial of her petition for modification.this court reversed the denial and the order terminating parental rights and remanded the case for a new hearing on the petition for modification.
while the appeal was pending,a review report in july stated the tribal representative told the social worker the tribe had taken no action on tca,preferring guardianship as a permanent plan for the minor.the caretaker information form detailed the caretakers efforts to maintain the minor connection to his tribe and to native american cultural practices in general,including finding a mentor from the minor tribe who taught the minor songs and drumming.the form also stated that the minor was somewhat resistant to attending visits with mother and slept for several hours following each visit.the caretakers wanted to adopt the minor to provide him emotional stability.at the review hearing,the court again set a selection and implementation hearing and expressed concerns about whether adoption would affect the minor status as a tribal member.
in august,mother filed a second petition for modification seeking return of the minor with family maintenance services or renewed reunification services with increased visitation.she alleged the modification would be in the minor best interests because he was bonded to her and his sibling and needed interaction with his specific band of the tribe.various documents were attached to the petition to demonstrate mother ongoing sobriety and progress in relapse prevention.additional documentation,including letters from the sacramento native american health center regarding mother relapse prevention efforts,her home visitations to improve parenting and her participation in cultural events was subsequently provided.
the report for the selection and implementation hearing concluded the minor was adoptable and recommended termination of parental rights with adoption by the current caretakers.mother regularly attended supervised visitation and visits were generally appropriate.
an assessment from the california department of social services cdss stated that the minor was placed in a native american certified foster home under legal guardianship.the guardians wished to adopt the minor.the minor was described as a healthy,happy,loving and social child who was well bonded to his guardians.the guardians each had formal education in native american studies.they were committed to supporting his cultural connection to his tribe,had taken him to native american events for the past three years and had a mentor for the minor from his own tribe.cdss strongly recommended adoption as the permanent plan for the minor.
the icwa expert,sean osborn,submitted a declaration stating that he had reviewed a letter from the tribal chairperson which stated that if the minor were adopted he would not lose his status as a member of the tribe.osborn described the minor placement and attachment to his caretakers.he noted tca had been proposed at one point by the tribal representative but no action to bring the permanent plan to fruition had occurred and it was no longer a viable alternative.based upon his review of the reports and statements from the social worker,osborn concluded that the minor would be at risk of serious emotional or physical damage if returned to mother care,in part due to the potential for relapse if mother had the additional stress of caring for the minor as well as the sibling she currently had in her care.he stated that it was in the minor best interests to be adopted by his current caretakers and it would be emotionally traumatic for him to be removed from their care.
an updated caretaker information form stated that recent visits between the minor and mother had gone well,although the minor was somewhat withdrawn prior to visits and always fell into a deep sleep following visits.the caretakers continued to be committed to development of the minor native american heritage both generally and as a member of the tribe.although some attempt had been made to contact the representative of the minor specific band within the tribe,there appeared to be some tension which led to the caretakers feeling unwelcome to bring the minor to visit the reservation.however,they intended to take the minor when he was older and better able to participate in events.
a psychological report by siggins in february assessed the quality of the bond between the minor and his caretakers.in addition to reviewing records in the case,the psychologist also observed the caretakers and the minor interact in their home.he opined that the minor was in the third state of bonding with the caretakers and creating the foundation for his own moral development.he concluded that any significant disturbance in the bond was not in the minor best interest and would likely result in a detriment to the minor sound psychological and social development.
the tribe requested an assessment by a clinical psychologist,martinez,who addressed the specific question of whether the minor would be harmed by a return to mother care.martinez found no evidence of serious harm to the minor if returned to mother and no indication that continued custody by her would likely result in serious emotional or physical harm to the child.he recommended a renewal of reunification services with an increase in visits and less supervision.
the hearing on the petition for modification began in march.martinez testified in accordance with his report.he said mother should be offered additional services and that currently there were no conditions endemic to mother or her home which would provide a risk of serious harm to the minor.he did not evaluate what would be in the best interests of the minor because he was only asked to address the recommendations for a permanent plan for the minor.accordingly,he did not evaluate either the minor or the minor interaction with mother and had no opinion on whether it was in the minor best interest to return to mother.because of the limitations on martinez report,the court did not accept his report as evidence on the petition for modification.
mother testified about her current circumstances,including her ongoing therapy,bible studies,participation in step and recovery groups,home health parenting and native american activities.mother also testified about her current stability and ongoing care of the minor sibling who was placed with her.she believed that it was in the minor best interests to be with family because he belonged with her and she had changed.mother felt that they deserved a chance to be together and was concerned he was not participating in tribal activities.she acknowledged that she had not participated in pit river tribal activities in two years but had attended more general native american activities.
siggins also testified in accordance with his report.after observing the minor in the caretaker home,he concluded the minor was securely attached to the caretakers,the bonds were strong and removal and returning the minor to mother would be devastating to the minor and result in serious emotional harm to him.in his opinion,there would be both an immediate and a future impact on the minor if removed from the current caretakers.observing visits would not change his opinion as he assumed the minor reaction to mother in visits would be positive due to his secure attachment to his caretakers.
the social worker testified mother had monthly visits.visits were generally good and the minor was happy to see his mother and sibling but was usually ready for the visits to end.the social worker was informed that the minor visits with the state adoptions worker were similar to those with mother and the minor was also happy to see the adoptions worker.the social worker had reports that the minor was subdued before visits and,after visits with mother,was very tired and slept in the car on the way home,sometimes waking up screaming.in the social worker opinion,it was in the minor best interests to remain with the current caretakers rather than have further reunification efforts with mother.
one of the caretakers testified,describing the minor behavior before visits as subdued and stating that after visits the minor would sleep up to four hours.she further testified that native american heritage was a great part of the caretakers lives because of their professions as academics in native american studies and having lived on the navajo reservation.they attended numerous local and regional events.they traveled widely to other indigenous communities and the minor went with them.they worked with people about attending intertribal events and had strong relationships with a nearby wintun tribe.the minor had attended several events in the feather river and colusa area.one of their friends was a member of the tribe,although in a different band from the minor,and has acted as a mentor for the minor involving him in songs and drumming.the caretakers had not felt welcome to take the minor to the tribal area but hoped that when the minor status was resolved they would be able to take him there for events.she believed that the minor best interests would be best served by remaining in their home and that removal would have a detrimental impact on him.
after reviewing the exhibits and hearing argument,the court found mother circumstances had changed since december in that she had made significant progress in resolving her various issues.recognizing the significance of the minor indian heritage,the court also considered that the minor had been in the current placement since october and the testimony regarding best interest of the minor presented by siggins,the social worker and the minor caretaker and concluded that it was not in the minor best interest to grant the petition for modification.
the court moved on to the selection and implementation hearing.the indian expert testified the minor current placement was appropriate under icwa.the expert also testified that the minor would be at risk of serious emotional and physical harm if returned to parental custody because the father did not complete services and,while mother now had the sibling placed with her,given mother earlier difficulties,placement of a second child would increase the stress on mother and place the minor at risk of harm.in his experience,adding another child to the home of an parent who has stabilized leads to failure of the placement.moreover,it would be traumatic to the minor to lose his relationship with the current caretakers.the expert opinion was unaffected by mother recent stability and positive visits.because adoption would not sever the minor connection to the tribe,the expert believed adoption was the most appropriate plan for the minor even though the tribe did not want mother parental rights terminated.the expert testified that,at this stage of the minor development,taking the minor to some native american events and exposing him to cultural practices and celebrations would be an appropriate level of connection to the tribe.his current caretakers also would provide him with multiple perspectives on other tribal ways which would ultimately benefit him.
ward,the councilperson for the madesi band of the tribe and a cousin of mother,testified that the tribe preferred not to have its members adopted and that tca was a better alternative than traditional adoption.he was aware that the tribe was given an opportunity to work on tca when the guardianship was granted.contrary to the tribe letter,ward believed that,if adopted,the minor would no longer be a part of the tribe.the tribe preference was for the minor to be returned to mother.ward stated that he had invited the caretakers to come to the tribal lands and he would show them around.he denied discouraging them from coming.
in its ruling,the court commented that it had initially ordered a plan of guardianship to allow for a tca which did not occur.the court found the minor was adoptable.the court further found the benefit exception was not established because,despite regular visitation for the last months,the minor would not benefit from continued contact with mother based on evidence that he continued to be impacted by visits,as evidenced by his demeanor before visits and sleeping for hours after.the court considered the indian child exception,finding that termination of parental rights would not interfere with his membership rights.the court noted that,while mother valued her indian heritage,she had not attended tribal events,only more general native american events,not unlike those the caretakers had attended with the minor.moreover,the minor had a mentor from his tribe,albeit a different band within the tribe,and this constituted an effort to keep the minor in touch with his heritage.the court accepted the testimony that the caretakers were welcome to visit tribal lands,thus,there would not be a substantial interference with his connection with either the tribe or his particular band.the court recognized that the tribe had identified guardianship as the preferred permanent plan,but that plan was appropriate only as a transition to tca which never occurred.the court found active efforts to take into account the minor social and cultural values and way of life in the minor tribe and,based on siggins testimony and report that returning the minor to mother custody would result in serious emotional or physical damage to the minor,adopted modified findings and orders terminating parental rights and selecting adoption as the permanent plan.
discussion 
tribal customary adoption 
the tribe raises several issues relating to the tca process.we shall briefly describe the process as it is set forth in the relevant statutes.
tca is an alternative to a standard adoption and protects both the tribe and the child interests in maintaining tribal membership by formalizing an adoption by an individual selected by the tribe without terminating parental rights.section sets forth the procedures to institute a tca.first,the assessment report for the selection and implementation hearing must address the tca option,subd.i h,subd.b.if the tribe decides that tca is the appropriate alternative,the tribe or its designee conducts a home study prior to approval of the tca placement including a check of the child abuse central index and a state and federal criminal background check,subd.c.this assessment and the tca order from the tribe should be completed prior to the selection and implementation hearing and the tca order should be filed with the court prior to the selection and implementat
