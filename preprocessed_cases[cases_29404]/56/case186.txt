in this case,three children were removed from the custody of their mother,petitioner,sara hereafter mother,on grounds that she had failed to protect them and they had suffered serious emotional damage.welf,subds.b,c.the juvenile court declared them dependents of the court and began reunification services to try to reunite the family.after six months of reunification services,the court found that mother had failed to contact or visit the children,subd.e.under section,subdivision e,and california rules of court,rule f b it terminated reunification services and scheduled a hearing to establish a permanent plan for the children.see.
in this writ proceeding,mother contends that section,subdivision e,does not permit a court to terminate reunification services after only six months due to a parent failure to contact or visit a child,unless the child had originally been removed from the parent custody because of abandonment.because she did not originally abandon the children,she argues,she is entitled to a full year of reunification services before the court may begin to consider a permanent plan.she also argues that rule f b is invalid because it is contrary to the statute.the court of appeal agreed with her.
section can be read as mother and the court of appeal in this case read it.but it can also be read differently.previous court of appeal decisions,as well as the judicial council in adopting rule f b,have long interpreted section,subdivision e,as permitting a court to terminate reunification services whenever a parent fails to contact or visit a child for six months after those services commenced.if this were a matter of first impression,the question would be close,but we are not writing on a clean slate.at this late date,we will not overturn the earlier appellate court decisions and the applicable rule of court.
mother also claims her failure to contact or visit her children during this time was excusable because the tuolumne county department of social services hereafter department effectively prevented her from visiting them.as we explain,we disagree.
factual and procedural history 
in november,the department filed juvenile dependency petitions on behalf of mother three children,who were four,seven,and eight years old at the time,under section,subdivisions b failure to protect and c serious emotional damage.the petitions alleged,among other things,that mother failed to provide the children with adequate food,clothing,and shelter,and that she was unable to provide regular care for her children due to her substance abuse involving crack cocaine and methamphetamine.the juvenile court detained the children.on december,it conducted the initial jurisdictional hearing.mother appeared at that hearing,and the court ordered her to participate in a drug dependency program.the court set a contested jurisdictional hearing for december.
mother failed to appear at the december hearing,and her attorney did not know where she was.the juvenile court found it had dependency jurisdiction under section,subdivisions b and c.it ordered reunification services,including visitation as deemed appropriate by the case managing social worker pursuant to section,subdivision a,and scheduled a review hearing.it also ordered mother to review,sign,and comply with the family reunification plan.on january,mother appeared before the juvenile court sitting as the drug dependency court.she said that she had not received notice of the previous hearing by mail until after it was conducted,but she also acknowledged that the court had informed her of the hearing date when she appeared in court on december.at the january hearing,the court ordered her to sign and comply with the family reunification case plan.she signed the plan.it required mother,among other things,to stay free from illegal drugs,to show her ability to live free from drug dependency,and to comply with all required drug tests.it conditioned her right to visit the children on her not being under the influence of alcohol or drugs and not ingesting alcohol or drugs before the visit.
over the next six months,mother failed to comply with her drug dependency treatment and reunification plans.according to the department review report prepared in june,the only time she visited her children was on january.at that time,she had a faint negative test for methamphetamine on a presumptive test and was permitted to visit.during that visit,mother reportedly acted inappropriately and challenged the visitation rules.consequently,the visit ended early,and the department discontinued further visits until mother agreed to abide by the visitation rules.mother failed to appear at a court hearing on february,and the court issued a bench warrant.at a hearing on april,at which mother again did not appear,the court ordered her terminated from the dependency drug court program because she failed to participate or appear in hearings before that court.
on may,mother asked the department for permission to visit her children.however,she admitted she was under the influence of methamphetamine and marijuana,and she declined to take a urinalysis test.the social worker denied visitation and told her that she must test clean on presumptive tests to have visits rescheduled.except for a voice mail message mother left the department a few days later stating that she had not yet decided what to do and would call again later,mother had no further contact with the department before the next court hearing on june.
mother appeared at the review hearing on june.the court told mother that it had ordered you to do certain things,you have done it.there has been any contact,you not going to groups,you not testing.it told her she had a couple of weeks to fall in line and start doing what you need to do if you do,then the court going to terminate reunification services.it scheduled another hearing for july,and told mother to get over to your social worker and get with this program.
a contested hearing was held on july,and then continued to july.a supplemental report the department provided for the july hearing stated that on june,mother provided a random substance abuse test that was positive for methamphetamine.she was arrested that day for driving under the influence.she failed to take any scheduled substance abuse tests after june.she was arrested on june for possession of a controlled substance and drug paraphernalia,although she denied that the drugs and paraphernalia were hers.on july,the social worker called mother and asked why she had not complied with the court directives.mother said after her arrest she was unable to comply.she asked to visit her children and was told she had to comply with the case plan and not be under the influence of methamphetamine for a visit to occur.
the department recommended the court terminate reunification services under section,subdivision e,and schedule a hearing to establish a permanent plan.it also recommended the court make certain statutory findings to support these actions.the report indicated that the youngest child grandmother wished to adopt him,and that the other two children might be placed with a grandfather.
mother testified at the july hearing.she admitted that she had signed the reunification case plan,but she said she did not fully understand it.she said she attended about three group meetings,but then her car had broken down and stuff like that,so i failed to go to any more.she said that if the court permitted her to participate in reunification services for the next six months,she was hoping that she could comply with the court orders.she hoped to be placed in a rehabilitation program of some kind.accordingly,she asked for six more months of reunification services.she said that on may,when she asked to visit her children,she declined to take a drug test because i told the social worker i was dirty for marijuana at the time.after her arrest for driving under the influence,she had no further drug testing.
at the end of the july hearing,the court terminated reunification services and scheduled a hearing on november to establish a permanent plan.it told mother that in june it had given her another chance,perhaps to get into ddc dependency drug court,to give the court a reason to extend reunification services.it noted the difficulty of balancing the time it takes for someone to actually get clean and sober and build some sort of a foundation so they can stay that way,versus what in the best interests of the children and that the children be placed in an appropriate supportive living environment,a safe living environment.they just do always mesh.it said it had no reasonable belief that the child will be returned to mother in the next six months.it also made the findings the department report recommended,including finding by clear and convincing evidence that there had been no contact between mother and the children in the last six months.in the meantime,the court ordered that the youngest child be placed with his grandmother and the other two with their grandfather.
mother filed the instant writ petition challenging the order terminating reunification services.the court of appeal granted the petition.it directed the superior court to conduct a new review hearing and to reinstate reunification services for an additional six months.we granted the department petition for review.
ii.discussion 
interpretation of section,subdivision e 
california has a comprehensive statutory scheme establishing procedures for the juvenile court to follow when and after a child is removed from the home for the child welfare.et citation.the objective of the dependency scheme is to protect abused or neglected children and those at substantial risk thereof and to provide permanent,stable homes if those children can not be returned home within a prescribed period of time.citation.when the child is removed from the home,the court first attempts,for a specified period of time,to reunify the family.in re celine cal th,d.if,after the specified time period has expired,the efforts to reunify the family have failed,the court must terminate reunification efforts and set the matter for a hearing pursuant to section for the selection and implementation of a permanent plan,subd.g.ibid.the hearing under section is called a permanency planning hearing.in re celine,supra,at,d.
in this case,the court terminated reunification efforts and scheduled a permanency planning hearing.the permanency planning hearing does not necessarily result in a loss of parental rights,but it very often does.in re celine,supra,cal th at,d.accordingly,terminating reunification services and setting the matter for a permanency planning hearing has potentially serious consequences for a parent.
the issue here is whether the specified period of time in which the court must provide reunification services had expired before the court set the permanency planning hearing.mother contends she was entitled to an additional six months of services.this is a question of statutory interpretation.generally,subject to certain exceptions not relevant here that can extend the time period,if,as here,the child is over three years of age when removed from the home,the reunification period shall not exceed months,subd.a.the court is also required to review the status of the child at least once every six months after the initial dispositional hearing until the matter is finally resolved,subd.a.the initial review hearing in this case was the one begun on june,then continued to july and finally to july.
section,subdivision e,governs this initial review hearing.the fifth paragraph of that subdivision is critical here and gives rise to the present legal dispute.it provides if the child was removed initially under subdivision g of section and the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the whereabouts of the parent are still unknown,or the parent has failed to contact and visit the child,the court may schedule a hearing pursuant to section within days.if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the parent has been convicted of a felony indicating parental unfitness,the court may schedule a hearing pursuant to section within days.
this paragraph was interpreted in in re monique th,d monique.in that case,the child was initially removed from the mother under subdivision b,but not subdivision g,of section.the mother,like mother here,argued that section,subdivision e,permitted the court to terminate reunification services after six months of no parental contact only for those children initially removed under subdivision g the parent whereabouts are unknown.monique,supra,at,d.the court disagreed we interpret the legislature placement of the comma after the word unknown to create an additional ground for setting the section hearing,where the parent has failed to contact and visit the child,regardless of the initial grounds for removal.monique,supra,at,d.
the court found support for its interpretation in former rule f a.monique,supra,th at,d.the relevant subdivision of the rule has been renumbered,but it is still substantially identical to the rule cited in monique today,as relevant,it provides that the court may set the permanency planning hearing at the initial review hearing if a the child was removed under section g and the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the parent whereabouts are still unknown or b the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the parent has not had contact with the child for six months or c the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the parent has been convicted of a felony indicating parental unfitness rule f.
the monique court noted that the r ules relating to the juvenile court are designed to implement the purposes of the juvenile court law by promoting uniformity in practice and procedure and by providing guidance to judges,referees,attorneys and others participating in the juvenile court.rule b.insofar as these rules are substantially the same as existing statutory provisions relating to the same subject matter,these rules shall be construed as restatements of those statutes insofar as these rules may add to existing statutory provisions relating to the same subject matter,these rules shall be construed so as to implement the purposes of the juvenile court law.rule c.we conclude rule f a restates section,subdivision e,providing three discrete grounds for setting a selection and implementation hearing after six months.monique,supra,th at,d.the court found its interpretation allowing the selection and implementation hearing to be set after six months of a parent failure to contact and visit a child is consistent with the intent of the dependency scheme to provide stability for abused,neglected and exploited minors.there is no purpose served in continuing to offer services where a parent,absent extenuating circumstances,makes no effort to reach out to his or her child for six months in the dependency process.id.at,d.
the monique opinion was followed,albeit without independent analysis,in in re tameka th,d,and cited with approval in dicta in in re david th,footnote,d.
the court of appeal in this case disagreed with monique s.it concluded that the legislature tied parental failure to visit or contact the child with a prior adjudication of abandonment.we believe our interpretation is sound both structurally and logically.for example,if we read the phrase or the parent has failed to contact and visit the child as standing apart from a previous adjudication under section,subdivision g,it would then also stand apart from the requirement of a finding under clear and convincing evidence,a result which makes no sense.furthermore,it is not reasonable to assume the legislature meant that a failure to contact and visit the child alone is an independent ground for advancing directly to the section hearing when it carefully enumerated a second ground,conviction of a felony indicating parental unfitness,in a separate sentence and indicated that finding must be made by clear and convincing evidence.therefore,we interpret section,subdivision e as establishing only two situations where the court can schedule a section hearing at the review when the child has been removed under section,subdivision g and the court finds by clear and convincing evidence the whereabouts of the parent is still unknown or the parent has failed to contact and visit the child or when the court finds by clear and convincing evidence the parent been convicted of a felony indicating parental unfitness.either of these circumstances reasonably justifies accelerating the section hearing.
although the statute can be read as the court of appeal did here,over years have passed since rule was promulgated,and years have passed since monique interpreted the statute.for several reasons,we conclude that we should not abruptly change the rule and this interpretation.rule f is unambiguous.the judicial council adopted the rule pursuant to its constitutional and statutory authority to adopt rules for court administration,practice,and procedure,not inconsistent with statute.rule b.the legislature has specifically directed the judicial council to establish rules governing practice and procedure in the juvenile court not inconsistent with law.the rules have the force of statute to the extent that they are not inconsistent with legislative enactments and constitutional provisions.in re richard cal d,d.
ultimately,the interpretation of a statute is a legal question for the courts to decide,and an administrative agency interpretation is not binding.reno baird cal th,d.certainly the judicial council interpretation of a statute,as reflected in the rules of court,is not binding on the courts,and we will invalidate a rule if it is contrary to statute.people hall cal th,d.but we have also said that when a statute is susceptible of more than one interpretation,we will consider an administrative interpretation of the statute that is reasonably contemporaneous with its adoption.robinson fair employment housing com.cal th,d.consistent administrative construction of a statute over many years,particularly when it originated with those charged with putting the statutory machinery into effect,is entitled to great weight and will not be overturned unless clearly erroneous.see also tidewater marine western,bradshaw cal th,d.
courts have given similar deference to rules of court that the judicial council has promulgated.in adams commission on judicial performance cal th,d,we considered a constitutional provision that was construed in a rule of court.we said that past or contemporaneous interpretation by an administrative entity of a constitutional provision it is charged with implementing,is accorded considerable weight citation,and courts generally will not depart from such construction unless it is clearly erroneous or unauthorized.citations.the judicial council,as an independent agency charged with a specialized and focused task of promulgating rules,is the entity presumably equipped or informed by experience to perform such task,and whose findings warrant deferential treatment by the court.id.at,d,see also leydon alexander d.imports malloy d.judicial council interpretation of the statutory term the time of the trial is consequently to be accorded the benefit of the familiar rule that the contemporaneous construction of a statute by an administrative agency charged with its enforcement is entitled to great weight unless it is clearly erroneous or unauthorized.
in yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th,d,yamaha,we considered in detail how much weight courts should give to administrative rules.we recognized the existence of two distinct categories of rules and interpretive.rules are those that the agency promulgates as part of the lawmaking power the legislature has delegated to it.judicial review of these rules is very limited.id.at,d.rules that interpret a statute receive less judicial deference.unlike rules,an agency interpretation does not implicate the exercise of a delegated lawmaking power instead,it represents the agency view of the statute legal meaning and effect,questions lying within the constitutional domain of the courts.but because the agency will often be interpreting a statute within its administrative jurisdiction,it may possess special familiarity with satellite legal and regulatory issues.it is this expertise,expressed as an interpretation,that is the source of the presumptive value of the agency views.an important corollary of agency interpretations,however,is their diminished power to bind.because an interpretation is an agency legal opinion,however expert,rather than the exercise of a delegated legislative power to make law,it commands a commensurably lesser degree of judicial deference.id.at,d.
the rules of court that the judicial council adopts can fall into either category some rules are genuine lawmaking and some are interpretive.the rule at issue here rule f falls within the second category it effectively interprets section,subdivision e.so this rule is entitled to a lesser degree of judicial deference than a rule that comes within the agency delegated legislative power to make law.but it is still entitled to some deference.in such a case,the judiciary,although taking ultimate responsibility for the construction of the statute,accords great weight and respect to the administrative construction.yamaha,supra,cal th at,d.how much weight to give such a rule is situational and depends on a number of factors.ibid.factors to consider are whether the administrative interpretation is contained in a regulation adopted after public notice and comment rather than one contained in an advice letter prepared by a single staff member whether the interpretation is and has been consistently maintained and whether the interpretation was contemporaneous with the legislative enactment of the statute being interpreted.id.at,d.if an agency has adopted an interpretative rule in accordance with administrative procedure act include procedures,notice to the public of the proposed rule and opportunity for public comment that enhance the accuracy and reliability of the resulting administrative product that circumstance weighs in favor of judicial deference.ibid.
the judicial council membership consists of appellate and trial judges,as well as others cal,art.vi,subd.a,so it is uniquely situated to implement the legislative policy.people wright cal d.it is charged,by both constitution and statute,with adopting rules of court.cal,art.vi,subd.d see people hall,supra,cal th at,d.moreover,although the judicial council is not subject to the administrative procedure act apa because it is an agency in the judicial branch of state government,subd.a,its process for promulgating rules includes procedures similar to those of the apa that enhance the final product reliability.these procedures include internal review as well as notice to the public and an opportunity for public comment whenever the proposed rule is other than a minor or technical change.see cal.rules of court,tit,jud.admin.rules,rules c.the judicial counsel also has standing advisory committees that advise it in areas of each committee expertise.these standing committees are directed to act in the best interests of the public and the entire court system,rule a.among the standing advisory committees is one on family and juvenile law,which is required to have members with a wide variety of experience and perspectives,rule.
rule was adopted contemporaneously with section,subdivision e,and its interpretation has never changed.it was subjected to public comment and internal review.see judicial council of,admin.off.of,mem.to superior court com.of jud.council re proposed revisions to juvenile court rules may.the judicial council advisory committee on juvenile court law considered these comments and the proposed juvenile court rules,and ultimately recommended adoption of the rules,including rule.that advisory committee had members,including appellate and juvenile court judges,a wide variety of public and private attorneys practicing juvenile court law and representing varying constituencies,and others involved in the juvenile court system.judicial council of,ann.
all of these circumstances support the conclusion that the formal rules the judicial council adopts that interpret a statute,including rule,are entitled to a measure of judicial deference.accordingly,rule interpretation of section,subdivision e,although not binding on the courts and invalid if contrary to statute,is entitled to great weight and will be overturned only if it is clearly erroneous.adams commission on judicial performance,supra,cal th at,d,robinson fair employment housing,supra,cal th at,d.we emphasize that this is merely deference,not abdication.statutory construction remains ultimately a matter for the courts 
another circumstance weighing against overturning rule f and monique,supra,th,d,is legislative acquiescence.the legislature has amended section,as well as other closely related dependency statutes,at least once,sometimes more than once,sometimes in response to judicial rulings,virtually every year since the judicial council adopted rule and the court of appeal decided monique see historical and statutory notes,west ann.welf.ed.foll,and id.supp.renee superior court th,d maribel superior court th,d.the legislature has been very active in this area of the law and has carefully watched judicial interpretations of these statutes.but during all this time,it has left untouched rule and monique s.it has not substantially changed the paragraph from section,subdivision e,that is at issue since its original enactment.see stats,ch.
this is not just a matter of legislative inattention,which is often of little significance.in communications,los angeles cellular telephone cal th,d,we refused to overrule previous court of appeal interpretations of a statute for similar reasons.during that time in the course of judicial interpretation,the legislature has amended california statutes regulating competition numerous times,sometimes to overrule judicial interpretations.citation.but it has left this rule intact.legislative inaction is often not a convincing reason to refuse to change a statutory interpretation.citation.under the circumstances here,however,including the longevity of the rule and the unanimity of the decisions stating it,we believe it is up to the legislature to change it if it is to be changed.id.at,d.
here,not only has the legislature failed to overturn a judicial interpretation,it has failed to overturn a rule of court rule that the judicial council promulgated at the legislature direction.see.because the legislature has specifically directed the judicial council to promulgate these rules,we can presume it was aware of the administrative interpretation,which makes its acquiescence all the more significant.see yamaha,supra,cal th at,d,conc.opn.of mosk,and cases cited robinson fair employment housing,supra,cal th at,fn,d,because the legislature authorized the fehc to establish the system of publication in which precedential decisions are printed citations the legislature now is presumed to be aware of the two administrative decisions on which the court of appeal relied,and thus has reason to be aware of the construction the agency placed on its own regulation.
moreover,we agree with the court in monique,supra,th at pages,d,that its interpretation of the statute is consistent with the overall legislative intent behind the statutory balance efforts to reunify the family with the child need for stability.the parent interest in having an opportunity to reunify with the child is balanced against the child need for a stable,permanent home.the parent is given a reasonable period of time to reunify and,if unsuccessful,the child interest in permanency and stability takes priority.in re marilyn cal th,d.it makes sense for the legislature to permit the court to set the permanency planning hearing if the parent has not contacted or visited the child for six months.childhood does not wait for the parent to become adequate.id.at,d.
mother and the court of appeal claim the legislative history supports their interpretation of the statute.the court of appeal stated that any doubt that remains is readily clarified by express legislative intent.section,subdivision e was enacted in as part of senate bill reg.sess,a bill intended to establish a new structure for making permanency decisions.with respect to the review,the senate committee on judiciary stated the new structure would allow a case to go directly from the month review to a permanency planning hearing if the child had been abandoned or the parent was convicted of a felony which indicated parental unfitness.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill,as amended.
we do not believe that this legislative analysis supports mother position.the report is fully consistent with rule f and monique contrary to mother argument,the report does not show that the legislature intended to require that additional technical requirements for abandonment stated in different statutes be met,former,subd.a,now.the author of the report may simply have considered allowing six months to pass without contacting or visiting a child to constitute a form of abandonment.a commentary noted that rule f and monique do not require that the original jurisdictional finding be made under section,subdivision g,before the court may terminate services due to the parent failure to contact and visit the child.as explained,this rule recognizes that a parent can abandon a child whether that parent whereabouts is known or unknown.either way,the effect on the child is the same.seiser et,cal.juvenile courts practice and procedure ed.c,see also cal.judges benchguides,juvenile and family court procedures,benchguide,juvenile dependency review hearings cjer,a court may set a section hearing at this stage the review hearing when the parent has failed to contact and visit the child there is nothing to be gained in continuing to offer services when a parent makes no effort to reunify with the child for six months and there are no extenuating circumstances,citing in re monique,supra,th,d.
mother also argues the statute would violate due process if it were interpreted to permit the finding that the parent had failed to contact and visit the child to be based on some lesser showing than clear and convincing evidence.however,rule f b indicates that the court must make this finding by clear and convincing evidence.
for these reasons,we reaffirm the administrative and judicial construction of section,subdivision e,as permitting the court to terminate reunification services and set the matter for a permanency planning hearing whenever it finds by clear and convincing evidence that the parent has failed to contact and visit the child for six months after reunification services have begun,whether or not jurisdiction was originally asserted under section,subdivision g.
application to this case 
mother also argues that even if we accept the monique interpretation of the statute,the court erred in terminating reunification services because her failure to contact or visit the child was caused by the social worker refusal to make the children available for frequent and regular visitation as required by section.monique held that reunification services need not be continued where a parent,absent extenuating circumstances,makes no effort to reach out to his or her child for six months in the dependency process.monique,supra,th at,d,italics added.the italicized words imply that reunification services must be continued if there are extenuating circumstances excusing the failure to contact and visit the children.in effect,mother argues the department actions constitute such extenuating circumstances.
section,subdivision a a,states that any order for reunification services shall provide,s ubject to subparagraph b,for visitation between the parent and the child.visitation shall be as frequent as possible,consistent with the of the child.subparagraph b of that subdivision provides,as relevant no visitation order shall jeopardize the safety of the child.
in this case,the department ended mother visit with her children on january because it found she was acting inappropriately,a finding mother has never challenged.after that,it did not permit mother to visit the children unless she was free of drugs,as the reunification plan that mother signed required.mother failed to participate in dependency drug court and for this reason was terminated from that program.the only time before the june hearing that mother asked to visit her children she was,by her own admission,under the influence of methamphetamine and marijuana,and she declined to take a random urinalysis test.she has never claimed the department refused to permit her to visit the children anytime she was free of drugs.
mother may not challenge the court order providing for reunification services because she never appealed it.section provides in relevant part a judgment in a proceeding under section may be appealed from in the same manner as any final judgment,and any subsequent order may be appealed from as from an order after judgment a consequence of section is that an unappealed disposition or postdisposition order is final and binding and may not be attacked on an appeal from a later appealable order.in re jesse th,d.an appeal from the most recent order in a dependency matter may not challenge earlier orders for which the time for filing an appeal has passed.ibid.permitting a parent to raise issues going to the validity of a final earlier appealable order would directly undermine dominant concerns of finality and reasonable expedition,including the predominant interest of the child and state in re janee th,d.accordingly,by failing to appeal,mother has waived any complaint she may have regarding the reunification plan as ordered.in re julie th,d.
to the extent mother challenges the department actions,sufficient evidence supports the trial court implicit finding that the department provided reasonable reunification services.in re julie m,supra,th at,d.the appellate court construe s all reasonable inferences in favor of the juvenile court findings regarding the adequacy of reunification plans and the reasonableness of the social services department efforts.ibid.here,the department merely required that mother be free of drugs and alcohol before she visited her children,as the reunification plan required.the record shows,and mother never claimed otherwise,that she has a substance abuse problem.accordingly,requiring her to be drug and alcohol free before she could visit with her children was reasonable to protect their.in re christopher th,d see.the program in which a parent or guardian is required to participate shall be designed to eliminate those conditions that led to the court finding that the child is a person described by section,subd.c see in re christopher,supra,at,d.
in this case,mother made no apparent effort after january to visit her children under the reunification plan when she was free of drugs and alcohol.at the june hearing,the court gave her another chance,and she still failed to visit the children.under the circumstances,we find no error in the court ultimate order of july terminating reunification services and setting a hearing to establish a permanent plan.
iii.conclusion 
we reverse the judgment of the court of appeal and remand the matter to that court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
when a child is declared a dependent of the court welf,and is removed from parental custody,the trial court must generally order the department of social services to provide reunification services to the parent,and the court must schedule a review hearing in six months.
ordinarily,the department of social services must provide the parent with reunification services for one year,subd.a cal.rules of court,rule f.but at the review hearing the trial court may terminate reunification services and schedule a permanency planning hearing that may forever deprive the parent of any parental rights i f the child was removed initially under subdivision g of section and the court finds by clear and convincing evidence the whereabouts of the parent are still unknown,or the parent has failed to contact and visit the child,subd.e,italics added.at issue here is this does the italicized phrase apply only when the child has been removed under subdivision g of section according to the majority,the answer is no.i disagree.
in,the tuolumne county department of social services department filed a dependency petition alleging that the three children of sara should be declared dependents under subdivisions b failure to protect and c serious emotional damage of section because sara was a drug addict who was not providing them with adequate food,clothing,and shelter.the trial court sustained the petition,ordered the department to provide sara with reunification services including visitation,and scheduled a review hearing for june.sara case worker told her that she had one year to complete the reunification plan,and that if she failed to do so the court would order a permanent plan that could result in termination of her parental rights.a court order and a letter to sara from a social worker also said that she had one year to comply with the reunification plan.
sara did not comply with the reunification program during the first six months of the dependency.she visited the children once at the beginning of the dependency,but the visit did not go well.she tried to visit a second time shortly before the review hearing,but she was not allowed to see the children after she admitted being under the influence of methamphetamine and marijuana she was told that she could see the children only if she stopped using drugs.at the review on june,the trial court told sara it would terminate reunification services if she did not make a greater effort to comply with the reunification program the court continued the matter for three weeks to check on sara progress.
later that day,sara drove to her social worker office and submitted to a drug test when the test was positive for methamphetamine,the social worker had sara arrested for driving under the influence.the next week the police arrested her for possession of a controlled substance and drug paraphernalia,both misdemeanors.at the progress hearing,the trial court ordered termination of reunification services and scheduled a permanency planning hearing.sara filed a writ petition challenging these rulings.the court of appeal held that the trial court orders were premature.it directed the trial court to vacate the permanency planning hearing and to reinstate reunification services for an additional six months.
a child may be made a dependent of the court for many reasons,as set forth in section subdivisions.subdivisions b and c,under which the dependency in this case was created,authorize a dependency when a parent has willfully or negligently failed to protect the child from abuse or to provide adequate food,clothing,and shelter subd.b and when the child has suffered or is at risk of suffering serious emotional damage subd.c.also pertinent here is subdivision g,which authorizes a dependency when a child is left without support when a parent voluntarily surrenders custody of a child and thereafter does not reclaim it when a parent is incarcerated or institutionalized and can not arrange for the child care and when a custodian with whom the child is living can not or will not care for the child,the parent whereabouts are unknown,and reasonable efforts to locate the parent are unsuccessful.other subdivisions of section authorize dependencies for physical abuse subd.a,sexual abuse subd.d,abuse inflicted on a young child by another person with the parent knowledge subd.e,negligently or intentionally causing the death of another child subd.f,relinquishment for adoption subd.h,acts of cruelty subd.i,and abuse or neglect of a sibling subd.j.
once a dependency is created,the trial court must,subject to certain exceptions,provide the parents with reunification services and must schedule a review hearing in six months.
subdivision e of section section e,at issue here,contains eight paragraphs,all of which pertain to the review hearing.it explains that at the review hearing the trial court must return the child to the parent custody unless it finds that doing so would be detrimental to the child,that the court must make findings justifying a continued detention of the child,and that the court must warn the parent that if return of the child is still inappropriate after an additional six months,a permanency planning hearing may be scheduled.
as a general rule,after the review hearing the parent must be provided with reunification services for an additional six months.but section e provides that in certain circumstances,which are described in four paragraphs,the court may terminate reunification services at the review hearing.pertinent here is one of these paragraphs,the fifth paragraph of section e,which states if the child was removed initially under subdivision g of section and the court finds by clear and convincing evidence the whereabouts of the parent are still unknown,or the parent has failed to contact and visit the child,the court may schedule a permanency planning hearing within days.if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the parent has been convicted of a felony indicating parental unfitness,the court may schedule a permanency planning hearing within days.italics added.
at issue here is whether,as the court of appeal concluded,the italicized phrase applies only when the dependency was created under subdivision g of section,or whether,as the majority concludes,the italicized phrase applies to dependencies created under any subdivision of section.to answer that question,i turn to our standard rules of statutory construction.the objective of statutory construction is to determine the intent of the enacting body so that the law may receive the interpretation that best effectuates that intent.hassan mercy american river hospital cal th,d.we first examine the words themselves because the statutory language is generally the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.citation.the words of the statute should be given their ordinary and usual meaning and should be construed in their statutory context.ibid.if the plain,commonsense meaning of a statute words is unambiguous,the plain meaning controls.in re jennings cal th,d.fitch select products company cal th,d.
the majority construes the fifth paragraph of section e as permitting the trial court to set the matter for a permanency planning hearing in three circumstances if the child was removed initially under subdivision g of section and the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the whereabouts of the parent are still unknown,i f the parent has failed to contact and visit the child,and i f the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the parent has been convicted of a felony indicating parental unfitness.e.so construed,there is a standard of proof clear and convincing evidence that the legislature specified for the first and third of these circumstances,but not for the second.the majority offers no explanation for that legislative omission.
the court of appeal,by contrast,concluded that the phrase at issue in the fifth paragraph of section e,which i italicized in my discussion at d page,page,ante,refers back to the beginning of the sentence,which states,if the child was removed initially under subdivision g of section therefore,the court of appeal said,the italicized phrase applies only when the child was initially made a dependent under subdivision g of section.under that interpretation,a trial court can schedule a permanency planning hearing at the time of the review in two circumstances.the first has two subgroups if the child was removed initially under subdivision g of section and the court finds by clear and convincing evidence either a the whereabouts of the parent are still unknown,or b the parent has failed to contact and visit the child.e.the second circumstance occurs i f the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the parent has been convicted of a felony indicating parental unfitness.ibid.under the court of appeal interpretation,the legislature specified a standard of proof clear and convincing evidence for each of the categories listed in the paragraph at issue,whereas the majority construction here leaves one of the categories without a standard of proof.
furthermore,the second of the majority three categories i f the parent has failed to contact and visit the child is so that it completely swallows up the first category if the child was removed initially under subdivision g of section and the court finds by clear and convincing evidence the whereabouts of the parent are still unknown,leaving the first category meaningless.otherwise stated,if the child was initially removed because the parent whereabouts were unknown,and the parent whereabouts are still unknown at the trial court review,it is unlikely that the parent would have contacted or visited the child during the intervening time.
thus,the majority interpretation of the fifth paragraph of section e turns the entire first clause of the paragraph if the child was removed initially under subdivision g of section and the court finds by clear and convincing evidence the whereabouts of the parent are still unknown into mere surplusage.this violates one of the guiding principles of statutory construction,that significance be accorded every word of an act.people johnson cal th,d.this court has repeatedly explained that whenever possible,significance must be given to every word in pursuing the legislative purpose,and the court should avoid a construction that makes some words surplusage.agnew state bd.of equalization cal th,d,see also elsner uveges cal th,d,arnett dal cielo cal th,d,williams superior court cal th,d,brown superior court cal d,city and county of san francisco farrell cal d.
under the court of appeal statutory interpretation,by contrast,there is no surplusage.in essence,the court of appeal construed the first sentence of the fifth paragraph of section e as saying that a trial court may schedule a permanency planning hearing at the review hearing if the child was removed because the parent abandoned the child and either the parent whereabouts are still unknown at the time of the review hearing,or even though the parent whereabouts have been discovered,the parent has not visited the child.these categories do not overlap,and neither is so broad that it encompasses the other.
as previously mentioned,the statutory scheme generally provides for up to one year of services designed to reunify the parent and child before a permanency planning hearing is scheduled,subd.a cal.rules of court,rule f see generally,cynthia superior court cal th,d.under the majority interpretation of the fifth paragraph of section,a trial court may end reunification services after only six months even when,as in this case,a parent whose child was removed for reasons unrelated to abandonment has shown an interest in visiting the child,but has not been permitted to do so because of a continuing substance abuse problem.this broad reading is inconsistent with the statutory scheme general policy of giving a parent a year to meet the requirements of an individualized reunification plan.as interpreted by the court of appeal,however,the legislature crafted a narrow exception to that general policy when a parent who initially abandoned the child has shown no interest in reunification because the parent whereabouts are unknown or the parent has not visited the child,or when a parent has been convicted of a felony that demonstrates parental unfitness.offering an additional six months of services to such parents would be pointless,because further services would not redress the problems that resulted in the dependency.see carolyn superior court th,d goal of reunification services is to address the circumstances which required court intervention into a family life.
in short,the majority interpretation of the fifth paragraph of section e makes one clause of the paragraph meaningless,is based on the assumption that the legislature specified a standard of proof for two of the categories of cases discussed in the paragraph but not the third,and is inconsistent with the statutory scheme governing dependencies.by contrast,the court of appeal statutory interpretation gives meaning to all of the words in the paragraph at issue,it specifies a standard of proof for each of the categories of cases discussed in the paragraph,and it is consistent with the statutory scheme.that construction far better reflects the legislature intent than that of the majority here.
