mother and father appeal from the juvenile court order terminating their parental rights to their daughter.the sole issue raised on appeal concerns orange county social services ssa lack of inquiry regarding american indian heritage as required by the indian child welfare act icwa.ssa admits it failed to comply with the icwa requirements.rather than stipulating to a limited reversal and having the matter returned to the trial court for further proceedings,ssa sought an immediate in the trial court while the matter was still pending on appeal.
with its briefing on appeal,ssa filed a motion asking us to consider evidence of that hearing and the juvenile court order concerning ssa icwa investigation and remedial efforts at notification.ssa contends we must dismiss this appeal because mother and father issues on appeal were rendered moot by the postjudgment activities.we disagree.the trial court lacked jurisdiction to rule on the icwa issue following its termination of parental rights.welf.inst.code,subd.i.because the juvenile court postjudgment icwa order is void,this appeal is not moot.and due to the undisputed icwa violations,we order a limited reversal of the judgment and remand the matter for further proceedings.
icwa violation 
ssa concedes that at mother first court appearance in march,she informed the juvenile court she may have american indian heritage through her maternal grandmother,marlene w.the court ordered ssa to investigate the matter.it failed to do so.
in ssa subsequent reports dated may,and september,the social worker stated icwa may apply but also noted mother denied american indian heritage in prior child abuse investigations.in december,after the section hearing hereafter hearing was scheduled,ssa prepared a report stating icwa did not apply.in a status review report prepared one month before the hearing,in february,the social worker again noted icwa did not apply.at the hearing held on march,the juvenile court did not mention icwa in its minute order terminating parental rights.
mother and father filed separate notices of appeal,and their opening briefs filed in early june raised the issue of inadequate notice and violations of icwa.in its briefing,ssa concedes there was inadequate notice and violations of icwa.indeed,the record reflects there was no notice or investigation before judgment was entered.accordingly,the juvenile court order terminating parental rights is reversed and the matter is remanded to the juvenile court with directions to order ssa to provide the appropriate tribes with proper notice of the proceedings under icwa.if,after receiving notice under icwa,no tribe indicates is an indian child within the meaning of the statutory scheme,then the juvenile court shall reinstate the order terminating parental rights.in all other respects,the judgment is affirmed.
on september,ssa filed its respondent brief,making extensive references to the information contained in its concurrently filed motion to augment the record and take additional evidence,and dismiss the appeal as moot.for reasons we now explain,we grant the code of civil procedure section motion to take additional evidence hereafter motion,deny the motion to augment,and deny the motion to dismiss the appeal.
in its motions,ssa asserted it now possessed documentation and reports that resolved the parents icwa concerns and,thus,rendered the appeal moot.ssa explained it reinitiated icwa inquiry and notice efforts in july after mother and father filed their opening briefs in this appeal and the trial court reappointed counsel for both parents for the limited purpose of icwa notices and findings.on august,ssa filed the icwa documentation it sent to several tribes along with copies of the return receipts.it supplied response letters from several cherokee tribes declining for tribal membership.
ssa attached several supporting documents to its motion.first ssa provided a copy of the juvenile court minute order,dated july,containing the following statements the court read,considered,and signed a third page stipulation submitted this date the court makes orders and findings pursuant to the stipulation due to inadvertence,icwa findings were not properly made in this matter the court schedules a icwa compliance and findings hearing for july,and the court reappoints counsel to represent the parents.a copy of the stipulation referred to in the order is not attached as an exhibit to ssa motion.
second,ssa provided a copy of the juvenile court minute order dated august.the minute order stated that at first call the court noted icwa was not previously addressed,documentation had been filed,and notice was given to all appropriate tribes.the court determined icwa did not apply.the minute order next indicated mother counsel requested a second call of the matter.during the second call mother counsel requested the court vacate the previous order regarding icwa and continue the matter one day because the matter was currently under appeal.the court agreed to suspend the order icwa did not apply and trailed the hearing to the following day.
the minute order dated september,stated the juvenile court considered argument.the order added,counsel for mother objects to the court making any further orders regarding icwa pursuant to section,subdivision i,as stated on the record.father counsel joined in the objections.the minute order stated the court heard argument from minor counsel and county counsel as stated on the record.the court lifted the temporary suspension of the icwa orders and restated its finding icwa does not apply.ssa did not provide a copy of the reporter transcript describing the exact nature of the arguments,objections,and discussions made at either postjudgment hearing.
finally,in support of the motion,county counsel,mark sanchez,submitted a declaration stating he represented ssa in the trial court and parents did not challenge the sufficiency or content of ssa renewed notice efforts but focused their arguments on the nature of the proceedings.sanchez declared the parents objected to the icwa findings on the grounds the ruling was improperly made after termination of parental rights and while an appeal was pending.
the parents filed separate motions opposing ssa motions.mother counsel asserted postjudgment evidence is generally rejected by a reviewing court.in re zeth cal th,d.in addition,mother maintained ssa icwa evidence is insufficient to prove the appeal is moot it is alarming that missing from the postjudgment evidence were the reporter transcripts for the august and september hearings.counsel maintains the legal arguments made on the record both days should have been disclosed.
mother counsel speculates,what is also apparent is that ssa is attempting to do anything it can to avoid a reversal by this c ourt.ssa concedes icwa notice was not sent as required by law if ssa wanted to remedy this issue in the fastest most efficient manner,ssa should have stipulated to a limited icwa reversal,and an expedited remittitur.the solution attempted by ssa deprives the parents and child of due process because they will be deprived of oversight or review by this c ourt as to the adequacy of the new icwa investigations and notices.ssa already got it wrong at least one time in this case.counsel argued the icwa notices were missing important information and were inadequate.counsel explained this court can not review the objections or argument made at the hearing because no reporter transcripts were provided.finally,counsel asserted the juvenile court lacked jurisdiction to hear the icwa issue while it was on appeal.father counsel raised the same objections and added it would be improper for this court to take judicial notice or accept the new evidence.
the first issue we must decide is whether the new evidence can be reviewed by this court and by what mechanism.ssa seeks to augment the record with events occurring six months after the termination order,creating a new record rather than completing the appellate record is this case.the request to augment with a new record is inappropriate.augmentation does not function to supplement the record with materials not before the tr
