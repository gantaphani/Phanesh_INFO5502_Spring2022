here we conclude that a juvenile offender may not be ordered to register as a sex offender under penal code section if his offenses are not among those listed in subdivision d 
factual and procedural background 
at the age of derrick was committed to the california youth authority.the commitment followed four years of juvenile court intervention beginning when derrick was accused of lewd and lascivious acts with a child under,subd.a.derrick was then years old and living with the family of a girl.while she slept,he reached under her clothes and touched her chest,buttocks,and vagina.pursuant to an agreement,derrick was declared a ward of the court for having committed the lesser offense of sexual battery.he was ordered to live in a group home and attend sex offender treatment,as conditions of probation.
derrick failed in several group home placements.during the course of his wardship he admitted to counselors that he had sexually assaulted a number of victims.he also reported his own sexual victimization at the hands of his parents friends.
in,derrick was found to have committed a misdemeanor weapons offense,continued as a ward,and again ordered to undergo sex offender treatment.in,derrick admitted misdemeanor violations for assault and battery.the court sent derrick to the california youth authority,choosing his earlier sexual battery offense as the basis for the principal term.welf,subd.a.the court also directed that he register as a sex offender upon his release.the court of appeal affirmed the judgment,with a modification of precommitment credit.
the only issue before us is the validity of the section registration order.
ii.discussion 
three provisions of section must be analyzed to resolve this question.
section,subdivision a a requires registration by adults convicted of various sex offenses,including sexual battery 
section,subdivision d pertains to juveniles sent to the youth authority.it lists specific offenses giving rise to a registration requirement upon discharge or parole sexual battery is not included in this list.
a third subdivision authorizes a court to require registration in connection with unlisted offenses if the court makes certain findings and states reasons for the imposition,subd.a e.the attorney general relies on this subdivision to defend the juvenile court order.the reliance is misplaced.
the objective of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent.people trevino cal th,d,people gardeley cal th,d.to determine that intent,we turn first to the words of the statute,giving them their usual and ordinary meaning.trevino,at,d,trope katz cal th,d.when the statutory language is clear,we need go no further.if,however,the language supports more than one reasonable interpretation,we look to a variety of extrinsic aids,including the objects to be achieved,the evils to be remedied,the legislative history,the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part,and contemporaneous administrative construction,as well as questions of public policy.people flores cal th,d,granberry islay investments cal th,d,people woodhead cal d.
under section,subdivision a e,a court may order registration for unlisted offenses if it finds at the time of conviction or sentencing that the person committed the offense as a result of sexual compulsion or for purposes of sexual gratification.italics added.this language is clear.conviction and sentencing are terms of art usually associated with adult proceedings.because the legislature used these terms,we construe this subdivision as applying only in cases of adult convictions 
in people burton cal d,burton,we held that a capital defendant prior juvenile adjudications,though serious offenses,were not prior felony convictions within the terms of section,factor c as we explained welfare and institutions code section provides that a n order adjudging a minor to be a ward of the juvenile court shall not be deemed a conviction of a crime for any purpose,nor shall a proceeding in the juvenile court be deemed a criminal proceeding.this court and the courts of appeal have consistently agreed that adjudications under welfare and institutions code section are not criminal convictions,people weidert cal d,in re joseph cal d,leroy workmen comp.appeals bd.cal d,people sanchez d.see also people lucky cal d.burton,at,italics added.
we must assume that the voters,when they enacted section,were aware of welfare and institutions code section and judicial constructions of its terms.people weidert,supra,cal d.with such an awareness,the voters can not have intended the term prior felony conviction contained in section,factor c to refer to juvenile court adjudications.we employ a presumption that when the language of a statute uses a term that has been judicially construed,the term is used in the precise sense which the court gave it.weidert,supra,at.consistent with past decisions and in the absence of any evidence the voters intended a different interpretation for section,factor c,we conclude evidence of juvenile adjudications is not admissible under factor c.see people lucky,supra,cal d at.burton,supra,cal d at.
the same reasoning bolsters the conclusion that the legislature,in choosing the terms conviction and sentencing in its enactment of section,subdivision a e was aware of welfare and institutions code section and judicial constructions of its terms,including burton,supra,cal d,and the cases it cites.
in re bernardino th,d bernardino provides additional support for this construction.bernardino was accused of performing a lewd and lascivious act on a child under the age of.he admitted the allegations,was adjudged a ward,and required to register as a sex offender under section.th at,d.the court of appeal reversed,holding that before the enactment of subdivision d,section was inapplicable to juvenile offenders.
prior to,penal code section required registration only by persons who had been convicted of specified sex offenses.under the juvenile court law,a person adjudged a ward of the court has not been convicted of anything.welfare and institutions code section provides that a wardship adjudication shall not be deemed a conviction of a crime for any purpose,nor shall a proceeding in the juvenile court be deemed a criminal proceeding.
the legislature own interpretation of the statute as applied to juvenile wards became apparent when,in,it amended penal code section by adopting a new subdivision d expressly dealing with wards of the juvenile court.extrinsic legislative materials strongly indicate that the preamendment statute had no application whatever to juvenile wards although persons,including remanded minors,committed to youth authority from criminal court for specified sex offenses must register under current law,juvenile court commitments do not currently have to register no matter how violent their offense.assem.office of research,reading analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended,reading analysis.the legislature viewed the amendment as an expansion of the statute sweep to persons previously excluded.legis.counsel,bill,stats,summary digest,expanding the category of persons to which a criminal penalty is applicable reading analysis,supra,expands application of the registration requirements.
given this legislative interpretation of the statute and the complete absence of contrary authority,it seems clear that the sole statutory basis for requiring juvenile wards to register as sex offenders is the amendments themselves.we turn now to the question whether those amendments can be properly understood as bringing appellant within the statute.bernardino,supra,th at,d,fns.omitted.
the court held that bernardino could not be required to register under section,subdivision d because he had not been committed to the youth authority.bernardino,supra,th at,d.
the attorney general contends that bernardino,supra,th,d,is inapposite because it was decided before the enactment of section,subdivision a e.this argument fails.the fact that bernardino was decided before the enactment of subdivision a e makes it all the more significant that the legislature chose to use terms that had been construed to apply to adult
