introduction 
mother appeals from the juvenile court permanent restraining order against her requiring her to stay away from father,the father of,their daughter,and mother contends that there was insufficient evidence to support the inclusion of in the restraining order as a protected person.in affirming in part,reversing in part,and remanding the matter,we hold that based on the record,the juvenile court erred by including in the restraining order.
factual and procedural background 
in,the los angeles county department of children and family services department filed a welfare and institutions code section petition alleging was at risk due to,inter alia,mother drug use and her repeated false allegations that father sexually abused on may,the juvenile court sustained the following petition allegations b the child mother has a history of illicit drug use and is a current abuser of marijuana which renders the mother incapable of providing the child with regular care and supervision.on prior occasions in,the mother possessed marijuana,smoked near the child where the child could smell the marijuana and was under the influence of marijuana while the child was in the mother care and supervision.the mother substance abuse endangers the child physical health and safety,placing the child at risk of physical harm,damage and danger.b the child mother created an endangering and detrimental home environment for the child in that the mother has repeatedly made false allegations to law enforcement and medical personnel that the father sexually abused the child.such an endangering and detrimental home environment established for the child,by the mother endangers the child physical health and safety,placing the child at risk of physical harm,damage and danger.
on june,the juvenile court declared a dependent of the juvenile court,removed her from mother custody,ordered the child father,mother to have monitored visits with that were not monitored by father,and that the parents were educational rights holders.in our prior opinion,we affirmed the juvenile court jurisdiction order.
on august,father filed a request for a restraining order seeking,inter alia,an order that mother stay at least yards away from him and,their residence,his workplace,his vehicle,and school.in support of his request for a restraining order,father declared under penalty of perjury that o n june,following the hearing,mother attempted to remove from school.mother threatened father,struck him,leaving scratches on father hand and pulled his hair.mother threatened father when she told him you dead motherf.you already know what coming to you.my people are going to put a bullet through your head.mother violated the court order that she stay a way from father home and school.
the juvenile court granted father request,issued a temporary restraining order,and set an order to show cause hearing for august.thereafter,on several occasions,the juvenile court extended the time of the expiration of the temporary restraining order.
on september,the department reported that mother currently has monitored visits with every sunday for hour s a day during mother monitored visits with,mother interaction with is good,and appears to enjoy spending time with her mother.has reported to the department that she likes visiting with her mother.
on october,the juvenile court held an order to show cause hearing regarding the issuance of a permanent restraining order.on that date,father declared under penalty of perjury,i am requesting a restraining order for the following reasons mother has used vulgarity against me,my mother and my family on.she as threatened me and my family on.she has had other people threaten my life.after the last court date,she continues to contact the school because she wants a report of the incident that took place there.in addition,she threatened to remove from school on june,violating a retraining sic order that was issued on.as such,i am fearful of mother and fear for my child safety.father did not base his request for a restraining order on mother substance abuse,her false allegations that father sexually abused,or her violation of a visitation order.
during the hearing,father counsel stated,it is not just about my client,it about his daughter safety,as well.this court is about child safety.a fter the petition was filed in this case there have been a number of incidents in the school and most notably,june,where there was an altercation involving my client and mother.not only that,the last time we were here,it in father declaration,mother contacted the school,again,trying to get information of an incident,that incident which took place on june.my client,in his declaration,states that mother cussed him out,cussed his mother out,cussed his family out.he indicates she threatened him.she threatens his family.your honor just has to make a finding that there is apprehension here and i believe my client has established that.more important,the fact that his child is placed with him.i think it in the child best interest to grant a restraining order.my client is not trying to prevent mother from seeing her child,that not the issue here.in this case,the restraining order includes a visitation order.my client is willing to follow the terms of that visitation order.in fact,if your honor were to liberalize mother visits,my client would certainly follow that order.what my client fears is the continuing harassment by mother.mother complete lack of insight and her going to school and looking,i guess,for a report and her harassing school officials.
mother counsel said at that hearing,the request for a temporary restraining order references an incident that occurred at the school.there is a december order from saying mother is not to attend the child school.the mother does hold educational rights t here is nothing preventing the mother from contacting the school.she is appropriate during her visitation.there have been no concerns raised by the department,no request by the department to modify her visits and father counsel references her erratic behavior however,the sustained petition references her marijuana use and generally calling in referrals on the father.none of those things have happened since the court sustained the petition.additionally,father counsel references an incident since the temporary restraining order was issued.there is zero evidence to support his statements or threats my client has made.furthermore,nothing that he articulated references a specific theft to this child and there are no reports that the father has made regarding mother violating the restraining order.so had she in fact threatened father or done anything since the original temporary order was issued on august,there should be a police report or at least an incident report regarding mother violating the restraining order.so i would ask the court not to issue a restraining order preventing the mother from or limiting the mother contact with the child.the child is safe in her placement,safe during the visits.there no concerns mother is going to harm the child or take the child or do something else.
counsel replied,your honor,i have no objection to the child being taken off of the restraining order.i think that the concerns as to the mother interaction or possible risk she would present to the child are not something that warrant a restraining order because they are not things that could be resolved be a restraining order.this is something that includes erratic behavior making allegations or contacting the school,and additionally,i do have any information,especially recent information,of any incident that would pose a risk if as the father reports,the mother is contacting the school for information,even if it is overbearing or annoying to them,it does not place the child at risk.
the juvenile court issued the restraining order and included as a protected person.the juvenile court explained that it included in the restraining order because i t a safety risk to the father and he has care of the child.it a safety risk to the child and i think that if this was a woman coming to court asking for this restraining order,there would n
