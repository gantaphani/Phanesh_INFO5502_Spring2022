ii.section,subdivision b 
appellant contends the juvenile court failed to exercise its statutory discretion in setting his maximum term of physical confinement,pursuant to recently amended section,subdivision b.
section,subdivision b,provides in relevant part a minor committed to the department of the youth authority may not be held in physical confinement for a period of time in excess of the maximum period of imprisonment which could be imposed upon an adult convicted of the offense or offenses which brought or continued the minor under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.a minor committed to the department of the youth authority also may not be held in physical confinement for a period of time in excess of the maximum term of physical confinement set by the court based upon the facts and circumstances of the matter or matters which brought or continued the minor under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court,which may not exceed the maximum period of adult confinement as determined pursuant to this section.italics added.the legislature amended section,subdivision b,to add the above italicized language to the provision,with an operative date of january.see stats.reg.sess,ch,eff,operative.
as a preliminary matter,respondent asserts that appellant has waived this issue by failing to raise it in the juvenile court.see people scott cal th,d.appellant,however,does not contend that the court imposed a commitment in a procedurally or factually flawed manner id.at,d,but instead makes the distinct argument that the court completely failed to exercise its discretion,under section,subdivision b,in setting appellant maximum term of confinement.a ruling otherwise within the trial court power will nonetheless be set aside where it appears from the record that in issuing the ruling the court failed to exercise the discretion vested in it by law.citations.citation.failure to exercise a discretion conferred and compelled by law constitutes a denial of a fair hearing and a deprivation of fundamental procedural rights,and thus requires reversal.citations.citation.people downey th,d.
the record supports appellant claim that the juvenile court did not believe it had any discretion with respect to the maximum term of confinement when it committed appellant to cya.amended section,subdivision b,became operative on january.the court twice mentioned appellant maximum term of confinement during the proceedings.first,on july,after appellant admitted to the allegations of the amended petition and the court found a knowing waiver of rights,the court said,i sorry,but at this time i do need to advise the minor of the maximum term.the prosecutor then said,it eight years,eight months.the court then said,do you understand that,sir appellant responded in the affirmative.second,at the august,dispositional hearing,the court stated,for the reasons i have stated on the record,the minor committed to the department of california youth authority for a term prescribed by law,for a period not exceeding eight what was it the clerk answered,eight months.the court then said,eight years and eight months.the court,counsel,and the probation department indicated no awareness of court discretion in setting the maximum term of confinement.the issue is not waived.
i n construing a statute,a court must ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.citation.in determining that intent,we first examine the words of the respective statutes if there is no ambiguity in the language of the statute,then the legislature is presumed to have meant what it said,and the plain meaning of the language governs.citation.where the statute is clear,courts will not interpret away clear language in favor of an ambiguity that does not exist.citation.citation.if,however,the terms of a statute provide no definitive answer,then courts may resort to extrinsic sources,including the ostensible objects to be achieved and the legislative history.citation.we must select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the legislature,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute,and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.citation.people coronado cal th,d.
furthermore,we must harmonize competing statutes to effectuate the legislative policy.we should seek to consider the statutes not as antagonistic laws but as parts of the whole system which must be harmonized and effect given to every section citations.accordingly,statutes which are in pari materia should be read together and harmonized if possible.citations.johnston sonoma county agricultural preservation open space dist.th,d.
in the present case,respondent argues that the added language of section,subdivision b,is unambiguous in that it is merely a clarification of existing law and a directive to cya that a ward can not be physically confined beyond the maximum term set by the juvenile court.respondent further avers that the language in section,subdivision b,providing for the court to set the maximum term of confinement based upon the facts and circumstances of the case,merely articulates the understanding that the court has discretion under section,subdivision c,in deciding whether to aggregate periods of physical confinement on multiple counts or petitions adjudging
