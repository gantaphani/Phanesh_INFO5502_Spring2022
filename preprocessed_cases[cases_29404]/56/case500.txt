admitted two counts of a welfare and institutions code section petition alleging violations of penal code section,subdivision a,and criminal street gang allegations pursuant to penal code section,subdivision b.after determining that the assaults were felonies,the court committed the minor to the division of juvenile justice djj,and set the maximum period of confinement at years months.the court also ordered gang registration pursuant to penal code section.
the minor contends the court violated the americans with disabilities act ada et,by committing him to the djj instead of a less restrictive placement because the minor has diabetes.he further contends the court violated his due process rights by considering his diabetes as a factor in selecting the appropriate placement.
we hold the court did not abuse its discretion by committing the minor to the djj.the claimed ada violation is not cognizable in the context of this appeal as grounds for reversal of an otherwise valid dispositional order.we also hold the dispositional order did not violate due process,and affirm the order.
a.the current petition 
on june,a group of to males and females playing hide and seek at an elementary school were approached by a group of males in a car asking if they needed something.the hide and seek players interpreted the inquiry as an offer of drugs for sale and said they did not want anything.words were exchanged and,within minutes,a group of to males,wearing red and armed with rocks,bats,bottles,and wooden sticks with nails sticking out,began to attack.the armed group,including the minor,yelled norte as they attacked.one of the victims was stabbed in the lower back.another victim was hit in the shoulder with a bottle,and a third victim suffered a contusion and laceration to his head.several more also suffered injuries and were treated at the scene.
a short while later,the police located the car driven by some of the attackers outside a nearby home.defendant,a known member of the norteno criminal street gang,was inside the house with several other known gang members.the police found a large amount of marijuana in the house,and a knife with dried red fluid on it in the front yard.
prior petitions 
the original petition,filed on june,alleged that the minor,then age,obstructed a teacher and committed two misdemeanor batteries.it also alleged that one of the batteries was committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang.the minor admitted one count of battery and threatening a public officer.the street gang allegation was dismissed.
the dispositional study noted that the minor had failed nearly every class during the preceding two years and his truancy was so severe he had been referred to the school attendance review board.according to the minor,his absences were caused primarily by complications related to his diagnosed diabetes.he was receiving special education services and had an individualized education program iep.the minor also acknowledged that he used marijuana to alleviate depression.on august,the court adjudged the minor a ward of the court and placed him on probation subject to no weapons and no gang association conditions,and ordered individual and family counseling.
on november,a subsequent petition alleged that on september,defendant carried a dirk or dagger for the benefit of a criminal street gang count one,carried a switchblade knife for the benefit of a criminal street gang count two,and on november,again carried a dirk or dagger count three.he admitted count one,and the court dismissed the remaining counts and enhancements.the court deemed count one to be a felony.
the dispositional study reported that the minor had not made any progress on probation.he had only attended school two days in the fall semester.he had not attended the required drug,alcohol,and family counseling,nor had he completed any of the required community service hours,or written a court mandated letter of apology and essay.the minor father believed his son behavioral problems were related to depression caused,in part,by the diagnosis of diabetes he received at age.
on january,the court continued the wardship and referred the minor to the repeat offender prevention program ropp for intensive supervision.the probation conditions included a proscription against possession of weapons,a curfew,gang conditions,and a stay away order naming several individuals.
little more than a month later,on february,the probation officer filed a section probation violation notice alleging that the minor had not attended school and had violated his curfew.on february,the minor admitted the probation violation and the court placed him on home electronic monitoring.he attended school on february.on february,he returned to school after a holiday but was two and a half hours late and threatened another student.
the minor father reported to the probation officer that the minor was out of control.the father had talked to the minor doctors regarding his health issues,and the doctors informed him that not everyone conforms to treatment appropriately.the minor health issues stem from the minor unwillingness to accept that he has diabetes and treat it appropriately.the father says he has tried to take control of the minor treatment,however the minor,at times,refuses to take his insulin shots.the father stated he has gone so far as to give the minor his shot when he is sleeping,however,this action is also dangerous for the minor.neither the minor father nor his doctors have devised a treatment plan that the minor has followed appropriately the father believes the minor needs therapy to learn how to accept his illness and treat it appropriately.the report noted that the minor has had the opportunity to receive counseling services through david grant medical center,but he has not been cooperative with that treatment either.the minor was still on the waiting list for ropp,an intensive supervision program that deals with young juveniles.
on february,the court continued the wardship and ordered six mandatory weekends of detention,and an additional days on home electronic monitoring.
on may,the probation officer filed another probation violation notice alleging that the minor had failed to attend school since,tested positive for alcohol and marijuana,had been cited by the police for violating curfew,missed a probation appointment because he refused to get out of bed,and failed to appear for one of his mandatory detention weekends.the minor also failed to appear at the first hearing on the probation violations and a bench warrant issued.
he appeared on the bench warrant return on may.the court appointed a doctor to perform a psychological evaluation.on june,the minor admitted several probation violations.
the next day he committed the offenses that resulted in the current petition.the probation officer requested that the minor be in physical restraints during court proceedings because,while at juvenile hall,he aided a norte√±o detainee involved in a fight with another juvenile.
dispositional hearing 
the dispositional report summarized the psychological evaluation.the appointed psychologist found no psychotic or neurological problems.the tests indicated the minor showed some insensitivity to the suffering of others,and the minor acknowledged he saw nothing wrong with using others to get what he wants.the psychologist recommended a medical evaluation for help with his chronic pain symptoms and diabetes.he also stated that the minor needs a structured,supportive environment away from gangs or similar criminal associations that he may have turned to for support and understanding not provided by his family.
the dispositional report noted the minor had been before the court for violations on five separate occasions.the only term that he has completed is his financial obligation.all of his remaining terms are outstanding and the minor and his father have been referred by both his present and previous probation officer s for counseling services.also,the minor principal at travis community day has informed the father that the minor needs counseling.however,there has been no follow through with counseling.
the report concluded,based upon the facts underlying the current petition and the prior petitions and the minor performance on probation,that the minor posed a serious danger to the community and required treatment in a secured facility.
the juvenile placement screening committee committee screened his case.the committee concluded new foundations was not appropriate because it is a placement where the minor could earn furloughs after two months,and it was not likely that family reunification and substance abuse could be achieved in that short a period.the committee found fouts springs youth facility fouts to be inappropriate because it was primarily a behavior modification program and does not have hours medical staff for the minor diabetic needs that he requires,nor does it offer family counseling.it found challenge inappropriate because it did not provide substance abuse counseling or family counseling and the minor would not receive intensive supervision upon release from the program.the committee also found placement in a group home was not a placement alternative because,due to the serious and violent nature of the offenses it was highly unlikely that the probation department could find a group home to accept him.nor would a group home adequately address the need for public safety because they are usually located in residential neighborhoods.
the probation officer recommended that the minor be committed to the djj where both the goals for rehabilitation and protection of the community would be addressed.the djj would evaluate the minor to develop a treatment plan,including substance abuse,impact on victims of crime training,schooling,and medical needs.at djj,the minor would have the opportunity to earn a high school diploma and receive vocational training.the djj would also offer family counseling in a secure setting.when he turns and becomes eligible for parole,djj offers transitional adult living services,if the minor were to choose not to reunify with his family.six months prior to release,if it is determined that he has significant substance abuse issues,he would be housed in a rehabilitation unit.the djj would also retain jurisdiction of the minor until age,and can provide supervision services.the probation officer concluded that the djj was the most comprehensive treatment plan available for the minor in addressing both community safety and the most appropriate services for the minor.
at the dispositional hearing on august,the minor father testified that,as a young child,the minor had loved going to school.he became depressed when he was diagnosed with diabetes,and his school difficulties began after the diagnosis.his defiant behavior began at about age,and he became difficult to control.his diabetes is controllable with medication,but even while in juvenile hall,where he received medication daily,his numbers were still running high,and the minor needed to see a doctor to increase his medication.when the minor does not receive his proper medication he gets weak.if his blood sugar level gets too high or low,he can very easily become disoriented.his father acknowledged that he had difficulty controlling the minor.while living at home the minor had not attended school for almost a year and did not complete any of the terms or conditions of probation.the minor father did not condone carrying a knife,and was unaware that his son was doing so.
the probation officer testified that in january of the minor was referred to ropp.by may of he was on the top of the waiting list,but he was taken off the list when he was placed in custody for another offense.the probation officer noted that the minor had also been on the ankle monitor,and given mandatory weekend detention,but continued to reoffend.
in terms of placement,when asked whether,but for the diabetes issue,your recommendation might have been for fouts,the probation officer replied that it might have been.she confirmed that fouts did not have the medical staff or treatment the minor needed.she explained that fouts was inappropriate because the minor is a diabetic,and fouts did not have a hour medical staff,nor did fouts offer family counseling.
with respect to other alternatives,she repeated the same factors enumerated in the dispositional report that rendered new foundations,challenge,or a group home inappropriate or ineffective placements.she also testified that there were no other placement facilities.
with respect to djj,the probation officer described all of the services available that would benefit the minor,including a medical staff.among the criteria she used in making the djj recommendation were the seriousness of the offense,the fact that this is his third offense for using and being in possession of a knife,the injuries to the victims,and that the minor initially denied any gang affiliation and did not recognize the seriousness of the offense.other factors she relied on were that neither being on probation nor being on the ankle monitor had deterred the minor from reoffending,and he had reoffended before he could be placed under more intensive supervision in the community.
after hearing argument from counsel the court found the minor could no longer remain in the custody of his father.in reference to an earlier discussion concerning placement,the court asked rhetorically what alternative to djj does the court have in the face of the programs that are available to me the court stated that fouts could have been an appropriate placement because it would meet many of the minor needs,except that it is physically remote.it is probably at a minimum an hour to two hours for medical care.and although the staff at that facility are excellent and would provide wonderful personal care to the minor,they could not meet his medical needs.it found new foundations is inappropriate given his history of violence,possession of weapons,so that program is out,and that challenge met none of his treatment needs.
the court concluded so it is not with any joy nor is it without some concern that the only alternative available to the court is the department of juvenile justice.the court emphasized it would closely review the progress reports the djj is now required to submit,and if the minor were not progressing,or his needs were not being met the court could recall the case and review it and determine whether that placement continues to be appropriate.
ii.analysis 
one of the primary objectives of juvenile court law is rehabilitation,and the statutory scheme contemplates a progressively more restrictive and punitive series of dispositions starting with home placement under supervision,and progressing to foster home placement,placement in a local treatment facility,and finally placement at the djj.in re teofilio d.teofilio.although the djj is normally a placement of last resort,there is no absolute rule that a djj commitment can not be ordered unless less restrictive placements have been attempted.in re ricky cal d,ricky in re asean th,d teofilio,supra,d at.a djj commitment is not an abuse of discretion where the evidence demonstrates a probable benefit to the minor from the commitment and less restrictive alternatives would be ineffective or inappropriate.in re pedro th,d.
before we address the minor contention that the court order committing him to the djj violates the ada,we emphasize that this is not a case in which the court failed to consider less restrictive alternatives,or where the evidence does not support the court finding of a probable benefit.indeed,the minor does not even suggest that the court dispositional order was an abuse of discretion,and such a contention would,in any event,be unavailing.
first,the record demonstrates the court considered every available less restrictive placement,and gave reasons supported by the evidence why challenge and new foundations were not appropriate.with respect to fouts,the court reluctantly rejected this alternative after determining that although many of its programs were appropriate for the minor,the staff would be unable to meet his medical needs,and due to its remote location there was inadequate access to medical care.the court findings regarding the minor medical needs and the inability of the fouts staff to meet them is supported by the probation officer testimony,and was confirmed by the court independent knowledge concerning the location of the facility.
the probation reports also included many references to the fact that the minor needed to be under the care of a doctor,had not taken charge of his own treatment,denied his condition,and failed to treat it properly.according to the father,the minor could easily become disoriented if his diabetes is not treated properly.even under close supervision while detained at juvenile hall,the minor diabetes was not completely under control,and he needed to see a doctor to adjust his medication.the minor did not offer any evidence to refute the probation officer testimony that management of the minor medical condition would require a medical staff and that fouts did not have the appropriate medical staff on site,or nearby therefore,substantial evidence supports the court stated reason for finding placement at fouts would be inadequate or ineffective,that it would not meet the minor medical needs.
second,the court finding that the djj commitment would be of probable benefit is amply supported by the probation officer testimony concerning the treatment plan,the presence of a hour medical staff,the opportunity to earn a high school diploma,and the availability of family counseling,substance abuse rehabilitation,vocational training,and supervision services.
rather than attempting to demonstrate that the dispositional order was an abuse of discretion,the minor contends the trial court decision not to place him at fouts and instead to commit him to the djj violated the ada because the court based its decision solely upon his disability,diabetes.to state a claim of disability discrimination under title ii,the plaintiff must allege four elements the plaintiff is an individual with a disability the plaintiff is otherwise qualified to participate in or receive the benefit of some public entity services,programs,or activities the plaintiff was either excluded from participation in or denied the benefits of the public entity services,programs,or activities,or was otherwise discriminated against by the public entity and such exclusion,denial of benefits,or discrimination was by reason of the plaintiff disability.thompson davis cir,thompson.we shall assume for the purpose of our analysis that the minor diabetes does constitute a disability,as defined by the ada.nonetheless,his ada argument fails for several reasons.
first,the minor did not raise the ada issue below,or even argue that a placement at fouts was appropriate.in fact,defense counsel urged the court to place him at challenge,not fouts.counsel did mention fouts and the minor diabetes,but only in support of the argument that the court should place him at challenge he did not make an ada discrimination claim,nor request or suggest an accommodation to facilitate a placement at fouts.consequently,the people have had no notice or opportunity to introduce relevant evidence,or raise any defenses,and the court had no opportunity to address the issue in making its dispositional order.therefore,assuming arguendo the ada issue could be raised and litigated in the context of the dispositional hearing,the issue would,in any event,be waived.people scott cal th,d,see people planavsky th,d convicted narcotics offender waived the issue of failure of court to determine whether he should be committed to the crc pursuant to welfare and institutions code section by not raising it at sentencing people lizarraga th,d same.
second,even if not waived,we have found no authority to support the minor novel contention that an ada claim may be raised in the context of a section dispositional hearing,and that an otherwise valid dispositional order can be reversed on the ground that it violated the ada.although no published decision has considered such a proposition with respect to a djj commitment order,one court has rejected a similar attempt to raise an ada claim in an appeal of an order in a juvenile dependency proceeding.in re diamond th,d diamond,disapproved on another ground by renee superior court cal th,fn,d.
in diamond a developmentally disabled mother contended on appeal that the juvenile court decision to deny reunification services pursuant to section,subdivision b,violated the ada.the court held that the ada claim could not be raised in the context of the juvenile dependency proceedings.it reasoned in response to the discrimination faced by disabled individuals,congress enacted the ada et.title ii of the ada prohibits excluding qualified individuals from participating in or being excluded from the services,programs or activities of a public entity.title iii provides that no individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods,services,facilities,privileges,advantages or accommodations of any place of public accommodation.both provisions apply to state and local public entities.citations.in enacting the ada,however,congress did not intend to change the obligations imposed by unrelated statutes.although a parent may have a separate cause of action under the ada based on a public entity action or inaction,such a claim is not a basis to attack a state court order.citations.thus,the ada does not directly apply to juvenile dependency proceedings and can not be used as a defense in them a ny challenge a parent has under the ada for alleged violations must be raised in a separate cause of action in federal court.diamond,supra,th,d,italics added.
we find the analysis in diamond to be equally applicable where a minor found to be a person within the meaning of section is attempting to assert an ada violation as grounds to set aside an otherwise valid dispositional order.in addition to the reasons stated in diamond,we observe that achieving the important rehabilitative and treatment goals of the juvenile proceedings would be severely hampered if,whenever the court considers,as it must,a minor physical or psychological problems in assessing whether a particular placement would be effective,its decision could trigger an ada claim that the court would have to allow the parties to litigate before reaching a final disposition.the obvious delays and procedural and substantive problems that would follow from importing what is,in effect,a new and complex civil action into the juvenile proceedings,is not mandated by the ada,which instead provides a remedy by way of an independent civil action.
the minor reliance upon decisions that have applied the ada to challenge exclusion of certain classes of prisoners from parole or certain prison programs is misplaced because,in each of the cases the minor cites,the plaintiffs raised their ada claims in a separate civil action.
in stevens harper,the court denied a motion to dismiss the individual claims of several minors.the court held the minors adequately alleged a cause of action under the ada against the director of the california youth authority cya claiming they had been unable to participate in certain cya programs because the cya failed properly to accommodate their disabilities.these ada claims were brought in an independent action against the cya,not,as here,raised in the context of an appeal of a dispositional order of the juvenile court.
in pennsylvania of corrections yeskey,d,a court sentenced the plaintiff to serve time in a pennsylvania correctional facility with a recommendation that the time be served in a motivational boot camp for offenders which could result in early release.the department of corrections thereafter denied the plaintiff admission to the boot camp because of his medical history of hypertension.id.at.the plaintiff did not attempt to raise the ada issue in the context of the criminal proceeding.instead,he filed a civil complaint alleging the department decision to exclude him from the boot camp program violated the ada.a unanimous united states supreme court ruled that the statute language unmistakably includes state prisons and prisoners within its coverage id.at,but nothing in its decision remotely su
