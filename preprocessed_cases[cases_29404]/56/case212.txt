ii.discussion 
mother section petition 
mother contends the court erred by denying her an evidentiary hearing on her section petition.we disagree.
to prevail on a section petition,the moving party must establish that new evidence or changed circumstances exist,and the proposed change would promote the best interests of the child.citation.in re th.under section,a party need only make a prima facie showing to trigger the right to proceed by way of a full hearing.citation.the prima facie showing is not met unless the facts alleged,if supported by evidence given credit at the hearing,would sustain a favorable decision on the petition.citation.in determining whether the petition makes the necessary showing,the court may consider the entire factual and procedural history of the case.citation.the petition must be liberally construed in favor of its sufficiency.citations.in re th.
we review a summary denial of a hearing on a modification petition for abuse of discretion.citation.under this standard of review,we will not disturb the decision of the trial court unless the trial court exceeded the limits of legal discretion by making an arbitrary,capricious or patently absurd determination.citation.in re th.chronic substance abuse is generally considered a serious problem and,therefore,is less likely to be satisfactorily ameliorated in the brief time between termination of services and the section hearing.in re kimberly th,fn.it is the nature of addiction that one must be clean for a much longer period than days to show real reform.in re amber th,no abuse of discretion in denying petition where mother established only a period of abstinence in re cliffton th,seven months of sobriety since relapse,while commendable,was nothing new.in re ernesto th,to support a section petition,the change in circumstances must be substantial.citation.a parent recent sobriety reflects changing,not changed,circumstances.citation.
even if the juvenile court errs in failing to hold an evidentiary hearing on a section petition,that error will be held harmless unless there is a reasonable probability that in the absence of the error a result more favorable to the petitioner would have been reached.in re,supra,th at harmless where juvenile court erroneously failed to hold a hearing on a petition in re th,erroneous denial of hearing on second petition harmless where hearing was granted on first petition and where petitioner failed to identify additional evidence she would present at hearing in re victoria th,erroneous denial of hearing on petition harmless where juvenile court had considered evidence attached to petition in periodic review hearing.
here,one of the primary bases for jurisdiction in the instant case was the sustained allegations that mother had an extensive history of substance abuse issues which placed minor at risk of harm.mother tested positive for amphetamines a month prior to minor birth.relatives reported she had drug issues,particularly with methamphetamine.mother had previous substantiated allegations regarding substance abuse issues.mother reported that she began using and selling methamphetamine a few years earlier when she lost custody of her other children.
nevertheless,while mother participated in a outpatient recovery program,it was noted that she attended less frequently than did father.indeed,there is no indication in the record that mother actually completed the program.in fact,mother subsequently had two positive drug tests in july,and one in august 
in mother petition dated september,with respect to substance abuse issues,mother attached only an undated letter noting she had been attending a celebrate recovery study group for the last four month s.the lack of a date on the letter,the lack of specificity regarding the nature of the program,and,in particular,mother failure to even allege any period of sobriety,in and of itself,establish a lack of a prima facie case for a change in circumstances.indeed,the last record of a drug test in which mother participated was the september,test,more than a year earlier.
moreover,the other primary basis for jurisdiction was mother engagement in domestic violence,not only as a victim,but also as an aggressor.the officer who investigated the two initiating incidents reported that mother was the aggressor in the first incident and the possible aggressor in the second.father reported that mother beat him.the pgf reported that parents were mutually combative and that mother had hit minor accidently in an attempt to hit father while he was carrying minor.the pa reported witnessing mother beat father,punching him in the face while he was holding minor.
however,mother only basis for alleging a change of circumstances with respect to domestic violence was her completion of a domestic violence support group.at best,the rational inference of her attendance of a support group is that it was directed at victims rather than perpetrators of domestic violence.mother never alleged she had participated in any program to address her issues with initiating domestic violence.
finally,mother assertion that it would be in the best interest of minor to return him to her care or offer her additional reunification services fails.the record reflects that mother herself reported that she lost custody of all her previous children.prior to the initiation of the proceedings in the instant case,mother was already receiving vfms.mother received months of reunification and family maintenance services in the instant case mother was out of the statutory time for continued reunification services.
cfs had to remove minor from mother custody twice in the instant case.minor was out of mother custody at less than a month old in july,until march,and then from february,to the date mother filed her petition thus,minor had spent more than half his life outside mother custody.
mother had not received unsupervised visitation since february,eight months earlier.mother testified she never missed any visitation,but this is belied by the social worker report that parents missed visitation on september.a foster parent reported that minor pulled away from mother and had no separation anxiety when visits ended.the social worker report indicated that minor did not have much reaction upon first seeing mother during visitation,mother did not engage with minor much during visitation,her interactions with him were not affectionate,and there was not a strong attachment between the two.thus,the court did not abuse its discretion in summarily denying mother petition.
counterbalanced with information provided subsequent to the court denial of mother petition regarding the relationship between minor and the pgm renders any error in the denial of a hearing harmless.minor referred to the pgm as mom.the social worker observed a clear attachment between minor and the pgm.the pgm continues to work on building a strong and secure attachment with minor by meeting his needs and providing him with structure,love,and nurturing.she had known minor since his birth.the pgm wanted to adopt minor because h e is my grandson and he deserves to have a good life he needs to be safe and in a safe,loving environment,and i feel i can give him what he needs.thus,mother failed to make a prima facie claim for a change of circumstances.regardless,even if the court erred in declining to hold a hearing on the petition,any error was harmless because mother requested relief would not have been in minor best interest.
due process 
mother contends the court violated her due process rights by preventing her from testifying regarding minor relationship with his sibling hence,effectively negating any evidentiary basis she might have had for arguing the sibling relationship exception to termination of parental rights.we agree.
while mother counsel examined mother during the section hearing,counsel asked if mother had any other children.mother responded that she did.counsel asked if any were living with her.mother responded that her middle,son lived with her.counsel for cfs objected on the basis of relevance.the court observed i not sure why this is relevant mother attorney argued well,he does have a relationship,essentially,with the maternal family,including his full siblings.i feel that it gives a bigger picture of a better picture of the relationship that he has,that it just not simply with mother,it with the entire family.the court replied except the only consideration that we have today is the relationship with the m other and the f ather.so that is the relationship that is the one required to have the scrutiny for a section hearing.
reflecting the legislature preference for adoption when possible,the sibling relationship exception contains strong language creating a heavy burden for the party opposing adoption.it only applies when the juvenile court determines that there is a compelling reason for concluding that the termination of parental rights would be detrimental to the child due to substantial interference with a sibling relationship.citation.indeed,even if adoption would interfere with a strong sibling relationship,the court must nevertheless weigh the benefit to the child of continuing the sibling relationship against the benefit the child would receive by gaining a permanent home through adoption.citation.in re celine cal th.parents have the burden of establishing the applicability of the exception.see in re megan th.
in reviewing challenges to a trial court decision as to the applicability of these exceptions,we will employ the substantial evidence or abuse of discretion standards of review depending on the nature of the challenge.in re bailey th.we will apply the substantial evidence standard of review to evaluate the evidentiary showing with respect to factual issues,such as whether the child has a close and strong bond with a sibling for the sibling relationship exception.id.at,subd.c b i,v.however,a challenge to the trial court determination of questions such as whether,given the existence of a sibling relationship,there is a compelling reason for determining that termination of parental rights would be detrimental to the child is a quintessenti
