factual and procedural background 
crescent city police sergeant erik apperson went to the masonic lodge lodge or building and saw it was on fire.the damage to the building was extensive the roof collapsed and the building contents were completely destroyed.the lodge was declared a total loss.
after learning the year old minor and his friend,michael michael,were people of interest,sergeant apperson and another law enforcement officer went to the minor house and interviewed him.initially,the minor told law enforcement officers he,his sister,and michael were in the building before the fire and that he saw an african american man exiting the building that he believed may be suspect.later,however,the minor said michael was upstairs alone the minor also said that later,michael said he,michael,lit a carpet on fire.finally and after being mirandized the minor accept ed responsibility for finding a cigarette lighter upstairs,lighting a box and leaving the building while the box was burning.the minor said he found the lighter in a desk drawer and lit a candle and then a box.and then he also said he lit a box on fire.according to sergeant apperson,the minor claimed to be playing around.he was horseplaying.
the minor said he blew on the fire to put it out and was unsuccessful in response,sergeant apperson told the minor he thought the minor blew on the fire to cause the fire to burn more.sergeant apperson explained that the minor may have denied he left the fire burning at some point in the interview,but by the end of the interview,the idea was that he he left it burning.he was aware that the fire had started and he fled the building.the minor said he fled the building because he was scared.
the minor year old sister,jenny jenny,testified that she,the minor,and michael went into the lodge and messed up everything and threw soda on the ground.they went upstairs,where they found a whole bunch of boxes and lighters and stuff.according to jenny,the minor set fire to a cardboard box he found in a storage room.right afterward,he left the room he just lit the box and took off.jenny initially testified that after the minor lit the fire,i t went out and then he blowed sic it and then it tried to go back again but the fire did not reignite.she also said,however,that the flame ignited again and the box was still burning when the minor left.then jenny said she tried to blow it out when they went down there and then i could,so i went down there with them.she explained,i was trying to blow it out and then he went out,and i said,wait,try and blow it out,and then he he tried to blow it out.it blew out and then it and then i tried to blow it out,and then it came right back up.
when the prosecutor tried to clarify the sequence of events,jenny said the minor found a box and lit it on fire.about five seconds after he set the box on fire,the group left the room and quickly walked downstairs.before they went downstairs,she and the minor blew on the box and the fire just blew out,and then and then it did light again.according to jenny,the box was not burning when the minor went downstairs.she testified she blew on the box after the minor left and the fire reignited.then she stepped on the box and the fire went out and she ran downstairs.on redirect examination,jenny said she knew the box would light on fire when she blew on it but she did it anyway.jenny estimated she saw flames for five minutes before running away.on,jenny testified the fire was not out when the minor left the room.the fire went out and then came back.
in a welfare and institutions code section petition,the people alleged the minor committed arson,subd.c and resisted a police officer.at the jurisdictional hearing,counsel for the minor argued there was insufficient evidence of willful intent to burn the building or any malice.this was some kids horsing around,engaged in playing with fire,one of the most fascinating substances humans have ever discovered.when the court asked about evidence of maliciousness,the prosecutor responded,the simple act of lighting a box that does not belong to the defendant and on a property on which he is not authorized to be in for the purposes of igniting a box for the purposes of setting a fire.
the court determined the minor committed arson in violation of section,subdivision c,explaining malicious is defined in the applicable jury instruction as when a person intentionally does a wrongful act.it appears to me that the minor knew that burning the box inside the masonic lodge was wrong.while he is only years of age,he left.he did tell anybody.he left hurriedly,may have even tried to blow out the fire.i not sure about that.but it clear to me that he knew what he did was wrong.and so that would give the maliciousness that required.the court found the minor did intend to burn the box.the court noted that jenny testimony was not critical because the minor admitted he started the fire and admitted to sergeant apperson that it was burning when he left.the court also determined the minor violated section.
at the dispositional hearing,the court declared the minor a ward of the court,ordered him to serve to months in juvenile hall,and placed him on probation after his release from custody.the court also ordered the minor to register as an arsonist pursuant to section.
