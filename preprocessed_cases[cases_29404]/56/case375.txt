elizabeth handy,under appointment by the court of appeal,for minor.
angela and erick appeal orders terminating their parental rights under welfare and institutions code section.unless otherwise indicated,further references are to the welfare and institutions code.they contend the juvenile court erred when it found that their son,michael,was likely to be adopted within a reasonable time if parental rights were terminated.the parents argue the social services agency adoption assessment report was inadequate,and the court should have granted a brief continuance to allow the social worker time to receive an updated report from michael therapist and the results of michael psychological evaluation,and to further assess his adoptability in the context of that information.the parents also argue there is insufficient evidence to support the findings that the beneficial and sibling relationship exceptions to termination of parental rights did not apply.we affirm the findings and orders.
we conclude that the juvenile court erred when it did not order a brief continuance of the section hearing to allow time to receive michael psychological evaluation and an updated report from his therapist,but the error was harmless in light of other evidence supporting the finding that michael was likely to be adopted within a reasonable time.specifically,the reports from michael teacher and caregiver support the finding that michael did not currently display any significant behavioral or emotional problems,despite earlier reports he had had significant behavioral problems while he was in the care of his mother and other relatives.we also conclude there is ample evidence to support the juvenile court finding there were no applicable exceptions to termination of parental rights.angela contention she had a beneficial relationship with michael sufficient to overcome the statutory preference for adoption is frivolous and should not have been raised on appeal.
at oral argument,we found it necessary to restate,more than once,the standard of review that applies when the issue on appeal challenges the juvenile court resolution of disputed factual questions,and to remind the appellants that this court does not substitute its judgment for that of the juvenile court.appellate practitioners would be well advised to remember it is the function of the trier of fact,not the appellate court,to determine the facts,and to cast their arguments in this court within the confines of that basic principle.bickel city of piedmont cal th,bickel appellate court views all factual matters and resolves all conflicts in the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party in re zeth cal th,zeth it is the province of the trial court to decide questions of fact and of the appellate court to decide questions of law.

michael exhibited hyperactivity,and defiant and aggressive behaviors against peers and school personnel.he hoarded food.he had severe tantrums.the social worker stated michael behaviors were and angela care for michael and understanding of his needs were minimal.according to the social worker,michael had no attachment to angela.
the juvenile court granted angela liberal supervised visits with her children twice weekly,including a visit on saturdays.angela was more affectionate with michael brothers than she was with him.she complained she had to take quality time away from joshua and jacob to spend time with michael.angela asked the social worker to place michael separately from his brothers to not give him false hope that he would return to her care.angela therapist said angela clearly did not want to resume caring for michael and continued to blame him for some of her problems.
in november the children were detained with a maternal aunt.
in december the juvenile court sustained the petition filed on michael behalf,and dismissed his brothers dependency cases.the court offered reunification services to angela and denied services to erick,who was incarcerated.
angela said she did not have time to participate in family reunification services in michael dependency case.she visited michael approximately once a month until june.
the social worker reported that michael was in good health.he was an active who liked to play with his friends.he had some problems at school with aggressive and defiant behaviors.michael kindergarten teacher reported that he was a bright,endearing child who was a quick and active thinker.at times he was so eager for attention that he shouted out or put his hands on his classmates.
michael remained with his maternal aunt until june,when the aunt asked for his removal due to her high stress levels.he began participating in therapy in august.michael was then placed with a maternal stepcousin.he was removed from that home after the cousin had an altercation with his partner.after a stay at polinsky children center pcc,michael was placed in foster care in october.
angela did not visit michael during his stay at pcc.she visited him approximately six times between october and june.according to michael caregiver,angela visits were usually clustered around the time of a juvenile court hearing.angela told the social worker she loved michael but he was difficult to handle.he did not listen to her and he acted out for attention.angela did not have time to participate in family reunification services,and said,i would rather have michael adopted into a good home.
in january the juvenile court terminated reunification services and set a section hearing.the court ordered michael to undergo a psychological evaluation.
the contested section hearing was held on june.the agency reported that michael was a happy,healthy attractive child who was shy with strangers.he was developmentally on target and doing well at school.he was affectionate with his caregiver.she had not seen any aggression,bedwetting or extreme tantrums since michael was placed with her.

the caregiver and her husband considered adopting michael.in view of their health problems,they decided adopting michael would not be in his best interests.
at the close of evidence,erick counsel asked the juvenile court to continue the section hearing to allow time to receive the results of michael psychological evaluation and the social worker reassessment of adoptive families that had expressed interest in adopting a child like michael.
the juvenile court denied the continuance.the court found that michael was likely to be adopted within a reasonable time if parental rights were terminated,and no exceptions applied that would make termination of parental rights detrimental to michael.the court terminated parental rights.
appellate motions 
on october,the agency filed a motion to augment the record with a copy of michael psychological evaluation report,dated june.the parents opposed the motion to augment the record,and filed motions to strike the respondent brief because it contained references to the results of that evaluation.
on november,this court denied the agency motion to augment the record.on november,this court denied the parents motion to strike the respondent brief,and ordered all references to that evaluation in respondent brief are stricken and will not be considered by the court.accordingly,we did not consider the references to the results of michael evaluation in respondent brief,or the evaluation itself,in reaching the conclusions set forth in this opinion.
