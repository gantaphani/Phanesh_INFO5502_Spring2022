the principal issue in this case is which of two statutes of limitations is applicable where a physician negligently fails to report suspected child abuse.
on the one hand,the general statute of limitations for a statutorily created liability code civ,subd.a such as the obligation of physicians and others mandated by statute to report reasonable suspicions of child abuse,is tolled until the minor reaches the age of majority,subd.a.on the other hand,the medical injury compensation reform act micra specifically requires that a suit be filed against a physician for professional negligence within either three years from the date of injury or sometime prior to the minor eighth birthday,whichever period is longer.we hold that allegations that a physician negligently failed to report suspected child abuse,which should have been discovered during a medical examination while rendering professional services,constitute a claim for professional negligence within the meaning of micra more restrictive statute of limitations.
factual and procedural summary 
in a complaint filed on august,plaintiff david a minor,born in june alleged three general negligence causes of action against defendants rodney cotner,defendant doctor and beverly hospital defendant hospital.as indicated in the first amended complaint,the first cause of action alleged that on october,defendant doctor observed plaintiff,who had marks on his body which should have caused a reasonable suspicion that the child had been abused.after plaintiff returned home,his father severely abused him physically,resulting in permanent and serious medical issues.and if defendant doctor had reported the suspected abuse on october,as he was required to do by statute,et,the child would not have sustained such subsequent physical abuse.
plaintiff second cause of action alleged negligence against defendant hospital based on the failure of its nurses and other health care practitioners employed by defendant hospital to fulfill their statutory duty to report to authorities their reasonable suspicions of child abuse.one of defendant hospital nurses wrote on a hospital report that there were marks on plaintiff body,which should have triggered the statutory duty to report suspected child abuse and thus allegedly prevented the subsequent abuse.
the third cause of action asserted negligence by defendant hospital in failing to fulfill its duty to ensure compliance by its doctors,nurses and other agents with the mandatory statutory requirement of reporting suspected physical abuse of children.as an alleged proximate cause of the breach of such duty,plaintiff sustained severe injuries.
defendant doctor demurred on the grounds that any statutory claim against a physician for failing to report child abuse necessarily arises out of the physician professional duties,and the claim is thus subject to the limitations period in section since plaintiff complaint was filed outside that statute of limitations,almost eleven years after the alleged malpractice and over three years after plaintiff eighth birthday,defendant doctor urged the action was barred by the statute of limitations.defendant hospital also demurred on the grounds of the statute of limitations.plaintiff opposed the demurrers,arguing that the limitations period for violation of a statutory requirement should apply,pursuant to section but should be tolled during the period of his minority,pursuant to section 
the trial court sustained the demurrers without leave to amend and then dismissed the complaint as to both defendants.
discussion 
reviewing the matter in accordance with the customary standard of appellate review,we treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,but not contentions,deductions,or conclusions of fact or law.moore conliffe cal th,d.a demurrer challenges the validity of the causes of action and places at issue the legal merits of the action on assumed facts.carman alvord cal d.
at issue here is the application of the statute of limitations in section,originally enacted in stats,ch,but amended in as part of micra stats,second,ch.the amended statute reduced the maximum limitations period for professional negligence actions against health care providers from four years to three years after the date of injury,and it tolled this period only in certain specified circumstances.see young haines cal d.with respect to minors,an action not tolled must be brought within three years from the date of the wrongful act or by the minor eighth birthday,whichever occurs later.
section was adopted as a response to a perceived major health care crisis in the state of california attributable to skyrocketing malpractice premium costs and resulting in a potential breakdown of the health delivery system citation.young haines,supra,cal d at.the legislature intent in enacting micra was to restrict the tolling provisions in malpractice actions.the long tail claims,the legislature noted,had been a contributing cause of the perceived malpractice insurance crisis which precipitated micra.citations.cal d at.evidently,the legislature found a relationship between the malpractice insurance crisis and the former statute of limitations.commentators had observed that the delayed discovery rule and the resulting long tail claims made it difficult to set premiums at an appropriate level.citations.presumably,the legislative goal in amending section was to give insurers greater certainty about their liability for any given period of coverage,so that premiums could be set to cover costs.id.at.
in the present case,the alleged medical negligence occurred on october.under section,a timely complaint would have to have been filed prior to plaintiff eighth birthday,which was in june of.the complaint herein,however,was filed on august,and thus was untimely by over three years.
plaintiff contention that the applicable limitations period is three years under section,subdivision a,which is tolled during the period of his minority under section,subdivision a,is without merit.the fundamental problem with that contention is that the present action is one for professional negligence,a situation specifically defined and encompassed by the applicable statute of limitations in section.
as defined in section,subdivision,professional negligence means a negligent act or omission to act by a health care provider in the rendering of professional services,which act or omission is the proximate cause of a personal injury or wrongful death,provided that such services are within the scope of services for which the provider is licensed and which are not within any restriction imposed by the licensing agency or licensed hospital.italics added.plaintiff alleges that in defendant doctor capacity as a physician at defendant hospital he negligently omitted to act in a manner he should have regarding the statutory reporting requirement,and it is undisputed that he did so while rendering professional medical services to plaintiff.thus,section on its face applies to the present situation.
plaintiff urges that the general statute of limitations and its tolling should apply because t he failure to report suspected child abuse is more than mere professional negligence.to the contrary,the conduct alleged in the present case is professional negligence and nothing more.
under penal code section physicians,licensed nurses and other specified health care workers are mandated reporters with a duty to report reasonable suspicions of child abuse or neglect,but only when discovered in the context of their professional capacity or within the scope of their employment,subd.a.here,since defendant doctor mandated duty to report suspected child abuse arose when he was acting within the course and scope of the performance of his professional duties,the statute of limitations pertaining to professional negligence must apply.this is not a case where the failure to report is premised on any theory other than negligence.had plaintiff alleged that defendant physician intentionally concealed his failure to report see,subd.b or that he intentionally failed to report known or suspected abuse,the restrictive limitations period
