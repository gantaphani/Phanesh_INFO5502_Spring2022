one night,a female friend of the mother who was visiting from out of state called.when officers arrived,she reported that the father and the mother had been in their bedroom when she heard the father arguing with the mother and then hitting her.she went into the bedroom,where she saw the father pushing and swinging wildly at the mother as they stood over.she pulled the father away,then took out to the kitchen.
when the friend returned to the bedroom,the father pushed the mother onto a bed and held her down.meanwhile,crawled back into the bedroom.the friend pulled the father away again,then took out to the kitchen again and placed him in a jumper.
the mother followed,pursued by the father.the father then grabbed the mother and threw her down on top of.in doing so,he fell on top of both the mother and.when the friend pulled the father away yet again,he hit her in the eye.the friend called.the father threatened to come back and shoot both her and the mother,then fled.

the maternal grandmother reported that the father had been physically abusing the mother for a long time.the mother minimize d the domestic violence between her and the father and refused to seek shelter elsewhere.as a result,was detained and the riverside county department of public social services the department filed a dependency petition concerning him.
after about two weeks,was placed with the maternal grandmother.
shortly before the jurisdictional hearing,the father was released from custody.
on march,at the jurisdictional hearing,the juvenile court found that it had jurisdiction based on failure to protect.welf,subd.b.it authorized the mother to reside with the maternal grandmother and,provided that she not be left alone with 
also on march,the criminal court issued a restraining order against the father criminal order it was issued on judicial council form criminal protective violence.it named as protected persons the mother and.the criminal order provided,among other things,that the father must not harass,strike,threaten,assault sexually or otherwise,follow,stalk,molest,destroy or damage personal or real property,disturb the peace,keep under surveillance,or block movements of the protected persons.the criminal order also provided,t his order takes precedence over any conflicting protective order if the protected person is a victim of domestic violence 
on march,at the request of the department,the juvenile court issued an ex parte temporary restraining order against the father,as well as an order to show cause osc why a restraining order after hearing should not issue.
in april,at the hearing on the osc,the father counsel objected to the proposed restraining order.she noted that the criminal court had already issued a restraining order,then added father position at this time is that that a sufficient restraining order 
if the mother would like the maternal grandmother added to the restraining order,that can always be done with the current restraining order in the criminal court.we can always go back to that court and have that modified.but at this point in time,i think it would be improper to have another restraining order from this court that would actually be in contradiction to that restraining order.it not really a modification if we adding something that more restrictive.
the juvenile court nevertheless issued the restraining order juvenile order.it was issued on judicial council form restraining.it named as protected persons the mother,and the maternal grandmother.much like the criminal order if more grammatically,the juvenile order provided that the father must not harass,attack,strike,threaten,assault sexually or otherwise,hit,follow,stalk,molest,destroy personal property of,disturb the peace of,keep under surveillance,or block movements of the protected persons.

finally,the juvenile order provided if a criminal restraining order form conflicts with a juvenile restraining order form,a law enforcement agency must enforce the criminal order any nonconflicting terms of the juvenile custody or visitation order remain in full force.
the propriety of issuing a separate restraining order 
the father contends that,because the criminal court had already issued a restraining order,the juvenile court lacked jurisdiction to issue its own restraining order.
