introduction 
among other statutes,the safe neighborhoods and schools act proposition or the act amended health and safety code section to provide misdemeanor or felony punishment as follows 
a person shall be punished by imprisonment in a county jail for a period of not more than one year,except that such person may instead be punished pursuant to subdivision h of section of the penal code if that person has one or more prior convictions for an offense specified in clause iv of subparagraph c of paragraph of subdivision e of section of the penal code or for an offense requiring registration pursuant to subdivision c of section of the penal code,at subd.a.
for defendant robert angel zamora violation of this drug possession offense,the trial court sentenced him as a felon under subdivision h of penal code section based on defendant prior juvenile adjudication for sexual battery in violation of section.an adult convicted of this offense is required to register as a sex offender under section,subdivision c.defendant contends the trial court erred by treating his juvenile adjudication as a prior conviction in direct contravention of welfare and institutions code section an order adjudging a minor to be a ward of the juvenile court shall not be deemed a conviction of a crime for any purpose.the attorney general relies on alejandro superior court th alejandro,to argue the act,in the broad sense,applies to all aspects of juvenile proceedings and applies to juveniles for all purposes.although we agree the act applies generally to juveniles as held in alejandro,we conclude the search for statutory intent in this case calls for a more narrow and limited approach,which focuses on the statutory language and settled case law interpreting this language.in turn,this approach leads us to conclude defendant juvenile adjudication for a violation of section is not a prior conviction as used in health and safety code section and does not disqualify him from misdemeanor sentencing.
in the unpublished portion of this opinion we reject the attorney general request for dismissal of the appeal due to defendant failure to obtain a certificate of probable cause.
we reverse the trial court finding defendant offense constitutes a felony instead of a misdemeanor.
background 
prior to november,a violation of health and safety code section,subdivision a was a wobbler,meaning it could be a felony or a misdemeanor,depending upon the punishment imposed.see,subd.a.on november,voters enacted proposition,which went into effect the next day.cal,art.ii,subd.a people rivera th.as a result,certain drug and theft offenses are now punished as misdemeanors,unless committed by statutorily defined ineligible offenders.people gonzales cal th.
proposition additionally created a process by which a person who is serving a felony sentence for an offense made a misdemeanor by the act can petition for a recall of sentence and be resentenced to a misdemeanor.if,however,service of the felony sentence is complete,that person can petition to have the felony conviction designated as a misdemeanor.people gonzales,supra,cal th at,fn,subds.a f.these provisions do not apply,however,to persons who have one or more prior convictions for an offense specified in clause iv of subparagraph c of paragraph of subdivision e of section or for an offense requiring registration pursuant to subdivision c of section,subd.i.
on march,a felony complaint charged defendant with possession,on or about march,of a controlled substance in violation of health and safety code section,subdivision a count.the complaint alleged the offense was a felony,defendant having previously suffered a conviction for an offense specified in section,subdivision e c iv,or for an offense requiring registration pursuant to section,subdivision c,to wit,a juvenile adjudication for violation of section sexual battery.count of the complaint charged defendant with unlawfully identifying himself to a police officer in violation of section,subdivision a,a misdemeanor.
on march,following extensive unreported discussions,the trial court found defendant not eligible for relief under section based on his prior offense.the court also found defendant did not have a serious or violent felony under section,subdivision e,and so was eligible for felony drug probation under section.defendant then pled no contest to count as a felony and count was dismissed.imposition of sentence was suspended,and defendant was placed on formal probation,pursuant to the provisions of section,for three years.
on may,the probation department requested defendant postrelease community supervision prcs be revoked for violation of the conditions thereof,including commission of new offenses on may,the probation department requested defendant drug probation be revoked and that he be excluded from further participation in the treatment program,based on his arrest on the new offenses.
on may,a status conference was held concerning the alleged violation of probation.defense counsel made an oral motion to reduce defendant current offense to a misdemeanor on the ground the alleged prior disqualifying offense was a juvenile adjudication not a conviction citing welf.inst.code,whereas a conviction was required to disqualify defendant from misdemeanor treatment.because defendant was not required to register under section,subdivision c based on a juvenile adjudication,counsel pointed out defendant does not have to register.the prosecutor opposed the request,arguing defendant falls under a which insinuates after if you go to cya on this type offense,you have to register.i understand local authorities no longer require him to register.i would submit under c where that crime appears this person is not eligible for reduction.
the trial court denied what it referred to as the petition.it reasoned that under health and safety code section,a person remained subject to felony punishment if he or she had one or more convictions for an offense specified in section,subdivision e c iv,or requiring registration under section,subdivision c.the court noted section,subdivision d specified when a juvenile adjudication constituted a serious or violent felony.it found a juvenile adjudication for violating section to be a serious or violent felony conviction for purposes of proposition.because it is listed as an offense requiring registration pursuant to section,subdivision c,the court found whether or not defendant has to register to be irrelevant.accordingly,it found defendant disqualified under health and safety code section and so denied the request to reduce the current offense to a misdemeanor.the matter was then set for further hearing on the alleged probation violation,pending the outcome of defendant new charges in another case.
on june,defendant filed a notice of appeal.the notice specified the appeal was based on the sentence or other matters occurring after the plea that do not affect the validity of the plea.cal.rules of court,rule b.no request was made for a certificate of probable cause.
discussion 
i.the appeal is operative,despite the lack of a probable cause certificate 
the attorney general contends the order denying defendant request to reduce his current offense to a misdemeanor is not appealable,and the appeal must be dismissed,due to defendant failure to obtain a certificate of probable cause.under the somewhat unusual circumstances of this case,we disagree.
section requires a defendant to obtain a certificate of probable cause from the superior court in order to file an appeal from a judgment of conviction entered after a guilty or no contest plea,including an appeal challenging the validity of the plea people mendez cal th.however,n otwithstanding the broad language of section,it is settled that two types of issues may be raised in a guilty or nolo contendere plea appeal without issuance of a certificate search and seizure issues for which an appeal is provided under section,subdivision m and issues regarding proceedings held subsequent to the plea for the purpose of determining the degree of the crime and the penalty to be imposed.people panizzon cal th,see cal.rules of court,rule b.
the california supreme court has cautioned that the certificate requirement of section should be applied in a strict manner.people mendez,supra,cal th at see in re chavez cal th.that court has strongly criticized the practice in some appellate decisions of reaching the merits of the appeal in the interests of judicial economy,notwithstanding the defendant noncompliance with that requirement.mendez,supra,at people panizzon,supra,cal th at,fn.people padfield d,fn.people vest d,people mcmillan d.it has concluded relaxing the certificate requirement in search of judicial economy has been a futile exercise that must be abandoned.mendez,supra,at see,fn.as a result,in the absence of compliance with the certificate requirement,the appeal is not operative and the reviewing court must dismiss it.id.at.
in assessing whether an appeal mandates a certificate of probable cause,courts examine the substance of the appeal.t he crucial issue is what the defendant is challenging,not the time or manner in which the challenge is made.people ribero cal d.for instance,a claim a guilty plea was induced by an illusory promise is a certificate issue,as it is a question going to the legality of the proceedings and,specifically,the validity of the plea.people panizzon,supra,cal th at.likewise,a certificate must be obtained to secure review of the lawfulness of the maximum term imposed pursuant to the negotiated plea,notwithstanding the multiple punishment prohibition of section.people shelton cal th.
in the present case,after the trial court found defendant not eligible for relief under section to have his current offense treated as a misdemeanor under proposition,defendant agreed to plead no contest to that offense as a felony.it appears defendant could have challenged the court ruling by an appeal at that point see people mutter th,had he done so,we may have agreed with the attorney general that such appeal was not operative absent a certificate of probable cause,since defendant claim would have been tantamount to a challenge to the validity of his plea to the felony count 
defendant did not appeal at that point,however.rather,as set out ante,he waited until he allegedly violated his probation.he then made an oral request to reduce his current offense to a misdemeanor.insofar as the record shows,defendant request was treated as a petition brought pursuant to section indeed,the trial court referred to the request as the petition.there was no suggestion defendant was asking merely to have the trial court reconsider its previous ruling no mention was made that there had even been a prior ruling.the people did not argue the provisions of section did not apply.
given the procedural timeline of this case and the fact the court and parties treated defendant request as a petition for reduction under the act,we conclude defendant was not required to obtain a certificate of probable cause in order to appeal from the trial court ruling.under the circumstances,the appeal was based on grounds that arose after entry of the plea and did not affect the plea validity.rule b b see harris superior court cal th,people not entitled to have plea agreement set aside,on ground they would be deprived of benefit of bargain,when defendant seeks to have sentence recalled under.
ii.defendant juvenile adjudication did not disqualify him from misdemeanor sentencing under proposition 
defendant contends the trial court erred by ruling his prior juvenile adjudication for sexual battery elevated his current violation of health and safety code section,subdivision a to a felony under the act.he points to the fact both section,subdivision i and health and safety code section,subdivision a refer,in terms of ineligibility for misdemeanor treatment,to prior convictions for specified offenses.he does not dispute an adult convicted of violating section would be subject to sex offender registration,subd.c.rather,he points to welfare and institutions code section,which states an order adjudging a minor to be a ward of the juvenile court shall not be deemed a conviction of a crime for any purpose.he observes courts have held a juvenile is not convicted of a present or prior offense for purposes of applying section in re anthony d,and that juvenile adjudications are not convictions for purposes of enhancement under section,subdivision a people west d.he acknowledges a juvenile adjudication that constitutes a conviction for purposes of sentencing under the three strikes law citations also constitutes a conviction for purposes of determining eligibility for three strikes resentencing under section,subdivision e.people arias th,arias.he correctly notes,however,unlike the juvenile offense at issue in arias,sexual battery does not constitute a serious or violent felony,subd.c,subd.c and is not listed in welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b,and so it does not constitute a strike,subd.d,subd.b.
we agree the resentencing scheme contained in section,and at issue in arias,is not identical to that contained in proposition.however,that does not end our inquiry nor our search for statutory intent.we begin our analysis with a broader context view of proposition.
in alejandro,supra,th,the court held 
t he offense reclassification provisions set forth in section apply to juveniles.welfare and institutions code section provides for a minor to be declared a ward of the juvenile court when the minor commits a crime set forth in the penal code and other codes defining criminal offenses primarily in the adult criminal context.the section thereby incorporates the entire body of laws defining criminal offenses as the basis for juvenile wardship jurisdiction.accordingly,when a criminal offense is reclassified from a felony to a misdemeanor in the adult context as occurred under proposition the reclassification likewise applies in juvenile wardship proceedings.by adding section to the penal code,the proposition voters made this reclassification available to qualifying offenders on a retroactive basis.thus,section concerns the very same offenses that are incorporated into the juvenile wardship proceedings via welfare and institutions code section,and it follows that section offense reclassification provisions are equally applicable to juvenile offenders.id.at.
the court determined voters intended proposition to apply,in the broader context,to juveniles.id.at.
this case does not ask us to determine the reach and breadth of proposition application to juvenile proceedings generally.the issue before us is whether defendant was disqualified from misdemeanor treatment under health and safety code section because his juvenile adjudication of a violation of section was intended by the voters to serve as a prior conviction.see in re derrick cal th,here there is no broader context to expand upon the clear language chosen by the voters.like arias,alejandro does not answer this question.however,there are two noteworthy cases,though distinguishable,which have spoken on a similar issue.
recently,the court in people sledge th,held s ome felony juvenile adjudications are disqualifying prior convictions for proposition purposes under section i as a matter of law.in determining legislative intent,the court looked to the actual language of section,subdivision i,and explained as follows 
the provisions of this section shall not apply to persons who have one or more prior convictions for an offense specified in clause iv of subparagraph c of paragraph of subdivision e of section or for an offense requiring registration pursuant to subdivision c of section.italics added.
in turn,clause iv of subparagraph c of paragraph of subdivision e of section section e c iv applies when the defendant suffered a prior serious violent felony conviction,as defined in subdivision d of this section,for any of the following felonies.italics added.the list of felonies includes various sex,violence and homicide offenses,which are sometimes referred to as super strikes.see people zamarripa th,zamarripa.
finally,subdivision d of section section d provides a prior juvenile adjudication shall constitute a prior serious violent felony conviction for purposes of sentence enhancement if a the juvenile was years of age or older at the time.b the prior offense is listed in subdivision b of section of the welfare and institutions code or described in paragraph or as a serious violent felony.c the juvenile was found to be a fit and proper subject to be dealt with under the juvenile court law.d the juvenile was adjudged a ward of the juvenile court because the person committed an offense listed in subdivision b of section of the welfare and institutions code.italics added.
reading these statutes together,and giving the unambiguous words in them their usual and ordinary meaning,we conclude a felony juvenile adjudication is a disqualifying prior conviction within the meaning of section i if it is one of the super strike offenses listed in section e c iv if it is either an offense listed in welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b,or an offense described in section d,paragraph or as a serious or violent felony and if all of the other conditions set out in section d are satisfied.
our conclusion that these specific felony juvenile adjudications are disqualifying prior convictions under section i is consistent with at least one of the voter expressed intents in enacting proposition.among its stated purposes is to e nsure that people convicted of murder,rape,and child molestation will not benefit from this act.citation.zamarripa,supra,th at.people sledge,supra,th at.
in sledge,the prior juvenile adjudication at issue was for forcible rape.people sledge,supra,th at.the court then concluded 
defendant argues juvenile adjudications are not disqualifying prior convictions because section i does not expressly refer to juvenile adjudications,and because juvenile adjudications have historically been treated differently than adult criminal convictions.we do not agree.
since the definition of conviction of a serious violent felony contained in section d is incorporated in section i,and since that definition specifically includes designated juvenile adjudications,a person who has been adjudicated for an offense listed in section d will be excluded.while juvenile adjudications and adult convictions are distinguished in many other contexts,for the purposes of the exclusion under section i,they are treated the same.couzens bigelow,proposition the safe neighborhoods and schools act may,as of,italics added.people sledge,supra,th at.
a violation of section is not one of the super strike offenses listed in section,subdivision e c iv furthermore,while it is an offense requiring adults to register under section,subdivision c,section,not section,governs the registration requirements of juvenile offenders.section does not include section on its list of offenses requiring registration.see,subd.c.thus,this case is distinguishable from people sledge because defendant juvenile adjudication does not meet the requirements for an offense listed in section,subdivision d.
we conclude defendant juvenile adjudication for an offense not listed in section,subdivision d or e did not elevate his current drug possession conviction to a felony under proposition.health saf.code,subd.a,subd.i.in doing so,we do not disagree with the reasoning of alejandro that proposition applies to juvenile proceedings generally.however,another recent case is more helpful to us in reaching our conclusion.
in people dunn th dunn,the defendant was years old when he allegedly committed two acts of forcible rape in concert with another and three acts of forcible sexual penetration.the court found the allegations true,adjudged him a ward of the court,and committed him to the california youth authority for a term.following his discharge,dunn was required to register as a sex offender under current section.dunn,supra,at.as an adult,dunn committed felonies that landed him in prison,including a robbery strike offense.eventually,dunn committed a felony petty theft with a prior in violation of section and was sentenced back to prison for months.after the passage of proposition,dunn petitioned to have his petty theft conviction reduced to a misdemeanor under the act.dunn,at.
section is one of the sections amended by proposition.however,the amendment of section did not add a conviction requirement for exclusion of sex offenders.as stated in dunn,offenders are disqualified from misdemeanor treatment if they are required to register pursuant to the sex offender registration act,subd.b.juvenile sex offender registry is part of the sex offender registration act.dunn,supra,th at.thus,unlike health and safety code section,section does not require a prior conviction for an offense requiring registration pursuant to subdivision c of section.as the dunn court noted 
petty theft with a prior is not a misdemeanor under the act for those who are required to register pursuant to the sex offender registration act,subd.b.juvenile sex offender registry is a part of the sex offender registration act.
if the electorate intended to make only adult offenders ineligible for relief under section,it knew how to do so.health saf.code,pen.code,subd.i.a person is ineligible for relief under the other proposition statutes only if they are a person with one or more convictions for an offense requiring registration pursuant to subdivision c of s ection adult sex offender registration.health saf.code,pen.code,subd.i see health saf.code,pen.code,in re derrick,supra,cal th.
dunn asks us to construe section to make only adult sex offenders ineligible.he contends this would best effectuate the electorate intent it is required by the rule of lenity the disparity between section and other proposition statutes reflects a drafting error and the disparity violates state and federal equal protection principles.we disagree with each of these contentions.
the electorate intent to withhold relief from juvenile sex offenders who commit serial thefts is unambiguously expressed in section.people canty cal th,if the language is clear and unambiguous,we follow the plain meaning of the measure.the rule of lenity does not apply because section is not reasonably susceptible to two constructions.people avery cal th.a person is disqualified if they are required to register under the sex offender registration act,subd.b.section does not reflect a drafting error there is no compelling evidence the electorate intended a different result.people garcia cal th,we may reform a statute only when compelled by necessity and supported by firm evidence of the drafters true intent.the electorate advanced its goal of r equir ing misdemeanors for nonserious,nonviolent crimes like petty theft and drug possession,while withholding relief from all sex offenders who commit serial theft,subd.see voter information guide,text of.
section does not violate equal protection guarantees because juvenile sex offenders who commit recidivist theft crimes and juvenile sex offenders who commit other proposition crimes are not similarly situated.dunn,supra,th at.
of course,dunn did not address the specific issue we confront here.nonetheless,its logic in construing the statute before it vis the other statutes amended by the act is undeniable,and it works equally well both ways.this is true because the rules of statutory construction guide the analysis.as stated in in re derrick,supra,cal th 
the objective of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent.citations.to determine that intent,we turn first to the words of the statute,giving them their usual and ordinary meaning.citations.when the statutory language is clear,we need go no further.if,however,the language supports more than one reasonable interpretation,we look to a variety of extrinsic aids,including the objects to be achieved,the evils to be remedied,the legislative history,the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part,and contemporaneous administrative construction,as well as questions of public policy.citations.
under section,subdivision a e,a court may order registration for unlisted offenses if it finds at the time of conviction or sentencing that the person committed the offense as a result of sexual compulsion or for purposes of sexual gratification.italic
