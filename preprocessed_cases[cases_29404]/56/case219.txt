turning to disposition,both parents argued they were entitled to reunification services because the agency had filed a new section petition instead of a petition under section to terminate the guardianship.the agency disagreed.noting the case was in the postpermanency phase,the agency argued services were not required.moreover,the agency noted the parents would have to prove reunification was in best interest to be entitled to services.the court agreed with the agency.the court explained the case did not return to square one after termination of guardianship and noted it was the parents inability to reunify with after receiving services that resulted in the guardianship.while acknowledging the cases differed on the procedure to use to terminate guardianship,or,the court stated the cases broadly considered whether due process was met.finding the parents had notice the agency sought to terminate the guardianship and set a new permanency plan based on the agency section petition and jurisdiction and disposition report,the court found due process satisfied.

discussion 
three years after establishing a legal guardianship,the agency sought to terminate it and set a new permanency planning hearing for.at issue in father writ petition is whether the agency took the right procedural steps to terminate the guardianship and whether father was prejudiced by any failure to do so.we conclude the agency should have filed a section petition to terminate the guardianship and erred by instead filing a section petition.however,we conclude the error was harmless,as it is not reasonably probable the juvenile court would have awarded father reunification services had the agency used the proper procedure.
