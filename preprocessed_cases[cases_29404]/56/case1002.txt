after a jury trial,respondent,christopher,was adjudicated delinquent for the offense of first degree murder ilcs west.the trial court imposed both a juvenile sentence and an adult sentence pursuant to the extended juvenile jurisdiction ejj statute of the juvenile court act of ilcs west.the appellate court affirmed respondent conviction,but reversed his adult sentence.d.the main issue before this court is whether the doctrine prohibits the designation of a case as an ejj prosecution after the appellate court affirms the denial of a motion to prosecute a juvenile as an adult under section of the act ilcs west.we hold it does not and reverse the appellate court modification of respondent sentence.we also affirm respondent conviction.in doing so,we hold the trial court did not err in determining respondent did not unambiguously invoke his right to counsel.
background 
on january,willie lomax was shot and killed.soon thereafter,respondent,who at the time was years old,was arrested and taken into custody for the shooting.with his mother present,he was questioned by two chicago police department detectives.ultimately,respondent provided oral and statements admitting his involvement in the shooting 
on february,the state filed a petition for adjudication of wardship charging respondent with murder.the state also filed a motion to prosecute respondent as an adult pursuant to section of the juvenile court act,which gives a juvenile court discretion to permit the prosecution of a minor under the state criminal laws ilcs west.this procedure is known as a discretionary transfer of jurisdiction ilcs west.after a hearing,the trial court denied the state discretionary transfer motion,and the state appealed.
the appellate court affirmed the trial court denial of the state motion.in re christopher,d,unpublished order under supreme court rule.initially,it rejected the state contention that respondent was engaged in adult activities to such an extent that his behavior warranted transfer.the appellate court then reasoned that the trial court considered all the appropriate statutory factors in ruling on the state motion.according to the appellate court,the trial court correctly gave the seriousness of the alleged crime and respondent history of delinquency the most weight.the former factor weighed against respondent,because first degree murder is a serious crime,but the latter factor weighed in his favor,because he had only one prior station adjustment.the remaining six factors enumerated in the discretionary transfer statute were equally split.respondent culpability,premeditated actions,and use of a deadly weapon all weighed against him,but his age,his willingness to participate meaningfully in available services,and the adequacy of the punishment or services available in the juvenile system all weighed in respondent favor.the appellate court concluded that the record supported the trial court findings with respect to each statutory factor.therefore,the appellate court held the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the state motion.in re christopher.
after the appellate court issued its mandate,respondent moved to quash his arrest for lack of probable cause,and to suppress any evidence obtained as a result of his arrest.respondent also moved separately to suppress the statements he made to the police while in custody.the trial court denied both motions.
on june,the state filed a motion to designate respondent case as an ejj prosecution under section of the juvenile court act ilcs west.when a juvenile court designates a case as an ejj prosecution,the minor subject to the ejj prosecution is entitled to a jury trial.ilcs west.if the trial results in a guilty verdict,the trial court must impose a juvenile sentence and an adult sentence,staying the adult sentence on the condition that the minor not violate the provisions of the juvenile sentence.ilcs west.the trial court granted the state ejj motion,and the case proceeded to a jury trial.
at trial,the jury found respondent guilty of murder.therefore,in accordance with section,the trial court committed respondent to the illinois department of corrections,juvenile division,until the age of ilcs west and imposed an adult sentence of years imprisonment ilcs west,staying the latter on the condition respondent successfully complete his juvenile sentence.
respondent appealed both his conviction and sentence.d at.with respect to the sentence,the appellate court found the trial court erred in designating respondent case as an ejj prosecution and,accordingly,in imposing a stayed adult sentence.d at.specifically,the appellate court held that the doctrine barred the application of section to respondent case.d at.the court reasoned that the state ejj motion was directed toward the same ultimate issue as the state discretionary transfer motion,which the trial court denied,and which was affirmed on appeal.see d at.therefore,the appellate court reversed respondent adult sentence.d at.in addition,based on its interpretation of section and section,the appellate court held the legislature intended discretionary transfer motions and ejj motions to be filed simultaneously.d at.the appellate court rejected respondent claims that section violates the principles of apprendi new jersey,d d at,and is unconstitutionally vague d at.
with respect to respondent conviction,the appellate court held the trial court did not err in denying respondent motion to suppress his statements to the police.d at.the appellate court also upheld the trial court denial of respondent motion to quash his arrest and suppress related evidence.d at.therefore,the appellate court affirmed respondent conviction.d at.
the state filed a petition for leave to appeal with this court.we allowed the state petition to address whether the doctrine bars the designation of a case as an ejj prosecution after the appellate court affirms the denial of a discretionary transfer motion.we also permitted the juvenile law center and a number of other organizations concerned with the welfare of minors to file an amicus curiae brief in support of respondent.
prior to oral argument,the state filed a motion to dismiss certain issues respondent raised on as moot.we ordered the state motion to be taken with the case.as a preliminary matter,we address this motion.
the issues on fall into three categories.first,respondent claims section is unconstitutionally vague.he argues the statute is unconstitutionally vague on its face because it fails to provide adequate notice to a minor as to what acts violate the conditions ilcs west of the minor juvenile sentence for purposes of lifting the stay on the minor adult sentence.he also argues section is unconstitutionally vague on its face because it encourages arbitrary and capricious enforcement of a minor adult sentence by failing to specify what acts violate the conditions of the minor juvenile sentence.in addition,respondent argues section is unconstitutionally vague as applied to him because the trial court did not specifically identify the conditions attached to his juvenile sentence,thereby failing to provide him with adequate notice as to what acts could trigger his stayed adult sentence.respondent also argues the statute is unconstitutionally vague as applied to him because the trial court did not specifically identify the conditions attached to his juvenile sentence,thereby encouraging the arbitrary and capricious imposition of his adult sentence.
second,respondent claims two apprendi violations.he argues the initial designation of his case as an ejj prosecution violated apprendi because it increased his penalty for the alleged offense beyond the statutory maximum absent proof to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt of the factors necessary to designate a case as an ejj prosecution.respondent reasons that the trial court denial of the state motion to prosecute him as an adult effectively set his maximum sentence at commitment to juvenile detention until the age of.the designation of his case as an ejj prosecution,he concludes,exceeded this maximum.additionally,respondent argues the procedure in section for lifting the stay on a minor adult sentence violates apprendi.respondent reasons that section impermissibly allows a trial judge to extend a minor sentence beyond the statutory maximum after finding by a preponderance of the evidence that the minor committed a new offense or violated the conditions of the juvenile sentence.he reiterates that the applicable maximum sentence is commitment to juvenile detention until the minor birthday.
finally,respondent raises a fifth amendment claim.he argues that while he was in police custody,he invoked his right to counsel,and this right was not honored.accordingly,he concludes the trial court should have suppressed the statements he made to the police.
in its motion to dismiss,the state points out that respondent turned while this appeal was pending,successfully completing his juvenile sentence.the state concedes respondent fifth amendment claim may not be moot because it relates to the validity of his conviction,not to his sentence.it argues,however,that this court can not grant respondent any effectual relief on the other issues raised in his.the state further asserts that the issue of whether the doctrine bars the designation of respondent case as an ejj prosecution falls within the public interest exception to the mootness doctrine.
in objection,respondent requests that this court dismiss as moot all of the issues related to the designation of his case as an ejj prosecution,including the issue.he also asserts his fifth amendment claim is not moot and should not be dismissed.in addition,respondent argues that if this court considers the state issue under the public interest exception to the mootness doctrine,it should also consider respondent vagueness and apprendi claims.
the threshold question before us is whether the issues raised in this appeal are moot.an issue on appeal becomes moot where events occurring after the filing of the appeal render it impossible for the reviewing court to grant effectual relief to the complaining party.people roberson.the mootness doctrine stems from the fear that parties to a resolved dispute lack a stake in its outcome sufficient to ensure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumination of difficult questions.baker carr,d,quoted in roberson,at.in general,this court will not consider moot issues.in re robert.
respondent fifth amendment claim is not moot.this court has previously acknowledged that the completion of a defendant sentence renders a challenge to the sentence moot,but not a challenge to the conviction.people lynn.nullification of a conviction may hold important consequences for a defendant.lynn,at.respondent fifth amendment claim calls into question the validity of his conviction and therefore is not moot.
on the contrary,the issues raised by the state and by respondent regarding the designation of respondent case as an ejj prosecution are moot.under section,the successful completion of the juvenile sentence imposed on a minor in an ejj prosecution terminates the minor adult sentence.ilcs west.respondent successfully completed his juvenile sentence upon turning.therefore,he is no longer subject to the adult sentence imposed by the trial court pursuant to section.as a result,this court can not grant any meaningful relief to the state or to respondent by ruling on the validity of the trial court ejj designation.
while this court generally will not consider moot issues,it may choose to review such issues under the public interest exception to the mootness doctrine.robert,at.therefore,we must inquire whether the moot issues raised by the state and by respondent fall within the public interest exception.the exception applies when an issue is public in nature,it is likely to recur,and an authoritative determination of the issue is desirable for the future guidance of public officers.in re mary ann.the exception is construed narrowly,and requires a clear showing of each criterion.in re adoption of walgreen,ill d.
the issue raised by the state is public in nature,because it pertains to the administration of the juvenile justice system.the issue is also likely to recur.it has the potential to arise anytime a minor eligible for discretionary transfer is prosecuted.at oral argument,respondent argued the issue implicates only the facts of this case.we disagree.the appellate court holding effectively precludes the state from ever filing an ejj motion after the denial of a discretionary transfer motion is affirmed on appeal,regardless of the underlying facts of the case.finally,an authoritative determination of the issue is desirable for the future guidance of public officers.in assessing the desirability of an authoritative determination,this court has consistently looked to whether there is conflicting case law on the issue in question.see,in re marriage of,no authoritative determination needed because no conflicting case law in re,same walgreen,at,same robert,at,authoritative determination needed because of conflicting case law people roberson,same mary ann,at,commonwealth edison will county collector,in re,same lucas lakin,same.while the appellate court decision in this case does not directly conflict with prior case law regarding doctrine,none of the cases cited by the appellate court apply the doctrine to bar consideration of an issue defined by a different statutory section than the issue determined in the first appeal.compare d at,with people tenner,people patterson,people partee,people rodriguez,d,lake bluff heating air conditioning supply,harris trust savings bank,d,miscevich commonwealth edison,d.moreover,the appellate court did not clearly explain whether its conclusion that the state must simultaneously file a motion for discretionary transfer and an ejj motion is dicta,or a necessary implication of its holding that the doctrine bars the consideration of an ejj motion after the denial of a discretionary transfer motion is affirmed on appeal.see d at.for these reasons,we find that an authoritative determination of the issue is desirable to guide juvenile judges in the disposition of motions for discretionary transfer and ejj motions.because the issue meets the three criteria of the public interest exception,we choose to consider it on the merits.
we next turn to respondent vagueness claims.we acknowledge at the outset that facial and as applied vagueness challenges to section have the potential to recur anytime a case is designated as an ejj prosecution.moreover,whether section is unconstitutionally vague on its face is an issue that is public in nature,because if the statute is unconstitutionally vague on its face,it has no valid application.see people wilson,noting that where a statute does not affect first amendment rights,it will not be declared unconstitutionally vague unless it is not capable of any valid application.whether section is unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant,however,is an issue specific to the facts of defendant case.therefore,it is not public in nature.furthermore,we do not believe an authoritative determination of either of the vagueness claims raised by respondent is necessary at this time.our research discloses that only one appellate court decision besides the case before us has addressed a vagueness challenge to section.see in re,d.the appellate court resolution of the vagueness challenge in is not inconsistent with the appellate court discussion of respondent vagueness claims in this case.compare,d at,holding respondent had no standing to raise vagueness challenge to section,with d at,holding the term offense,as used in section,is not unconstitutionally vague.we are aware that neither the instant appellate court decision nor addresses the specific arguments respondent raises before this court in support of his claims.this,however,merely further confirms that,as yet,there is no need for an authoritative pronouncement on vagueness challenges to section.for these reasons,respondent and claims do not fall within the public interest exception to the mootness doctrine.
finally,we address whether respondent apprendi claims fall within the public interest exception.these claims are public in nature because,like the issue,they pertain to the administration of the juvenile justice system.specifically,they implicate the legislature decision to allow judges to make ejj designations and determine whether to impose stayed adult sentences on minors convicted in ejj prosecutions.they also are likely to recur,as they may potentially be raised whenever a judge rules on an ejj motion after the denial of a discretionary transfer motion is affirmed on appeal.however,we conclude that no authoritative determination of these issues is necessary at this time.our research discloses that the appellate court has thus far uniformly rejected respondent claim that the initial designation of a case as an ejj prosecution violates apprendi.see d at,d at,in re matthew,d.the appellate court has yet to address respondent claim that the procedure for lifting a stay on the minor adult sentence in an ejj case violates apprendi.however,as we noted with respect to respondent vagueness claims,this merely confirms that,at this time,there is no need for an authoritative determination of this issue.thus,respondent apprendi claims do not fall within the public interest exception to the mootness doctrine.
in sum,the issue raised by the state and the vagueness and apprendi claims raised by respondent are moot.however,we shall consider the issue on the merits because it falls within the public interest exception to the mootness doctrine.we shall also consider the fifth amendment issue raised by respondent on the merits,because it pertains to the validity of his conviction and is therefore not moot.
ii.doctrine 
the doctrine prohibits the reconsideration of issues that have been decided by a reviewing court in a prior appeal.see generally d appellate review through.we now consider whether the doctrine prohibits the designation of a case as an ejj prosecution after the appellate court affirms the denial of a discretionary transfer motion.this issue presents a question of law.therefore,we review it de novo.international,shred pax.resolving the issue will necessarily require us to examine the statutory language of section and section.an issue of statutory interpretation likewise presents a question of law,which we review de novo.in re.
the plain language of a statute is the best indication of the legislature intent in re madison,and the primary objective of statutory interpretation is to determine and give effect to that intent in re ryan.in doing so,this court will examine a statute as a whole,considering all relevant parts.in re.where the statutory language is clear and unambiguous,we will give effect to it without resorting to other aids of construction.in re.
at the outset,we note that nothing in the plain language of either statute prohibits the filing of an ejj motion after the denial of a discretionary transfer motion is affirmed on appeal.to the contrary,section permits the state to file an ejj motion at any time prior to commencement of the minor trial ilcs west.moreover,section specifically provides that n othing in this s ection precludes the state from filing a motion for transfer under s ection ilcs west.we will not read exceptions,conditions,or limitations into a statute that the legislature did not express if the statutory language is clear and unambiguous,which it is here.in re.
this conclusion,however,does not end our inquiry.these statutory provisions alone do not resolve whether,as a matter of judicial discretion,the doctrine precludes a trial court from considering an ejj motion after the appellate court affirms the denial of a discretionary transfer motion.in general,the doctrine prohibits reconsideration of issues which have been decided in a prior appeal.d appellate review,at.if there have been no material changes in the facts since the prior appeal,such issues may not be relitigated in the trial court or in a second appeal.appellate review,at see also tenner,at,doctrine bars relitigation of issue already decided in same case patterson,at,under doctrine,rule established as controlling in particular case will continue to be law of the case as long as facts remain the same.the underlying purposes of the doctrine are to avoid indefinite relitigation of the same issues,to obtain consistent results in the same litigation,and to ensure that lower courts follow the decisions of appellate courts.d appellate review,at.while the doctrine is not a jurisdictional limitation on a court power to address an issue,it does express the practice of courts generally to decline to reopen what has been decided.d appellate review,at see also patterson,at,citing christianson colt industries operating,d.
the state argues the doctrine does not bar a trial court from designating a case as an ejj prosecution after the court denial of discretionary transfer has been affirmed on appeal.it reasons that the question of whether to prosecute a minor as an adult under section is different from the question of whether to designate the minor case as an ejj prosecution under section.it also points out that the statutory factors considered in disposing of each motion are different.accordingly,the state asserts the appellate court erred in concluding a discretionary transfer motion and an ejj motion both decide the same ultimate issue.
respondent argues the doctrine prohibits an ejj designation after a denial of discretionary transfer is affirmed on appeal.he asserts that a discretionary transfer motion and an ejj motion both decide the issue of whether to subject a minor to an adult sentence,and emphasizes that the statutory factors considered in disposing of each motion are essentially identical.
to address whether the doctrine prohibits the designation of a case as an ejj prosecution after the denial of a discretionary transfer is affirmed on appeal,we must determine whether a discretionary transfer motion and an ejj motion decide the same issue.to do so,we return to the statutory language of section and section.
section of the juvenile court act provides,in pertinent part,as follows 
transfer of jurisdiction.
discretionary transfer.
a if a petition alleges commission by a minor years of age or over of an act that constitutes a crime under the laws of this state and,on motion of the state attorney to permit prosecution of the minor under the criminal laws,a juvenile judge assigned by the chief judge of the circuit to hear and determine those motions,after hearing but before commencement of the trial,finds that there is probable cause to believe that the allegations in the motion are true and that it is not in the best interests of the public to proceed under this act,the court may enter an order permitting prosecution under the criminal laws.
b in making its determination on the motion to permit prosecution under the criminal laws the court shall consider among other matters 
i the seriousness of the alleged offense 
ii the minor history of delinquency 
iii the age of the minor 
iv the culpability of the minor in committing the alleged offense 
v whether the offense was committed in an aggressive or premeditated manner 
vi whether the minor used or possessed a deadly weapon when committing the alleged offense 
vii the minor history of services,including the minor willingness to participate meaningfully in available services 
viii the adequacy of the punishment or services available in the juvenile justice system.
in considering these factors,the court shall give greater weight to the seriousness of the alleged offense and the minor prior record of delinquency than to the other factors listed in this subsection.
if criminal proceedings are instituted,the petition for adjudication of wardship shall be dismissed insofar as the act or acts involved in the criminal proceedings.ilcs west.
to summarize,section gives a juvenile court authority to permit the prosecution of a minor under the state criminal laws.for a court to allow a minor to be prosecuted as an adult under the discretionary transfer provision,the minor must be at least years old,the act the minor is alleged to have committed must be a crime,and there must be probable cause to believe the allegations against the minor are true.in addition,the court must determine it is not in the best interests of the public to prosecute the minor in juvenile court.see ilcs a west.in making this determination,the court must consider the eight factors enumerated in the statute,among other matters within its discretion.see ilcs b west.if the court determines transfer is appropriate,criminal proceedings are instituted against the minor and the juvenile petition is dismissed.see ilcs west.
section of the juvenile court act provides,in relevant part,as follows 
extended jurisdiction juvenile prosecutions.
if the state attorney files a petition,at any time prior to commencement of the minor trial,to designate the proceeding as an extended jurisdiction juvenile prosecution and the petition alleges the commission by a minor years of age or older of any offense which would be a felony if committed by an adult,and,if the juvenile judge assigned to hear and determine petitions to designate the proceeding as an extended jurisdiction juvenile prosecution determines that there is probable cause to believe that the allegations in the petition and motion are true,there is a rebuttable presumption that the proceeding shall be designated as an extended jurisdiction juvenile proceeding.
b the judge shall enter an order designating the proceeding as an extended jurisdiction juvenile proceeding unless the judge makes a finding based on clear and convincing evidence that sentencing under the chapter v of the unified code of corrections would not be appropriate for the minor based on an evaluation of the following factors 
i the seriousness of the alleged offense 
ii the minor history of delinquency 
iii the age of the minor 
iv the culpability of the minor in committing the alleged offense 
v whether the offense was committed in an aggressive or premeditated manner 
vi whether the minor used or possessed a deadly weapon when committing the alleged offense.
in considering these factors,the court shall give greater weight to the seriousness of the alleged offense and the minor prior record of delinquency than to other factors listed in this subsection.
sentencing.if an extended jurisdiction juvenile prosecution under subsection results in a guilty plea,a verdict of guilty,or a finding of guilt,the court shall impose the following 
i one or more juvenile sentences under section and 
ii an adult criminal sentence in accordance with the provisions of chapter v of the unified code of corrections,the execution of which shall be stayed on the condition that the offender not violate the provisions of the juvenile sentence.ilcs west.
section thus gives a juvenile court authority to impose an adult sentence on a minor in conjunction with a juvenile sentence,staying the adult sentence pending successful completion of the juvenile sentence.for a court to designate a case as an ejj prosecution,the minor must be at least years old,the act the minor is alleged to have committed must be a felony if committed by an adult,and there must be probable cause to believe the allegations against the minor are true.see ilcs west.if these criteria are met,the court must then designate the proceeding as an ejj prosecution unless clear and convincing evidence demonstrates an adult sentence would be inappropriate.in making this finding,the court must consider the six factors enumerated in the statute.see ilcs b west.if a case designated as an ejj prosecution results in a finding of guilt,both a juvenile sentence and an adult sentence are imposed,and the latter is stayed.see ilcs west.
based on the language of section and section,it is apparent that a discretionary transfer motion and an ejj motion decide distinct issues.section allows the state to prosecute a minor under the criminal laws ilcs west,meaning that the minor is prosecuted in the same manner as an adult offender.adult prosecution subjects the minor to adult sentencing.for instance,a minor who,like respondent,is convicted of first degree murder ilcs west faces a minimum sentence of years imprisonment ilcs a a west.the minor convicted and sentenced as an adult has no possibility of avoiding the adult sentence.by contrast,section subjects a minor to a potential adult sentence that the minor may or may not be required to serve,depending on the minor successful completion of a juvenile sentence.by way of example,a minor who,like respondent,is convicted of first degree murder in an ejj prosecution faces commitment to juvenile detention until the age of ilcs west and the prospect of a minimum adult sentence of years imprisonment ilcs a a west.the minor convicted in an ejj prosecution remains within the juvenile justice system as long as he does not violate the conditions of his juvenile sentence or commit a new offense ilcs,west.thus,section reflects the legislature intent to show minors who qualify for the application of the statute greater leniency than minors who qualify for discretionary transfer,while still providing them with a tangible incentive to avoid flouting their juvenile sentences or reoffending.in this respect,section differs significantly from section.it follows that the issue of whether to designate a case as an ejj prosecution is not the same as the issue of whether to prosecute a minor as an adult under section.
our conclusion is further supported by the fact that the inquiry underlying a discretionary transfer motion is distinct from the inquiry underlying an ejj motion.the initial factors that qualify a minor case for discretionary transfer and an ejj designation are essentially the same.the minor must be at least years old,there must be probable cause to support the allegations against the minor,and the minor must be alleged to have committed a crime ilcs west or an act that is a felony if committed by an adult ilcs west.after these initial factors are met,however,the inquiries underlying a discretionary transfer motion and an ejj motion diverge.in the case of a discretionary transfer motion,the trial court must consider whether it is in the best interests of the public to prosecute the minor as an adult.ilcs a west.in the case of an ejj motion,once the initial qualifying factors are met,a rebuttable presumption arises that the case will be designated as an ejj prosecution ilcs west,and the designation will remain unless the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that an adult sentence would be inappropriate for the minor ilcs b west.it is true that some of the statutory factors a trial court must consider in determining whether discretionary transfer is in the best interests of the public overlap with the statutory factors a trial court must consider in determining whether an adult sentence would be appropriate for the minor under the ejj statute.however,these factors are not identical.under section,the trial court must consider t he minor history of services,including the minor willingness to participate meaningfully in available services,and t he adequacy of the punishment or services available in the juvenile justice system,as well as other matters within the court discretion.ilcs b,b vii,b viii west.these factors are not considered in deciding whether to designate a case as an ejj prosecution.see ilcs b west.it is entirely conceivable that a trial court could determine on the basis of the eight factors listed in section,as well as other matters within its discretion,that it would be inappropriate to try a minor as an adult,but that,on the basis of the six factors listed in section,it would be appropriate to designate a minor case as an ejj prosecution.
previous decisions of this court cited by respondent in support of affirming the judgment of the appellate court are distinguishable.in people tenner,this court concluded the doctrine was inapplicable because the case at issue,which involved the defendant second postconviction petition,was not the same case as either that involving his first postconviction petition or his federal habeas corpus petition.tenner,at.people williams,and people taylor,relied on by williams,both involved the state attempt to relitigate fourth amendment suppression issues after the suppression order had become final.in williams,this court stated the rule in taylor as follows 
taylor procedural rule is simple a suppression order may be an appealable order,and,if it is,the state must either appeal or not.except for seeking timely reconsideration by the same or a successor judge of the court in which the order was entered citation,the state can not now have the order reviewed by another trial judge and can not before such a judge retry the issues therein decided citation.williams,at.
the court went on to state that the taylor rule was not strictly driven by the doctrine,but was a discrete rule of illinois procedure,independent of such related doctrines as collateral estoppel,law of the case,or even res judicata.williams,at.
in light of the foregoing,we hold the doctrine does not prohibit the designation of a case as an ejj prosecution after the appellate court affirms the denial of a motion for discretionary transfer.therefore,where a trial court denies a motion for discretionary transfer,the denial is affirmed on appeal,and the state subsequently files an ejj motion,the trial court must consider the ejj motion,as the trial court did in this case.
iii.invocation of fifth amendment right to counsel 
finally,we address whether the statements respondent made while in custody were obtained in violation of his fifth amendment right to counsel.this issue requires us to review the trial court ruling on respondent motion to suppress.review of a motion to suppress presents both questions of law and fact.people smith.a trial court credibility determinations and findings of historical fact will be upheld on review unless they are against the manifest weight of the evidence.people watson.however,the ultimate legal question of whether the evidence should be suppressed is reviewed de novo.watson,at.
the testimony at the hearing on respondent motion to suppress revealed the following facts.on the afternoon of january,respondent turned himself in to the police and was placed under arrest in connection with the shooting of willie lomax.one of the arresting officers read respondent his miranda rights,and respondent stated he understood them.respondent mother,who was present,stated the same.respondent was then taken to the district police station,accompanied by his mother.the arresting officers did not question respondent about the shooting.
from the district police station,respondent was transferred to the area police headquarters.detectives steven buglio and edward winstead met him there in an administrative room.detective winstead again advised respondent of his miranda rights.when asked if he understood those rights,respondent answered yes.respondent mother also acknowledged that she understood the miranda rights.
it is undisputed that,at this time,respondent mentioned a lawyer.however,the testimony presented at the suppression hearing varies regarding what respondent actually said.respondent mother recalled respondent saying,i think i should have a lawyer.respondent testified,i asked them the detectives if i would need a lawyer.detective winstead testified that respondent asked him d o i need a lawyer and that he answered respondent by saying t hat not my call.
after the exchange between detective winstead and respondent,respondent mother asked if she could speak with respondent alone.both detectives left the room and began preparations for a lineup.there is no indication in the record that respondent talked to his mother about a lawyer after the detectives left,or that respondent mother took any action to secure a lawyer for respondent.
detective winstead returned once to the room before the lineup to see if respondent and his mother needed anything.he did not ask respondent about the shooting at this time.shortly thereafter,respondent participated in the lineup.
when the lineup was over,a youth investigator was summoned to the police station.after the youth investigator arrived,detective winstead again read respondent his miranda rights.respondent and his mother both indicated they understood those rights,and respondent proceeded to speak to the detectives about lomax shooting.
the detectives left the room once they finished speaking with respondent and called an assistant state attorney to the police station.when the assistant state attorney arrived,respondent was given further miranda warnings.he continued to cooperate with the police and ultimately provided a statement.
based on these facts,the trial court found that 
a s a matter of fact the minor respondent asking the question do i need a lawyer does not suggest his implication of a right to remain silent.he was looking for advice.the police were wise not to give him advice.they left him alone with his mother and he made his decision.
accordingly,the trial court denied respondent motion to suppress the statements respondent made while he was in custody.
respondent argues the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress.he reasons that when he said either do i need a lawyer or i think i should have a lawyer,his statement was sufficiently clear to invoke his fifth amendment right to counsel.respondent and amici urge this court to focus on respondent youth in determining whether his statement constituted an invocation of his right to counsel.in support of doing so,they claim the united states supreme court has historically viewed minors constitutional rights differently than those of adults.they also cite numerous psychological and developmental differences between minors and adults,arguing minors are more likely than adults to couch their invocation of the right to counsel in an inquiry about possible counsel,to use indirect language,and to refrain from repeatedly requesting counsel.respondent invocation was,they argue,sufficiently clear for a.therefore,they conclude,all questioning should have ceased after respondent mentioned a lawyer.
in response,the state argues respondent statements were properly admitted into evidence.the state asserts that the arguments of respondent and amici ignore the specific facts at issue,which demonstrably prove that,under the circumstances,respondent question do i need a lawyer could not have reasonably been understood as an invocation of counsel.respondent,the state suggests,was an intelligent and capable minor,who turned himself in to the police on his own volition,understood his miranda rights,and had his mother present with him throughout the fairly short police detention and interrogation according to the state,the facts show the detectives responsible for interviewing respondent reasonably understood his question to be a request for their advice,not a request for counsel.the state argues that the relevant inquiry must focus on the facts at hand,not a hypothetical situation involving a hypothetical year old.thus,the state concludes respondent question was not sufficiently clear to invoke his fifth amendment right to counsel.
prior to any interrogation by law enforcement officials,a person in custody must be advised of the right to remain silent and the right to counsel.people villalobos,citing miranda arizona,d.a suspect who expresses the desire to deal with police only through counsel is not subject to further interrogation until counsel has been made available,unless the suspect initiates further communication with the police.people olivera,citing edwards arizona,d.to determine whether statements obtained during custodial interrogation may be used against an accused,a court must decide whether the accused actually invoked his right to counsel,and if so,whether he then initiated further conversation with the police so as to knowingly and intelligently waive his previously asserted right.people evans,citing smith illinois,d.this case involves the former inquiry.accordingly,it requires us to clarify the standard we apply to determine whether a suspect has invoked the right to counsel.
this court leading discussion of the invocation issue is people krueger.in krueger,testimony at the defendant suppression hearing revealed that,after the written waiver of his miranda rights,the defendant answered questions about several burglaries.krueger,at.however,when the questioning turned to the alleged homicide for which the defendant was arrested,the defendant made a remark variously described by the investigators who conducted his questioning as maybe i ought to have an attorney,maybe i need a lawyer,and maybe i ought to talk to an attorney.krueger,at.when the defendant made the remark,the investigators continued to question him,and shortly thereafter,the defendant gave a written statement admitting his responsibility for the homicide.krueger,at.
in krueger,this court refused to interpret the miranda decision as requiring that every reference to an attorney,no matter how vague,indecisive or ambiguous,should constitute an invocation of the right to counsel.krueger,at.the court observed that the record established the defendant was a person of normal intelligence,the defendant fully understood his miranda rights,the defendant waived those rights,his interrogation lasted only a short while,and there was no indication he was under any coercion or duress other than that inherent in every custodial setting.krueger,at.while the court also acknowledged that,according to the evidence,none of the investigators considered the defendant comment to be a request for counsel,it declined to place undue emphasis or weight on the investigators subjective beliefs.krueger,at.instead,the court concluded u nder the present facts,we find such belief the investigators belief the defendant did not invoke his right to counsel to have been reasonable.krueger,at.accordingly,the court held that because,in the instant case,a more positive indication of a desire for an attorney was required,the investigators did not violate the defendant fifth amendment right to counsel.krueger,at.
after krueger was decided,the united states supreme court handed down its decision in davis united states,d.in davis,the united states supreme court considered how police should respond when a suspect makes a reference to an attorney that is insufficiently clear to invoke the right to counsel.davis,at.at,d at.the petitioner in davis waived his right to remain silent and his right to counsel both orally and in writing,but stated maybe i should talk to a lawyer an hour and a half into his interview with investigators.davis,at.at,d at.at that point,the investigators attempted to clarify whether the petitioner wanted an attorney,to which the petitioner responded no,i not asking for a lawyer and no,i do want a lawyer.davis,at.at,d at.after a short break,the investigators reminded the petitioner once again of his rights to remain silent and to counsel,and continued on with the interview.davis,at.at,d at.
in finding against the petitioner,the court emphasized that determining whether a suspect actually invoked his right to counsel is an objective inquiry.davis,at.at,d at.according to the court,if a suspect makes a reference to an attorney that is ambiguous or equivocal in that a reasonable officer in light of the circumstances would have understood only that the suspect might be invoking the right to counsel,the officer is not required to cease questioning the suspect.emphasis in original.davis,at.at,d at.the court went on to state that a suspect must articulate his desire to have counsel present sufficiently clearly that a reasonable police officer in the circumstances would understand the statement to be a request for an attorney.davis,at.at,d at.it then rejected the petitioner argument that law enforcement officers should be required to stop questioning a suspect immediately upon the suspect ambiguous or equivocal reference to an attorney.davis,at.at,d at.specifically,the court held that after a knowing and voluntary waiver of the miranda rights,law enforcement officers may continue questioning until and unless the suspect clearly requests an attorney.davis,at.at,d at.in so holding,the court also noted that,when a suspect makes an ambiguous or equivocal reference to an attorney,it often will be good police practice to clarify whether the suspect actually wants counsel,as the investigators did in davis,at.at,d at.such clarification,however,is not required.davis,at.at,d at.
this court applied the davis holding in people oaks.people oaks,rev on other grounds,in re.in oaks,the defendant inquired should i see a lawyer in response to an investigator question about whether the defendant had any problem with memorializing the oral statement he had just given.oaks,at.the investigator initially responded t hat up to you,but also made further comments urging the defendant to give a written statement.oaks,at.after summarily concluding that the defendant remark should i see a lawyer was ambiguous oaks,at,this court applied davis and held that,absent an unambiguous or unequivocal request for counsel,the investigators had no obligation to stop questioning the defendant oaks,at.as in davis,this court noted that it would have been good police practice for the investigators to clarify whether the defendant actually wanted an attorney.oaks,at.however,they were not required to do so.oaks,at.
while this court adherence to the holding in davis has been clear since oaks,this court has yet to express any opinion on the davis objective test.at this time,we note that the objective test is consistent with the approach we set forth in krueger.there,we emphasized that while an assertion of the right to counsel need not be explicit,unequivocal,or made with unmistakable clarity,not every reference to an attorney,no matter how vague,indecisive or ambiguous,should constitute an invocation of the right to counsel.krueger,at.after setting forth this threshold standard,we proceeded to examine the circumstances surrounding the defendant purported invocation of the right to counsel.krueger,at.ultimately,we concluded that,in light of the circumstances,the investigators reasonably believed the defendant comment was not a request for counsel.krueger,at,see also people smith,simon,dissenting,joined by goldenhersh and moran,jj.the focus of a reviewing court should be on whether the defendant alleged assertion of his right to counsel,standing alone or in conjunction with his earlier statements or actions insofar as they shed light on his desires,were sufficient to be understood as such an invocation by a reasonable man in the interrogating officer position emphasis omitted,rev on other grounds,smith,at.at,d at.this approach is essentially the same as that endorsed by davis.thus,for the sake of clarity,we now formally recognize our adherence to the davis objective test.
respondent correctly points out that the holding in davis is limited to the situation where the alleged invocation of the right to counsel comes after a knowing and voluntary waiver of the suspect miranda rights.davis,at.at,d at.by implication,this suggests the united states supreme court has left open the issue of whether the objective test applies in a prewaiver setting.we believe the objective test set forth in davis can be applied to situations where,as here,the suspect makes a reference to counsel immediately after he has been advised of his miranda rights.see,united states brown,cir applying davis in situation united states muhammad,cir same ex parte cothren,so d,same moore state,same.in such a case,the relevant inquiry should remain whether a reasonable officer in the circumstances would have understood only that the suspect might be invoking the right to counsel davis,at.at,d at,or stated alternatively,whether the suspect articulation of the desire to have counsel present was sufficiently clear that a reasonable officer in the circumstances would have understood the statement to be a request for an attorney davis,at.at,d at.the fact waiver has not yet occurred can simply be subsumed into the objective test.that is,a trial court may consider the proximity between the miranda warnings and the purported invocation of the right to counsel in determining how a reasonable officer in the circumstances would have understood the suspect statement.the primary focus of the inquiry,however,should remain on the nature of the actual statement at issue.see,evans,at,holding that defendant never invoked right to counsel equivocally,a
