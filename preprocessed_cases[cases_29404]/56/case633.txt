introduction 
in this case we hold 
a mother who was assessed liability of pursuant to a welfare and institutions code section restitution order,based on an arson committed by her minor son,has a right of appeal from the order making her so liable.section specifically incorporates civil code section,and judgments under section of the civil code are appealable.
the acceptance by the victim of a payment from the mother insurer in full release of all claims against the mother and son precludes any section restitution liability on the part of the mother.there are reasons that civil settlements do not release juvenile offenders from a liability for restitution under section.see generally in re tommy th,d tommy.but those reasons do not apply to parents who are only vicariously liable under section.the state interest in the rehabilitation of juvenile offenders is not implicated by a release of vicarious liability against an otherwise innocent parent.and the legislature never intended to preclude the operative effect of releases of vicariously liable parents given by victims of their children torts.in fact,not giving effect to such a civil release deprives victims of an important bargaining chip,and ultimately of compensation that might come their way as well as the benefits of their rights under liability insurance contracts.
an abstract of judgment filed against the mother indicating that she is a judgment debtor under a judgment in excess of amount of the restitution award against her son,under section,not the restitution award against her under section be expunged.
the restitution order against the son under section for that is correct,despite the civil release obtained by his mother insurer,which was also obtained on his behalf as well.it makes no difference that the order will continue on into the son adult life.section contemplates that juvenile offenders themselves will make full restitution,and that orders of restitution will continue beyond their wardship.
background 
in december,then michael and a friend entered a combination pe storage shed and snack bar on the bolsa grande high school campus and held a lighter to one of the pads and some carpet on the inside floor of the shed.the pad and the carpet ignited.the fire got out of control and caused about in damage.
a little more than two years later the school district accepted a payment of made by the insurer of catherine,michael mother.the district provided a full release of all of its claims in any way growing out of the fire against michael and his mother.
in march,about the same time as the settlement,michael was made a ward of the juvenile court that is,formally found to be a juvenile delinquent and placed under the jurisdiction of the court pursuant to section based on his admission to the felony arson.he was committed to juvenile hall for days,and thereafter put on probation.
later in the year a restitution hearing was held,at which michael and his mother were present.both were represented by the same retained attorney.the court made an order setting the restitution to be paid by michael at about is,the amount of the damage after deducting the payment from the insurer.the order also stated that pursuant to civil code,maximum liability for mother is set at.
within two months of the court order recognizing the mother maximum liability at,the county of orange filed an abstract of judgment.only michael mother name appears on the document,as defendant and again as judgment debtor.michael is not listed at all.the document states that the total amount of the judgment is.the document makes no reference to the trial court express cap on catherine liability of.an ordinary person reading the abstract would naturally conclude that catherine owed that entire amount.both michael and his mother catherine have appealed from the orders of restitution.
the mother appeala.appealability 
the attorney general office asserts that the mother appeal should be dismissed on the theory that a parent has no right to appeal from a juvenile court order against a delinquent minor.not so.catherine certainly does have a right to appeal from the order against her.the legislature contemplated that the liability of parents arising out of the application of section would be civil liability,giving rise to a money judgment for civil damages.such money judgments are subject to the normal rules of appealability set forth in the code of civil procedure.the issue was recently and squarely addressed in in re jeffrey th,d jeffrey which held in the affirmative 
we agree with the court in jeffrey and take this opportunity to expound on its determination.section incorporates civil code section by reference.the relevant language from section is a in a case in which a minor is ordered to make restitution to the victim or victims a parent or guardian who has joint or sole legal and physical custody and control of the minor shall be rebuttably presumed to be jointly and severally liable with the minor in accordance with sections and of the civil code for the amount of restitution,fines,and penalty assessments so ordered,up to the limits provided in those sections,subject to the court consideration of the parent or guardian inability to pay.italics added.
civil code section provides in pertinent part a any act of willful misconduct of a minor which results in injury or death to another or in any injury to the property of another shall be imputed to the parent or guardian having custody and control of the minor for all purposes of civil damages italics added.civil code section is specifically targeted at firearm use by a minor under years old,and likewise uses the phrase for all purposes of civil damages in imputing c ivil liability to a parent or guardian having custody and control of the minor.
a purpose of civil damages,of course,is a money judgment for those damages,and such a money judgment is appealable under code of civil procedure section,subdivision a when it is final.
having found authority for the mother appeal in section incorporation of civil code sections and and their incorporation,in turn,of section of the code of civil procedure,we must make one further note.section of the welfare and institutions code,which expressly gives minors the right to appeal,contains no language precluding parental appeals from section judgments,or limiting such appeals to only minors.on its face the statute merely says a minor may appeal.nowhere does it say that a directly affected parent may not appeal under some other statute where an appeal would otherwise be appropriate.
the sole authority relied on by the attorney general office,in re almalik th,d,is factually distinguishable and not persuasive to the degree that it arguably can be read to conflict with jeffrey almalik involved a mother contending that her son offense was not a felony,so no direct interest of the mother was implicated in the order from which she appealed.given the natural presumption that minor children typically live with their parents,the parent was only indirectly affected.in essence,the case involved a court order grounding the minor.there was no order directly aimed at the parent pocketbook.the cases that almalik relied on,to say,basically,that the code of civil procedure does not apply to juvenile court orders,were themselves cases which never addressed the issue of a monetary award against a parent under section and can not by any means be read to preclude parental appeals pursuant to section 
we now proceed to the merits.
b.the merits 
the effects of the settlement 
california restitutionary legislation derives from a constitutional provision,commonly known as proposition,now article i,section of the constitution,added by initiative in.subdivision b of section addresses restitution,and in pertinent part provides it is the unequivocal intention of the people of the state of california that all persons who suffer losses as a result of criminal activity shall have the right to restitution from the persons convicted of the crimes for losses they suffer.restitution shall be ordered from the convicted person in every case italics added.
the main juvenile restitutionary statute directed at the juvenile offender himself or herself,section,is considered to be legislation implementing the restitutionary provisions of proposition.see tommy,supra,th,d section is one of the implementing statutes.
by contrast,the statute directed at the custodial parents of juvenile offenders,section,does not implement proposition with its focus on the convicted person.rather,section is a procedural variation on the theme of vicarious civil tort parental liability articulated in civil code section,which was first enacted in,well before proposition.as explained by jeffrey,section was intended to transfer the vicarious liability policy endorsed by civil code section to juvenile court proceedings,in part,so that victims of a crime committed by a minor may seek restitution from the parents without the need for a separate independent civil action.jeffrey,supra,th at,d.
the way that the law treats offending minors as regards a release provided by a victim is instructive.the issue was recently explored in tommy,supra,th,d.tommy involved a car accident.the car was driven by a friend of the offender mother.the friend insurer paid the victim for her economic losses and the victim expressly released both the friend and the juvenile offender from liability for all claims arising out of the accident.even so,the juvenile court ordered the offender to pay the same amount in restitution to the victim as a condition of probation.the minor appealed,attacked the restitution award,and pointed to the settlement.the tommy court gave three reasons why the settlement did not release the offender from his obligation 
the settlement came from the friend insurer,a source completely distinct and independent of the offender and the payment did not satisfy the requirement in that restitution come directly from the minor.tommy,supra,th at,d.
the state was not a party to the settlement,and the state interest in having the minor satisfy a rehabilitative and deterrent debt to society under proposition could not be released by the victim.tommy,supra,th at,d,quoting people bernal th,d bernal.
release would not recognize the general importance of the rehabilitative and deterrent goals of restitution.tommy,supra,th at,d,citing bernal,supra,th at,d.
these reasons from tommy simply do not apply to a case of vicarious liability provided for in section against the offending minor custodial parent.
in the first place,it was the mother here,catherine,who obtained the homeowners insurance that paid the school a sum in return for its release of all claims against her.in the context of vicarious parental liability under section distinct from direct offender liability under section is no statutory requirement that all payments come directly from the party against whom the restitutionary order is made,and in fact the court in bernal held that an offender insurer payments did constitute payments directly from the offender.see bernal,supra,th at,d we conclude that the directly from language of penal code section,subdivision a includes payments by an insurance company insuring the defendant.and catherine,unlike the defendant in bernal,is only vicariously liable,undercutting a fortiori any application of the tommy directly from prong to the facts at hand 
second,the state interest in rehabilitation is not implicated by a release of vicarious liability against an otherwise innocent parent.the parent does not need rehabilitation.and the state interest in deterrence is only tangentially implicated at most.the interest in deterring bad conduct on the part of potential juvenile offenders is not implicated at all.in the next portion of this opinion,for example,we will uphold the entirety of the some restitution award against the minor michael.and any secondary interest of the state in having parents control the behavior of their children is only marginally implicated.it is implicated only by the degree to which a parent who has insurance against the possibility of vicarious liability originating in the acts of his or her children will be marginally less controlling of those children in contrast to a parent who,in malpractice insurance parlance,goes bare.
students of insurance law will,of course,recognize that what we are talking about here is the old problem of moral hazard,meaning the degree to which human beings tend to relax when they have an insurer backing them up.but the moral hazard problem is inherent in all insurance,and therefore of weak force,as illustrated by the instances where public policy encourages people to obtain insurance precisely in order to assure that victims of torts will be compensated for their losses.the example that most readily comes to mind is the financial responsibility law that requires all motorists obtain insurance see,but there are also other statutes which have the direct or indirect effect of promoting the availability of liability insurance.those include statutes seeking to ensure that property insurance is available to those who desire it see wolfe state farm fire casualty ins.th,d,finding policy in et and regulating notices of cancellation so that individuals have the opportunity to procure substitute insurance see kotlar hartford fire ins.th,d,finding policy in.
indeed,while we are on the subject of the state interest,we need only look at this case from a different angle to realize the deleterious public consequences that would flow from a holding that a vicariously liable parent could not obtain a release of section liability by virtue of an insurer payment.such a rule would effectively deprive parents of the ability to insure against the risk of vicarious liability as a result of those torts of their children that implicated the criminal justice system.and that would also mean that many victims would not be paid at all,ever,since we may take it as a given that many parents of juvenile offenders as well as the offenders themselves are without insurance.
what we have just said about the second reason given in tommy for refusing to recognize a release that includes the juvenile offender the absence of the state as a party applies equally to the third prong in tommy the state general interest in rehabilitation and deterrence.on top of all of this,we find in the structure of section itself an indication that the legislature did not intend to preclude the operative effect of releases of vicariously liable parents given by victims of their children torts.
a close reading of the text of section indicates a potential for compromise in the litigation of a parent vicarious liability for the child restitutionary obligation.we note section does not establish a conclusive presumption of joint and several custodial parental liability for the child,only a rebuttable one.the pertinent language is a parent who has joint or sole legal and physical custody and control of the minor shall be rebuttably presumed to be jointly and severally liable that is,the statute contemplates the right of a parent to litigate the issue of his or her actual liability,albeit with a presumption of liability going in.the statute also contemplates the right of a parent to litigate the issue of his or her ability to pay any restitution award.the pertinent language is with the minor in accordance with section and of the civil code for the amount of restitution,fines,and penalty assessments so ordered,up to the limits provided in those sections,subject to the court consideration of the parent or guardian inability to pay,subd.a.
the possibility of litigation over such judgment call issues such as ability to the possibility of compromise.is the statute to be read in a way that would preclude a district attorney office,in a case such as this,from compromising the issue of a parent liability to pay to some figure below not to recognize a release obtained for an insurer payment effectively precludes compromise.we can not believe that the legislature intended that.
further,perversely,such a rule would encourage insurers to delay any payment to victims until they could obtain consent from the local prosecutor office and a release of liability from that office.under such a rule,only by involving the prosecutor in any settlement the equivalent of involving the state in the tommy context would the insurer have a chance of obtaining a meaningful release on behalf of the insured parent.and what if the prosecutor and the victim disagreed,with the victim wanting compensation immediately while the prosecutor held out for some higher figure a rule refusing to recognize a release given by a victim in return for a payment from a parent insurer would effectively penalize the victim and prevent insurers from performing their duties of effectuating prompt settlements of claims when liability is reasonably clear pursuant to insurance code section,subdivision h.
finally,there is the potential for injustice when one looks at the issue in terms of the victim.nonrecognition of a release puts victims in the awkward position of not being able to make good on their word to a party that did not engage in any wrongdoing and to which the requirements of proposition do not apply.that makes no sense,and there is nothing in the constitution or statutes to require such an unseemly result 
in the case before us,for example,a lawyer for the school district bargained with catherine insurer and gave a release to her.that release ought to be worth something.while,under tommy and bernal,the release might not be any good against the defendant himself,there is no reason not to recognize it as regards a party only vicariously liable.
we should add that there is nothing in the actual text of section providing that a parent can not be released by a third party.the text merely states that a parent shall be rebuttably presumed to be jointly and severally liable for certain reasons.a presumption of liability,however,can not reasonably be translated into a preclusion against any and all releases of liability.it would be a misreading of that text to say that it precludes a release of any parental liability by the victim.the rule against release of the minor liability by the victim as articulated in tommy was based on the text of section and policy concerns see tommy,supra,th at,d,not any language in section.
the order making catherine jointly and severally liable in any amount for the restitution award against son her michael must therefore be reversed.
the abstract of judgment 
obviously,in light of our determination that the release effectively precludes any section liability against catherine,the abstract of judgment recorded by the county of orange has no validity.however,in light of the county recording an abstract of judgment against catherine for more than the amount of the restitution order against her,some comment is required.
by its terms,section provides for parental liability only up to the limits provided in civil code sections and.the current limits set forth in civil code section are for each tort of the minor.under subdivision c of section of the civil code these limits are to be adjusted every two years the current limits in civil code section are now as a result of any one occurrence or,subject to limit as to one person,and for injury to or death of all persons as a result of any one such occurrence.since it governs firearm use,civil code section is not applicable to the case before us.
there is no argument that michael holding the lighter to the pad and rug constitutes anything but a single tort.as such,the maximum liability that even might possibly have been assessed against michael mother catherine was.and in fact that was precisely the trial court order.the trial court order stated plainly pursuant to civil code,maximum liability for the mother is set at.clearly,the abstract should never have been applied for or issued in the first place in any amount greater than because it was that figure which was the true total amount of judgment entered against catherine as judgment debtor.
a judgment lien is created by recording an abstract of a money judgment with the county recorder.code civ,subd.a.such a lien is a lien for the amount required to satisfy the money judgment.code civ.it follows,then,that an abstract of judgment filed pursuant to section of the code of civil procedure which gives the name and last known address of the judgment debtor and the amount of the judgment or decree as entered code civ,subds.a,a,must be for the amount of the judgment specifically against that judgment debtor,not more.then again,such a an abstract of judgment can not indicate a liability on the part of a judgment debtor in excess of the judgment creating that liability in the first only common sense anyway 
the son appeal 
it is important to understand exactly what son michael is contending in this appeal.in light of tommy and bernal,michael does not argue that the release obtained by his mother insurer exonerates him from any restitutionary award.rather as the point was refined in oral argument,he asserts that in light of the payment,the award should expire upon the expiration of his wardship.he raises the specter of a residual civil judgment that will economically cripple him well into adulthood,if not for life.statutorily,michael has framed his argument in terms of subdivision h of section,which provides that restitution to victims shall be imposed in the amount of the losses and the court shall order full restitution unless it finds compelling and extraordinary reasons for not doing so,and states them on the record.
did michael present such compelling and extraordinary reasons here we conclude the answer is no.subdivision i of section provides that an order of restitution to a victim shall be enforceable as a civil judgment.the language is a clear indication that the legislature envisioned the liability of the juvenile offender continuing on into judgments may be enforced for years code civ,basic period to enforce judgments and renewed anytime in those years code civ,procedures for renewing judgments.the fact that a juvenile delinquency restitution order may extend into adulthood and easily beyond the period of wardship then can hardly be called a compelling reason to depart from a rule of full restitution.extension of juvenile offender liability into adulthood is what one would expect under the language of subdivision i of section.
that leaves only the bare fact of the release obtained by michael mother insurer,independent of the extension of the restitution order into michael adulthood.we have already discussed why a release should protect a parent only vicariously liable.among our reasons is the law encouragement of obtaining liability insurance so that victims will be compensated.but that factor cuts the other way for the liability of the juvenile offender.it is clear from the statute that full restitution will be the usual,ordinary order.proposition itself uses the phrase compelling and extraordinary to describe a judge latitude to depart from an order of restitution.cal,art.i,subd.b.under section,departures from full restitution must be justified by clear and compelling reasons stated on the record.what one hopes will be the normal receiving payment from the offender parent insurer to protect the parent from vicarious hardly be called so extraordinary as to be compelling.
moreover,under the facts of the case before us,the disproportionately small percentage of the victim actual losses actually covered affirmatively demonstrates the lack of any compelling reason to depart from a norm of full restitution.the insurer paid less than in settlement against an actual loss exceeding.
we note that the trial court has already credited michael with the amount of the insurer payment,reducing michael restitution obligation to around.bernal,supra,th at,d because payment made by adult offender insurer was directly from offender,payment by insurer could be used by offender as an offset of his restitution obligation,subd.i restitution collected pursuant to this subdivision shall be credited to any other judgments for the same losses obtained against the minor arising out of the offense.perhaps,had the insurer paid the entire amount of the actual loss,there might be a compelling reason not to order full restitution,since at that point the state constitutional interes
