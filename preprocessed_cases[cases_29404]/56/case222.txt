appeals from a juvenile court order declaring him a ward of the court and placing him on probation after he admitted to a misdemeanor count of indecent exposure.raising mostly constitutional claims of vagueness and overbreadth,he challenges four probation conditions that require him not to access pornography the condition to submit to warrantless searches of his electronic devices and provide passwords the electronics search condition to attend school regularly the attendance condition and not to leave home without a parent or the probation officer permission the condition.we conclude in the published section of our opinion that the condition is vague,and we remand for the juvenile court to modify it in the first instance.we also affirm the attendance condition.in the nonpublished section of our opinion,we conclude that the electronics search condition is overbroad and remand for the court to modify it in the first instance.we also remand for the court to clarify whether,in light of ambiguity in the record,it intended to impose the condition.
factual and proceduralbackground 
in december,the victim and her boyfriend son were riding a bus in san leandro after they exited the bus,the son informed the victim that he had seen a male,later identified as year old,standing behind her on the bus and exposing his penis and masturbat ing and that the male eventually ejaculated and the semen landed on the back of the victim clothing.the victim had not noticed anything at the time but discovered a white substance on the back of her jacket,and she eventually reported the incident.
later that month,the alameda county district attorney filed a petition under welfare and institutions code section,subdivision a seeking to have declared a ward of the court.the petition alleged misdemeanor accounts of battery against a bus passenger,indecent exposure,and annoyance or molestation of a minor admitted to committing the offense,and the other two counts were dismissed.at the dispositional hearing,the juvenile court declared a ward of the court and placed him on probation with various conditions,including the four at issue in this appeal.
discussiona.the operative version of each challenged probation condition.
we begin by sorting out the various versions of the challenged probation conditions that appear in our record to determine which version of each condition controls.this is necessary because there are four different potential sources of the operative language the dispositional report containing the probation department proposed conditions,some of which were imposed by the juvenile court at the dispositional hearing the court oral pronouncement at that hearing that hearing minute order,which was signed by the court and served on and his parents and a probation department document entitled conditions of probation and court orders that and his parents signed.some capitalization omitted.
although the traditional rule was that a court oral pronouncement of probation conditions controlled over the written version,the modern rule is that if the clerk and reporter transcripts can not be reconciled,the part of the record that will prevail is the one that should be given greater credence in the circumstances of the case.people pirali th.indeed,the oral pronouncement may well be less inclusive given that probation conditions need not be spelled out in great detail in court as long as the probationer knows what they are to require recital in court is unnecessary in view of the fact the probation conditions are spelled out in detail on the probation order.ibid.
the condition was not proposed in the dispositional report,but the juvenile court orally pronounced it as follows you not to access pornography on any electronic devices or otherwise.the signed probation document uses the same language except it says other devices instead of otherwise.capitalization omitted.the minute order directs,no pornographic materials,electronic or otherwise.we conclude that the oral pronouncement controls because there is no clear indication that the court intended to impose the version in either the minute order or the signed document.
the dispositional report contains a proposed search term submit person and any vehicle,room,or property under your control to search by probation officer or peace officer with or without a search warrant at any time of day or night but does not include language covering electronic devices and passwords.the juvenile court orally pronounced the challenged condition as follows a ny electronic devices in your possession or control are subject to search,and you to provide passwords to allow that search by law enforcement officials or the probation officer.the minute order states,provide all passwords to any electronic devices,including cell phones,computers,or notepads,within your custody or control,and submit such devices to search at any time without a warrant by any peace officer.provide all passwords to any social media sites,including facebook,instagram,and myspace and submit those sites to search at any time without a warrant by any peace officer.finally,the signed probation document requires to submit person and any vehicle,room,or property under his control to search by probation officer or peace officer with or without a search warrant at any time of day or night including electronic devices passwords.capitalization omitted.we conclude that the court oral pronouncement is the operative version,with the addition of the phrase with or without a search warrant at any time of day or night from the dispositional report because the court stated that it was imposing the standard conditions of probation and proceeded to read several conditions that appeared in that report.again,there is no clear indication that the court intended to impose the version in either the minute order or the signed document.
the attendance condition was expressed in the dispositional report and oral pronouncement as a ttend school regularly.the minute order states,attend classes or job on time and regularly be of good behavior and perform well,and the signed probation document does not contain an probation condition.we conclude that the oral pronouncement controls and that the directive to to be of good behavior and perform well was not imposed.
finally,the condition was expressed in the dispositional report as d o not stay away from home unless with a parent or legal guardian or without prior permission of the probation officer,and the juvenile court oral pronouncement directed,you not to be away from home without your parent or without prior permission of the probation officer.neither the minute order nor the signed probation document contains such a condition.we need not determine which version controls because,as we discuss in section,which is part of our nonpublished opinion,it is unclear whether and to what extent the court intended to restrict ability to leave home in light of a narrower curfew condition that was also imposed.
as a final matter,we agree with that he should not have to piece together the full terms of his probation by reviewing the various potential sources of those conditions.nor can he be expected to engage in the legal analysis required to resolve conflicts and determine which version of each condition controls.given the serious due process concerns this lack of clarity creates,we direct the juvenile court to ensure that on remand a single document containing all of probation conditions is provided to and his parents.
b.the condition is unconstitutionally vague.
contends that the condition is unconstitutionally vague and must be modified to specify that he not access materials that he knows or that the probation officer has informed him are pornographic we agree that the condition is vague but disagree that adding an express knowledge requirement would fix the problem.we therefore remand for the juvenile court to clarify the condition purpose and to more precisely conform the condition to that purpose.
when a juvenile court places a minor on probation,it may impose and require any and all reasonable conditions that it may determine fitting and proper to the
