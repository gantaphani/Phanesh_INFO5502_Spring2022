a juvenile court authority to commit a minor to the california department of corrections and rehabilitation,division of juvenile justice djj,is a matter of statutory law.pursuant to welfare and institutions code section,subdivision c hereafter section c,a ward of the juvenile court who meets any condition described below shall not be committed to the djj c the ward has been or is adjudged a ward of the court pursuant to section,and the most recent offense alleged in any petition and admitted or found to be true by the court is not described in subdivision b of section,unless the offense is a sex offense set forth in subdivision c of section of the penal code.italics added.in this case,after greg appellant admitted a juvenile delinquency petition alleging an offense that was not djj eligible under section c,the juvenile court utilized section to dismiss that petition in order to reach back to an earlier petition alleging a offense that appellant had admitted.the court did so in order to commit appellant to djj.because we read section c to limit the court authority to dismiss a petition under section,we reverse the disposition order.
background 
appellant,born in july,admitted the allegations of a september,juvenile delinquency petition that alleged he committed assault with a deadly weapon,subd.a with infliction of great bodily injury,subd.a and for the benefit of a criminal street gang,subd.b c.this offense is listed under section,subdivision b and,under section c,may lead to a commitment to djj.the probation report reveals that on september,appellant and two other males exited a vehicle and threw rocks and shouted gang slogans at the victim,joseph,while the victim was riding his bicycle.appellant then ran toward the victim and hit him on the head with a baseball bat,causing the victim to fall off his bicycle.as a result,the victim underwent surgery for an epidural hematoma and was hospitalized for approximately seven days.appellant was declared a ward of the court on june.
on august,another juvenile delinquency petition was filed alleging that on august,appellant committed felony battery against three persons for the benefit of a criminal street gang,subd.d.according to the probation report,on august,while having dinner in juvenile hall,appellant and two others stood up and attacked three sure√±o residents.all six minors began fighting and security staff eventually detained them.
at a hearing on august,defense counsel stated she and the prosecutor had agreed that appellant would admit the battery and gang enhancement,and a second count of knowing participation in a criminal street gang,subd.a would be dismissed.the court informed appellant that based on his admission the matter would be put over for disposition,at which time the court would decide the consequences for appellant admission.the court accepted the admission,ordered appellant detained in juvenile hall pending a disposition hearing set for september,and referred the matter for a written dispositional report.on august,the court granted the prosecution ex parte request to advance the matter to august for a hearing on its motion to withdraw plea.the request form indicated that appellant counsel opposed the motion.

at the august,hearing,the prosecutor urged the court to withdraw appellant admission to the petition pursuant to in re th.the court stated the motion should be characterized as a motion to strike the petition and gave the prosecution leave to refile its motion.on august,the people filed a motion seeking to set aside appellant admission to the petition,to dismiss that petition,and to commence proceedings on the section notice of probation violation.
on october,the court granted the people motion to dismiss the petition in the interests of justice and appellant welfare.it also set a hearing on the section probation violation for october.on october,appellant admitted the august probation violation.
on february,appellant was committed to djj for a maximum term of confinement of years,with credit for days in custody.he filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
the offense alleged in the petition and admitted by appellant,felony battery against three persons for the benefit of a criminal street gang,subd.d is not an offense described in subdivision b of section or a sex offense set forth in penal code section.thus,pursuant to section c,it could not provide a legal basis for committing appellant to djj.
pursuant to section and in re,supra,th,the prosecution requested that the court dismiss the petition,so that under section c the most recent offense alleged in any petition and admitted or found to be true by the court would be the felony assault with infliction of great bodily injury and for the benefit of a street gang,subd.a,subd.a,subd.b c alleged in the petition.this offense is one described in subdivision b of section,and could support appellant djj commitment.in granting the request to dismiss the petition and appellant admission to it,the court stated it was doing so in the interest of justice.
deciding appellant claim of error depends,in part,on resolving the apparent conflict between sections c and two appellate decisions have reached inconsistent results on this issue.in superior court th,the minor was charged in a section petition filed in with a sex offense and was granted probation.while on probation,he was charged in a section petition filed in with three new offenses,only one of which was.pursuant to a plea bargain,the minor admitted the offense and the two offenses were dismissed,and he was continued on probation,at.thereafter,the prosecution filed a section notice of probation violation based on the minor commission of two offenses.as in our case,to avoid the bar of section c,the prosecutor moved under section to dismiss the petition so that it could seek a djj commitment on the offenses charged in the petition.the juvenile court granted the motion and dismissed the petition pursuant to section,at.
on a petition for writ of mandate the appellate court reversed,concluding the juvenile court abused its discretion under section in dismissing the petition,supra,th at.in considering whether the dismissal was in the interests of justice,the court found penal code section,the dismissal statute applicable to adult criminal proceedings,analogous to section,at.noted that decisions interpreting penal code section have found that section runs only in the immediate favor of a defendant,by cutting off an action or a part of an action against the defendant.citations,at,fn.extending that reasoning to section,found it troubling that the court used its dismissal power under section to increase the range of potential sanctions to which the minor defendant was subject if found in violation of his probation,at,fn.concluded that the dismissal of the petition was not in the interests of justice under section because it was a violation of due process to deprive the minor of the benefit of the plea bargain by dismissing the petition at the prosecution request in order to render the minor eligible for a djj commitment based on the petition,at.
also concluded that the juvenile court dismissal was not in the interests of society,as expressed by the legislature in section c the language of section c allows commitment to djj only when the most recent offense alleged in any petition and admitted or found to be true by the court is an eligible offense.the statute does not focus on the overall or entire delinquent history of the minor or on whether the minor may be generally considered a serious,violent offender.the language looks to the minor most recent offense.the legislature has specifically determined it is the minor most recent offense that determines the minor eligibility for djj commitment.dismissal of the most recent petition in order to reach back to an earlier petition containing a djj qualifying offense would be contrary to the unmistakable plain language of section c.it would frustrate the legislative policy expressed by the language of section c.such a dismissal can not be in the interests of justice.citation,supra,th at.noted that,pursuant to the legislative history of section c,its purpose is to stop the intake of youthful offenders adjudicated for,offenses to the djj citation,at.it also noted that section c was enacted in an effort to reduce state costs by limiting the number of youth offenders housed in state facilities by shift ing responsibility to the counties for all but the most serious youth offenders citation.citation,at.concluded that construing section to permit the dismissal of a minor most recent petition with a offense to reach a prior petition with a offense would be inconsistent with the statutory purpose underlying section c because it would not restrict the intake of juvenile offenders to djj to those who are currently serious or violent offenders,at.
in in re,supra,th,the minor admitted a march section petition alleging a offense felony assault and was continued at an adolescent center placement.in august,a section notice of probation violation was filed alleging the minor failed to return to his placement.in re,at.in december,a section petition was filed charging the minor with another offense attempted second degree robbery while armed with a knife and a misdemeanor.the minor admitted the attempted robbery with a knife allegation and the misdemeanor was dismissed.the minor also admitted the probation violation alleged in the august section notice.at the disposition hearing,the court heard evidence regarding the prosecutor and probation department recommendation that the minor be committed to djj,and continued the disposition hearing before making a dispositional ruling.in re,at.thereafter,the minor sought to withdraw his admission to the weapon enhancement in the december petition,stating that the law had changed under section after he admitted the enhancement,and asserting that if the enhancement were not found true,the attempted robbery would be a eligible offense under section c.thus,he argued he was unaware of the consequences of his plea when it was entered.the court granted the minor motion to withdraw his admission to the weapon enhancement and set a contested hearing thereon.in re,at.subsequently,the prosecutor sought dismissal of the december petition under section and a commitment of the minor to djj.in re,at.pursuant to section,the court granted the prosecution motion to dismiss the december petition,set aside the minor admission to it and all subsequent proceedings on that petition,found the minor had committed the charged probation violation and committed him to djj based on the original assault charge in the march petition.in re,at.
the minor appealed,arguing his most recent offense was a probation violation,not a section,subdivision b offense,and therefore he was ineligible for a djj commitment.in re,supra,th at.in affirming the dismissal of the december section petition and djj commitment,the appellate court stated s ection does not specifically authorize the dismissal of a petition containing the most recent offense admitted or found to be true.however,section does authorize the juvenile court to set aside findings and to dismiss a petition if the court finds that the interests of justice and the welfare of the minor require such dismissal in re,at.
we agree with that the phrase the most recent offense in section c indicates the legislature intent to limit djj commitments to minors who are currently serious or violent offenders,and to disallow a djj commitment for minors based on their overall juvenile history.we also agree with that utilizing section to dismiss the most recent petition adjudicating a nonviolent,nonserious offense to reach back to an earlier petition adjudicating a violent or serious offense undermines section c prohibition against committing a minor to djj for any offense other than the most recent offense alleged and admitted or found true by the court.this use of section also undermines the budgetary purpose underlying section c.see,supra,th at.
we resolve the apparent conflict between sections c and by relying on two principles of statutory construction.first,a later enacted statute,like section c,ordinarily controls over an earlier enacted one.in re michael cal d.we are entitled to presume that,in,when the legislature enacted section c,it was aware of the earlier enacted section,and could have clarified that section remains available to the juvenile court to dismiss a petition containing the most recent offense,which is eligible,to reach back to an earlier petition containing a offense for purposes of committing the minor to djj.in re michael,at.in the absence of any indication of such legislative intent,we will not assume such intent exists,particularly in light of section c clear substantive and temporal restrictions on committing minors to djj.the second principle of statutory construction we rely on is that more specific statutory provisions normally control as against more general provisions when both concern the same subject.in re michael,at.under this principle,section c would control over section,given that both statutes generally concern the disposition of juvenile matters,but section c is more narrowly concerned with commitments to djj.
while juvenile courts have broad discretion under section to dismiss petitions when required by the interests of justice and the minor welfare derek superior court d,absent a showing of legislative intent this discretion is not broad enough to trump the clear limits that section c places on the court dispositional authority see people hatch cal th,does not permit dismissals in the interest of justice where the legislature had clearly evidenced a contrary intent.
we conclude the juvenile court lacked authority under section to dismiss the petition for the purpose of reaching back to the petition containing a offense in order to support appellant djj commitment.
the people assert that precluding dismissal under section in the circumstances presented here immunizes juvenile recidivism.our response is.first,this situation would have been averted had the prosecutor filed a section notice of probation violation rather than filing the petition see in re,supra,th at accord,in re th.second,the argument that our analysis of the interplay between sections c and immunizes recidivism is one that is more properly directed to the legislature.
given our conclusion that the court abused its discretion in dismissing the petition,we reverse the dispositional order and remand the matter for further consideration 
disposition 
the dispositional order is reversed and the matter remanded to the juvenile court for reconsideration of the disposition in light of this decision.
