factual and procedural background 
on july,the district attorney filed a petition under section to adjudicate respondent a ward of the court for allegedly having committed robbery and assault at the adjudication hearing,the juvenile court admitted appellant confession,as well as evidence relating to how it was obtained.the evidence adduced at that hearing was as follows.
according to erick esteban,on july,at approximately,he was delivering pizza near corning street,in beverly hills.after making the delivery,three to four young males approached him.one of them had his hands inside his shirt as if holding a weapon.that same person hit esteban in the face and demanded money.when asked at the hearing if he recognized anyone in the courtroom as the person who hit him,esteban testified that he was uncertain.after being hit,esteban began to fall.as he did,he pleaded,please do hit me and do do that.the other males surrounded him and began punching him.esteban was uncertain which of the others hit him because he was covering his head.the men took his fanny pack,car key and money from his pocket.
on july,los angeles police detective kirby carranza telephoned respondent foster mother,yvonne jenkins,and asked if she would voluntarily bring respondent and his brother,trevon,to the police station for questioning.he told her he wanted to speak to them about crimes that had occurred in the neighborhood.
on july,at approximately,jenkins brought the boys to the station.the three were buzzed into the security area and taken upstairs to a location on the second floor,where civilians were not allowed to just roam around.detective carranza accompanied each to separate rooms,respondent being placed in a room that was seven feet by seven feet,with the door partially open.jenkins consented to the detective speaking to respondent alone.jenkins was brought to a room that was feet from respondent.
in a recorded interview,detective carranza thanked respondent for voluntarily coming to the station and told him that he was not under arrest and was free to leave at any time he wanted.detective carranza did not give respondent miranda warnings before the interview because respondent was not in custody,was not detained,came in voluntarily and was free to leave,even though he was brought to a nonpublic area of the station from which an officer would have had to escort him.
detective carranza began the interview by discussing with respondent his truancy for five or ten minutes.he then questioned him about gang conversation and people in the neighborhood for another to minutes.after minutes,he asked if respondent was involved in the july,pizza man robbery on corning street.respondent initially denied involvement,stating that he did not know what the detective was talking about.he then acknowledged hearing about a robbery of a pizza man.detective carranza said he had information that respondent was involved in that crime,and respondent then stated he was there,but denied striking esteban.finally,respondent admitted approaching esteban and demanding pizza.he told the detective that when he was told that the man had none,he demanded money.esteban said he had none,and respondent shoved him against a gate and punched him in the face.esteban took his fanny pack off and handed it to respondent.respondent said he acted alone,although he had previously indicated that his brothers were present.before respondent made these admissions,his counsel objected that they were hearsay.the juvenile court initially sustained the objection,adding that there was also a miranda violation.upon further consideration and research,it stated that it was not going to rule on the hearsay and miranda issues at that time,and it heard the challenged evidence.
when respondent began discussing his involvement in the robbery,detective carranza did not give any miranda warning,even though he acknowledged that respondent was not free to leave at that point.only at the conclusion of the interview did he read respondent his miranda rights and detain him.he asked no additional questions.at no time during the interview did respondent request to leave or ask to speak to jenkins.
after interviewing respondent,detective carranza brought trevon to the interview room.trevon stated that he was at the robbery scene,heard respondent demand money from esteban,and saw him push esteban,punch him twice and grab his fanny pack.trevon and respondent then ran from the scene.
at the conclusion of the people evidence,respondent moved pursuant to section to dismiss the allegations for insufficiency of the evidence because his confession was invalid,and no one was able to identify him as the perpetrator.the juvenile court denied the motion,finding that the interrogation of respondent was voluntary,and respondent understood that he was free to leave during the interview 
after denial of his motion,respondent testified in his own defense.he admitted being at the scene of the robbery with his two brothers,derek and trevon.derek had his hands in his shirt and demanded money from esteban.thinking derek was about to leave,respondent walked toward derek.esteban jumped at derek,and frightened,respondent hit esteban.derek took esteban pouch.respondent never looked inside of it.
at the conclusion of the evidence,the juvenile court sustained the section petition as to both counts.
at the disposition hearing,respondent filed what he termed a penal code section motion for new trial,claiming that seibert rendered his confession inadmissible.agreeing,the juvenile court reversed its previous finding that respondent confession was voluntary and ruled that he was in custody at the time he confessed.because miranda warnings were therefore required and not given,the confession was inadmissible.when the prosecutor indicated that she was unable to proceed,the juvenile court dismissed the petition with prejudice.
the people appeal from the orders unlawfully suppressing the minor confession and dismissing the case.
discussion 
iappellate jurisdiction 
the people contend that there is appellate jurisdiction over this appeal under section,subdivision b and b.that subdivision provides b an appeal may be taken by the people from any of the following an order or judgment dismissing or otherwise terminating the action before the minor has been placed in jeopardy,or where the minor has waived jeopardy.the imposition of an unlawful order at a dispositional hearing,whether or not the court suspends the execution of the disposition.
respondent contends that we lack jurisdiction because neither of the jurisdictional grounds asserted by the people is applicable.he argues that section,subdivision b is inapplicable because jeopardy attached when the first witness was sworn,he was placed in jeopardy before the action was dismissed,and he did not waive jeopardy.he further argues that subdivision b is inapplicable because this appeal is not from an unlawful dispositional order.while we agree that subdivision b does not afford a basis for appellate jurisdiction here,we conclude that subdivision b does.
our jurisdiction can not be premised on section,subdiv
