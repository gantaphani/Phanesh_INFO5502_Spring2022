here we consider the scope of elections code provisions enacted in,which created a new process by which a proposed initiative measure is submitted for public comment.after the comment period,the attorney general prepares an official circulating title and summary,including an estimate of the measure fiscal impact.the proponents may then solicit signatures to qualify their measure for the ballot.
the legislature specified that any amendments to a measure submitted for comment must be reasonably germane to the theme,purpose,or subject of the initiative measure as originally proposed.b.in this case,proponents decided to amend their measure,deleting some provisions and adding others that were supported by governor edmund brown.challengers sought a writ of mandate requiring the attorney general to reject the amendments.the trial court granted the writ,finding that the revised measure failed to meet the requirements of section.the proponents,joined by the governor,sought emergency relief in this court.we temporarily stayed the trial court judgment and issued an order to show cause.we now grant the requested relief and direct the trial court to vacate its judgment.
as discussed in detail below,the legislative history and statutory language demonstrate that the legislature intended the comment period to facilitate feedback,not to create a broad public forum.nor did the legislature preclude substantive amendments.it required only that any amendments be reasonably germane to the original measure aims.b.while the new process imposes time constraints on various governmental functions,the constraints are similar to those that existed under the former statutory scheme.in particular,the legislature continued existing law relating to fiscal analyses of the impacts of proposed measures.
background 
section a requires the attorney general to post the text of proposed initiative measures on her web site for a day public comment period on december,proponents margaret prinzing and harry berezin submitted the justice and rehabilitation act.the act declared it was intended to ensure that california juvenile and criminal justice systems effectively stop repeat offending and improve public safety.the first of its listed purposes was to e nsure that california juvenile and criminal justice system resources are used wisely to rehabilitate and protect public safety sic.the measure proposed statutory amendments to accomplish the following 
abolish the requirement that minors years or older be prosecuted as adults for certain serious offenses.eliminate the discretion of district attorneys to file charges against juveniles in adult court.establish as the minimum age at which juveniles may be transferred to adult court.require a judicial transfer hearing in all cases.specify a number of serious crimes for which juveniles may be committed to the division of juvenile facilities.
allow minors convicted of crimes in adult court to move for a juvenile disposition instead of a prison sentence,and make various other changes to the process of juvenile dispositions and commitments.
eliminate the prohibition against the sealing of juvenile court records,and permit the sealing or destruction of such records.
alter parole suitability review for prisoners who were under years of age at the time of their controlling offense in two respects sentence enhancements would no longer be included in determining the term of imprisonment for purposes of identifying the controlling offense,and three strikes offenders would no longer be excluded from such parole suitability review.see.
the proponents of the justice and rehabilitation act received no online comments from the public.however,during the comment period they spoke with a number of individuals and groups interested in justice reform,including members of the governor staff.a political action committee supporting the measure engaged in discussions with numerous interest groups,including the california district attorneys association cdaa.the governor and his staff were significantly involved in these discussions as well.
on january,after the close of the public comment period but within the ensuing window for accepting amendments,the proponents submitted a revised measure,retitling it the public safety and rehabilitation act of.among the declared purposes of the amended measure were to p rotect and enhance public safety,s ave money by reducing wasteful spending on prisons,and stop the revolving door of crime by emphasizing rehabilitation,especially for juveniles.the new measure retained the original provisions eliminating district attorneys discretion to file charges against juveniles in adult court and requiring a judicial hearing to determine whether a transfer of jurisdiction is warranted.transfers were generally limited to minors aged or older,but were permitted for or year olds accused of certain serious crimes.all other original provisions were deleted,and new provisions were added.
the original proposal to amend penal code section,governing parole hearings for prisoners under the age of at the time of their offenses,was replaced with a constitutional amendment that would significantly modify parole consideration for all state prisoners convicted of a felony offense.these prisoners would be eligible for parole consideration after completing the full term for their primary offense,defined as the longest term of imprisonment imposed by the court for any offense,excluding the imposition of an enhancement,consecutive sentence,or alternative sentence.the department of corrections and rehabilitation would be authorized to award credits for good behavior and rehabilitative or educational achievements,and to adopt implementing regulations.
the attorney general examined the amended measure,determined it was reasonably germane to the original,and began preparing a circulating title and summary.b.on february,the legislative analyst issued a summary of the measure fiscal impacts.see,subd.a.the same day,cdaa sought a writ of mandate to restrain the attorney general from proceeding with the measure 
the trial court granted the writ,ruling that the attorney general abused her discretion by accepting the amendments as reasonably germane to the original measure.b.the court found that the theme and purpose of the original initiative was reform of the juvenile justice system,whereas the amended version deals primarily with reform of the adult justice system.the court also ruled that the purpose and intent of section were violated because the public was deprived of the opportunity to comment on the amended measure.
the governor and the proponents of the measure sought emergency relief in this court,based on the shortness of time remaining for collecting signatures to qualify the measure for the ballot.we stayed the trial court judgment and ordered cdaa to show cause why the requested relief should not be granted.
ii.discussion 
as noted,the elections code limits the extent to which a proposed measure may be amended once it is posted for public comment.amendments must be reasonably germane to the theme,purpose,or subject of the initiative measure as originally proposed.b.cdaa argues that the trial court judgment honors the terms and purposes of section.it contends the statute was intended to enhance the transparency of the initiative process by giving the public a meaningful opportunity to review and comment on proposed measures.it reasons that this opportunity is lost if a measure is replaced with a dramatically different version never exposed to public comment.it claims such a substitution deprives the legislative analyst of the time needed to prepare a fiscal estimate,the attorney general of the time needed to properly prepare a circulating title and summary,and potential opponents of the time needed to mount a campaign against the initiative.cdaa suggests the legislature contemplated only amendments to correct drafting errors and legal flaws,and urges us to construe the reasonably germane standard accordingly.finally,cdaa contends that even if the standard is applied broadly,the changes made in this initiative measure are not reasonably germane to the original proposal under section b.
with regard to the purposes of the statutory scheme and the time frames it imposes,the legislative history is instructive.after reviewing that history,we will turn to the reasonably germane standard and its application here.
section in the light of legislative history 
the legislature is authorized to provide the manner in which petitions shall be circulated,presented,and certified,and measures submitted to the electors.cal,art ii,subd.e.it first addressed the subject of amendments to proposed initiative measures in,when it revised former section.the attorney general was directed to provide a copy of the title and summary to the secretary of state within days after receipt of the fiscal estimate or opinion.former,as amended by stats,ch.the amended statute provided if during the day period,the proponents of the proposed initiative measure submit amendments,other than technical,nonsubstantive amendments,to the final version of such measure,the attorney general shall provide a copy of the title and summary to the secretary of state within days after receipt of such amendments.ibid.thus,the legislature placed no restriction on the nature of the amendments proponents might submit,providing only that if substantive changes were made,a new day period would begin for the attorney general to prepare a title and summary.
that statutory regime remained in place for years.the operative provisions were transferred to section in,and to section a in.stats,ch,stats,ch.in,the legislature enacted the provisions now before us as part of senate bill number reg.sess.bill.the bill was revised a number times before passage.
as originally proposed,the amendments included provisions requiring the attorney general to initiate a day public comment period by posting the text of a proposed initiative on her website.the first version instructed the attorney general to p romot e public participation by inviting on the web site written public comments on the proposed initiative measure.the site shall accept written public comments for the duration of the public review period.public comments may address perceived errors in the drafting of,or perceived unintended consequences of,the proposed initiative measure.the attorney general shall transmit any written public comments received during the public review period to the proponents of the proposed initiative measure.bill,as introduced.section b said simply,d uring the public review period,the proponents of the proposed initiative measure may submit amendments to the measure.bill,as introduced.section b specified,as it does now,that t he submission of an amendment shall not extend the period to prepare the estimate required by section.bill,as introduced,italics added.
section b was not modified during the legislative process.it states an amendment shall not be accepted more than five days after the public review period is concluded.however,a proponent shall not be prohibited from proposing a new initiative measure and requesting that a circulating title and summary be prepared for that measure pursuant to section.bill,as introduced.the provisions governing the time for the attorney general to prepare a circulating title and summary were set out in section,subdivision b,which also was enacted as originally framed the attorney general shall provide a copy of the circulating title and summary and its unique numeric identifier to the proponents and to the secretary of state within days after receipt of the fiscal estimate or opinion prepared by the department of finance and the legislative analyst pursuant to section.bill,as introduced.
the first bill analysis that appears in the legislative history was prepared for a hearing on the first amended version.none of the amendments affected the statutes relevant here,but the author of the legislation commented presently,there is not a sufficient review process of initiatives by the public or the legislature where either is able to provide greater input and suggest amendments or correct flaws before the measure is printed on the ballot.implementing a better public review process before the title and summary process by the attorney general helps address this deficiency.com.on elections and constitutional amendments,analysis of bill,as amended.other comments provided a summary of related legislation,which noted assembly bill number laird of,would have similarly allowed for a day public period prior to the attorney general drafting the title and summary.assembly bill number was vetoed by former governor gray davis who stated in relevant part i am concerned that an initiative could receive either a negative or positive comment while displayed on the secretary of state web site the proponents may then revise the initiative,but are not required to repost it.consequently,the public may see one version of the initiative prior to the election and an entirely different initiative during the election.ibid.
the provisions governing the public comment period were then revised to read as they do today.the attorney general is required to i nvit e,and provid e for the submission of,written public comments on the proposed initiative measure on her web site,and t he site shall accept written public comments for the duration of the public review period.a,as amended by bill on june.however,the comments are not displayed on the site.instead,t he attorney general shall transmit any written public comments received during the public review period to the proponents of the proposed initiative measure.ibid.the following statement was removed from section a and added to bill uncodified findings and declarations public comment may address perceived errors in the drafting of,or perceived unintended consequences of,the proposed initiative measure.bill,as amended june,subd.b.the provisions governing amendments were not changed at this time.
in a subsequent bill analysis,the following criticisms were directed against section treatment of amendments possibility of spot initiatives during the public review period,this bill permits proponents of a proposed initiative measure to submit amendments to the measure.however,this bill does not place any limitation on the amendments submitted by the proponents.consequently,this bill does not prevent a proponent from receiving public comments on the text of a spot initiative,and then submitting a substantially revised initiative text to the attorney general after the day public comment period for the ballot title and summary preparation.this scenario renders the public review process meaningless.moreover,the proponents of a proposed measure could do this and circumvent paying another filing fee.
furthermore,because this bill does not prevent the submission of a spot initiative,the time period that the legislative analyst and dof the department of finance have to prepare the fiscal estimate could be negatively impacted.this bill,which extends the time for the dof and the legislative analyst to prepare the fiscal estimate from working days to days,also permits the proponents to submit amendments days after the day public review period.as a result,if the proponents submit an amendment that substantively changes the initiative text,the dof and legislative analyst will only have days to prepare a new fiscal estimate.assem.com.on elections and redistricting,analysis of bill,as amended june.
thereafter,section b was revised to add the following italicized language during the public review period,the proponents of the proposed initiative measure may submit amendments to the measure that further its purposes,as determined by the attorney general.bill,as amended july.the provision was amended again a month later during the public review period,the proponents of the proposed initiative measure may submit amendments to the measure that are reasonably germane to the theme,purpose,or subject of the initiative measure as originally proposed.however,amendments shall not be submitted if the initiative measure as originally proposed would not effect a substantive change in law.b,italics added,as amended by bill on.no further changes were made to the relevant provisions.
the evolution of the governing statutes,as set forth above,puts to rest cdaa arguments about the purposes of section.while the legislature intended to improve the initiative process by allowing members of the public to make suggestions to proponents,it did not establish a public forum for comments or provide a broadly transparent amendment process.nor did the legislature limit proponents to amendments correcting drafting errors or legal flaws,as cdaa suggests.in its originally proposed form,the statute permitted amendments without any limitation as to their substance,consistent with the state of the law since.the sponsor of the bill informed his fellow legislators that the new public comment period was intended to allow the public to suggest amendments or correct flaws.
when it was noted that an earlier proposal for a day public comment period had been vetoed,out of concern that the public might be asked to vote on an initiative measure that was entirely different from the one posted for comment,the statute was amended to specify that comments were not to be posted online for public review,as they would have been under the vetoed legislation.see fn,ante.they were simply to be sent to the measure proponents.at the same time,language suggesting that public comments were meant to address perceived errors and unintended consequences was taken out of the operative provisions of section and moved to an uncodified section of bill number.thus,while corrections of this nature are among the contemplated purposes of the statute,the drafters went out of their way to avoid any implication in section that they are the only reason for enabling public comments.
when more pointed objections were raised that the proposed legislation placed no restriction on amendments,allowing extensive alterations that would render the public comment period meaningless,the statute was not revised to limit amendments to nonsubstantive changes.such a restriction would have been a natural one because it was part of existing law,which provided no extension of time for the attorney general to prepare a title and summary after nonsubstantive amendments.former a see stats,ch.instead,the statute was initially altered to require the attorney general to determine whether amendments furthered the purposes of the original measure shortly thereafter,that requirement was dropped and section b was given its current form.the limitation imposed on amendments is a lenient one they must be reasonably germane to the theme,purpose,or subject of the initiative measure as originally proposed.b.
spot initiatives are addressed by a provision barring amendments if the initiative measure as originally proposed would not effect a substantive change in law.b.cdaa,however,takes issue with the policy of allowing substantive amendments to any initiative measure.it argues that permitting such amendments facilitates maneuvers akin to the legislative practice of gutting and amending a proposed bill.cdaa does not define what it means by gut and amend,but presumably it refers to instances where the contents of a bill are deleted and replaced with different provisions at a late stage,bypassing the usual legislative process.that is not an apt analogy to the procedures established by section,which provides for public comment as an initial step.the usual process for initiative measures follows the measure is circulated for signatures,placed on the ballot if sufficient signatures are gathered,and subjected to the tests of the campaign season.
at the early stage addressed in section,the legislature intentionally left ample room for proponents to make substantive changes.it squarely considered,and was not moved by,the possibility that a measure emerging from the public comment process would be significantly different from the original.by ensuring that comments would not be posted,but transmitted directly to the proponents,the legislature signaled its intent that comments are for the benefit of proponents,not for the purpose of fostering public discussion.it could have,but did not,require proponents to respond to comments or to post amendments for a second round of comment.cdaa objection that this procedure does not serve the purpose of transparency fails to acknowledge that the avenue for public comment laid out by the legislature runs only one way,and for only one round of suggestions 
the legislative history also undermines cdaa arguments concerning the time frames allowed by the statutory scheme.although the drafters of section were warned that it might leave as little as days for the preparation of a fiscal estimate,they did not respond by expanding the time allowed.to the contrary,they retained a provision stating that the time for preparing the estimate would not be extended by the submission of amendments.b.no unreasonable burden was thereby imposed.the legislature was familiar with the existing provisions of section,subdivision c,which explicitly permit the responsible entities to provide an opinion of a measure fiscal impact if they deem the time too short for preparation of an estimate.the legislature also knew that if a measure qualifies for the ballot,a more thorough statement of its fiscal impacts is prepared by the legislative analyst and summarized by the attorney general for inclusion on the ballot.thus,the legislature was satisfied that existing law adequately addresses the concerns raised by cdaa over the time for preparing a fiscal estimate.
cdaa further objects that the attorney general is entitled to days to prepare a circulating title and summary,which she will not have if a measure is substantially amended after submission.cdaa arrives at this day period by adding the days provided for preparation of a fiscal estimate under section,subdivision c to the days permitted by section,subdivision b for preparing a title and summary after receipt of the fiscal estimate.however,under the statutory scheme replaced by bill number,the attorney general was given only days to produce a title and summary after receiving substantive amendments to a proposed initiative measure.see former a stats,ch.the new statutes actually allow more time.the comment period is days,followed by five days for accepting amendments.even if an amendment is accepted on the day,there are days remaining for the preparation of a fiscal estimate or opinion,and the attorney general has an additional days to perform her functions after obtaining the fiscal report,subd.b,subd.c.
finally,there is no merit in cdaa claim that allowing amendments to the substance of a measure after the public comment period deprives opponents of time to mount a campaign.opponents can use the comment period to communicate their objections to proponents.thereafter,they have ample opportunities to make their case during the lengthy process of signature gathering,ballot qualification,and the election itself.
b.the reasonably germane standard 
section b provision requiring amendments by proponents to be reasonably germane to the theme,purpose,or subject of the initiative measure as originally proposed is plainly taken from our case law applying the constitutional requirement that a n initiative measure embracing more than one subject may not be submitted to the electors or have any effect cal,art ii,subd.d.we have long held that the constitutional single subject rule is satisfied so long as challenged provisions meet the test of being reasonably germane to a common theme,purpose,or subject.californians for an open primary mcpherson cal th,mcpherson,and cases cited.this standard reflects our liberal interpretative tradition of sustaining statutes and initiatives which fairly disclose a reasonable and common sense relationship among their various components in furtherance of a common purpose.legislature eu cal d,quoting brosnahan brown cal d.
cdaa does not dispute the derivation of the reasonably germane standard.it urges,however,that the standard operates differently in this statutory context than it does under the constitution.section b requires an amendment to be reasonably germane to the theme,purpose,or subject of the initiative measure as originally proposed italics added,whereas an initiative measure will pass the constitutional single subject test so long as challenged provisions meet the test of being reasonably germane to a common theme,purpose,or subject mcpherson,supra,cal th at,italics added and deleted.we agree that the frame of reference is different in the two contexts,though the difference may be a subtle one.under section b,a proponent amendment is compared with the original measure.under the single subject rule,the various internal parts of a measure are examined for their relationship to an overarching objective.in mcpherson,at,fn,we observed that whether provisions are reasonably germane to each other and whether all provisions are reasonably germane to a common theme,purpose,or subject are different,but related questions.thus,as both sides here recognize,we are not reviewing the public safety and rehabilitation act of for compliance with the single subject rule.
even though the focus of the test is different under section b,the legislature adoption of the terms reasonably germane and theme,purpose,or subject is significant.it could have used synonyms,such as rationally related and concern,objective,or topic.instead it chose terms of art with which it is quite familiar,given that the reasonably germane standard also governs the separate single subject requirement applicable to legislative enactments.cal,art.iv,a statute shall embrace but one subject mcpherson,supra,cal th at.the legislature was well aware that in the constitutional context,these terms have been applied in an accommodating and lenient manner so as not to unduly restrict the legislature or the people right to package provisions in a single bill or initiative.mcpherson,at.
there is no reason to suppose the legislature contemplated a more limited meaning for reasonably germane and theme,purpose,or subject under the statute.it is a venerable principle that when a word or phrase appearing in a statute has a legal meaning,it will be given that meaning in construing the statute.this has long been the law of california the rule of construction of statutes is plain.where they make use of words and phrases of a and definite sense in the law,they are to be received and expounded in the same sense in the statute.harris reynolds cal.this rule has been declared in our basic codes since they were first enacted in,words and phrases are to be construed according to approved usage,but such others as may have acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning in law are to be construed according to such peculiar and appropriate meaning accord,code civ,subd.arnett dal cielo cal th.
accordingly,we review this proposed measure remembering that the initiative process occupies an important and favored status in the california constitutional scheme,and therefore the reasonably germane standard should not be interpreted in an unduly narrow or restrictive fashion.senate of the state of cal.jones cal th,and cases cited.we have consistently deemed it our duty to guard the people right to exercise the initiative power.id.at.the proponents of an initiative measure are captains of the ship when it comes to deciding which provisions to take on board.in section,the legislature has granted them substantial leeway to make amendments before the measure is presented to the public for signatures.the statute permits even sweeping changes,so long as they are reasonably germane to the theme,purpose,or subject of the original proposal.
with these guidelines in mind,we apply section b to the amendments at issue.as noted,the amended version of the initiative measure requires a judicial transfer order before a minor can be prosecuted as an adult and sets age limits for such a transfer.cdaa does not dispute that these provisions are reasonably germane to the very similar ones found in the original measure.it concedes that the deletion of other original provisions applying to juvenile dispositions,commitments,and records was a reasonably germane amendment.cdaa arguments center on fact that the proponents replaced their original amendment of penal code section with a broader constitutional amendment.
before comparing the terms of the original and amended proposals,we address cdaa argument that the original submission was concerned with juvenile justice,while the amendments were concerned with the adult criminal justice system.the claim fails.both as it now exists and as it would have been amended by the initially proposed measure,penal code section applies only to inmates in state prison,not juvenile facilities.cdaa contends the amendments to penal code section were merely collateral to the juvenile justice reforms of the original measure.it relies on manduley superior court cal th,a single subject case in which we held that provisions expanding the list of three strikes offenses were collateral to other provisions addressing gang and juvenile offenses.manduley is inapposite.here the parole reforms were central to the proponents original submission,which was prefaced by the declaration evidence shows that authorizing judges and parole boards to consider release of individuals that have become rehabilitated reduces waste and incentivizes rehabilitation.we note that even the provisions of the original measure governing the prosecution of minors in adult court,which were retained by the amended version in substantially similar form,would have had a significant effect on adult courts and correctional facilities.
the originally submitted statutory amendment proposed changes to the parole suitability review process for prisoners under the age of at the time of their offense.it had two components eliminating enhancements from the calculation of the relevant term of imprisonment,and removing the bar against parole hearings for three strikes offenders.the newly proposed constitutional provision also addresses parole suitability review.it would be significantly more restrictive in one way,because it would apply only to prisoners convicted of felonies.it would be significantly less restrictive in another way,because it would apply to all prisoners regardless of their age at the time of the offense.it would also authorize the department of corrections and rehabilitation to award credits for good behavior and rehabilitation 
given the accommodating and lenient review to which the proponents are entitled mcpherson,supra,cal th at,we can not say the amended measure is not reasonably germane to the theme,purpose,or subject of the original.both proposals address parole suitability review for inmates in state prison,with an eye toward making such review available at an earlier stage than under existing law.both accomplish this objective by removing enhancements from the calculation of parole review dates.neither makes any change in the determinate sentencing statutes per se.both are intended to benefit prisoners who have rehabilitated themselves in custody,and to reduce the costs of incarceration 
cdaa places great reliance on the fact that the original proposal would have provided hearings only for a younger class of offenders.however,as the proponents point out,some offenders covered by the original proposal are serving three strikes sentences.those prisoners would have been by the time they received parole suitability review.the amended version would apply to the same class of offenders,so long as their offense was nonviolent.it would include others of the same age or younger who are serving shorter sentences,as well as older inmates who have completed the full term for their primary offense.the theme,purpose,and subject of the original measure are easily recognizable in the amended version,even though it would allow parole hearings for offenders regardless of their age at the time of their offenses.
cdaa objects that the amended version would enact a broad constitutional provision,whereas the original would have amended a statute with narrower application.but the reasonably germane standard imposes no limit on the scope of amendments within range of the theme,purpose,or subject of the original proposal.b.in the single subject context,we have held that the standard does not preclude comprehensive,reform in a particular area of public concern.senate of the state of cal.jones,supra,cal th at.we have also held that initiative measures combining significant constitutional amendments with statutory changes comply with the standard.raven deukmejian,supra,cal d at brosnahan brown,supra,cal d at.by adopting the central terms from the reasonably germane standard as it developed in single subject cases for use in section b,the legislature indicated its intent to allow substantial changes by proponents,even constitutional amendments,after the public comment period.
cdaa makes a perfunctory argument that the substituted measure can not be considered an amendment under section b.it relies on a court of appeal opinion applying the constitutional limitation on the legislature power to amend initiative measures.franchise tax bd.cory d cal,art.ii,subd.c.in no way do we suggest that initiative proponents face similar limitations in deciding whether to amend their own proposals.we note,however,that the language relied on by cdaa would include the new proposal here as an amendment its aim is to reach situations which were not covered by the original.cory,at see people kelly cal th,fn.other authority quoted in cory supports the same conclusion an amendment is any change of the scope or effect of an existing statute,whether by addition,omission,or substitution of provisions,which does not wholly terminate its existence,whether by an act purporting to amend,repeal,revise,or supplement,or by an act independent and original in form,sutherland,statutory construction ed.cory,at see kelly,at,fn.
there is no question that the changes the proponents made to this initiative measure were,in certain respects,quite extensive.however,that is their right,so long as the changes are reasonably germane to the original theme,purpose,or subject.the amended measure,like the original,addresses the process for transferring minors to adult court for criminal prosecution,and expands parole suitability review for state prisoners.it meets the accommodating standard established in section b.accordingly,the trial court erred in directing the attorney general to reject the amended measure.
iii.disposition 
a peremptory writ of mandate shall issue,directing the trial court to vacate its judgment and enter a new order denying the relief sought by cdaa.
in my view,the superior court was correct.i would deny the instant writ petition.
the amendment to elections code section section was a legislative reform designed to improve the initiative process.this case sets the precedent establishing whether that section can function as a true reform to achieve its intended purpose,or if it is an empty shell just another rule that can easily be evaded with a little imagination.
as amended,section,subdivision a,requires a day period of public review of all proposed initiative measures,during which time the public may make written comments to be transmitted to the measure proponents.section,subdivision b,provides that during this public review period,the proponents of the proposed initiative measure may submit amendments to the measure that are reasonably germane to the theme,purpose,or subject of the initiative measure as originally proposed.the reasonably germane language is taken from cases interpreting the single subject rule.see californians for an open primary mcpherson cal th.i agree with the majority that this court has interpreted the term broadly when deciding whether an initiative measure satisfies the single subject rule.but that does not mean the legislature intended the same broad interpretation in this context.in amending section,the legislature did not merely incorporate the single subject rule.
we do not have to look far to find the legislative intent behind section.the legislature itself stated its intent in the bill that led to the amendment.as enacted,the bill stated the legislature intent to do,among other things,the following identify ing and correct ing flaws in an initiative measure before it appears on the ballot.currently,proponents of an initiative measure have few options to correct the language of an initiative measure or to withdraw a petition for a proposed initiative measure,even when flaws are identified.this act would give voters an opportunity to comment on an initiative measure before the petition is circulated for signatures.public comment may address perceived errors in the drafting of,or perceived unintended consequences of,the proposed initiative measure.stats,ch,subd.b.
thus,the legislature intended to improve the quality of initiative measures by requiring a period of public review and permitting amendment to correct flaws that review revealed.as originally introduced,the bill permitted any amendment to the proposed initiative measure.bill reg.sess.as introduced.the legislature was concerned about this.as a bill analysis stated,this bill does not place any limitation on the amendments submitted by the proponents.consequently,this bill does not prevent a proponent from receiving public comments on the text of a spot initiative,and then submitting a substantially revised initiative text to the attorney general after the day public comment period for the ballot title and summary preparation.this scenario renders the public review process meaningless.assem.com.on elections redistricting,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended june,italics added.
it should be obvious the legislature intended the public review process to be meaningful,not meaningless.it added the reasonably germane limitation to ensure that it would be meaningful.consistent with this legislative intent,we must interpret section,subdivision b in a way that makes the review process meaningful rather than something easily evaded.
the same bill analysis expressed another concern that the reasonably germane language was also intended to obviate.furthermore,because this bill does not prevent the submission of a spot initiative,the time period that the legislative analyst and department of finance have to prepare the fiscal estimate could be negatively impacted.this bill,which extends the time for the department of finance and the legislative analyst to prepare the fiscal estimate from working days to days,also permits the proponents to submit amendments days after the day public review period.as a result,if the proponents submit an amendment that substantively changes the initiative text,the department of finance and legislative analyst will only have days to prepare a new fiscal estimate.assem.com.on elections redistricting,analysis of bill,supra.the legislature was thus concerned that the fiscal analysis be afforded adequate time.
as even the majority recognizes,the legislature intended to improve the initiative process by allowing members of the public to make suggestions to proponents,ante,at.in this way,the legislature enacted the comment period to benefit the public,and not merely the initiative proponents.the legislature made the public comment period mandatory,not optional.the reason is clear.the legislature wanted to improve the final product.it wanted to permit the public to point out obvious,and not so obvious,flaws in a measure drafting so the proponents could correct those flaws before the measure was irrevocably placed on the ballot.
when he signed the amendment to section into law,the governor made clear it was intended to benefit the public and not merely proponents of initiative measures.he issued a press release saying that he signed it to increase public participation in the initiative process and provide better information to voters on ballot measures.california initiative process is a hallmark of our electoral system and today we taking an important step to modernize and strengthen direct democracy,said governor brown.the measure introduces a day public review period at the beginning of the initiative process.proponents can amend the initiative in response to public input during that review period.governor edmund brown,press release regarding bill reg.sess.
the same press release quoted the bill supporters as saying the bill would enabl e broader debate and public review so that measures can be modified before they go to the ballot,avoiding unintended consequences and would give voters the chance to address flaws if there are problems with the language.governor edmund brown,press release regarding bill,supra,italics added.it quoted former chief justice ronald george too often,ballot measures are confusing and poorly written,but there is no chance for initiative backers to make even the most routine changes.this legislation makes improvements that will help voters understand what their votes mean and enable them to make informed decisions.ibid.
the majority observes,correctly,that the initiative process occupies an important and favored status in the california constitutional scheme,and we must guard the people right to exercise the initiative power,ante,at.but this observation does not mean the initiative process can not be improved.exercising its constitutional responsibility to provide the manner in which petitions shall be circulated,presented,and certified,and measures submitted to the electors cal,art.ii,subd.e,the legislature amended section to do just that.nor does this observation mean that a statute like section that is designed to improve the process should be given a crabbed interpretation that defeats its purpose.in no way does enforcing section to achieve its purpose diminish the important and favored status the initiative process occupies in our constitutional scheme.it just makes the process work better.proponents of measures may still circulate what they want.they merely have to provide enough lead time to do so consistent with legal and practical requirements,including section.the proponents of the measure at issue here inform us they did not have enough time to submit the proposed constitutional amendment for public comment.but that is their doing,not the legislature.
initiative proponents should not be permitted to defeat statutory requirements by submitting for public review a measure vaguely similar to what is ultimately intended,then on day or so,finally showing their hand by substituting something dramatically different,something that will never receive the mandatory public review.
i now turn to the initiative measure at issue here.certainly,some of the amendments are reasonably germane to the original measure.some simply eliminate many of the changes in the law concerning juveniles included in the original proposal.but the newly proposed constitutional amendment the centerpiece of the new initiative measure is not reasonably germane.it would work a major change in california constitutional form unrelated to the original measure under the majority holding,that constitutional amendment will never receive public comment or the opportunity to amend to correct drafting flaws.but it is entirely different from the original measure.
i must admit the previous sentence is a slight a very slight overstatement.vague similarities exist between the new proposed constitutional provision and the original measure.both involve the criminal justice system in the broadest sense the original measure concerned juvenile and,to a lesser extent,youthful offenders the constitutional amendment concerns mostly adult offenders.to some extent,both involve the potential release of inmates,although in very different ways.to some extent,both involve parole,although in very different ways.but there the similarity ends.
the stated reason for the newly proposed constitutional amendment to enhance public safety,improve rehabilitation,and avoid the release of prisoners by federal court order amended measure,adding art.i,proposed,subd.a has nothing to do with juveniles,meaning it has nothing to do with the original measure juvenile focus.
dramatically changing the sentencing laws by permitting early parole for some offenders,contrary to the detailed sentencing scheme currently in effect is not reasonably germane to changing the treatment of juvenile and youthful offenders in the criminal justice system.supposedly avoiding the release of prisoners by federal court order the purpose the proponents stress in their argument that the measure must qualify for the ballot has nothing to do with the original measure.
the constitutional amendment would also give the department of corrections and rehabilitation department constitutional authority to award behavior and other credits.the legislature has already enacted detailed mandatory provisions for the department to award conduct and participation credits.see,et but the amended measure proposed constitutional language is permissive.presumably,authority to award credits includes authority not to award credits or to award lower credits than the statutes currently require.because the constitution prevails over mere statutes,it appears the proposed constitutional amendment would displace the current statutory provisions for credits and shift authority over such credits from the legislative to the executive branch of government.
for the moment,i will assume that altering the balance of power between the two branches of government in this way would not be an impermissible constitutional revision.legislature eu cal d,finding a initiative imposing term limits on members of the legislature was not invalid,as a procedurally defective constitutional revision,because n o legislative power is diminished or delegated to other persons or agencies.the relationships between the three governmental branches,and their respective powers,remain untouched.but shifting power from one branch of government to another is not reasonably germane to the original measure,which left the separation of powers between the branches of government unchanged.
the new constitutional provision would also have an entirely different,and obviously complex,fiscal impact that warrants careful study.whatever work was done on the fiscal analysis of the original measure would be useless in analyzing the fiscal impact of the proposed constitutional amendment those responsible for that analysis would have to start from the beginning.the amendment would require at least thousands of new parole hearings,and would presumably require such hearings to be regularly conducted at intervals yet to be determined.regulations would have to be adopted.some unknown number of inmates would be released.all this suggests that the day period under section for the joint fiscal analysis of the new measure should not be reduced to days,as it was here.
i agree with the majority that the legislature intended the comment period to facilitate feedback,not to create a broad public forum,and that the avenue for public comment runs for only one round of suggestions,ante,at.but the legislature did intend to facilitate feedback and to permit one round of suggestions.the proposed constitutional amendment the main part of the new proposal has received no feedback and no round of suggestions.if the court overturns the superior court order,it never will receive such comment and can not be amended.
but the proposed constitutional amendment is exactly the sort of measure that would greatly benefit from public comment and the opportunity to make amendments.disregarding its merits,public comment could easily expose its drafting flaws.for example 
it seems odd to embed permanently in the california constitution a reference to a potential federal court order in an unnamed piece of litigation.amended measure,adding art.i,proposed,subd.a.it is also redundant,as this purpose is already referenced in a preceding portion of the new initiative measure,where it more logically belongs.amended initiative measure,par.one purpose of the measure is to prevent federal courts from indiscriminately releasing prisoners.
it seems particularly odd,and pointless,to conclude a statement of purpose with the language,notwithstanding anything in this article or any other provision of law.amended measure,adding art.i,proposed,subd.a.
more substantively,the constitutional provision never defines the term felony offense.because the united states supreme court recently declared unconstitutional as impermissibly vague the term violent felony in a federal statute john
