charles woolsey was convicted of drug and firearms offenses after police executed a search warrant at his residence and discovered a cache of guns,cocaine,marijuana,and methamphetamine.on appeal woolsey challenges the denial of his motion to suppress the evidence seized at his house,as well as the district court exclusion of two witnesses at his jury trial.the government and argues that at sentencing the district court erred in refusing to impose a life term on his conviction for possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute.we affirm woolsey convictions but vacate his sentence on the methamphetamine count and remand with directions to impose a life term on that count.
initial investigation 
in march,after police in paoli,indiana,had received complaints of drug activity,police chief barry chastain and assistant police chief josh babcock visited the home of melissa mccoy.the man who answered the door robert bo tuell exhibited signs of heavy drug abuse,including sores on his face.chastain and babcock knew tuell,if distantly,and had noticed him around town in recent months in worsening health.the officers had also heard rumors that tuell was selling methamphetamine.their conversation was brief.chastain and babcock told tuell that if he continued to use and sell drugs he would end up back in jail or worse,that he needed to stop,and that help was available at a local drug rehabilitation center.neither officer threatened arrest.
a few weeks later tuell contacted chastain and asked for assistance.tuell explained that he was strung out,had ruined a lot of lives,and no longer wanted to be involved with drugs.chastain then contacted a local rehabilitation counselor,and the three men met to discuss tuell problems.during the meeting tuell admitted that he was a drug dealer and that he was selling drugs for charles woolsey.chastain invited tuell to elaborate,although he did not offer tuell any reward for the information or threaten tuell with arrest.nevertheless,tuell told chastain that in the previous week he had seen over two pounds of methamphetamine at woolsey house as well as marijuana and cocaine,all of which could be found in woolsey tool box,a lock box,or in various trash cans inside the house.tuell also mentioned that woolsey had recently traveled to texas,as he did each month,to obtain a fresh shipment of drugs.when asked to identify woolsey,tuell reported that woolsey drove a mid blue chevrolet pickup truck.tuell also provided a home phone number and cell phone number for woolsey.chastain immediately communicated this information to babcock,who supervised all drug investigations.
in an effort to corroborate tuell statements,babcock spoke with indiana state trooper jonathan lamb,who confirmed tuell description of woolsey pickup.babcock also spoke with sergeant paul andry of the indiana state police,who told babcock that tuell had once before provided reliable information that led to a criminal conviction,albeit ten to twelve years earlier.babcock then prepared an affidavit of probable cause summarizing the information provided by tuell,lamb,and andry and a proposed search warrant for woolsey house.in his affidavit,babcock revealed that tuell described in the affidavit as a confidential informant was a drug addict 
the is neither seeking leniency nor financial compensation in exchange for the information that they have sic given.the is concerned about the use of illegal drugs,especially methamphetamine,in the county.the also stated that they was sic addicted to methamphetamine and needs help for his addiction.
a state judge approved the search warrant.
on april,law enforcement officers executed the search warrant and discovered approximately pound of cocaine,two pounds of methamphetamine,pounds of marijuana,numerous guns,and in currency in and around woolsey home.federal authorities then took over the investigation and charged woolsey in a superseding indictment with possession with intent to distribute grams or more of methamphetamine,see a,b a viii,possession with intent to distribute cocaine,see id.a,possession with intent to distribute marijuana,see id.a,b d,possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime,see c a i,and possession of a firearm by a felon,see id.g.
district court proceedings 
before trial woolsey moved to suppress the evidence seized from his home because,he maintained,the search warrant was not supported by probable cause.woolsey argued that there was no significant corroboration of tuell statements prior to the search and tuell reliability as an informant could not rest on a single instance of useful information provided over a decade ago.woolsey also sought suppression under a second,alternative theory,asserting that babcock affidavit provided false information and omitted material facts that undermined probable cause.see franks delaware,d.according to woolsey,the supporting affidavit mischaracterized tuell as a concerned citizen and deceived the issuing judge by failing to mention that tuell was a drug dealer,that chastain and babcock had threatened him with arrest,and that ten years had passed since he last cooperated with law enforcement.moreover,woolsey argued,tuell now denied that he ever spoke to chastain about woolsey marijuana or woolsey supplier in texas.
following a suppression hearing,the district court concluded that the supporting affidavit did not establish probable cause but held,nonetheless,that suppression was inappropriate in light of the exception enunciated in united states leon,d.despite the absence of probable cause,the district court explained,the officers had obtained and executed the warrant in good faith.and babcock had not,according to the court,intentionally or recklessly misled the judge who issued the warrant 
so,even with the deference that a court in my situation owes to the judge at the time,and even in light of the flexible and common sense approach we take to issues of probable cause,i think this was too thin to establish probable cause.there was no corroboration of anything incriminating and it all depended on the uncertain reliability of tuell.
there are differences between what chastain and babcock remember about what tuell told chastain and what chastain relayed to babcock,and what tuell remembers about whether he said anything about marijuana,and whether he told chastain anything about his source on or about april,as opposed to a week or so later.
i think chastain and babcock are credible.i do think what they put in the affidavit is a hundred percent accurate,but i do believe that they were being honest in relaying the information.
i also do find that there were deliberate omissions or deliberate deceptions in what was presented to the judge.they let the judge know that tuell was a methamphetamine addict.the information that they had about whether he was involved in dealing was sketchy enough and dicey enough that i do believe they acted irresponsibly and certainly not dishonestly by leaving that information out.
after this ruling,woolsey requested that the district court compel the appearance at trial of two men in state custody,mark frentz and david turner.see c.woolsey informed the court that he anticipated eliciting the following testimony prior to woolsey arrest,frentz who at the time was in the county jail awaiting trial on unrelated drug and murder charges had suspected that woolsey was involved romantically with his girlfriend,and had tried to retaliate by soliciting other inmates,including turner,to kill woolsey or plant drugs at his residence.despite skepticism that the two men could provide admissible testimony even if they were willing,the court granted woolsey request for writs of habeas corpus ad testificandum.see id.
on the second day of trial,frentz and turner proffered their testimony outside the presence of the jury.not surprisingly,frentz invoked his fifth amendment right against and refused to answer questions about his conversations with other jail inmates.he did,however,deny asking anyone in jail to plant drugs on woolsey property.the district court in turn concluded that frentz had no relevant testimony to offer the jury and refused to permit his appearance simply for the purpose of inviting him to take the amendment in front of the jury.
turner proffer was more complex.the district court summarized the proposed testimony following a series of questions posed to turner 
the critical testimony,as i understand it,is that turner would testify that shortly after frentz arrived in his cell block in late january of,frentz expressed jealousy and hatred towards woolsey,and expressed a desire to either kill woolsey or set him up by having someone plant drugs at woolsey property.
the testimony would also be that turner did not accept this invitation that frentz remained in custody at all relevant times,as did turner and that there is no evidence from turner that frentz invited anyone else to carry out such a scheme.
the district court concluded that turner testimony would not be relevant because it established only frentz motive but not opportunity.after all,the court noted,we know that turner did do it frentz did do it himself and there no evidence that anybody else did.furthermore,the court reasoned,the particular that turner had said frentz solicited was inconsistent with the evidence found in woolsey home.turner had reported that frentz proposed building a methamphetamine laboratory in an outbuilding on woolsey property and scattering loose marijuana elsewhere on the premises.but,as the court observed,the methamphetamine,cocaine,and marijuana actually seized from woolsey residence was worth over,an amount that far exceeded what frentz could have mustered,however indirectly,after his arrest and the seizure of his own drugs.even if turner testimony was relevant,the court continued,it would not satisfy federal rule of evidence because its potential to delay the trial or confuse and mislead the jury exceeded its slight probative value virtually zero.finally,the court added,the hearsay exception for statements against interest would not authorize turner to testify about frentz jailhouse solicitation because of the absence of corroborating circumstances that might support the trustworthiness of the statements attributed to frentz.see.b.
at the conclusion of trial,the jury found woolsey guilty of all five offenses charged in the superseding indictment.
sentencing 
prior to trial the government filed an enhancement information,see,detailing two prior drug felonies that would trigger a mandatory term of life imprisonment if,as was alleged in the first count of the superseding indictment,woolsey possessed for distribution at least grams of methamphetamine,see b a viii.at sentencing woolsey conceded that his indiana conviction would count for enhancement purposes,but he challenged the use of his federal conviction.in,woolsey explained,an arizona district court had sentenced him to two years probation under the federal youth corrections act for possessing with intent to distribute approximately pounds of marijuana.woolsey recounted that his probation officer had informed him that this conviction would be set aside automatically upon successful completion of his probation.but this information was not accurate,as woolsey now understood only an early discharge of probation had the effect of setting aside a conviction under the act,and because woolsey term was not discharged early,his only recourse after he completed his probation in was to petition the district court in arizona to grant him a nunc pro tunc early unconditional discharge and set aside his conviction.see tuten united states,d united states sumner,cir united states gardner,cir.woolsey professed that he was unaware of this requirement until seeing the government enhancement information,which explained why his conviction was still on the books.
eager to avoid life imprisonment,woolsey asked the district court in this case to set aside his conviction.the government urged the court to reject the motion for numerous reasons,chief among them was that the court lacked jurisdiction to fulfill the request.furthermore,the government insisted,woolsey maneuvering constituted a collateral attack on his earlier conviction and the clock had long since run on the statute of limitations found in e.the court responded by postponing woolsey sentencing so he could seek relief from the arizona district court.but after nearly five months had passed with no ruling from arizona the court decided to proceed with sentencing but disregard the conviction for purposes of b a 
i believe it is also appropriate under these circumstances to not count the marijuana conviction for this purpose.on that issue,with respect to both the guidelines and the issue,i will say that it seems to me that there is no apparent reasons in this record why the defendant should not have been discharged early as to what is the customary practice as was intended and,in essence,the court ought to treat as having been done what should have been done under general equitable powers.
still,even one prior felony drug conviction subjected woolsey to a mandatory minimum.see b a viii.and his c charge carried an additional,consecutive mandatory minimum term.see c a i.the applicable guidelines imprisonment range,without regard to the statutory minimums,was to months after pairing woolsey total offense level of with his criminal history category of iii.ultimately,the court imposed concurrent sentences totaling months on the drug and g counts plus the consecutive month term on the c count.all told,woolsey would serve months in prison.
a.the leon question 
on appeal woolsey renews his argument that he was entitled to suppression because,according to woolsey,leon exception can not save the search warrant.the government takes up the leon question as well but does not probe whether probable cause supported the warrant the preceding question.
a faulty warrant and an illegal search do not necessarily entitle a defendant to suppression of evidence.united states mykytiuk,cir.the supreme court announced in leon,at,that suppression is inappropriate if the police officers who executed a search warrant did so in good faith.leon rationale is plain the exclusionary rule is designed to deter future unlawful police misconduct.inherent in leon exception to the exclusionary rule is the view that permitting people to get away with crime is too high a price to pay for errors that stem from negligence rather than disdain for constitutional requirements.united states cazares olivas,cir.
an officer decision to obtain a warrant is prima facie evidence of good faith.united states otero,cir mykytiuk,at.a defendant may rebut this presumption by showing that the judge who issued the warrant abandoned his neutral,detached role and acted as a rubber stamp for the police,or that the affiant intentionally or recklessly misled the judge,or that the supporting affidavit is so lacking in indicia of probable cause that an officer belief in its existence would have been entirely unreasonable,or that the warrant itself is so facially deficient that the executing officers could not reasonably have believed it to be valid.see leon,at.otero,at.we review de novo the legal conclusion that a law enforcement officer reasonably relied on a subsequently invalidated search warrant.see united states koerth,cir.
woolsey contends that babcock could not have obtained the warrant in good faith because his affidavit conveys false information and omits significant facts that undermine probable cause all in an effort to deceive the issuing judge.see leon,at.franks,at.woolsey identifies two allegedly false statements in the affidavit that tuell provided chastain information about woolsey supplier and that he also reported the presence of marijuana in woolsey home.woolsey brief catalogues a number of purported omissions as well that chastain and babcock threatened tuell with arrest before he provided any information,that tuell was a known drug dealer,and that tuell earlier cooperation with law enforcement was an isolated incident over a decade ago.
woolsey list is not enough to win his appeal,however.in order to prevail,a defendant must establish,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the affidavit contained false or misleading information,t
