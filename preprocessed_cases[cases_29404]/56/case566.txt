carl appeals from an order terminating his parental rights to his daughter,welf.he contends the dependency court presiding over his child dependency erred by not appointing a guardian ad litem on his behalf because he was a person for whom a conservator had been appointed code civ,subd.a hereafter section.in separate proceedings,a superior court previously found carl was gravely disabled welf,subd.h and consequently ordered and repeatedly renewed a conservatorship for him under the act lps act welf,et.according to carl,the dependency court failure to comply with section violated his due process rights and therefore is reviewable here and prejudicial under a standard.
we disagree and will affirm.we hold the dependency court noncompliance with section standing alone does not violate the parent due process rights and the error is subject to a harmless error standard cal,art.vi.
factual and procedural summary 
previous dependency proceedings 
in january,the madera county superior court adjudged and her older brother dependent children and removed them from parental custody.sexual abuse of,the mother apparent drug abuse,and her neglect of the children mental health needs were the bases for the dependency court exercise of jurisdiction.
at the time,carl,the children presumed father,was unable to care for them.he was institutionalized under an lps conservatorship based on his long history of mental illness,coupled with noncompliance with treatment.he had a history of paranoia and delusions and was violent toward family members and those trying to assist him.his mental illness and substance abuse rendered him incapable of providing for his basic needs.carl appeared in the dependency court proceedings through a guardian ad litem.
according to a january social worker report,providing reunification services to carl would be an exercise in futility.services would offer false hope to the children and prolong the needed time to deal with the loss of their father to mental illness.
the dependency court denied carl reunification services pursuant to welfare and institutions code section,subdivision e because he was institutionalized and services would be detrimental to the children.the dependency court dispositional order contained no order for visitation between carl and the children.eventually,reunified with her mother,and in july the dependency court dismissed dependency 
current dependency proceedings 
the mother drug relapse led to redetention and new dependency court proceedings in march.madera county department of social services department attempted to serve carl notice of the new proceedings at the facility where he had been institutionalized during the prior dependency.the department learned,however,that carl no longer was at the facility.hence,carl did not appear at detention hearing.even so,the dependency court appointed counsel to represent him.
the department soon located and noticed carl,who made his first appearance at jurisdictional hearing in april.noting the dependency petition allegations were solely against the mother,carl attorney submitted the issue of jurisdiction on a social worker report.he then advised the dependency court that carl wanted visits but was not receiving them.the dependency court announced it would not do so at that time.
there other issues that are relevant to his visitation,not his status as father,but i not going to order them before disposition.i let the department investigate that and i have to address the fact that carl is back in the general location or general area.if they not going to offer him services and not going to offer him visitation they need to explain why,but i not going to order it pending disposition.
the dependency court in turn exercised its jurisdiction over pursuant to welfare and institutions code section,subdivisions b and j.
the department disposition report recommended the dependency court remove from parental custody and order reunification services for only the mother.welf.the report included the family social history,as gleaned from interviews with the mother.according to the report,carl had been unavailable to interview.
the mother met carl in approximately and knew him for years.they married shortly after they met and,from the start of the marriage,there was a lot of abuse.they lived together for approximately two and a half years.meanwhile,carl was in and out of prison.according to the mother,carl was like twelve different people.she was constantly in fear for her and the children safety.
a records check with the department of justice confirmed carl had a criminal history.it included multiple felony convictions starting in,including two convictions and prison commitments,one for robbery,and the other for burglary,a second burglary conviction and prison commitment in,and another robbery conviction in.
as the department reported,carl either had been incarcerated or institutionalized for the majority of life,so the bond between them was limited at best.on the issue of institutionalization,the disposition report described a superior court order appointing the madera county public for carl person and estate.the conservatorship petition had alleged carl was gravely disabled,as defined in welfare and institutions code section,subdivision h under the lps act,and incapable of accepting voluntary treatment according to a mandated investigative report for the original conservatorship,h is wife and children have left him and he does not even know where they are.the court repeatedly had renewed the lps conservatorship for carl due to his psychotic behavior and noncompliance with mental health treatment.
the disposition report added carl currently remains on an lps conservatorship in a secured mental health facility.in addition to being institutionalized,carl could not possess a driver license,enter into a contract,vote,refuse treatment related to his grave disability,including psychotropic medications,possess firearms,or refuse routine medical treatment unrelated to his grave disability.
the department recommended the dependency court deny carl reunification services on two grounds.first,pursuant to welfare and institutions code section,subdivision e,he was institutionalized and second,under welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b,he had a violent felony conviction as defined by penal code section,subdivision c.
carl was not present on the date originally set for the dispositional hearing.he could not obtain transportation to court.the dependency court continued the case.then,on may,carl was present and through his attorney sought to contest the department recommendation.the dependency court in turn set trial confirmation and contested dispositional hearings.
carl attended the trial confirmation hearing during which county counsel stated her belief that carl only issue was visitation.although the dependency court asked carl attorney about this claim,there is no record of any reply to the dependency court query.the record does reveal that carl received a copy of the dispositional report.
carl was absent for the contested dispositional hearing conducted in late may.during that hearing,his attorney did not submit on the department report.instead,counsel for carl argued 
c.position is that as a parent he should be given services and allowed visits with a.
in response to counsel argument,the dependency court said,i think that the report does set out the reasons why services are not being provided to italics added.as for carl request for unforced visits,the dependency court denied it based on carl history.
the dependency court then adopted the department recommended findings and orders.the signed findings and orders included an order denying carl reunification services under welfare and institutions code section.it did not include either a finding or order regarding visitation between carl and 
carl attended multiple status review hearings while case was in reunification.at a status review,carl attorney questioned why carl had not had visitation with county counsel told the dependency court there was a july visitation order.carl corrected county counsel,saying 
that my son,but with my daughter.i was actually in the car once when all three of them both children.this is the first time i seen my daughter in years.
the social worker responded,we coordinate visits.we get those.
other than the visitation issue,counsel for carl submitted to the dependency court continued jurisdiction and placement.
in advance of the status review,the department prepared a report recommending the dependency court terminate reunification services for the mother,who had not made any progress,and set a welfare and institutions code section hearing to select and implement a permanent plan for.the department status review report did not contain any information on visitation between carl and 
during a hearing on the department latest report,which carl attended,attorney informed the dependency court that the child,by then years old,did not want visits with carl.neither carl nor his counsel responded to this representation.according to his attorney,carl took no position on the department report.counsel added,i do think he be objecting if the department gave six more months of services.
the dependency court thereafter ordered additional services for the mother based on the child strong relationship with her,despite the mother noncompliance with services.the dependency court specifically gave the mother additional time to enter a residential drug treatment program.but the mother did not comply.
carl next attended a july hearing at which the dependency court set the department recommendation to terminate the mother services for a contested hearing.carl attorney submitted on the matter.
in august,the dependency court terminated reunification services for the mother and set a welfare and institutions code section hearing for because carl did not attend that hearing,the dependency court clerk served carl notice of his writ remedy at a madera address.the department also served notice of the section hearing on carl at the same madera address.
although the dependency court did not conduct the welfare and institutions code section hearing until late january,carl was present on the originally scheduled section hearing date and each continued hearing date thereafter.
prior to the originally scheduled hearing date,an adoption social worker with the california department of social services prepared a report for the dependency court recommending it find adoptable and terminate parental rights.attorneys for both parents requested a contested hearing.in turn,the dependency court continued the hearing.it also clarified with carl that he knew who his attorney was and urged him to talk to her.
at the eventual welfare and institutions code section hearing,carl attorney called the state adoption worker and her on her adoption recommendation.in her report,the state adoption worker opined that was adoptable,despite a history of behavioral problems and her age.behavioral problems appeared to be in the past.also,foster parents,with whom she recently had been placed,received nonrelative extended family member status and were committed to adopting her.in addition,wished to live with her current foster parents under a plan of adoption.
after the case was submitted,the dependency court terminated parental rights.
discussion 
section,subdivision a provides in relevant part 
when a minor,an incompetent person,or a person for whom a conservator has been appointed is a party,that person shall appear either by a guardian or conservator of the estate or by a guardian ad litem appointed by the court in which the action or proceeding is pending,or by a judge thereof,in each case.a guardian ad litem may be appointed in any case when it is deemed by the court in which the action or proceeding is prosecuted,or by a judge thereof,expedient to appoint a guardian ad litem to represent the minor,incompetent person,or person for whom a conservator has been appointed,notwithstanding that the person may have a guardian or conservator of the estate and may have appeared by the guardian or conservator of the estate.italics added.
in the current dependency proceedings,the parties and the dependency court were on notice that carl was the subject of an lps conservatorship and was represented by the county public guardian by the time of the dispositional hearing,if not sooner.even so,carl neither appeared by his guardian nor did the dependency court appoint a guardian ad litem gal to represent him.
on this basis,carl contends the dependency court violated his due process rights.carl further argues that due to this alleged due process violation he may raise the issue for the first time in this appeal,and the error was not harmless under a heightened prejudice standard.alternatively,he claims his trial counsel was ineffective for not asserting his rights earlier.
the department argues we should dismiss this appeal as frivolous and moot because in prior dependency the dependency court did appoint a gal for carl.in addition,according to the department,there is no record that the dependency court either relieved the gal or terminated the appointment on other grounds.the department also argues carl waived his appellate arguments by failing to raise the gal issue in the dependency court or with this court by way of an earlier appeal or writ application.alternatively,the department contends any error was harmless.
as discussed post,we disagree with each of carl arguments.a dependency court failure to comply with section is a statutory error or mere irregularity in re lisa d,fn.lisa,citing pacific coast.bank clausen cal d,pacific coast.by itself,it does not violate a person due process rights.
department motion to dismiss 
whether an appeal is moot and therefore subject to dismissal depends on some event that occurs subsequent to the order,not before.when,during the pendency of an appeal,an event occurs that renders it impossible for an appellate court to grant any effectual relief,the dependency court will not proceed to a formal judgment but will dismiss the appeal.eye dog foundation state board of guide dogs for the blind cal d.thus,the dependency court appointing a gal for carl in the previous dependency proceedings does not render this appeal arising out of the current dependency proceedings moot.
to the extent the department accuses carl of not affirmatively establishing that the dependency court ever relieved the gal appointed in the previous dependency proceedings or terminated the appointment on other grounds,we also are not persuaded.the dependency court order dismissing dependency effectively terminated the gal appointment,which existed only for the purpose of those pending proceedings,subd.a.
ii.appealability 
when a dependency court has knowledge of a party minor status or incompetence under section,the dependency court has an obligation to appoint a gal sua sponte.in re th,d lisa,supra,d at.by analogy,when a dependency court is informed that a conservator has been appointed for a party,the dependency court also has a sua sponte obligation either to appoint a gal for that party or to order that the party shall appear through his or her conservator.because the dependency court had a sua sponte duty under the statute,rather than discretionary authority,we conclude carl did not waive his right to appeal by failing to raise the gal issue in the dependency court.in re lorenzo th,d if the law does not require the juvenile court to act in a certain way,the parent bears the responsibility to care for his or her own interests by asking the court to exercise its discretion in a manner favorable to the parent.
whether carl waived his claim of error by failing to raise it in a timely appeal is another matter.according to the waiver rule,an appellate court in a dependency proceeding may not inquire into the merits of a prior final appealable order on an appeal from a later appealable order.in re meranda th,d meranda.in meranda,this court declined to carve out an exception to the waiver rule,even though the issues raised involve d the important constitutional and statutory rights to counsel and to the effective assistance of counsel.ibid.in declining to do so,we weighed the private and governmental interests,ri
