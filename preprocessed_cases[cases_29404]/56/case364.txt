the father in this juvenile dependency proceeding,seeks reversal of the juvenile court jurisdictional orders adjudging his five children dependents of the juvenile court.father contends that substantial evidence does not support the court findings that he sexually abused his year old daughter,and further contends that three brothers year old twins and year old and year old sister were not at substantial risk of being sexually or otherwise abused by their father.we disagree and affirm the orders.
early in august,mother took her and her four siblings to a police station because she thought had been sexually abused by her father.a few days later,the los angeles county department of children and family services filed a petition alleging all of the father five children were dependents under welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b failure to protect,subdivision d sexual abuse,and,as to four siblings,subdivision j abuse of sibling 
the juvenile court ultimately sustained allegations that,on august,and on previous occasions for the past three years,father sexually abused by fondling the child vagina and digitally penetrating the child vagina and forcefully raped the child by placing the father penis in the child vagina.on a prior occasion,the father forced the child to expose the child vagina to the father and the father orally copulated the child vagina.on a prior occasion,the father forced the child to watch pornographic videos with the father.is afraid of the father due to the father sexual abuse of.the sexual abuse of by the father endangers physical health and safety and places the child and the child siblings at risk of physical harm,damage,danger,sexual abuse and failure to protect.these allegations were sustained under subdivisions b,d and j of section 
the department detention report described separate interviews with the mother and the five children.
the mother reported that in,told her that father was touching her inappropriately,and mother immediately called the police.but three days later,recanted and the case was dismissed.then,a few weeks before the events that precipitated this proceeding,mother noticed that father behavior started to change drastically.father began to drink alcohol abusively,and started to become angrier at times.father always wanted mother to take her son with her on errands and to leave at home.on august,father asked mother to go to the market to get ice cream.mother felt something was wrong,so she turned on the web camera on the family computer,hid an player and started its recorder.when she returned from the market,the web camera had been turned off,but the player was still on.
when mother listened to the recording,she heard the father asking the child if she would move in with him,if he left the home,heard the father tell the minor that she can have male friends but can not have sex with them.mother was unable to hear other things on the tape because the recording was not clear.she decided to question,and told her about the web camera and the recording.then told mother that father had been touching inappropriately and having sex with mother took the children to the police the next morning,telling father they were going to the clinic for school shots.mother did not want a confrontation with father in the presence of the children.in the past,father became irate with denial when mother had asked him about abuse.
in a second interview,when asked why she turned on the web camera and recorder,mother said father had been acting strange and since she always had a suspicion,she turned the devices on.she also said that father was very sexually active and they would have sex every day,but for the past couple of weeks the father was not seeking for sex.mother said that a couple of days earlier,she went through father internet browser and she saw that he has visited many incest websites.mother said father had never hit her,but is verbally aggressive,he yells at her all the time,he is easily irritable and he throws things in the home when he upset.
was taken to a medical center for an examination.the results of the genital examination showed only one small abrasion the assessment of the findings was that the examination was consistent with history.
when she was interviewed on august,told the social worker that on a regular basis her father forced her to have sex with him on every tuesday while mother went to pick up her siblings from school.said she arrives home from school before her siblings on tuesdays only.the most recent incident of abuse was the day before,when father asked mother to go to the market with one of her twin brothers,who was always l ooking around seeing what everybody in the home is doing.her father called upstairs into his room,went downstairs to see what her other siblings were doing,and then returned.he then told her to pull down her paints sic,her panties,to bend over and he put his penis in her vagina from behind.denied that her father ever had sex with her in her buttocks or forced her to have oral sex on him,but said the father did perform oral sex on her.one time father asked her to look at a pornographic videos sic on the family computer that portrayed a father having sex with his daughter.
told the social worker that she never disclosed the abuse to her mother until the incident with the web camera and recorder,when her mother questioned her about why the camera was off and told that she had heard the father saying sexual things to on the player.said that her father saw that the camera was turned on,and asked her to turn it off because father did not know mother password but did.said neither she nor father knew mother also had an player recording.admitted to the mother that the father had been abusing her sexually for approximately three years.told the social worker that her father has told her if she has sex with him he would allow her to have male friends,she can wear the type of clothes she wants to wear and he would allow her to participate in her quinceanera.she said her father normally used condoms but the last two times he did not.
when asked about the previous sexual abuse case in,stated that the father was abusing her at that time but she was afraid that her father will go to jail and she did not want him to go to jail,so she lied about the abuse.told the social worker that she feels she has done the right thing because she did not want this to happen to her sister as her sister will be years old soon and that was the age the abuse started with her.
the other children uniformly reported to the social worker that they felt safe in the home,liked living with their parents,and were never touched inappropriately or in a sexual manner by their father or anyone else.none of the children saw their parents using any drugs or alcohol and none observed any domestic violence.all of them said that neither nor any other sibling had ever told them that father or anyone else had touched them inappropriately.the three boys all said that they had never told their mother that and the father had been in the parents room alone.sister said that on august,she heard her father and arguing in the parents room,and when she went into the parents room,she saw her sister behind the room door and the father at the computer doing homework.she said did not look angry and her clothes were on.except for that occasion,she never observed and the father in the room alone.
father was interviewed and denied that he or any one else ever touched any of his children inappropriately.later attempts to contact father were unsuccessful,and father did not respond to a letter asking him to contact the department.
three weeks after the children were detained,they were interviewed again about the allegations in the petition.the department report shows that then recanted her previous statements,saying the abuse allegations were not true.she said,i wanted him father out of the house and i wanted to get him off my back.explained that she began spending time with the emo crew and was told that she needed to start cutting herself and getting into fights to fit in,and her father found out and she then got into trouble.said she lied to the social worker about being sexually abused because she was angry with her father because he is strict.she said,i did it when i was years old and got away with it.so,i just did it again.
the interviewing social worker did not see any fresh cuts on,and observed that she could not maintain a complete thought pattern,appeared confused and appeared to avoid the subject matter.when asked about the web camera and the player,said that none of those things occurred,and that m y mother would never say those things.denied that mother recorded the conversation,denied that she told mother she was sexually abused by her father,and denied any conversation with her father about being able to wear the clothing of her choice and have male friends so long as she would agree not to have sex with them.denied ever being alone with father,and then nonchalantly stated that her boyfriend was pressuring her to have sex with him and on a tuesday she told her boyfriend that she was ready to have sex.she said that she and her boyfriend had sex in one of the stalls in the boys bathroom,but she could not describe the boys bathroom.when asked for contact information for her boyfriend and his parents,she became quiet and said something was wrong with her boyfriend telephone.
the later interviews with four siblings were consistent with the earlier interviews.the children all denied being touched inappropriately,and said they were not afraid of their parents.one of the year old twin brothers said he had never witnessed any verbal or physical altercations between his parents.the twins said they had not seen and their father spend time alone in a room.one of them could not recall a time when and father were alone at home,and had never witnessed any strange behaviors between father and.the other twin said he had not witnessed father mistreat sister said she knew that and her father were arguing she did not understand why but she heard them screaming.she said they were upstairs when they were arguing,and she said she had never witnessed father and spend time alone in a room,and that and father did not spend time alone at home.the youngest boy had never witnessed father and alone in a room and had not seen father mistreat or witnessed any argument between them.
in another interview,when again asked why she had placed the recorder and web camera in the room,mother said that lately father would become very upset with for anything that she would do wrong that father would not allow mother to take with her when she went out that had been cutting herself and when mother asked about it,said she was doing so to fit in with friends at school.
in addition to the incident,in father niece accused him of sexually abusing her when she was years old and was living with the family.according to the department report,although the niece recanted her story and the criminal charges were dropped,the allegations were substantiated.when mother was asked about these allegations,mother became defensive and said that the niece was lying the niece ran away from home and when mother reported the niece as a runaway,the niece made the allegations against father.
at the jurisdiction and disposition hearing,the department offered into evidence the department detention and reports with attached documents,and these were admitted without objection.no party offered any testimony at the hearing.father counsel stated that father continues to adamantly deny that this occurred,and that father belief is the department failed to meet its burden of proof,and he requesting the court to dismiss those three counts.
the court stated 
the court finds,by a preponderance of the ance of the evidence,that in this case with regards to b,d and j the counts quoted,at,ante,the court finds there is substantial evidence to sustain those counts in this case.with regards to the allegations,the child gave an extremely detailed statement with regards to the time and manner the abuse took place,even how the father had sex with her in this case,telling her she could have certain privileges if she kept having sex with him,that she could have a boyfriend and a quinceanera party.the timing was very significant in this case when the child was confronted by the mother,that there was a recording in the room,indicating he sic admitted to the abuse.her statements were consistent with the law enforcement report,as well as the forensic report in this case.
the court declared the children dependents of the court and found,by clear and convincing evidence,that there is a substantial danger to the children,if returned to the home,to the physical health,safety,protection,physical,emotional of the children,and there are no reasonable means by which the children physical health can be protected without removing the children from the father custody in this case.the court removed all the children from father custody,and ordered them placed with mother under the supervision of the department.the court ordered monitored visits for father and that mother was not to monitor the visits,and father case plan called for sex abuse counseling for perpetrators and family counseling.
father filed a timely appeal.
discussion 
father asks us to reverse the juvenile court jurisdictional and dispositional orders,contending the evidence was insufficient to support the court finding that he sexually abused,and there was no evidence her siblings were at risk of being sexually abused.we reject both contentions.
in reviewing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jurisdictional findings and disposition,we determine if substantial evidence,contradicted or uncontradicted,supports them.in making this determination,we draw all reasonable inferences from the evidence to support the findings and orders of the dependency court we review the record in the light most favorable to the court determinations and we note that issues of fact and credibility are the province of the trial court.in re heather th,d.we do not reweigh the evidence or exercise independent judgment,but merely determine if there are sufficient facts to support the findings of the trial court.citations.t he appellate court must review the whole record in the light most favorable to the judgment below to determine whether it discloses substantial evidence such that a reasonable trier of fact could find that the order is appropriate.citation.in re matthew d.
as to the sexual abuse of,father appears to think that substantial evidence does not exist because had recanted by the time of the jurisdictional hearing,telling the social worker that none of the allegations were true.there is,of course,no authority for that proposition.there was ample evidence from which the juvenile court could conclude as the department did that initial reports were true and her recantation was not.we will not again recount the evidence,which appears above in sufficient detail to make it obvious that,under the principles of appellate review,there is no basis for overturning the juvenile court finding that father sexually abused 
father next argues that siblings did not suffer any abuse and were not at risk of suffering any abuse,as the evidence showed all the siblings were happy at home and were treated well by the father.he points out that the juvenile court did not make any factual findings regarding how or why the siblings were at risk of sex abuse by their father,and describes the risk of sexual abuse of sister or her brothers as speculation,relying on in re rubisela th,d rubisela,in re maria th,d maria,and in re alexis th,d alexis.
we first reject the notion that,merely because younger siblings of a sexually abused girl are treated well by the abusing parent,they are therefore not at substantial risk that they will be sexually abused,subd.d or will suffer serious physical harm or illness as a result of the parent failure to protect them,subd.b.too may well have been happy and by her father until she reached the age of,when her father began the sexual abuse.the oldest of her younger siblings were of comparable age or younger and years old at the time of the court findings.so their current good treatment has no bearing on their risk of future harm if they remain in their father custody.
next,as to younger sister,nine years old at the time of the court orders,there can be no legitimate dispute that the evidence places her at substantial risk of sexual abuse as she approaches her sister age.while all accusations were eventually recanted,this is the third time that father has been accused of sexually abusing a child in,when she was father niece in,when she was and again and apparently continuously at the age of.the department report,finding a pattern of sexual abuse,also notes that father began dating mother when he was and she was,and mother gave birth to when she was years old.the evidence is more than substantial that sister is at substantial risk of sexual abuse.see rubisela,supra,th at,d the circumstances surrounding the abuse of rubisela support a finding under section,subdivision j as to her sister it was reasonable for the juvenile court to determine that in rubisela absence,father sexual offenses were likely to focus on his only other daughter.
finally,we come to father claim there was no evidence that brothers were at risk of serious physical harm or illness as a result of father failure to protect them,subd.b,and no evidence they were at risk of being sexually abused,subd.d.he relies on a number of cases concluding that evidence of sexual abuse of a daughter does not support a finding that sons are at risk of sexual abuse.see,rubisela,supra,th at,d s exual abuse of one sibling can support a trial court determination that there is a substantial risk to the remaining siblings,but there was no evidence of suspicious conduct by father with respect to minor son and,while a showing of harm from knowledge of sibling molestation or from other circumstances is possible,in rubisela there was no demonstration by the department of a substantial risk to the sons alexis,supra,th at,d evidence that the father inappropriately touched the adolescent half sister of his two sons fondling her breasts and buttocks and kissing her on the mouth did not support that the boys were at risk of sexual abuse there was no evidence that the boys were in any way aware of father actions and any risk of emotional injury from being in a home where sexual abuse was occurring had been eliminated,as father had moved out of the family home and was in compliance with an order prohibiting further contact with the abused half sister there was no evidence of any proclivity on father part to abuse or molest sexually immature children or males of any age,or to expose them to inappropriate sexual behavior.
father also relies on maria,supra,th,d.there,the court observed that brothers of molested girls may be harmed by the fact of molestation occurring in the family,but in the absence of evidence demonstrating that the perpetrator of the abuse may have an interest in sexually abusing male children,there is no risk of sexual abuse within the meaning of subdivision d of section of the welfare and institutions code.maria,supra,at,d.this is because,maria explained,subdivision d limits sexual abuse to the definitions in penal code section sexual assault and sexual exploitation,and does not include the collateral damage on a child that might result from the family or child reaction to a sexual assault on the child sibling.maria,at,d.
the maria court also held,however,that the subdivision j ground of jurisdiction based on abuse of a sibling does not limit the grounds of dependency adjudication for a child whose sibling has been abused to the same subdivision of section that applies to that sibling.rather,the plain language of section,subdivision j,directs the trial court to consider whether there is a substantial risk that the subject child will be abused or neglected,as defined in section,subdivision a,b,d,e,or i.maria,supra,th at,d see id.at,d t hus,the basis for taking jurisdiction of the son under subdivision j is not limited to a risk of sexual abuse,as that term is defined by subdivision d and the penal code.the court found that findings of sexual abuse of a boy sisters constitute prima facie evidence that the son is a child described by section,subdivision a,b,c or d and that he is at substantial risk of abuse or neglect maria,supra,th at,d,but that the agency had only pursued the allegation that the son was at risk of being sexually abused the court remanded the matter with directions to detain the son in protective custody and order the agency to assess any harm that the son may have suffered,or any risk to him that may exist,under section.maria,at,d.
we respectfully disagree with the constraints placed by these cases on a juvenile court ability to take jurisdiction over male siblings whose father has forcefully raped their sister.we agree instead with in re th,d and in re andy th,d andy.
in,the court found two male siblings were at risk of harm by reason of the father sexual abuse of their sister touching her vagina under her clothes on top of her underwear,even though both brothers indicated they had not observed any inappropriate touching of their sister by the father,and there was no evidence father had ever engaged in homosexual conduct,supra,th at,d.the court of appeal rejected the father effort to set aside the finding that his sons eight and five years old,respectively were at risk of sexual abuse,observing that the juvenile court had found brothers were at risk of harm because they were approaching the age nine at which father had begun to abuse and father had access to the boys because he routinely awoke during the night to cover them,d.the court relied on in re karen th,d karen,where the court concluded a father who has committed two incidents of forcible incestuous rape of his minor daughter reasonably can be said to be so sexually aberrant that both male and female siblings of the victim are at substantial risk of sexual abuse within the meaning of section,subdivision d,if left in the home.the court,observing that the abuse in was concededly less shocking than the abuse in karen,was convinced that where,as here,a child has been sexually abused,any younger sibling who is approaching the age at which the child was abused,may be found to be at risk of sexual abuse.as we intimated in karen,aberrant sexual behavior by a parent places the victim siblings who remain in the home at risk of aberrant sexual behavior,supra,at,d.
further found its conclusion consistent with section,subdivision d,which provides that when a parent has been found in a prior dependency hearing to have committed an act of sexual abuse,that finding is prima facie evidence that the subject minor is at substantial risk of abuse or neglect,subd.d,supra,th at,d.the court observed that,although there was no prior dependency proceeding,the provision nonetheless evinces a legislative determination that siblings of sexually abused children are at substantial risk of harm and are entitled to protection by the juvenile courts,supra,at,d.
andy is to like effect.agreeing with,the court found the juvenile court could properly conclude that a father aberrant sexual behavior with the and year old half sisters of his year old son placed the son at risk of sexual abuse.andy,supra th at,d.in andy,the father sexual abuse of the girls who were not his children consisted of touching the breast of one of the girls on top of her shirt,trying to touch the vagina of the other girl while she was in bed,exposing his penis,exposing one of the girls to a pornographic video and masturbating in her presence.id.at.andy observed that the only difference from was that andy was only two and years old,and so was not approaching the age at which his half sisters were abused.andy,at,d.but other factors convinced the court the evidence was sufficient to support the findings that andy was at substantial risk of sexual abuse while andy may have been too young to be cognizant of behavior,exposed himself to janet while andy was in the same room albeit apparently facing in the other direction.indeed,the court could infer,as the department suggests,that the father used andy to get janet to approach him so he could expose himself to her,by
