the untold hours this court has expended in response to voluminous as well as meritless appeals and writs,not to mention the costs of record preparation and appellant counsel,has led us to conclude is a vexatious litigant within the meaning of section,subdivision b and should be subject to a prefiling order.
procedural and factual history 
dependency court proceedings 
the juvenile court exercised its dependency jurisdiction over son in after finding true an allegation that the child mother failed to provide him with adequate food,clothing or shelter on account of her drug abuse.at the time,was incarcerated.
shortly after was released from custody,fresno county department of children and family services department alleged and the juvenile court found true that the child was at serious risk of physical harm because was unable to supervise,protect or provide adequate care or a safe home environment due to his extensive criminal history.the juvenile court also found the child was at risk of suffering serious emotional damage as a result of exposure to incidents of domestic violence between his parents.
at a disposition hearing in early,the juvenile court removed the child from parental custody and placed him in foster care.despite months of reunification services,was unable to reunify with the child.the juvenile court consequently terminated services in early and eventually adopted a permanent plan of foster care for the child.meanwhile,in may,the juvenile court terminated visits between and the child based on undisputed evidence that the child experienced problems after the visits and refused to follow visitation rules and court orders.the juvenile court has never reinstated visitation between and the child.
since it first selected foster care as the child permanent plan,the juvenile court has conducted status reviews of the child dependency.welf,subd.d status review hearing.at these status review hearings,the juvenile court has found,based on uncontroverted evidence,that there was a continuing necessity for the child placement and neither parent has made progress toward alleviating and mitigating the causes of the child removal.welf,subd.e.
appeal and writ proceedings 
in persona propria filed the pending appeal from a february order granting a continuance of a status review hearing.in the seven years preceding the filing of this appeal,in propria persona has filed final and unsuccessful appeals and writ petitions,as summarized below.
in propria persona appealed the juvenile court may order terminating visitation between appellant and the child.this court affirmed,finding no abuse of discretion.slip op,in re r.filed.
in propria persona filed an appeal from a july order granting a continuance of the child permanency planning hearing welf.appellate counsel could not find an arguable issue to brief and thus did not file an opening brief.in re sade cal th,d.although we granted time to personally file a letter brief to raise a claim of error,he did not respond to our order this court in turn dismissed the appeal.dismissal order,in re r.
in propria persona appealed from a may status review hearing.claimed his due process rights were violated and his trial counsel had been ineffective at the hearing.this court affirmed,finding appellant was afforded his due process right to be heard at the may hearing and any statutory violation was harmless because could not show prejudice.likewise,we concluded ineffective assistance of counsel claim was meritless.slip op,in re r.filed.
within a matter of days in early,in propria persona filed two notices of appeal and a petition for writ of mandate arising out of the child dependency.on the face of all three,sought to relitigate orders dating back years in the child dependency as well as to challenge a january order denying his motion to disqualify a new attorney whom the court recently substituted in to represent.this court summarily denied the petition for writ of mandate.denial order,r.superior court.
with regard to the two notices of appeal in propria persona filed in early,this court consolidated them and limited the scope of appeal to orders issued within days of the two notices of appeal.former cal.rules of court,rule d now rule d.thereafter,challenged the january denial of his motion to discharge his new attorney for an alleged conflict of interest.this court affirmed.slip op,in re r.filed.
meanwhile in august and during the pendency of his appeal in,in propria persona filed three additional notices of appeal and two notices of intent to file a writ.once again,on the face of these notices of appeal and notices of intent,sought to relitigate orders dating back years in the child dependency.this court deemed the various documents to constitute an appeal from juvenile court orders entered after hearings conducted on four dates in august.over the course of those hearing dates,the juvenile court granted a request by the mother attorney to be relieved on conflict of interest grounds twice granted requests for continuance of the court status review hearing of the child dependency denied effort to launch a section challenge and denied latest marsden motion to discharge his counsel 
on appeal,claimed the juvenile court erred in not relieving his trial counsel.he so argued by incorporating the arguments he made in his prior appeal.we affirmed having determined our unpublished opinion in,which by then was final,adequately addressed arguments.slip op,in re r.filed.
and.regarding the two notices of intent in propria persona filed in august,we concluded there was no basis for any writ proceeding under then rule of court,rule b and dismissed each.dismissal orders,r.superior court.
in propria persona appealed from the continued status review hearing which the juvenile court conducted in october.notably,did not attend the hearing and appellate counsel once more filed a sade letter.when did not respond to our order extending him leave to personally file a letter brief,this court dismissed that appeal.dismissal order,in re r.
in propria persona appealed from the child next status review hearing conducted in february.appellate counsel filed a sade letter.once again,did not respond to our order granting him leave.this in turn led to the dismissal of that appeal as well.dismissal order,in re r.
in propria persona appealed from the next status review hearing conducted in august.appellate counsel filed yet another sade letter.this time,did file a letter brief.however,he did not raise any claim of arguable error by the trial court.thus,we dismissed his appeal by opinion.slip op,in re r.filed.
in propria persona appealed from the next status review hearing held in february.he argued the juvenile court should have ordered supervised visits between him and the child as well as that the department did not provide him with a copy of its report in a timely fashion.we affirmed.notably,the appellate record did not contain any petition to modify welf,the court order,let alone any evidence of changed circumstances and that the child best interests would be advanced by modifying that order.slip op,in re r.filed.
in propria persona appealed from the next status review hearing held in august.again,appellate counsel filed a sade letter.after time expired for to personally file a letter brief,he requested a continuance without any good cause showing.this court denied a continuance for lack of good cause shown and dismissed the appeal by order.dismissal order,in re r.
in the pending appeal,appellate counsel once again could not find an arguable issue to brief and filed a sade letter.has never responded to our order granting him leave to file his own brief.
in addition,during the pendency of this appeal,this court has affirmed the juvenile court in yet another of in propria persona appeals.slip op,in re r.filed.this was an appeal from the juvenile court order following its november status review hearing.
against this litigious backdrop,we gave and his appellate attorney in the pending appeal notice of as well as the opportunity to brief,produce evidence,and be heard in oral argument on the question of vexatious litigant status.bravo ismaj th,d bravo in re luckett d.luckett.before summarizing the evidence presented by way of declaration,we observe that in the interim,in propria persona has initiated three additional appeals from juvenile court orders in the child dependency.
in his declaration under penalty of perjury,stated throughout the dependency court proceedings his trial counsel had not communicated with him concerning the nature and effect of the juvenile court proceedings and had not explained the appellate process,whether he should appeal or what was a viable issue on appeal.adding that he did not have the funds to hire an attorney,asserted the only way he could obtain legal advice about whether he had a potentially meritorious appeal was to file a notice of appeal and secure appellate counsel.also claimed he acted reasonably in pursuing his belief that his trial counsel had a conflict of interest by filing the appeals in and.further declared a lack of notice and monitored visits with his son have prompted him to seek appellate relief.
in particular,he believes the lack of monitored visitation constitutes legal error and that his attorney has not pursued visitation for him in the juvenile court.under these circumstances,he claims to have a belief that there are ongoing errors occur r ing in the trial court which probably will justify me seeking appellate relief in the future.
while claims a primary concern that his attorney has a conflict of interest,not only the juvenile court but this court has rejected that claim more than once.to the extent he professes concern over a lack of notice and the lack of visitation,the record over all these years simply does not support such concerns.
discussion 
vexatious litigant law 
california vexatious litigant law dates back to the early when the appellate court in stafford russell d.suggested the study of vexatious litigation and the unreasonable burdens it places upon the courts.in response,the legislature enacted sections through stats,ch,to address problems created by the persistent and obsessive litigant,appearing in propria persona,who has constantly pending a number of groundless actions.committee on administration of justice,report,cal.state bar,rawles,the california vexatious litigant statute a viable judicial tool to deny the clever obstructionists access.
as originally enacted,section defined terms used in the substantive provisions of the law.in particular,its definition of vexatious litigant included a person 
who,in the immediately preceding period has commenced,prosecuted or maintained in propria persona at least five litigations other than in a small claims court that have been i finally determined adversely to him or ii unjustifiably permitted to remain pending at least two years without having been brought to trial or hearing,subd.b.
the balance of the original vexatious litigant law,sections through,established procedures by which a defendant in a pending case could move to designate a plaintiff as a vexatious litigant and to require a vexatious litigant to furnish security under certain specified circumstances.failure to produce the ordered security would result in dismissal of the litigation in the defendant favor.
since its enactment of the vexatious litigant law,the legislature has expanded its reach.camerado ins.agency,superior court th,d.most notably,in,the legislature both broadened the definitions of terms used in the law as well as created an additional tool,known as a prefiling order,by which courts may counter vexatious litigants misuse of our justice system bravo,supra,at,d.stats,ch.
currently,section defines terms,used in the vexatious litigant law and relevant to our discussion,as follows 
a litigation means any civil action or proceeding,commenced,maintained or pending in any state or federal court.
b vexatious litigant means a person who does any of the following 
in the immediately preceding period has commenced,prosecuted,or maintained in propria persona at least five litigations other than in a small claims court that have been i finally determined adversely to the person or ii unjustifiably permitted to remain pending at least two years without having been brought to trial or hearing.
after a litigation has been finally determined against the person,repeatedly relitigates or attempts to relitigate,in propria persona,either i the validity of the determination against the same defendant or defendants as to whom the litigation was finally determined or ii the cause of action,claim,controversy,or any of the issues of fact or law,determined or concluded by the final determination against the same defendant or defendants as to whom the litigation was finally determined.
in any litigation while acting in propria persona,repeatedly files unmeritorious motions,pleadings,or other papers,conducts unnecessary discovery,or engages in other tactics that are frivolous or solely intended to cause unnecessary delay.
has previously been declared to be a vexatious litigant by any state or federal court of record in any action or proceeding based upon the same or substantially similar facts,transaction,or occurrence.
d plaintiff means the person who commences,institutes or maintains a litigation or causes it to be commenced,instituted or maintained,including an attorney at law acting in propria persona.
e defendant means a person including corporation,association,partnership and firm or governmental entity against whom a litigation is brought or maintained or sought to be brought or maintained.
section,which requires in propria persona vexatious litigants to seek prior court approval before filing new actions,currently provides as follows 
a in addition to any other relief provided in this title,the court may,on its own motion or the motion of any party,enter a prefiling order which prohibits a vexatious litigant from filing any new litigation in the courts of this state in propria persona without first obtaining leave of the presiding judge of the court where the litigation is proposed to be filed.disobedience of the order by a vexatious litigant may be punished as a contempt of court.
b the presiding judge shall permit the filing of that litigation only if it appears that the litigation has merit and has not been filed for the purposes of harassment or delay.the presiding judge may condition the filing of the litigation upon the furnishing of security for the benefit of the defendants as provided in section.
c the clerk may not file any litigation presented by a vexatious litigant subject to a prefiling order unless the vexatious litigant first obtains an order from the presiding judge permitting the filing.if the clerk mistakenly files the litigation without the order,any party may file with the clerk and serve on the plaintiff and other parties a notice stating that the plaintiff is a vexatious litigant subject to a prefiling order as set forth in subdivision a.the filing of the notice shall automatically stay the litigation.the litigation shall be automatically dismissed unless the plaintiff within days of the filing of that notice obtains an order from the presiding judge permitting the filing of the litigation as set forth in subdivision b.if the presiding judge issues an order permitting the filing,the stay of the litigation shall remain in effect,and the defendants need not plead,until days after the defendants are served with a copy of the order.
d for purposes of this section,litigation includes any petition,application,or motion other than a discovery motion,in a proceeding under the family code or probate code,for any order.
e the clerk of the court shall provide the judicial council a copy of any prefiling orders issued pursuant to subdivision a.the judicial council shall maintain a record of vexatious litigants subject to those prefiling orders and shall annually disseminate a list of those persons to the clerks of the courts of this state.
section prefiling order provisions are distinguishable in significant ways from the security provisions of section through.unlike the security provisions which require a motion by a defendant,section authorizes a court on its own motion or the motion of any party to enter a prefiling order against a vexatious litigant,subd.a,emphasis added.also,in contrast to the security provisions,the prefiling order operates beyond the pending case and affects a vexatious litigant future filings in propria persona,by requiring permission be obtained first from the presiding judge.subd.a mccolm westwood park association th,d mccolm see also bravo,supra,th at,d.further,the presiding judge will grant such permission provided it appears the litigation has merit and has not been filed for the purposes of harassment or delay,subd.b.by comparison,a court considering a defendant motion for security must determine in part that there is no reasonable probability the plaintiff will prevail in the pending litigation against the moving defendant.thus,while imposing limits on a vexatious litigant future filings,section provides a workable means by which a vexatious litigant may proceed with litigation.forrest department of corporations th,d forrest.
over the years,appellate courts have reviewed challenges to the vexatious litigation law and trial court determinations of vexatious litigant status.see cases cited in mccolm,supra,th at,d.in the process,appellate courts have taken an expansive approach to the vexatious litigant law in much the same way as the legislature.see forrest,supra,th at,d in re natural gas cases th,d bravo,supra,th at,d camerado ins.agency,superior court,supra,th at,d.
appellate courts also have applied the vexatious litigant law to appeals and writ petitions filed in the courts of appeal.mccolm,supra,th at,d.mccolm involved an appellant who had been declared a vexatious litigant in prior litigation and failed to post security imposed as a condition to proceeding with her appeal.id.at,d.she claimed,among other arguments,that the vexatious litigant law applied only to plaintiffs and defendants in trial courts.id.at,d.mccolm disagreed,holding an appellant or writ petitioner meets the definition of plaintiff in section as such a person certainly commences,institutes or attempts to maintain the litigation in the appellate court.mccolm,supra,th at,d.
relevant to our discussion,appellate courts,at least in luckett,supra,d.and in re whitaker th,d whitaker,also have declared appellants vexatious litigants.in so doing,these courts have relied on a litigant filings in the courts of appeal to determine the appellant to be a vexatious litigant under section,subdivision b.thus,to the extent claims we lack precedent to declare him a vexatious litigant for the first time on appeal,we disagree under the authority of luckett and whitaker.
the luckett court reviewed separate appellate actions luckett had filed with it.luckett,supra,d at.the appellate court concluded he repeatedly filed unmeritorious motions and engaged in frivolous tactics in those appellate actions and therefore determined luckett was a vexatious litigant under section,subdivision b.luckett,supra,d at.luckett was also the first instance in which an appellate court exercised the authority under section to issue a prefiling order.whitaker,supra,th at,d luckett,supra,d at.
in determining its appellant was a vexatious litigant under section,subdivision b,the whitaker court cited not only the excessive trial court actions whitaker had filed but also the writ and appeal proceedings he had filed.whitaker,supra,th at,d.the whitaker court further observed such repeated misuse results in a useless diversion of the appellate court attention and prejudices other appellate parties,many of whom wait years for resolution of bona fide disputes.similarly,our appellate system and our state taxpayers are damaged by what amounts to a waste of the appellate court time and resources.id.at,d.
as the mccolm court later explained,although these appellate courts 
have not articulated their reasons for applying the statute to appellate writs and appeals,their willingness to do so stems from the statute broad definitions for the terms litigation,plaintiff and defendant.mccolm,supra,th at,d,emphasis added.
mccolm observed throughout the vexatious litigant law,litigation means any civil action or proceeding,commenced,maintained or pending in any state or federal court,subd.a.manifestly,any civil action or proceeding includes any appeal or writ proceeding.of course,any state or federal court includes the california court of appeal.mccolm,supra,th at,d.accordingly,mccolm determined 
litigation for purposes of vexatious litigant requirements encompasses civil trials and special proceedings,but it is broader than that.it includes proceedings initiated in the courts of appeal by notice of appeal or by writ petitions other than habeas corpus or other criminal matters.id.at,d.
mccolm further held 
the decision whether to allow the litigant to proceed will be made on an individual basis,taking into account such factors as the nature of the action below,the nature of the lower court ruling,whether writ petition or appeal is the appropriate procedure for seeking review in the court of appeal,the litigant claims of error and whether the litigant has demonstrated improper reasons for bringing the original litigation or for taking it to the next court level.mccolm,supra,th at,d.
ii.is a vexatious litigant 
with these authorities in mind and given that the vexatious litigant law has been both broadly written and interpreted,we conclude meets the definition of a vexatious litigant under section,subdivision b.as detailed above,is a person who in propria persona has commenced,during the seven years preceding the filing of this appeal,appeals and writ proceedings,all of which have been finally determined adversely to him,subd.b.we note in this regard the definition of a vexatious litigant,subd.b is a person,not a plaintiff,who does one of four things.in addition,five of matters were sade appeals in which there was not even an arguable issue.in re sade,supra,cal th,d.furthermore,in propria persona shall be subject to a prefiling order for future litigation,pursuant to section,other than an appeal from a criminal conviction or a petition for writ habeas corpus in re bittaker,supra,th at,d.
the decision whether to allow in propria persona to proceed with future litigation will be made on a basis.particularly,as to future appeals or writ petitions,that decision will take into account such factors as the nature of the action below,the nature of the lower court ruling,whether writ petition or appeal is the appropriate procedure for seeking review in the court of appeal,claims of error mccolm,supra,th at,d and whether he has demonstrated improper reasons for bringing the appeal or writ petition.
disagrees with our determination.he raises a myriad of arguments,on statutory,constitutional,and policy grounds,in opposition to our declaring him a vexatious litigant and requiring a prefiling order before he proceeds with litigation.having reviewed each as discussed below,we conclude they are meritless.
iii.appellant status as defendant in the underlying proceeding 
during the pendency of this appeal,the fourth district,division one,issued its opinion in mahdavi superior court th,d mahdavi.mahdavi,previously declared a vexatious litigant,was a defendant in an unlawful detainer action.when he did not prevail in the unlawful detainer action,he appealed the judgment to the appellate division of the superior court.the appellate division in turn ordered him to seek leave of the court to maintain his appeal pursuant to the prefiling provisions of section.after he failed to do so,the appellate division dismissed his appeal.mahdavi,supra,th at,d.
mahdavi reversed and held an appellate court may not require a person,who has been determined to be a vexatious litigant,to seek leave of the court before he may file an appeal in a case in which he is the defendant.id.at,d.citing mahdavi,contends because he is a defendant in the child dependency proceeding,he is not subject to the vexatious litigant law.we disagree.
arguably,mahdavi neither addresses nor resolves the issue before us.the underlying facts as well as the legal issue in mahdavi are distinguishable from this case.the petitioner in mahdavi,unlike,previously had been declared a vexatious litigant and was subject to a prefiling order.the question was whether the prefiling order applied to his appeal arising out of a case in which he was the defendant.here,the issue is whether to declare a vexatious litigant based on his numerous and unsuccessful appeals and writ petitions for purposes of issuing a prefiling order.however,assuming for the sake of argument mahdavi is relevant to our discussion of whether is a vexatious litigant and subject to a prefiling order,we are not persuaded by it.
mahdavi first discussed some of the vexatious litigant security provisions,specifically sections through,focusing on references in these provisions to a plaintiff.mahdavi reasoned these particular provisions contemplate precluding a plaintiff from filing new litigation against a defendant.mahdavi,supra,th at,d.no doubt,these provisions make clear it is a defendant who moves for an order requiring the plaintiff to furnish security the court must be able to find the plaintiff is a vexatious litigant and there is no reasonable probability the plaintiff will prevail,before ordering the security and when security is not furnished,the litigation shall be dismissed as to the defendant for whose benefit the court ordered the plaintiff to furnish the security.
as previously discussed,section which authorizes a prefiling order is a separate and distinct remedy available to the courts in dealing with a vexatious litigant.in contrast to the language of the security provisions,the remedy of a prefiling order is not limited to a defendant seeking a prefiling order against a plaintiff.section authorizes any party to move for a prefiling order to prohibit a vexatious litigant from filing any new litigation,subd.a.also,in contrast to the procedure for requiring security,section authorizes a court,on its own motion,to enter a prefiling order.thus,we question mahdavi reliance on the language of the vexatious litigant security provisions in construing section which authorizes the distinct remedy of a prefiling order.
next,in mahdavi estimation,a defendant who appeals an adverse ruling,is not filing new litigation or maintaining litigation.rather,the individual is attempting to undo the results of litigation that has been instituted against him or her.id.at,d.in our view,this conflicts with the mccolm analysis mccolm,supra,th at,d which we find compelling.
mahdavi recognized mccolm conclusion that new litigation,as used in the prefiling order provision,subd.a,included the filing of an appeal by a vexatious litigant mccolm,supra,th at,d.mahdavi also acknowledged mccolm earlier reasoning as to the broad language of the vexatious litigant law as well as its determinations that an appellant should be considered a plaintiff for purposes of the statute and an appellant or writ petitioner certainly commences,institutes or attempts to maintain the litigation in the appellate court mccolm,supra,th at,d.
nevertheless,mahdavi concluded mccolm should be read narrowly to hold a prefiling order applies to prohibit a vexatious litigant plaintiff from appealing rulings of the trial court without first seeking leave.mahdavi,supra,th at,d.we respectfully disagree based on our analysis of the vexatious litigant law,as discussed in part above.
in our view,mahdavi took too narrow a view of the vexatious litigant law and its purpose.for instance,according to mahdavi,the appellant in mccolm was maintaining the litigation by filing an appeal.mahdavi,supra,th at,d.it reasoned mahdavi,in appealing from a ruling in a case he did not initiate,could not be said to be maintaining the litigation.id.at,d.however,this overlooks the vexatious litigant definition of plaintiff as the person who commences,institutes or maintains a litigation,subd.d,emphasis added,not to mention the broad definition of the term litigation,subd.a.
mahdavi also claimed a portion of mccolm discussion of the factors considered in deciding whether to grant permission supported its mahdavi narrow reading of mccolm.mahdavi,supra,th at,d.specifically,mahdavi highlighted mccolm mention of whether the litigant has demonstrated improper reasons for bringing the original litigation.mccolm,supra,th at,d,mahdavi,supra,th at,d.however,mccolm did not stop there.instead,the factor it identified for consideration was whether the litigant has demonstrated improper reasons for bringing the original litigation or for taking it to the next court level.mccolm,supra,th at,d,emphasis added.
finally,mahdavi claimed its holding was warranted because the thrust of the vexatious litigant law was to protect defendants from continued and repeated unmeritorious lawsuits initiated by plaintiffs.mahdavi,supra,th at,d.as discussed later in this opinion,we take the broader view of the vexatious litigant law,and especially section,purpose.it is one which also seeks to protect the court system and its resources as well as other litigants in re bittaker,supra,th at,d wolfgram wells fargo bank th,d wolfgram while at the same time provide a workable means by which a vexatious litigant may proceed with litigation forrest,supra,th at,d.
iv.statutory interpretation 
contends the vexatious litigant law does not apply to a dependency proceeding because a there is no welfare and institutions code provision which specifically applies it to dependency cases and b section,subdivision d specifically states it applies to probate and family law proceedings but is silent about proceedings under the welfare and institutions code.misses his mark with each of these arguments.
preliminarily,we observe it is not our purpose to render dependency cases more susceptible to the application of the vexatious litigant law than any other civil proceeding.rather,we address a much more narrow issue,that is whether is a vexatious litigant subject to a prefiling requirement based on the excessive number of meritless appeals and writ petitions he has filed in propria persona with this court.the fact that these appeals and writ petitions arise out of a dependency proceeding does render our analysis somewhat unique compared with earlier published opinions.whether it would be appropriate and under what circumstances to apply the vexatious litigant law requirements in other dependency proceedings or even as to other parents who repeatedly and unsuccessfully appeal rulings from the child dependency is not before us.
a line of older intermediate appellate decisions seems to suggest civil code and code of civil procedure requirements do not apply to a juvenile dependency case unless the welfare and institutions code so provides.in re jennifer th,d jones superior court d.in re angela d.even so,the appellate court in at least one of these decisions,alternatively considered whether application of a civil code or code of civil procedure requirement would be inconsistent with the purposes of the juvenile court law.see in re jennifer,supra,th at,d.
the better view is that application of a statute outside the welfare and institutions code and not expressly made applicable is not necessarily barred from dependency proceedings.courts should determine whether the statute at issue is consistent with the overall purposes of the dependency system.in re claudia th,d.this is in line with the stated position of the california supreme court which is to consider whether application of a statute outside of the welfare and institutions code would produce results inconsistent with the purpose of juvenile court law.in re chantal cal th,d.more recently in in re josiah cal th,d,the court noted in the absence of a dispositive provision in the welfare and institutions code,we may look to other statutory requirements for guidance.citation.neither acknowledges this evolution nor does he directly address its consequences here.
application of the vexatious litigant law to a parent,such as who abuses the appellate process,is not inconsistent with our state body of dependency law.dependency proceedings are part of a comprehensive statutory scheme geared toward expediency,largely to serve the dependent child best interests.in re claudia,supra,th at,d,citing in re meranda th,d.in the seven plus years that has filed the appeals and writ petitions summarized above,the underlying dependency case has been in that stage where the child interests,in stability and permanency,outweighs the parent interest in the child custody and control.in re marilyn cal th,d.we are not talking about appeals or writ petitions brought upon the juvenile court disposition or while the case is in a reunification mode.to that point we readily acknowledge the child and parent share an interest in reuniting.thereafter,however,the state has a compelling interest in providing stable,permanent homes for children who have been removed from parental custody and for whom reunification efforts with their parents have been unsuccessful.id.at,d.the state interest requires the court to concentrate its efforts,once reunification services have been terminated,on the child placement and,rather than on a parent challenge to a custody order.ibid.also,protracted litigation over the custody of a child may harm the child.adoption of alexander cal d.further,there exists a legitimate fiscal and administrative interest in reducing the cost and the burden of dependency proceedings.in re sade,supra,cal th at,d.
in determining that is a vexatious litigant who should be subject to a prefiling order,we are not talking about parents of dependent child generally who appeal or seek extraordinary writ review of juvenile court decisions.the hallmark of appeals and writ petitions over the last seven years has been his obsessive attempts at groundless claims which have the effect of clogging the appellate system.wolfgram,supra,th at,d.his appeals and writ petitions focus on as a litigant,not his interests as a parent let alone the child interests.in not one of the unsuccessful appeals or writ petitions has filed in the preceding seven years has he raised an issue regarding the merits of the child continued dependency status that is,the continuing necessity for the child placement and the lack of any progress by either parent toward alleviating and mitigating the causes of the child removal.while has twice argued in favor of visitation,the appellate records have been devoid of any evidence either contradicting the showing made in favor of terminating visits or supporting modification of the order terminating visits.thus,we conclude application of the vexatious litigant law to under these circumstances is not inconsistent with the purpose of juvenile dependency law.
also directs our attention to subdivision d of section,which creates the prefiling order remedy.it states 
for purposes of this section,litigation includes any petition,application,or motion other than a discovery motion,in a proceeding under the family code or probate code,for any order,subd.d.
according to,this language indicates the legislature specifically intended dependency matters be excluded from vexatious litigant proceedings.he cites in this regard the principle of expressio unius est exclusio alterius or the expression of one thing in a statute ordinarily implies the exclusion of other things.in re cal th,d.in his view,if the legislature intended the vexatious litigant law to apply to dependency cases,it would have listed the welfare and institutions code in subdivision d of section.
first and foremost,ignores the legislature use of the verb includes in section,subdivision d.such language suggests an expansion of the meaning of the term litigation,already broadly defined in section,subdivision a any civil action or proceeding,commenced,maintained or pending in any state or federal court and in turn an expansion of the prefiling order availability as a means of dealing with vexatious litigants 
also overlooks the fact that the expressio unius est exclusio alterius principle of statutory construction is not applied invariably and without regard to other indicia of legislative intent.in re,supra,cal th at,d.this rule of statutory construction is only a guide and will not be applied if it would defeat legislative intent or produce an absurd result.people rizo cal th,d.the california supreme court has clarified courts do not apply the principle if its operation would contradict a discernible and contrary legislative intent in re,supra,cal th at,d,citing people anzalone cal th,d,or result in absurd consequences in re,supra,cal th at,d.to follow argument and apply the expressio unius est exclusio alterius principle in this instance would both produce an absurd result and defeat legislative intent.
by reasoning,section,subdivision d,would necessarily limit the applicability of a prefiling order,as a remedy against vexatious litigants,to any new petition,application,or motion other than a discovery motion,in a proceeding under the family code or probate code,for any order.in other words,taking approach to its logical end,the remedy of a prefiling order to combat vexatious litigants could only be used to prohibit a vexatious litigant from filing in propria persona any new petition,application,or motion other than a discovery motion,in a proceeding under the family code or probate code,for any order and not in any other kind of litigation.this is absurd given the history of the vexatious litigant law and the legislature efforts to broaden rather than retract its reach.
in addition,a review of the legislative history underlying this amendment to section reveals the legislature merely sought to draw attention to the availability of a vexatious litigant determination as a remedy for relatives who were legal guardians and were subjected to repeatedly and unfounded attempts by parents to challenge a legal guardian decision making or even their continuing status as legal guardian.bill history of ab,stats,ch.
under existing law,parties to family law and probate law proceedings,as well as the court,may already use the vexatious litigant statutes if they so desire.the intent of this bill,according to the author and the proponents,is to point the way to the vexatious litigant statutes to the parties engaged in these proceedings and to the court,as a tool to discourage repeated motions by parents to regain custody of their children when there are no changed circumstances to justify a different result.com.on judiciary analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.

also contends our prefiling order will deny him his right to counsel on appeal in re sade,supra,cal th at,d,an indigent parent has a right to the assistance of appointed appellate counsel in his appeal from a decision adversely affecting child custody or parental status under california statutes and rules of court.according to,appellate counsel assistance is necessary to properly frame his appellate issues.
an appellant right to appellate counsel presumes an entitlement to appeal.by his actions as a vexatious litigant,has proven himself not entitled to such a presumption.he has abused time and again his right to appeal.however,as previously discussed,a prefiling order does not prevent an appeal it provides a means by which a vexatious litigant may nonetheless pursue litigation.forrest,supra,th at,d.having prepared a notice of appeal in propria persona,presumably knows what it is he is challenging.if he will complete an application see appen.a,post identifying the challenged order or decision and the presiding justice determines it has merit,in that it is at least arguable,and is not brought for the purpose of harassment or delay,notice of appeal will be filed and appellate counsel will be appointed.
also,ignores the fact that he has trial counsel who not only can advise him regarding whether he may have an arguable issue to appeal but can file the notice of appeal and bypass the prefiling order requirement altogether.while claims his attorney will not communicate with him,we are not so persuaded.the record supports a conclusion rather that it is who does not care to listen to what his trial attorney has to say.
vi.attack under the california constitution 
claims application of the vexatious litigant law to an appeal means the presiding justice alone will pass on the merits of an appeal and without opinion and therefore violates the state constitution in two respects.we disagree.
first,cites article vi,section of the california constitution which states in part 
the legislature shall divide the state into districts each containing a court of appeal with one or more divisions.each division consists of a presiding justice and or more associate justices.it has the power of a court of appeal and shall conduct itself as a court.concurrence of judges present at the argument is necessary for a judgment.emphasis added.
second,cites article vi,section of the california constitution which states in part 
decisions of the supreme court and courts of appeal that determine causes shall be in writing with reasons stated.
although numerous constitutional challenges against the vexatious litigant law have been raised over the years,none of the published decisions ruling on such challenges have addressed a contention such as.this may well be because his of the vexatious litigant law to an appeal means the presiding justice alone will pass on the merits of an appeal and without flawed.
section,subdivision b provides in part t he presiding judge shall permit the filing of new litigation in the courts of this state by a vexatious litigant in propria persona only if it appears that the litigation has merit and has not been filed for the purposes of harassment or delay.thus,by section own terms,the presiding justice in determining whether to permit the appeal to proceed does not pass on its merits.the presiding justice merely determines if there is an issue to review on appeal.mccolm,supra,th at,d.once again,as the mccolm court explained,
the decision whether to allow the litigant to proceed will be made on an individual basis,taking into account such factors as the nature of the action below,the nature of the lower court ruling,whether writ petition or appeal is the appropriate procedure for seeking review in the court of appeal,the litigant claims of error and whether the litigant has demonstrated improper reasons for bringing the original litigation or for taking it to the next court level.mccolm,supra,th at,d.
vii.attack under the federal constitution 
also argues that to require him to first obtain leave of our presiding justice before filing any new appeals or writ petitions in this court arising out of the child dependency violates his first amendment right to petition the government for redress of grievance and his fourteenth amendment right to due process under the united states constitution.according to,his act of filing a notice of appeal in the child dependency action is an exercise of his first amendment right to petition the government for redress of his grievances and that to require him,pursuant to section,to obtain leave to file future appeals in this court is unconstitutional because the requirement is not narrowly drawn.as to his alternative claim,he does not articulate how a prefiling order requirement would violate his due process rights.at most,he claims he is entitled to greater due process protection as an appellant in a case involving parental rights.therefore,in his view,application of the vexatious litigant law to him must pass strict scrutiny.
the issue of whether section violates an individual right to petition under the first amendment has been exhaustively addressed and rejected in wolfgram,supra,th at,d.we agree with the third district analysis in wolfgram.
no doubt,any impairment of the right to petition must be narrowly drawn.wolfgram,supra,th at,d.however,the right to petition does not confer the right to clog the court system and impair everyone else right to seek justice.wolfgram,supra,th at,d.baseless litigation is not immunized by the first amendment right to petition.wolfgram,supra,th at,d,citing bill johnson restaurants,nlrb,d.
the prefiling order component of the vexatious litigant statutes is a necessary method of curbing those for whom litigation has become a game to the extent it keeps vexatious litigants from clogging courts,it is closer to licensing or permit systems which are administered pursuant to narrowly drawn,reasonable and definite standards which represent government only practical means of managing competing uses of public facilities.citation.when a vexatious litigant knocks on the courthouse door with a colorable claim,he may enter.wolfgram,supra,th at,d.
contends we should not rely on wolfgram in addressing his right to petition challenge because wolfgram arose out of regular civil action and not a dependency case.we disagree.fails to cite and we know of no authority for his assumption of some kind of sliding scale for courts to apply in evaluating a first amendment issue such that one person may be entitled to more first amendment protection than another.it may simply be that is confusing his first amendment argument with his due process claim.
in any event,to the extent contends the remedy we intend to impose is not narrowly drawn,we disagree.he argues the usual purpose served by the vexatious litigant law is to protect a defendant from expending time and money responding to baseless lawsuits.that concern is not present,according to,in one of his appeals because the respondent need take no action,if there is no arguable issue and appellate counsel files a sade letter.alternatively,he claims we can simply dismiss his appeal when appellate counsel files a sade letter.
first,we take exception to appellant constrained interpretation of the vexatious litigant law.as we have previously discussed,the vexatious litigant law exists not only to help defendants but to curb misuse of the court system,unreasonably burdened by obsessive litigants pursuing groundless litigation.such repeated misuse results in a useless diversion of the appellate court attention and prejudices other appellate parties,many of whom wait years for resolution of bona fide disputes.similarly,our appellate system and our state taxpayers are damaged by what amounts to a waste of the appellate court time and resources.whitaker,supra,th at,d.the abuse is exacerbated in case due to the fact that appeals from dependency court rulings have precedence over all other cases in the appellate court.welf,subd.a.
second,we question assertion that appellate counsel filing of a sade letter somehow remedies the problem his appeals create and in a more way than a prefiling order would.the filing of a sade letter is neither responsive to nor a remedy for the vexatious litigant.it is simply the means by which appellate counsel advises the appellate court that,having reviewed the record,the attorney will not be filing an opening brief because that attorney can not find an arguable issue.
third,ignores this court practice of which he is well aware.we do not simply dismiss an appeal when appellate counsel finds no arguable issue.instead,we give the in propria persona the opportunity to brief and raise an arguable issue.if the parent files a brief,we review the claims made against the record and the law and issue a full opinion.it is only when the parent does not file a brief that we outright dismiss.argument also ignores the considerable effort as well as public expense involved in the trial court with record preparation,in our court with processing the appeal,and in the appointment of appellate counsel and payment for that attorney services.
as previously noted,fails to explain how a prefiling order violates his due process rights.for that omission alone,he is not entitled to our consideration of his undeveloped argument.people wharton cal d.to the extent he assumes a prefiling order violates due process because in his mind it denies him his righ
