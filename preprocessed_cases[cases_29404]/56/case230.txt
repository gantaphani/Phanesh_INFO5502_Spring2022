introduction 
the presumed father of now robert and miguel collectively,the children,and,robert biological father,each appeal from the juvenile court order terminating their parental rights.and argue insufficient evidence supports the juvenile court finding that the indian child welfare act of icwa et does not apply in this case,and further argue the orange county social services agency ssa failed to comply with its obligations under icwa.and also argue the juvenile court erred by finding the children adoptable and terminating parental rights while a child abuse report investigation was pending.
we grant ssa unopposed motion to take additional evidence under code of civil procedure section,which shows the juvenile court concluded the child abuse report was unfounded and the home study for miguel and robert prospective adoptive parents was completed and approved by ssa.that evidence moots and challenges to the order terminating parental rights based on the pendency of the child abuse report investigation at the time of the permanency hearing.
as for and icwa challenges,although ssa was informed the children were both eligible to enroll in two different chippewa tribes,our record does not show that any further efforts on the part of ssa or the juvenile court were made before ssa proposed that the court find that icwa did not apply and the juvenile court made that finding.we therefore reverse the order terminating parental rights for the limited purpose of allowing ssa to make active efforts necessary to secure tribal membership for the children,in compliance with rules c and c of the california rules of court.
background 
amended juvenile dependency petitions 
in december,the juvenile court sustained amended juvenile dependency petitions filed by ssa on behalf of robert and miguel.the petition on behalf of robert alleged that he came within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court under welfare and institutions code section,subdivisions b failure to protect and g no provision for support.all further statutory references are to the welfare and institutions code unless otherwise specified.the petition on behalf of miguel alleged that he also came within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court under section,subdivisions b and g.
in one or both of the petitions,ssa alleged the children mother mother,herself a minor and dependent of the orange county juvenile court,had absconded from orangewood children and family center.she had dropped off the children with caregivers without providing for their support or authorization for any medical needs.mother expressed that it was too difficult for her to care for the children.she had an unresolved substance abuse problem that included the use of marijuana,methamphetamine,and heroin.mother and had engaged in domestic violence.both and were incarcerated.
the juvenile court vested custody of the children with ssa and approved case plans and visitation plans.
although ssa is informed the children are both eligible for enrollment in two different native american tribes,the juvenile court finds icwa does not apply to the children.
in september,mother had told a social worker that she had native american heritage through the chippewa tribe and that her maternal grandmother,who lived in oregon,might be able to provide more information.a social worker spoke with the children maternal and their maternal,who each confirmed the maternal was enrolled with the bad river band of lake superior tribe of chippewa indians.the social worker contacted janice cadottet,who worked with the red cliff band of lake superior chippewa indians of wisconsin,to obtain more information.cadottet confirmed that the children maternal is an enrolled member of the red cliff band of chippewa indian tribe.cadottet informed the social worker that the children are or may be eligible for enrollment with either one of those two chippewa indian tribes.icwa day notices were sent.
the record contains a form,purportedly from the red cliff band of lake superior chippewas,dated october,which requests the family history for the children maternal biological grandmother.
on november,the social worker received a call from the bad river band of lake superior tribe of chippewa indians and was told that the children were eligible for enrollment with that tribe.a day later,the social worker was informed by the red cliff band of lake superior chippewa indians of wisconsin that the children were eligible for enrollment with their indian tribe.the social worker was further informed mother,at that time a minor dependent who was awol from placement,was eligible for enrollment in both tribes.the social worker stated,i n order to move forward with tribal enrollment for the children,ssa needs mother to present herself to court,choose to enroll herself in one of the two chippewa indian tribes.once mother has enrolled in either chippewa indian tribe then ssa can move forward to enroll the children in that same chippewa tribe.
our record discloses no further action after november,until an interim review report,dated april,stated,i t is respectfully requested that the court make a finding as to the children indian child welfare act status.the report further stated that icwa does or may apply as each child might be an indian child in the chippewa tribe and was icwa eligible capitalization boldface omitted.ssa proposed the court find icwa does not apply,and the juvenile court minute order,dated april,contains the finding,icwa does not apply.in a minute order dated june,the juvenile court again stated court finds icwa does not apply.
the juvenile court terminates parental rights and appeal.
the juvenile court terminated reunification services in april and set a permanency hearing.as to the issue of icwa compliance,the permanency hearing report stated per the orange county juvenile court minute orders dated april,and june,the indian child welfare act does not apply.
at the permanency hearing,the juvenile court found it likely the children would be adopted and that adoption was in their best interests.the court terminated parental rights as to mother,and,and placed the children for adoption.
and each appealed from the order terminating parental rights.
discussion 
evidence shows that icwa did not apply in this case and that ssa made active efforts to secure tribal enrollment for the children.
and argue insufficient evidence supports the finding that icwa did not apply.they also argue ssa failed to make active efforts to secure tribal enrollment for the children.we agree with both contentions.
icwa was enacted to protect the best interests of indian children and to promote the stability and security of indian tribes and families by the establishment of minimum federal standards for the removal of indian children from their families and the placement of such children in foster or adoptive homes which will reflect the unique values of indian culture.to achieve this purpose,icwa requires notice be given to the child tribe where the court knows or has reason to know that an indian child is involved.a.the tribe response will determine if the child is an indian child.in re desiree th,the question of membership rests with each indian tribe.
in the context of juvenile dependency proceedings,notice to indian tribes is governed by both federal and state law.icwa provides that if the court knows or has reason to know that an indian child is involved in an involuntary state court proceeding,the party seeking foster care placement of,or termination of parental rights to,an indian child shall notify the indian child tribe a.welfare and institutions code s ection,subdivision b reiterates that n otice shall be sent whenever it is known or there is reason to know that an indian child is involved,and for every hearing thereafter unless it is determined that icwa does not apply to the case in accordance with welfare and institutions code section.in re alice th,italics added.
we review the trial court findings whether proper notice was given under icwa and whether icwa applies to the proceedings for substantial evidence.citation.in re th.
