effective march,the gang violence and juvenile crime prevention initiative,primary,proposition amended welfare and institutions code section section,subdivision a section a establishes the juvenile court procedure for finding probation violations and modifying prior dispositions when new misconduct is committed by those on probation for crimes previously adjudicated under section.
as we recently explained in in re eddie cal th,d,eddie,former section could be used to find a new criminal violation by one already a probationer under section,and thus to increase the person maximum term of juvenile confinement.accordingly,case law established that the new misconduct adjudicated under former section must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt by evidence competent in a criminal trial.in re arthur cal d,arthur.
however,proposition prevents use of section a to produce new criminal adjudications and to thereby increase the maximum term of confinement for the original section offense.even if criminal in fact,new misconduct may be treated,under section a,only as a probation violation.if a violation is found,the violator may,at most,receive a more restrictive juvenile placement within the original maximum term.
consistent with section changed role,and in an effort to streamline proceedings under this statute,proposition reduced the standard of proof in such proceedings from beyond a reasonable doubt to a preponderance of the evidence,subd.c section c.certain evidentiary changes also were made.for example,proposition allows the use of reliable hearsay evidence in section a proceedings,insofar as such evidence is admissible in adult probation revocation proceedings,to prove juvenile probation violations.c see in re antonio d.
in eddie,supra,cal th,d,we unanimously held that the state and federal due process clauses permit use of the preponderance standard in all section a proceedings covered by proposition.as we explained,contrary to what statutory law provided when arthur,supra,cal d,adopted the old rule,juvenile probation violation proceedings now differ from criminal prosecutions in purpose,operation,and effect.eddie,supra,cal th at,d.
here,we address another constitutional challenge to section.petitioners committed their section offenses before the adoption of proposition.however,after proposition effective date,they committed alleged probation violations that the people seek to adjudicate under the amended version of section.petitioners claim that,as applied to them,the preponderance and evidentiary provisions of new section c violate state and federal guarantees against ex post facto laws,art.i,cal,art.i.petitioners equate section a proceedings with criminal trials,in which the quantum and standard of proof can not be retroactively eased.petitioners also claim that proposition rules for proving probation violations retroactively increase the punishment for their section crimes.
the juvenile court issued conflicting rulings on the ex post facto defenses in separate hearings below.in a consolidated writ proceeding,the court of appeal found no ex post facto bar to applying proposition in this case.
we agree with the court of appeal conclusion that no ex post facto problem is presented.even if retroactivity is measured from the date of the original section crimes,as petitioners necessarily claim,no ex post facto law is at stake.first,proposition amendments to section did not affect the standards of proof or evidence used to adjudicate those crimes.there is no authority for extending the ex post facto clause evidentiary concerns beyond the criminal trial itself to subsequent probation violation proceedings in which nothing akin to a criminal conviction is produced.second,for reasons set forth at length in eddie,supra,cal th,d,the challenged amendments do not inflict new or increased punishment,in the ex post facto sense,for the original section crimes.while proposition new procedural rules may increase the chance that a probation violation will be found,there has been no material adverse change in the standards used to modify the original disposition,or in the choice of placements available as a result.therefore,we will affirm the judgment of the court of appeal.
petitioners underwent separate proceedings in juvenile court.the district attorney filed section petitions accusing each petitioner of violating one or more laws defining crime,while under the age of,subd.a.the offenses occurred before proposition took effect on march,as discussed further below.
at the jurisdictional phase of the section proceedings,petitioners each admitted at least one alleged offense.the juvenile court found such crimes true beyond a reasonable doubt,and dismissed the remaining counts.
at the dispositional phase of the section proceedings,petitioners were declared wards of the court,and were placed in the custody and control of the probation department on various conditions.see.all three dispositional orders specified a maximum period of physical confinement for the section crimes sustained against petitioners,subd.c.
as a result,john entered the youth correctional center on the condition that he follow all rules and instructions.matthew was committed to a residential program and ordered to undergo treatment for his sex crime.jonathan received supervision on the condition that he remain drug free and take random drug tests.
the probation department later learned that petitioners violated probation.it appears the youth correctional center ejected john because he breached disciplinary rules and orders by provoking racial unrest and harassing black inmates.matthew treatment program was reportedly ended because he refused to participate.jonathan apparently tested positive for drug use several times.
the district attorney filed motions alleging probation violations on the foregoing grounds,and seeking more restrictive placements under section a,as amended by proposition.the alleged probation violations occurred,and the section proceedings began,after proposition march,effective date.
in each case,petitioners moved both orally and in writing for a ruling applying the former version of section,in effect when they committed their section crimes.all three petitioners argued against ex post facto application of proposition new standards of proof and evidence.
in john case,the juvenile court rejected the ex post facto claim and denied the motion.as to matthew and jonathan,another juvenile court granted their motions,and exempted their section proceedings from proposition.
the court of appeal summarily denied john petition for mandate,and he sought review in this court.we granted review and transferred the matter to the court of appeal with directions to vacate its denial of mandate and to issue an order to show cause.meanwhile,the people,represented by the district attorney,sought writs of mandate in the court of appeal to overturn the rulings granting both matthew and jonathan relief on ex post facto grounds.the court of appeal issued orders to show cause in the latter cases,and consolidated them with john mandate proceeding.
the court of appeal concluded that insofar as the challenged amendments are used to litigate probation violations committed after proposition effective date,an essential element necessary to an ex post facto violation appears to be absent new section does not appear to operate retroactively by applying to conduct completed before its enactment.rejecting a contrary assumption in in re melvin th,d,the court of appeal declined to use the section offenses as the pivotal date for its constitutional analysis.see post,fn.hence,the panel issued writs of mandate directing the juvenile court to vacate its orders concerning matthew and jonathan,and to conduct their probation violation hearings under section,as amended by proposition.mandate was denied in the john case,where the juvenile court had applied proposition.
we granted petitioners joint request for review.
ii.discussion 
intended scope of amended statute 
both sides had assumed throughout these proceedings,including in their briefs on the merits in this court,that the challenged amendments were intended to affect any section proceeding held after the voters approved proposition on march.however,after we requested supplemental briefs on this threshold statutory question,petitioners argued for the first time that such provisions were not meant to apply here.insofar as an initiative statute takes effect the day after the election unless the measure provides otherwise cal,art.ii,subd.a,petitioners suggest the operative event is the section offense triggering the juvenile court jurisdiction,not the section proceeding in which proposition new rules would otherwise apply.since their section crimes occurred before march,petitioners insist law dictates how their probation violations should be litigated.
the statutory language belies this claim.see robert superior court cal th,d,general rules of statutory construction govern initiatives like people birkett cal th,d,statute plain meaning controls.in making procedural changes to juvenile probation violation proceedings,proposition did not amend section to state that the original section offense must occur on or after march,in order for the changes to apply.by its own terms,section a broadly applies where the person is a court ward or probationer under section in the original matter and the notice alleges a violation of a condition of probation not amounting to a crime.section also contemplates a noticed hearing conforming to the statute requirements,including proposition new standard of proof and evidentiary rules,par.
the quoted language is unqualified and its meaning seems plain.any noticed hearing held while proposition changes to section are in effect is subject to their terms,regardless of when the section offense in the original matter occurred.a.if voters had intended to limit such amendments to probationers who committed their section crimes after the initiative effective date,proposition could have so provided.cal,art.ii,subd.a.we would have to rewrite the statute in order to restrict its scope in this manner.see people ansell cal th,d,ansell subjecting convicted sex offenders to new restrictions on procedure for removing civil disabilities even where qualifying crimes predated statutory change.
the statute purpose,as reflected in proposition ballot materials,also suggests an intent to affect the maximum number of juvenile probation violation cases as soon as possible.in general,voters expressed alarm over the recent increase in juvenile and crime,and the perceived inability of the juvenile justice system to protect the public,particularly against violent and recidivist offenders.see manduley superior court cal th,d.regarding changes to juvenile court procedures like section,ballot materials emphasized the interest in reforming less serious offenders by holding them more accountab le for crimes and other misconduct.eddie,supra,cal th,d.indeed,by making it easier to prove a probation violation alleged under section a,proposition ensures that new misconduct otherwise immune from either an adult criminal prosecution or a new section proceeding does not escape sanction altogether.eddie,supra,cal th at,d.the ballot materials convey a sense of urgency in this regard.see id.at,d,manduley superior court,supra,cal th at,d.
in contrast,petitioners approach effectively means that the section amendments at issue both here and in eddie,supra,cal th,d,would only affect juvenile court cases in which all of the following events occurred after proposition effective date the person violated a criminal statute within the meaning of section,the juvenile court adjudicated such offense in a section proceeding and issued a dispositional order,including probation,the person thereafter violated such probation within the meaning of section a,and authorities initiated a probation violation proceeding under section a.such a scenario could by many significant rehabilitative and public safety aims the changes were meant to achieve.thus,to ensure accountability for new misconduct alleged as juvenile probation violations,it seems reasonable to conclude that proposition covers any probationer whose section hearing takes place after march,whether or not the original section crime occurred before that time.
finally,this conclusion is consistent with how similar initiative measures have long been judicially construed.for instance,tapia superior court cal d,tapia,concerned proposition,the crime victims justice reform act,which changed criminal trial procedure by,among other things,limiting counsel role on voir dire and expanding the people discovery rights.a capital defendant tapia claimed these statutory changes did not apply in his trial because the charged crimes occurred before the initiative effective date.tapia,supra,cal d at.tapia emphasized that both proposition and related ballot materials were entirely silent on the question of retrospectivity tapia,supra,cal d at,and that all statutes were presumed to operate prospectively absent clear evidence to the contrary.see,people hayes cal d.
however,we determined that these general principles of statutory construction supported,rather than defeated,application of proposition new procedural rules in tapia case.even though applied to the prosecution of a crime committed before the law effective date,a law addressing the conduct of trials still addresses conduct in the future.this is a principle that courts in this state have consistently recognized.such a statute is not made retroactive merely because it draws upon facts existing prior to its enactment instead,t he effect of such statutes is actually prospective in nature since they relate to the procedure to be followed in the future.citations.for this reason,we have said that it is a misnomer to designate such statutes as having retrospective effect.citation.thus,a law governing the conduct of trials is being applied prospectively when it is applied to a trial occurring after the law effective date,regardless of when the underlying crime was committed.tapia,supra,cal d,italics added accord,albertson superior court cal th,d,new statute making mental health data available for use against sexually violent predators in civil commitment proceedings applies in both pending and future cases.
we must assume that proposition voters knew about and followed tapia,supra,cal d.see eddie,supra,cal th,d,electorate presumed to be aware of existing law when amending statutes.much like the initiative statutes that tapia construed,proposition standard of proof and evidentiary provisions concern the conduct and procedure to be followed in future section proceedings,juvenile probation violation hearings held after march.tapia,supra,cal d at.nothing in the relevant text or history suggests an intent to postpone this effective date,or to otherwise limit proposition depending upon when criminal conduct in the original section proceeding occurred.we reject petitioners contrary construction.
ex post facto challenge to amended statute 
general principles 
petitioners insist proposition can not cover any section a proceeding in which the probationer committed his section crime before the initiative took effect,even where the disputed probation violation occurred after that date.the claim rests on parallel federal and state ex post facto guarantees.see,art.i,cal,art.i,tapia,supra,cal d,placing no different meaning on federal and state ex post facto clauses,and following united states supreme court cases on the subject.
in general,the high court has established that no statute falls within the ex post facto prohibition unless two critical elements exist.miller florida,d miller weaver graham,d weaver.first,the law must be retroactive.such a law change s the legal consequences of an act completed before the law effective date,namely the defendant criminal behavior.tapia,supra,cal d,quoting weaver,supra,at,italics added.in other words,the operative event for retroactivity purposes,and the necessary reference point for any ex post facto analysis,is criminal conduct committed before the disputed law took effect.
second,only certain changes in the statutory effect of past criminal conduct implicate ex post facto concerns.since its decision in collins youngblood,d collins,the united states supreme court has followed the original intent of the constitution,and reaffirmed the principles first announced in calder bull dall.opn.of chase,calder.accord,stogner california,d,stogner carmell texas,d carmell.specifically,retroactive amendments to penal statutes do not violate ex post facto principles unless they implicate at least one of four categories described in calder,supra,dall.at page opn.of chase,
critical here are calder last two categories.the third category concerns laws that inflict a greater punishment than what was authorized when the crime occurred.calder,supra,dall.opn.of chase.the fourth calder category involves laws that adopt new rules of evidence and allow less or different testimony than what was required to convict the offender when he committed the crime.ibid.by design,these principles allow individuals to rely on existing penal statutes,and to avoid being unjustly convicted and punished because the law thereafter changed.stogner,supra,d,carmell,supra,d.
in the nearly years between the decisions in calder,supra,dall,and collins,supra,d,more expansive definitions of ex post facto laws arose.however,collins disavowed them.ansell,supra,cal th,d,accord,california of corrections morales,d,fn.morales in re rosenkrantz cal th,d.
in particular,the high court criticized some of its own decisions for disallowing any procedural change that withdraws substantial protections or substantial personal rights existing at the time of the crime.collins,supra,d.collins explained that regardless of its label or form id.at,a law does not raise ex post facto concerns unless it works in the manner calder,supra,dall,proscribes.
collins also overruled two high court cases invalidating statutes merely because they alter ed the situation of a party to his disadvantage after the crime occurred.collins,supra,d.the court made clear in collins id.at.that this test is too amorphous,and contravenes the exclusive ex post facto definition in calder,supra,dall.
finally,collins and its progeny show that adjustments in the procedures by which a criminal case is adjudicated rarely implicate ex post facto concerns.collins,supra,d.such laws do not typically enhance punishment under the third calder category.see lynce mathis,d,fn.lynce contrasting procedural statute that permissibly alters the methods employed in determining punishment with laws impermissibly changing the quantum of punishment.also,absent reductions in the quantum of evidence required to convict under calder fourth category carmell,supra,d,the high court has permitted the retroactive withdrawal of statutory protections regulating the conduct of criminal trials.see,collins,supra,at.allowing correction of flawed verdict on appeal and denying new jury trial see id.at,overruling both kring missouri.barring withdrawal of acquittal defense to first degree murder based on prior guilty plea to lesser offense and thompson utah.barring reduction in size of criminal juries.
we now use these principles and authorities to analyze the elements of the ex post facto violation alleged here.
retroactivity claim 
petitioners argue that amended section is retroactive as applied to them,because it affects probation ordered for section crimes predating proposition.though triggered by new misconduct committed and litigated after proposition took effect,the new statutory rules for proving probation violations assertedly relate back to the prior criminal acts for ex post facto purposes.
no federal or state authority compels acceptance of this claim.both this court and the courts of appeal have long held that someone who was convicted and sentenced for one crime,and who commits a new crime or other misconduct while either on conditional release or in custody for the original conviction,is subject to new penalties and adverse procedural laws enacted between the time of the two acts rejecting ex post facto claims like the one raised here,these cases reason that the new law merely alters the legal consequences of new misconduct as opposed to prior crimes,and that it therefore has prospective as opposed to retroactive effect hence,under the foregoing authorities,section,as amended by proposition,is not retroactive as to the section crimes supporting the ex post facto claims.
petitioners nonetheless rely on dictum in johnson united states,d johnson,as persuasive authority for their retroactivity claim.there,a convicted felon,johnson,committed new misconduct that violated the terms of his federal supervised release,which is not unlike parole.the district court revoked johnson supervised release,resentenced him to prison,and ordered him to serve an additional year of supervised release when he left prison.id.at.the statutory source of the last requirement was unclear.
in the sixth circuit court of appeals,johnson argued that the additional period of supervised release was not authorized by federal law when he committed the crime for which he was originally convicted.johnson also claimed that his sentence could not be upheld under a new statute explicitly authorizing additional terms of supervised release.because the new statute was enacted before the new misconduct but after the original crime,johnson claimed its application would retroactively increase punishment for that crime in violation of the ex post facto clause.johnson,supra,d.
the sixth circuit agreed with johnson that only the new statute permitted an additional period of supervised release of the kind he received.nevertheless,johnson ex post facto challenge to the new statute failed.the appellate court held that because revocation and related provisions of the new statute penalized johnson for violating the conditions of his initial term of supervised release,they were prospective only and did not impermissibly enhance punishment for the original crime.johnson,supra,d.
the united states supreme court found it unnecessary to reach and resolve this ex post facto question in order to uphold johnson sentence.johnson,supra,d.instead,as reflected in the bulk of the court opinion,johnson affirmed the judgment solely on statutory grounds.although it found no evidence that congress intended the new statute to cover past crimes like johnson,the high court held that an additional period of supervised release was implicitly authorized under prior law in existence when the original crime occurred.id.at.see id.at.conc.opn.of kennedy,id.at.conc.opn.of thomas,id.at.dis.opn.of scalia.
in a brief passage divorced from its statutory analysis,johnson discussed whether applying the new statute would involve retroactivity in the constitutional sense.the high court questioned the sixth circuit view that revocation and related sanctions do not relate to the original offense johnson,supra,d,and only constitute punishment for the violation of the conditions of supervised release.id.at.johnson noted,for instance,that a lthough such violations often lead to reimprisonment,the violative conduct need not be criminal and need only be found by a judge under a preponderance of the evidence standard,not by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.ibid.in other words,unless postrevocation penalties are deemed punishment for the crime originally proven beyond a reasonable doubt,due process problems might arise insofar as the reasonable doubt standard is not otherwise used to prove new misconduct in a parole or probation revocation matter,citing gagnon scarpelli,d reasonable doubt standard excluded from list of due process protections required to revoke adult probation see morrissey brewer,d same as to adult parolees.
as noted,california cases predating johnson,supra,d,have analyzed retroactivity similarly with the sixth circuit view questioned therein.moreover,consistent with the instant court of appeal decision,johnson suggestion that postrevocation penalties are attribute d to the original offense is not binding here.id.at.such language had no bearing on johnson statutory holding or rationale.nor,as discussed below,do proposition changes to section extend the maximum term of confinement for prior section crimes,increase the maximum level of restraint,or otherwise trigger penalties like those challenged in johnson,supra,d 
nevertheless,in light of the dictum in johnson,we will assume,without deciding,that the relevant conduct or reference point for assessing petitioners ex post facto claim is the criminal conduct producing the section adjudications,rather than the misconduct triggering the alleged probation violations.thus,for purposes of argument only,application of proposition to the present section proceedings change s the legal consequences of acts committed before the law effective date.tapia,supra,cal d,quoting weaver,supra,d.we now decide whether those consequences are constitutionally allowed.
petitioners emphasize the fourth category under calder,supra,dall.opn.of chase,which concerns rules allowing less or different testimony than what was previously required to convict the offender.petitioners complain that by easing the standards of proof and evidence in section hearings over what existed when the section crimes occurred,proposition makes it easier for the state to prove a probation violation and to modify disposition in punitive ways.petitioners rely on carmell,supra,d lone high court case to bar use of a statute under calder fourth category.see id.at.dis.opn.of ginsburg.
in carmell,and as pertinent here,the defendant was charged in a texas criminal court with sexually molesting his stepdaughter while she was between and years old.when the crimes occurred,state law provided that a conviction for sexual assault is supportable either if it was corroborated by evidence independent of the victim testimony,or if the victim informed a third person of the offense within six months of its commission.carmell,supra,d.the same statute recognized an exception to the corroboration and outcry requirements for victims under the age of,such that their testimony could sustain a conviction even in the absence of any corroboration or outcry evidence.if the statutory requirements were not met,either because corroboration or outcry was lacking,or because the victim was not under the age of when the crime occurred,then the defendant could not be convicted and the trial court would be compelled to enter an acquittal.however,compliance with the statute allowed the jury to decide the case and enter a guilty verdict.id.at.fn.
after the defendant committed the charged crimes,an amendment to the relevant statute expanded the exception,and allowed sexual assault convictions to rest solely on the testimony of victims under the age of.the amendment,which was applied in the defendant trial,relieved the prosecution of its duty under prior law either to corroborate the stepdaughter account or to establish that she disclosed the crime within six months.the trier of fact convicted the defendant based solely on the stepdaughter testimony.carmell,supra,d fn.the judgment was affirmed on appeal in state court.to reach this result,the appellate court used a principle approved in collins,supra,d,that exempted ordinary evidentiary rules from the ex post facto ban.id.at,fn,citing hopt utah.upholding retroactive statute making felons competent to testify as witnesses.
in a decision,the united states supreme court rejected the intermediate court approach in carmell.the majority first examined the fenwick case.there,parliament retroactively reduced the number of witnesses needed to sustain a treason conviction in order to successfully prosecute certain political enemies of the crown.carmell,supra,d.the majority observed that justice chase,who studied both fenwick case and common law treatises on the subject,framed the fourth ex post facto category in calder,supra,dall,to prevent such a scenario.carmell,supra,at,fn.the majority explained that just as the law in fenwick case originally required more than one witness testimony to sustain a treason conviction,texas law at the time of the defendant crimes required more than the stepdaughter testimony to support a sex crime conviction.postcrime changes requiring only one witness in fenwick case,and eliminating the corroboration and outcry requirements in the defendant case,suffered from the same flaw in the majority the quantum of evidence necessary to sustain a conviction.carmell,supra,at.
the carmell majority further explained that this view of the fourth calder category serves interests similar to other ex post facto proscriptions against laws altering the definition of crimes or the quantum of punishment.in each of these instances,the government subverts the presumption of innocence by reducing the number of elements it must prove to overcome that presumption by threatening such severe punishment so as to induce a plea to a lesser offense or a lower sentence or by making it easier to meet the threshold for overcoming the presumption.reducing the quantum of evidence necessary to meet the burden of proof is simply another way of achieving the same end t he government refuses,after the fact,to play by its own rules,altering them in a way that is advantageous only to the state,to facilitate an easier conviction.carmell,supra,d,fn.omitted.
responding to an argument made by both the state and the dissenting justices,the carmell majority declined to view the statute as merely a rule affecting the admissibility and competency of evidence under hopt utah,supra.see carmell,supra,d.the majority noted that such rules do not implicate ex post facto concerns because they benefit each side in a given case.carmell,supra,at,fn.however,both before and after the texas law changed,the victim testimony was competent and admissible in a sexual assault prosecution.id.at.the majority thus could only infer that the amendment altered the sufficiency of such evidence to meet the state burden of proof.id.at.the majority stressed that such postcrime changes always favor the prosecution,because they always make it easier to convict the accused.id.at.
finally,carmell,supra,d,rejected any suggestion that the relevant ex post facto principles had been previously abandoned or disapproved.the majority cited many high court decisions endorsing the fourth calder category.carmell,at.the carmell majority also noted id.at.that collins,supra,d,embraced the complete test in calder,supra,dall.opn.of chase.concluding that retroactive application of the revised texas law violated the fourth calder category,the majority reversed the convictions obtained in carmell.id.at.
it seems clear that carmell neither concerns nor precludes amendments like those at issue here.as we have seen,the proscribed retroactive change is one affecting the criminal trial for the act subject to ex post facto protection.the fourth calder category,as approved in collins,supra,d,and applied in carmell,supra,d,is limited on its face to amendments reducing the quantum of evidence or otherwise easing the burden of proof required to convict someone of a charged crime.calder,supra,dall.opn.of chase.at numerous points,carmell indicates that convictions in adult criminal court,and,presumably,their juvenile court counterparts,represent the sole concern of this ex post facto rule.carmell,supra,at,fn.see in re winship,d winship drawing due process analogy between adjudicatory stage of juvenile delinquency proceeding and adult criminal prosecution,and applying reasonable doubt standard to any juvenile crime triggering conviction if committed by adult.
here,petitioners can not show any impermissible procedural change affecting the criminal acts at the heart of their ex post facto claim.consistent with statutory and due process requirements,the original section adjudications were obtained by p roof beyond a reasonable doubt supported by evidence legally admissible in the trial of criminal cases.see winship,supra,d eddie,supra,cal th,d.indeed,no section adjudication is supportable unless this standard is met,whether pre or law otherwise applies.carmell,supra,d.there has been no reduction in the sufficiency of evidence or standard of proof needed to find petitioners or any other juvenile guilty of a section offense.proposition simply altered the rules for determining whether persons who are probationers as the result of prior section adjudications violated the terms of their probation under section a.
we further reject any attempt to extend carmell,and to apply the fourth calder category here.as discussed further below,section proceedings do not produce the equivalent of criminal conviction s under carmell,supra,at page.when proposition added the preponderance and evidentiary standards in section c,it also limited section a to alleged probation violations not amounting to crime s.eddie,supra,cal th,d,see id.at,d,followed adult probation revocation procedures in.whatever the nature of the acts,section can not be used to plead substantive crimes as such,to obtain new criminal adjudications,or to increase sanctions imposed for the original section offense.eddie,supra,cal th at,d,see id.at,d,before,operated much like new crime procedure.hence,the challenged amendments do not implicate carmell,supra,d,insofar as that case preserves the state duty to prove a charged crime beyond a reasonable doubt by the evidence required when the act occurred.eddie,supra,cal th at,d,juvenile probation violations need not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt,and c preponderance standard survives due process scrutiny people rodriguez cal d,same as to adult probation violations.
moreover,petitioners insistence on evaluating the present proceedings under carmell,supra,d,seems inconsistent with their retroactivity claim under johnson,supra,d.petitioners allegedly violated probation after voters amended section to include the procedural rules challenged here.by complaining under carmell about the manner in which their probation violations are litigated,petitioners arguably make such misconduct the reference point of their ex post facto claim.however,as implied by their reliance on johnson,petitioners suffer no ex post facto violation absent an impermissible retroactive change with respect to the section crimes committed before proposition took effect.it seems illogical for petitioners to invoke carmell,supra,d,while claiming to satisfy the retroactivity component of an alleged constitutional violation 
calder punishment claim 
petitioners also allude to the third calder category,which concerns ex post facto laws inflicting greater punishment than what was authorized when the crime occurred.calder,supra,dall.opn.of chase.the basic contention is that because section c new preponderance and evidentiary standards increase the chance that the juvenile court will find a probation violation and order a more restrictive placement,proposition retroactively increases punishment for the original section crimes.
first and foremost,we reject the suggestion that proposition new procedures for modifying disposition under section are themselves punishment.as we have seen,an ex post facto violation does not occur simply because a postcrime law withdraws substantial procedural rights in a criminal case.collins,supra,d.even new methods for determining a criminal sentence do not necessarily involve punishment in the ex post facto sense.lynce,supra,fn,d,following dobbert florida,d final decision on death penalty moved from jury to trial court,subject to automatic appellate review.otherwise,the high court would have retained the expansive principles that collins,supra,d,disapproved.there also would have been no need to revitalize the fourth calder category in carmell,supra,d.if punishment increased whenever new standards of proof and evidence disadvantaged a criminal offender,the third calder category would always apply,and the fourth category would be superfluous.
contrary to what petitioners imply,the ex post facto clause regulates increases in the quantum of punishment.lynce,supra,d,quoting morales,supra,d,italics added.although no universal definition exists morales,at,this concept appears limited to substantive measures,standards,and formulas affecting the time spent incarcerated for an adjudicated crime.for example,an ex post facto violation occurs where laws setting the length of a prison sentence are revised after the crime to contain either a longer mandatory minimum term lindsey washington,or a higher presumptive sentencing range miller,supra,d.impermissible increases in punishment also have been found where a new postcrime formula for earning credits postpones an inmate eligibility for early release weaver,supra,d,or where retroactive cancellation of overcrowding credits requires reimprisonment of an inmate who has been freed.lynce,supra,at.
however,not every amendment having any conceivable risk of lengthening the expected term of confinement raises ex post facto concerns.morales,supra,d.in morales,a california law allowed the parole board,after holding an initial hearing,to defer subsequent parole suitability hearings up to three years for inmates convicted of multiple homicides,provided it found parole was not reasonably likely to occur sooner.id.at.finding no retroactive increase in punishment,the high court emphasized that there had been no change in the applicable indeterminate term,in the formula for earning sentence reduction credits,or in the standards for determining either the initial date of parole eligibility or the prisoner suitability for parole.id.at.the court also observed that the statute,by its own terms,affected a small class of prisoners not likely to be paroled,and allowed the board to shorten the time between hearings based on the particular circumstances.id.at.at bottom,no ex post facto violation occurred because the risk of longer confinement was speculative and attenuated id.at,and because the prisoner release date was essentially unaffected by the postcrime change.id.at.garner jones,d concluding that new georgia rule allowing up to eight years between parole hearings for life prisoners did not necessarily increase confinement,and remanding to determine whether rule created significant risk of greater punishment as applied in that case.
here,any penal consequences attributable to petitioners section crimes are unaffected by the section procedures that proposition introduced.morales,supra,d.a brief look at the juvenile court dispositional role under section and section illustrates the point.
for years,the express purpose of the statutory scheme has been to rehabilitate juvenile offenders while both protecting the public and holding the person accountable for his misconduct,added by stats,ch.thus,under both pre and law,a crime alleged and sustained beyond a reasonable doubt under section triggers broad discretion in the juvenile court to order probation under various conditions,to keep the probationer in the physical custody of a parent or guardian,or to declare the probationer a court ward and to place him in one of several kinds of juvenile facilities.see,subd.e.whenever a section ward and probationer is removed from the custody of a parent or guardian,the order must specify that physical confinement can not exceed the maximum term of imprisonment that could be imposed upon an adult convicted of the same crime.see,subd.c,subd.b.the juvenile court may aggregate terms of confinement for multiple section counts or petitions,including previously sustained petitions,subd.c see eddie,supra,cal th,d.
before it was amended by proposition,section could be used in different ways against section wards and probationers.specifically,between and,officials could allege a probation violation not amounting to a crime,and seek a more restrictive placement than the one already in effect,allege a probation violation amounting to a crime,a new section offense,and seek the full range of consequences attending a new section petition,former subd.a,as amended by stats,ch,see eddie,supra,cal th,d.in either case,jurisdictional hearings held under former section,as amended in,followed the same procedures as section jurisdictional hearings,including proof beyond a reasonable doubt supported by evidence admissible in criminal trials.see arthur,supra,cal d,cal.rules of court,former rule d,adopted eff.july.
in,of course,proposition deleted the reference to probation violations amounting to crime s from section a,and adopted the procedures challenged here.see c.proposition thereby ended use of the statute to plead and prove probation violations as crimes,a
