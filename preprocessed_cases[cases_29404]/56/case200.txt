in a juvenile dependency appeal from an order terminating parental rights,may the court of appeal receive and consider postjudgment evidence that was never before the juvenile court,and rely on such evidence outside the record on appeal to reverse the judgment the general answer is no,although in the rare and compelling case an exception may be warranted.in this case the court of appeal erred in receiving and considering such postjudgment evidence,presented for the first time through the unsworn statements of the minor appointed appellate counsel in a letter brief,and in further relying on that evidence to reverse the juvenile court order and judgment terminating parental rights.accordingly,the judgment of the court of appeal must be reversed.
factual and procedural background 
stacy mother appealed from an order and judgment of the orange county juvenile court terminating her parental rights pursuant to welfare and institutions code section the minor,zeth,was born in february,and was first taken into protective custody by the orange county social services agency agency on july,at age months.a juvenile dependency petition was thereafter filed by the agency,alleging that the minor parents had failed to protect and provide support for the minor,subds.b and g.the grounds alleged in support of the petition included mother and father history of alcohol and drug abuse and related incarcerations,the unsanitary conditions of the paternal grandparents home in which the minor had been left,and the likelihood that father was in violation of his parole.during the incident that culminated in the taking of the child into protective custody,both mother and father were arrested for a peace officer in the performance of his duty,with mother additionally charged with assault and battery on a peace officer.after a detention hearing the minor was released to the home and care of his maternal grandfather,gregory,pending adjudication and dispositional hearings.maternal grandfather confirmed that minor parents were using drugs and would not be permitted to reside in his home.
at the jurisdictional hearing held august,the allegations of the petition were found true and the minor was declared a dependent child of the orange county juvenile court.the minor was ordered to remain in the custody of the maternal grandfather pending a review hearing,subd.e.at that hearing it was ordered that the minor be continued as a dependent child of the court,that custody of the minor remain with the maternal grandfather,and that previously ordered reunification services continue to be offered to mother and father pending a review hearing,subd.f.
in march,pursuant to a stipulation by the parties,the minor was released to mother custody for a trial visit.the results were favorable,mother having obtained temporary employment and a subsidized apartment with the agency assistance.in may,the minor was returned to mother under a plan of family maintenance.
in october,however,the agency filed a section supplemental petition for more restrictive placement,alleging that mother had left the minor in the paternal grandparents unsanitary home for unmonitored visits,without mother present,and on at least one occasion without adequate provisions for the child care,all in violation of the agency directives.supporting statements reflected that mother had entrusted the minor care to other unauthorized persons at various times,and was hosting drunken parties at her apartment.during one such party a guest had passed out,leading to police intervention and mother ultimate eviction from the apartment.
in a first amended supplemental petition it was further alleged that father,who had been released from prison,was living in the paternal grandparents residence,had not completed his case plan,and was being permitted unauthorized contacts with the minor by mother.statements by the maternal grandfather in support of the supplemental petition reflected his belief that at times the minor was terrified to be with his mother,that the minor was experiencing a lot of stress,and that his mother was neglecting him.
at the conclusion of the detention hearing on the amended supplemental petition,the minor placement with maternal grandfather was continued,and he again confirmed that mother would not be living in his home while he cared for the minor.in early december,mother moved into a sober living home within one week she was discharged for infractions of the rules.on december,the allegations of the supplemental petition were found true and the minor continued as a dependent child of the court.
a dispositional hearing was held january.the trial court denied further reunification services,found by clear and convincing evidence that return of custody of the minor to mother or father would be detrimental to the minor,and set the matter for a section selection and implementation hearing,also sometimes referred to as a termination or permanency hearing hearing.the agency report prepared for the hearing reflects that from october,until february,mother visited the minor in maternal grandfather home no more than once per week.during the period from february through april,mother did not visit the minor at all.during those periods,mother also refused counseling and refused to comply with biweekly drug testing per the court order.father remained incarcerated from august through february.on march,mother and father were arrested for possession of stolen property and illegal drugs.father parole agent observed track marks on both mother and father arms at the time of their arrest,and each admitted to recent heroin use.during those same periods,maternal grandfather reported that the minor was flourishing in his care minor was receiving regular medical attention and had been successfully enrolled in preschool.
the agency report recommended termination of parental rights and adoption as the permanency plan,indicating it was very likely that the child will be adopted by his current caretaker greg.was divorced from maternal grandmother,janet,herself a recovering alcoholic.he was in good health,had no criminal record,was stably employed,and resided with the minor in his apartment.he stated he loved his grandson very much,believed it important for him to adopt the child in order to ensure the child safety and,and did not believe this could be achieved with either parent,as there was no prospect that either mother or father would be able to care for the minor in the near future.the report further indicated,gregory has stated that he understands that by adopting the child he will be responsible for the child just as if the child was his biological child.the homestudy worker on this case reports that the caretaker presents himself as a mature and responsible individual who clearly understands the responsibilities of adoption.
the agency report was admitted into evidence without objection at the selection and implementation hearing held may.father waived his right to be present at the hearing.mother contested the agency recommendation that her parental rights be terminated.she admitted her recent heroin use but testified she had a close bond with the minor and claimed she was his primary caretaker during weekend visits at the maternal grandfather home.mother testified that during those weekend visits she made lunches for the minor,bathed him,and played with him.mother acknowledged that she had not visited the minor for significant portions of the preceding months.she further acknowledged that her father never refused to let her see the minor as long as she was sober,but did not permit her to be with the minor when she was under the influence.mother herself agreed that she did not want to be in the minor presence when she was under the influence.she testified,i love my son very much.i feel that i do have personal issues and problems that can be corrected,perhaps,by counseling or therapy.however,i do think that interferes with the way that i can parent my child.and i believe that it more important for my son and i to be together than anything else at this point.maternal grandmother,who confirmed she was divorced from maternal grandfather and was herself a recovering alcoholic,testified she had observed a positive bond between mother and the minor.she conceded,however,that at the time of the hearing mother was not in a position to take responsibility for care of the minor.
minor appointed trial counsel joined with the agency in arguing for termination of mother parental rights and adoption as the permanent plan for the minor.she urged that consistent visitation by mother had not been shown,and that mother and maternal grandmother were minimizing the extent of mother personal problems while exaggerating the positive nature of the relationship between mother and the minor.arguing that the minor has been on a rollercoaster long enough and deserves permanency,counsel for the minor stated his maternal grandfather is ready,willing and able to adopt.he the minor is adoptable,even if the grandfather did.it time for the minor to get that permanency that he deserves.
at the conclusion of the hearing,the trial court indicated it was discounting much of mother testimony,noting she had for the most part merely responded to leading questions posed by her counsel.the court also found maternal grandmother testimony in favor of mother biased and unconvincing.the court found the minor adoptable,and further concluded mother failed to meet her burden of establishing the sole possibly applicable statutory exception to termination of her parental rights under the benefit she had failed to establish the threshold requirement of regular visitation and contact with the child,and even had she done so,she could not have further established that the child would benefit from continuing the relationship,subd.c a.the court found that termination of parental rights would not be detrimental to the minor and would in fact be in the minor best interests,and entered an order terminating mother and father parental rights and freeing the child for adoption.
mother alone appealed from the judgment,on the sole ground that the trial court erred in refusing to apply the benefit exception to this case.the court of appeal appointed counsel for the minor in mother appeal.minor appellate counsel filed a letter brief in which she indicated she had investigated the minor current circumstances and learned that the minor was doing well in the home of the maternal grandfather,that mother visited regularly and often spent the night,that during her visits mother assumed primary parental responsibility for the minor,and that a ccording to the grandfather,he felt pressure to adopt the minor and preferred to become the minor legal guardian.minor appellate counsel concurred with mother that parental rights should not have been terminated because the order terminating parental rights was not in the minor best interests 
noting that minor appellate counsel was taking a different position than minor trial counsel,the court of appeal invited supplemental briefing from the parties on the following question in a case where a minor trial counsel unequivocally assured the trial judge at the hearing that the minor current caretaker is ready,willing and able to adopt,yet the minor appellate counsel tells the appellate court in her brief on appeal that the minor current caretaker was pressured into saying he wanted to adopt the child,and would prefer to be the child legal guardian,and further assuming,for the sake of argument,that the trial court did not err in not applying the section,subdivision c a benefit exception at the hearing,what is the proper disposition of the case on appeal following supplemental briefing,the court of appeal in a published opinion reversed the order terminating parental rights and remanded the matter to the trial court for an updated review hearing in the form of a retrial of the hearing.
agency petitioned for rehearing.appended to the petition was a supporting sworn declaration by minor maternal grandfather.with regard to minor appellate counsel representation to the court that he preferred guardianship over adoption,explained that he had learned from the social services agency,as well as from a class which he attended,that under the juvenile dependency law,adoption is the preferred permanent plan over legal guardianship,and that if he sought legal guardianship rather than adoption of his grandson,the court could place his grandson for adoption with an outside family in furtherance of the law preference for adoption.with regard to counsel further suggestion to the court that mother was now caring for the minor at maternal grandfather home,responded in the declaration,i understand that it has been reported that zeth mother is regularly his primary caretaker.that of course is not so.she is caretaker when she visits,under my supervision.her visits are not regular,and usually on the weekends only.rehearing was denied.
we granted the agency petition for review 
discussion 
it has long been the general rule and understanding that an appeal reviews the correctness of a judgment as of the time of its rendition,upon a record of matters which were before the trial court for its consideration.in re james d.this rule reflects an essential distinction between the trial and the appellate court that it is the province of the trial court to decide questions of fact and of the appellate court to decide questions of law tupman haberkern cal.the rule promotes the orderly settling of factual questions and disputes in the trial court,provides a meaningful record for review,and serves to avoid prolonged delays on appeal.although appellate courts are authorized to make findings of fact on appeal by code of civil procedure section and rule of the california rules of court,the authority should be exercised sparingly.de angeles roos,d.absent exceptional circumstances,no such findings should be made.green american cas.d.tyrone kelley cal d,see also in re brittany d.
there is no blanket exception to the general rule for juvenile dependency appeals.review of such appeals is governed by generally applicable rules of appellate procedure,with proper deference to be paid to the factual findings and uncontested rulings of the juvenile court,and all appropriate inferences to be drawn in favor of the judgment below.in furtherance of the state strong interest in preserving and promoting the welfare of dependent children of the court,and the fundamental right of such children to a stable relationship and a permanent home,the legislature has enacted a comprehensive juvenile dependency scheme that can lead to orders removing a child from the parents home,declaring the child a dependent child of the court,and ultimately terminating parental rights and freeing the child for adoption,as occurred in this case.various provisions of the statutory scheme strictly control the timing and manner of appeal or writ review of the critical findings and orders that can culminate in an order terminating parental rights,their primary goal being to expedite finality and thereby achieve permanency for the child.
the facts of this case are tragic but unexceptional they afforded no basis for the court of appeal to deviate from the settled rules on appeal in the manner in which it did when entertaining mother appeal from the order terminating her parental rights.at the time the minor zeth was taken into protective custody,he was a healthy baby boy.as far as the record reflects,he thrived in the care and custody of his maternal grandfather,and was successfully admitted into preschool while under his grandfather care.while in the former care and custody of his mother,however,the picture was not as bright.mother alcohol and drug abuse,and her related arrest and incarceration,prevented her from fulfilling her parental obligations to protect and provide support for her minor child,subds.b and g.she repeatedly left the child in the care of his paternal grandparents,in an unsanitary home,and on at least one occasion without basic provisions for his care.father,who,like mother,suffered from a history of alcohol and substance abuse,was a parolee who was permitted unsupervised and unauthorized contacts with the minor by mother,even after the child was taken into protective custody and then released back to mother for a trial visit.maternal grandfather furnished sworn statements relating his belief that at times the minor was terrified to be with his mother,that he was experiencing a lot of stress,and that his mother was neglecting him.his sworn statements further reflect that it was clear to him,from the time his grandson was taken into protective custody through the pendency of mother appeal,that his daughter was incapable of providing a permanent home or consistent care and support for her minor son.the record is replete with evidence of mother alcohol and drug heroin abuse,including drunken parties leading to her eviction from her subsidized apartment,and the incident that led to her arrest for assault and battery on a peace officer and the necessity of taking the child into protective custody.
it is particularly noteworthy that no party to this appeal has ever questioned or challenged the trial court critical finding,made at the termination hearing below,that the minor zeth was adoptable within the meaning of section,subdivision c.the issue of adoptability focuses on the minor,whether the minor age,physical condition,and emotional state make it difficult to find a person willing to adopt the minor.citations.in re sarah th,d.all that is required is clear and convincing evidence of the likelihood that adoption will be realized within a reasonable time.in re jennilee th,d.as noted,minor appointed appellate counsel confirmed at oral argument before this court that in the course of this appeal she never contested the finding of the juvenile court that the minor was indeed adoptable within the meaning of the statute.
in light of the factual record before us,and the rationale invoked by the court of appeal to reverse the juvenile court judgment,the central issue on review is this may a reviewing court look to postjudgment evidence that is outside the record on appeal and was never considered by the trial,an unsworn statement by minor appellate counsel that maternal grandfather may have felt pressured into choosing adoption of his grandson over legal reverse the trial court judgment terminating parental rights 
this is not the first time division three of the fourth district court of appeal has confronted the matter of the relevance and admissibility of postjudgment evidence in a juvenile dependency appeal.the agency and its amici curiae have pointed to four other published decisions authored by the court,each seemingly intended to further advance the court belief that postjudgment evidence will often be relevant in an appeal of an order terminating parental rights and freeing a dependent child for adoption,that counsel appointed for the minor on appeal is obligated by statute to independently investigate the child current placement and bring any evidence of changed circumstances to the attention of the reviewing court,and that such evidence should be liberally received and considered by the reviewing court for its potential impact on the appeal from the juvenile court termination order entered at the hearing.although we have no doubt the court of appeal had the best interests of the minors in mind when it decided this and the related cases,the court rationale and holdings are nonetheless well outside the legal mainstream,and can not be squared with the general rules on appeal and specific statutory provisions that govern juvenile dependency appeals.
the court of appeal four related decisions can briefly be summarized as follows.in in re jonathan th,d,the court stated,this court routinely accepts evidence per code of civil procedure section in juvenile dependency cases to expedite just and final resolution for the benefit of the children involved.citations.id.at,fn,d,italics added.
the court next decided in re eileen th,d eileen,which held that a dependent child appointed appellate counsel,like the child trial counsel in the juvenile court,has a duty to make an independent evaluation based on the circumstances in each case,that evidence as to how well the child is doing in a placement during the pendency of the appeal may be taken into account by the appellate court,and that it is especially important that independent minor appellate counsel evaluate what is in the best interests of their clients without any presumptions.id.at,fn,d.
in re jeremy th,d was decided next.that decision also stands for the proposition that in a parent appeal from an order terminating parental rights,appointed appellate counsel for the minor can side with the parent and challenge the trial court order by raising new matters arising from a change in the status or current circumstances of the child preadoptive placement,and that the normal requirements on issues on appeal must first be raised in the trial court,and must be preserved through a timely notice of routinely be dispensed with b ecause the paramount concern of the appellate court in all dependency proceedings is for the protection and welfare of the child,and it would be inappropriate to simply ignore the issue raised by the minor as waived based on procedural technicalities.id.at,d.
finally,the court of appeal decision in in re jayson th,d jayson,rendered after its decision in the instant case,echoed its holding in eileen orders terminating parental rights under section must be reviewed under a standard that look s for the child best interests,rather than the traditionally applied deferential standard of review.jayson,supra,th at,d,capitalization and italics omitted.jayson further holds that postjudgment evidence uncovered during the pendency of an appeal should routinely be received and considered,and can lead to reversal and the need for an updated review hearing,even where the juvenile court itself has committed no legal error in terminating parental rights or selecting adoption as the permanent plan on the evidence before it at the termination hearing.id.at,d.
the court of appeal in this case further expanded upon its view of the role of counsel appointed to represent minors on appeal first espoused in eileen a.here the court held that section,a provision which,by its express terms,is addressed to the duties and obligations of minors trial counsel in dependency proceedings before the trial court,also applies by implication to minors appointed appellate counsel,obligating counsel to serve the reviewing court as a neutral litigant in a capacity by independently investigating the current circumstances of the child preadoptive placement,and by reporting any changes to the reviewing court so that the court can determine anew whether the lower court judgment should be reversed and the matter remanded for a new hearing 
the chief problem with the court of appeal approach,however well intentioned it was,is that it effectively substitutes the reviewing court own post hoc determination of whether termination of parental rights remains in the minor best interests for the legislatively mandated determination that follows when the comprehensive juvenile dependency statutory scheme is dutifully adhered to in the trial court.the legislature,however,has determined that what is in the child best interests is best realized through implementation of the procedures,presumptions,and timelines written into the dependency statutes.the statutory scheme does not authorize a reviewing court to substitute its own judgment as to what is in the child best interests for the trial court determination in that regard,reached pursuant to the statutory scheme comprehensive and controlling provisions.this is particularly true where the reviewing court reaches a contrary determination on the basis of postjudgment evidence outside the record on appeal,which evidence,in likelihood,would have been irrelevant and excludable had it been known and presented to the trial court in the first instance.
the court in meranda,supra,th,d,explained the nature of the statutory scheme from the parent unique perspective in this way the dependency scheme is a remarkable system of checks and balances in re andrew th,d designed to preserve the relationship and to reduce the risk of erroneous in many different ways cynthia superior court cal th,d.until permanency planning,the parent interest in having a child returned to the parent is the paramount concern of the law.id.at,d,subds.e f,subd.a.the parent is thus entitled to months,and possibly more months,of reunification services aimed at assisting the parent in overcoming the problems that led to the child removal,subd.a,subds.e f.there is also in force at the dispositional hearing and at all subsequent prepermanency planning hearings a statutory presumption that the child will be returned to parental custody,subds.e f,subd.a.in addition,there are precise and demanding substantive and procedural requirements which the petitioning agency must fulfill before it can propose termination.at the dispositional hearing,the agency must show by the enhanced standard of clear and convincing evidence that removal of the child is necessary,subd.b.at the interim review hearings,the agency has the burden of showing by a preponderance of evidence that the return of the child to the parent would be detrimental to the child and that reasonable reunification services have been provided,subds.e f,subd.a.before reunification can be terminated,the agency must establish by a preponderance of evidence that it would be detrimental to return the child to the parent,subd.f,subd.a.also,independent judicial review of the case is mandated at least every six months during the reunification period and a myriad of positive findings are required with respect to every critical planning decision.last,the relevant statutes provide for early and complete notification to the parent of every stage of the proceedings during the entire course of the dependency.meranda,supra,th at,d.
by the time the proceedings reach the stage of a hearing,t he number and quality of the judicial findings that are necessary preconditions to termination convey very powerfully to the fact finder the subjective certainty about parental unfitness and detriment required before the court may even consider ending the relationship between natural parent and child.cynthia superior court,supra,cal th at,d,cynthia.t he decisions made at the review hearing regarding reunification are not subject to relitigation at the termination hearing.this hearing determines only the type of permanent home.id.at,d,fns.omitted.
although the settled case law thus holds that the critical findings of parental unfitness,detriment,and the failure of attempts at reunification may not be reopened or reconsidered at the termination hearing,the court of appeal approach in this and its related decisions,once again,is precisely to the contrary.
the court of appeal is of the view that to reverse and remand for an updated review hearing see jayson,supra,th at,d see also eileen,supra,th at,d,based on the receipt of postjudgment evidence during the pendency of a section appeal,is somehow of less impact than would be an outright reversal of the judgment based on the new evidence.the court in jayson suggested that i f postjudgment developments cast doubt where the law requires certainty,there is no harm in allowing the trial court to take a second look at a child adoptability.jayson,supra,th at,d.we fail to see any meaningful distinction between tak ing a second look at the child adoptability,and outright reversal of the judgment no matter how the remedy is labeled,the result is the same the trial court judgment is reversed.in this case,the court once again reversed the juvenile court judgment even though there was,strictly speaking,no error by the juvenile court.jayson,supra,th at,d,italics added describing the nature of our grant of review in this case.moreover,as already noted,in this case minor appointed appellate counsel has herself conceded,at oral argument before this court,that by all appearances the court of appeal below had utilized the postjudgment evidence issue as a means of reexamining the relationship.yet that was a settled matter which,by statutory directive,could not be reopened for reconsideration by mother,not even at the termination hearing itself 
under the court of appeal expansive view of the scope of an appeal of an order terminating parental rights,postjudgment evidence of circumstances involving the minor present custody status during the pendency of the appeal would be routinely and liberally considered.appointed counsel for the minor in the appeal would be encouraged,and indeed obligated,to independently investigate such evidence outside the record and bring it to the reviewing court attention for consideration in the appeal.basic formalities such as the need for a notice of appeal,and the requirement that issues raised on appeal first be raised in the trial court,would be dispensed with,and a best interests standard of review,applied anew from the perspective of the reviewing court,would be utilized to determine whether the juvenile court judgment should be reversed and the case remanded for a new hearing,even where the juvenile court itself has committed no legal error in terminating parental rights on the record evidence before it.
given the state strong interest in the expeditiousness and finality of juvenile dependency proceedings see in re sade cal th,d,the state has a strong interest in the expeditiousness of dependency proceedings,and its interest in the finality of such proceedings is stronger still,the statutory scheme generally does not permit the critical findings and orders made prior to the final setting of the hearing to be reopened and relitigated in an appeal from the order terminating parental rights nor can the order setting the hearing itself,or any findings subsumed therein,be appealed unless earlier writ review of any substantive claim was first sought and denied,subd.l.and the legislature has further expressly provided that the final order terminating parental rights and freeing the child for adoption itself can not be collaterally attacked in the trial court,subd.i.to the extent the court of appeal expansive theories and holding regarding appeals of judgments entered pursuant to section would allow and encourage the reopening of any foundational order or finding in support of the judgment terminating parental rights,they are at odds with each of these procedural limitations which section imposes on review of judgments terminating parental rights.
we therefore conclude that consideration of postjudgment evidence of changed circumstances in an appeal of an order terminating parental rights,and the liberal use of such evidence to reverse juvenile court judgments and remand cases for new hearings,would violate both the generally applicable rules of appellate procedure,and the express provisions of section which strictly circumscribe the timing and scope of review of termination orders,for the very purpose of expediting the proceedings and promoting the finality of the juvenile court orders and judgment to the extent anything said in in re jonathan,supra,th,d,eileen,supra,th,d,in re jeremy,supra,th,d,or jayson,supra,th,d,is inconsistent with the views expressed herein,those decisions are disapproved.
the parties have also briefed the issue of whether the court of appeal was correct in concluding that section requires counsel appointed for a minor in a parent appeal of an order terminating parental rights to independently investigate the current circumstances of the child preadoptive placement,and to report any significant changes to the reviewing court so that the court can determine anew whether the trial court judgment should be reversed,and the matter remanded for a new hearing.because we have concluded the court of appeal erred in holding that the postjudgment evidence in question in this case was cognizable and admissible in mother appeal in the first instance,the judgment must be reversed,and there is no need to further address this related issue.however,because the court of appeal erred in its conclusion that section makes no differentiation between minor trial counsel and minor appellate counsel,and echoed that erroneous conclusion,as well as reached seemingly conflicting conclusions,in other reported decisions,we make the following observations.
