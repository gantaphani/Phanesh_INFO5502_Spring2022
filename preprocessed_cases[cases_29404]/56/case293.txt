metcalf reported that for the past six weeks,mother had cancelled most wednesday night visits and sometimes failed to pick up without notifying jessica.mother also changed the visitation times for overnights without fully communicating her plans to jessica.metcalf noted mother failure to timely communicate the changes caused jessica a great deal of frustration.jessica worked full time and was a single mother with two other children.when mother suddenly canceled visits,jessica was left scrambling to find someone else to pick up from her day care.jessica requested wednesday visits be cancelled.

on friday,august,mother asked for a visit the following monday,august.jessica agreed.on august,jessica texted mother at to ask if she was going to pick up the child.mother stated she was ill and would not be coming.
on august,jessica received a text message at indicating she could not pick up that day.jessica reminded mother that for her next visit on saturday august,mother needed to arrive between and because jessica needed to be at work by.when mother did not arrive on time,jessica called her.mother stated she could not pick up until,following her drug test and asserted metcalf had approved a pick up.metcalf stated this was untrue because she did not approve a pick up and mother was not called to drug test that day.metcalf added mother threatened jessica,stating she would call ssa regarding jessica children.
the following wednesday,august,mother sent a text at cancelling her visit due to a dental appointment.that weekend,mother told jessica on friday she could not pickup until saturday morning,august.jessica objected,telling mother she needed to pick up earlier because she had to be at work at mother asserted the juvenile court and metcalf designated as the pick up time.metcalf stated this was untrue and she had told mother to arrange visits with jessica to accommodate both of their schedules.
the next scheduled visit was for wednesday,september.mother texted jessica at cancelling the visit and asking for a visit the following day.jessica agreed and it was arranged mother would pick up between and mother notified jessica at she was cancelling that visit.she texted super sorry not going to get baby just got home going to sleep,be there for sure on saturday 
wednesday,september was the next scheduled visit.the day before,mother said she would have to cancel the visit.however,on september,mother notified jessica she could pick up.she was significantly late in picking up.she arrived at,when the time to pick up was and the facility final pick up time was on tuesday,september,mother told jessica she was too sick to pick up on wednesday,september.
interestingly,mother consistently took for overnight visits.metcalf found it disconcerting that out of the six weeks mother had been approved for wednesday night visits,she had only been able to pick up one time.metcalf was concerned mother was not making a priority and she did not have the level of responsibility need to take care of 
in her report,metcalf provided some new information about mother.collette home had extended her stay until october.metcalf offered mother housing referrals.all drug tests in august and september were negative.metcalf listed the dates of testing,noting none conflicted with mother scheduled visits with 
on september,the court considered mother petition in conjunction with the hearing.the court first heard testimony from mother,who stated she was currently residing at collette home and randomly drug tested twice a month.with respect to visits,mother admitted she had missed a few visits.she stated there was initially a misunderstanding about the time saturday visits would start.mother acknowledged she missed two wednesday night visits and explained it was because she had been working a graveyard shift.mother testified she timely notified jessica about the cancelled visits.mother recalled on one occasion she gave jessica hours notice,and another time gave her one week notice.she disagreed with metcalf report stating she neglected to notify jessica or any suggestion mother constantly canceled and changed plans last minute.
when questioned about her graveyard shift,mother explained she would work at night and go home at.she explained her employer required her to work graveyard shifts anytime she missed work due to court dates.mother stated that following her graveyard shift she would sleep for a few hours,wake up for lunch or for a drug test if necessary,and then go back to bed.mother said she could not pick up from her day care at because she would be sleeping.
mother testified identified her as her mother and came to mother whenever she got hurt looking for comfort.mother said cried and called for her when she was dropped off after visits.mother described her activities with and concluded they had a strong bond.she explained that when jessica is with them,called jessica nina another word for godmother and she called mother mom.mother said looked to her for care and support even when jessica was present.
metcalf testified consistently with the information contained in her reports.she surmised mother was not responsible enough to have in her care full time.she stated,there some concerns about her being preoccupied,not putting the child first,prioritizing the child.mother is very involved in her recovery,in her meetings.and at one point she even asked if it would appropriate to go back to school.i think she reoccupied with her life now,and i do think she would prioritize the child.metcalf noted mother had missed visits with and each time her communication was poor.mother had also reduced visits with her other three children.
metcalf testified the various visitation issues suggested mother could not care for full time.she explained,mother does have any forethought with regards with what to do if certain instances come up.such as if she ca get to the day care center on time,she does make a contingency plan and she cancels with the caretaker if she ca make it for any reason,and that not something that can happen on a basis.you have to have forethought and make arrangements for the care of the child,if you ca be there.you ca just cancel.
metcalf questioned why mother did not notice for herself the clear safety issues present in her apartment before metcalf inspection.mother admitted she knew a child died from being crushed by a television yet did nothing about her own televisions in anticipation of having for overnight visits.metcalf believed saw jessica as her mother and primary caregiver,and saw mother as an aunt figure in her life.
after considering argument from the parties counsel,the court denied the petition.the court determined mother likely satisfied the first prong of the test used in evaluating petitions because there had been changed circumstances from the court prior order.specifically,mother had completed several parenting classes and had maintained her sobriety for over a year.the court stated mother sincere commitment to sobriety was not the sole test for a change of circumstances.
the court concluded it would not be in best interests to be returned to mother.the court reached this conclusion based on the information in ssa reports and mother testimony.it stated,her general neglect of children really from all of her adult life has not been eliminated by her commitment now to sobriety.it takes more to be a mother than to give birth.and in this case,allowing a to run unsupervised when she is responsible for the life of that child and that child running across a street is absolute proof that she is not ready to be responsible for the child life.she has shown she is not ready for that kind of commitment by choosing anything and everything else instead of her wednesday night visits and not conducting them in a timely and responsible fashion.she is unable to place the priority of over all of her other chosen relationships and commitments.
the court asked if the parties would agree to proceed to the hearing based on the evidence already presented.mother counsel stated she had a few more questions to ask metcalf.the court permitted counsel to question metcalf about the basis for her recommendation to terminate parental rights and her determination was adoptable.mother counsel argued the court should apply the parental benefit exception to termination of mother parental rights.
the court concluded was adoptable and it terminated parental rights.it determined mother had not met her burden of proving the parental benefit exception to termination.the court stated mother clearly had a new interest in reunifying with her child,but failed to comply with her reunification plan in a timely fashion.the court concluded mother failed to make consistent and regular visitation with.and those choices by her have resulted in disruption for jessica family which includes disappointment and behavior changes in.
the court determined there were many factual conflicts about visits and it found metcalf to be a credible and sincere witness,albeit not very prepared or persuasive.the court concluded that after observing mother demeanor during her testimony,i have come to the conclusion that i can not believe mother as being either accurate in her recall of dates,times and orders,or sincere.it added,mother for whatever reason is consistently in conflict with jessica recitation of any details of these visitation issues.but mother relies on explanations which have been shown specifically to be false.for example,mother stated she missed one visit because she had to drug test,and metcalf presented evidence she had not been called to test that day.the court mentioned another occasion when mother stated she was sleeping following a graveyard shift and could not pick up but there was evidence she could have slept and still picked up later in the evening.
as for the second prong of the benefit exception,the court explained it needed to balance the child interests and need for permanence against the child interests in continuing her relationship with mother.the court concluded jessica was the mother figure in life,not mother.although mother and had a bond,it was that of a relative.the court found significant that on her first overnight with mother,cried because she wanted to return to her home with jessica.and it was telling that mother called jessica because she knew jessica would know how to care for 
in addition,the court found relevant mother history of leaving her children with other people and concluded mother apparently forgot about the day she wandered alone across the street.the court found it telling mother set dental appointments on the day she was scheduled to visit,and she waited until after the pick up time to tell jessica she was cancelling.the court reasoned that even if mother had some sort of sibling rivalry issue with jessica,her behavior was upsetting and hurtful to,who was anticipating the visit and did not get one.the court also did not believe mother testimony she thought the court and metcalf initially ordered the overnight pick up time to begin at.the court said mother decision to invoke the court authority when jessica complained,knowing the court had not ordered a pick up time,was an act of fraudulent behavior.finally,the court concluded it would be harmful to to remove her from the only home she has ever known.the court stated overnight visits would no longer be approved by the court.it authorized visits with mother and father.
mother contends she made a sufficient showing to warrant an order granting her custody of and vacating the section hearing.we disagree.
a juvenile court dependency order may be changed,modified,or set aside at any time.a parent may petition the court for such a modification on grounds of change of circumstance or new evidence,subd.a.the parent,however,must also show that the proposed change would promote the best interests of the child,subd.a in re michael th.whether the juvenile court should modify a previously made order rests within its discretion,and its determination may not be disturbed unless there has been a clear abuse of discretion.in re stephanie cal th,stephanie.the appropriate test for abuse of discretion is whether the trial court exceeded the bounds of reason.when two or more inferences can reasonably be deduced from the facts,the reviewing court has no authority to substitute its decision for that of the trial court.id.at.in this case,the court did not abuse its discretion.
we conclude mother long term sobriety and renewed interest in parenting classes showed changed circumstances,but mother did not establish that an order giving her custody of would be in the child best interests.to understand the element of best interests in the context of a petition filed,as in this case,on the eve of the hearing,we turn to the supreme court language in stephanie,supra,cal th a t this point the focus shifts to the needs of the child for permanency and stability in re marilyn cal th,a court hearing a motion for change of placement at this stage of the proceedings must recognize this shift of focus in determining the ultimate question before it,that is,the best interests of the child.stephanie,supra,cal th at see also in re edward th,on eve of hearing,children interest in stability was court foremost concern and outweighed any interest in reunification.
in short,mother evidence did not establish need for permanency and stability would be advanced by an order returning to her care.the evidence showed had a loving and stable placement with her maternal aunt jessica,who had cared for since her birth.jessica had assumed full parental responsibilities and care for,and by the time of the hearing on the section petition,was two and one half years old.jessica was the only constant and stable parent had ever known.jessica and her two daughters felt like was part of their family.metcalf had no doubt and jessica were strongly bonded to each other.mother does not dispute jessica and relationship,and in her petition she stated she would strive to preserve that bond if granted custody or a temporary release.mother failed to present any evidence best interests in permanency and stability would be furthered by the proposed modification under stephanie,supra,cal th at page.
on appeal,mother ignores the supreme court language in stephanie and instead urges this court,in evaluating best interests,to apply factors delineated by the appellate court in in re kimberly th.those factors are the seriousness of the problem leading to dependency and the reason that problem was not overcome the strength of relative bonds between the dependent children to both parent and caretakers the degree to which the problem may be easily removed or ameliorated and the degree to which it actually has been.ibid.she argues she overcame the most serious problem leading to dependency drug addiction and the relief being sought would preserve the bond she shared with deserved an opportunity to know a mother who worked so hard to maintain their relationship.she concludes a change of custody would not be detrimental.in essence,mother is asserting it is in best interests to preserve the biological parent child relationship that she has worked diligently to achieve over the past year.
it is true a parent and a child share a fundamental interest in reuniting up to the point at which reunification efforts cease.in re th.however,the interests of the parent and the child have diverged by the point of a hearing to select and implement a child permanent plan.cynthia superior court cal th.c hildren have a fundamental independent interest in belonging to a family unit citation and they have compelling rights to be protected from abuse and neglect and to have a placement that is stable,permanent,and that allows the caretaker to make a full emotional commitment to the child.marilyn,supra,cal th at.adoption gives a child the best chance at a full emotional commitment from a responsible caretaker.in re celine cal th.
consequently,after reunification efforts have terminated,the court focus shifts from family reunification toward promoting the child needs for permanency and stability.marilyn,supra,cal th at.a court hearing a motion for change of placement at this stage of the proceedings must recognize this shift of focus in determining the ultimate question before it,that is,the best interests of the child.stephanie,supra,cal th at.best interests are not to further delay permanency and stability in favor of rewarding mother for her hard work and efforts to reunify.mother best interests are simply no longer the focus.
for the above reasons,we decline to apply the kimberly factors if for no other reason than they do not take into account the supreme court analysis in stephanie,applicable after reunification efforts have been terminated.as stated by one treatise,i n such circumstances,the approach of the court in the case of kimberly may not be appropriate since it fails to give full consideration to this shift in focus.seiser kumli,cal.juvenile courts practice and procedure lexisnexis.we instead follow the direction of our supreme court,holding that after reunification services have terminated,a parent petition for either an order returning custody or reopening reunification efforts must establish how such a change will advance the child need for permanency and stability.as stated above,mother petition fails to address these points and therefore we conclude the court did not err in denying the petition.
in closing,we wish to express our concern that the trial court deemed it appropriate to reward mother with additional services after terminating services and further liberalized visits when the focus should have been entirely on best interests.as the court later came to realize,there was ample evidence would be devastated and suffer great detriment if she were removed from jessica home after two and years.it is the only loving,safe,and stable home she has ever known.this case brings into sharper focus the reasons why the statutory scheme authorizes courts to terminate services and schedule a hearing at the review date for children younger than three.section provides services will not exceed six months if the child is under the age of three,unless the court finds a substantial probability of return with an extended or month period.these rules were enacted to circumvent the very situation we see in the case before us.based on the record,best interests at the age of six months and at twelve months were blaringly clear because mother had relapsed multiple times and could not offer a stable home.the legislature understood children such as have a critical need to quickly find a secure and stable placement.it was detrimental to this infant best interests,and it was ultimately unkind to mother,to continue the case an additional months.
at a permanency planning hearing,the court may order one of three alternative plans adoption necessitating the termination of parental rights guardianship or foster care,subd.c,c a.if the child is adoptable,there is a strong preference for adoption over the other alternatives.in re th.once the court determines the child is adoptable as indisputably was,a parent seeking a less restrictive plan has the burden of showing that the termination of parental rights would be detrimental under one of the exceptions listed in section,subdivision c b,supra,th at.
section,subdivision c b i provides for one such exception when t he parents have maintained regular visitation and contact with the child and the child would benefit from continuing the relationship.the benefit necessary to trigger this exception has been judicially construed to mean,the relationship promotes the of the child to such a degree as to outweigh the the child would gain in a permanent home with new,adoptive parents.in other words,the court balances the strength and quality of the natural relationship in a tenuous placement against the security and the sense of belonging a new family would confer.if severing the natural relationship would deprive the child of a substantial,positive emotional attachment such that the child would be greatly harmed,the preference for adoption is overcome and the natural parent rights are not terminated.in re autumn th,autumn see also in re jasmine th,jasmine.
a parent asserting the parental benefit exception has the burden of establishing that exception by a preponderance of the evidence.in re valerie th.it is not enough to show that the parent and child have a friendly and loving relationship.see in re beatrice th,beatrice.interaction between a natural parent and child will always confer some incidental benefit to the child beatrice,supra,th at.for the exception to apply,a parental relationship is necessary.jasmine,supra,th at.while friendships are important,a child needs at least one parent.where a biological parent is incapable of functioning in that role,the child should be given every opportunity to bond with an individual who will assume the role of a parent.citation.ibid.
mother suggests the law has departed from the autumn line of cases described above and the benefit exception no longer requires proof the child has a primary attachment to a parent or that the parent maintained day to day contact.citing,supra,th at.not so.moreover,this case is nothing like the case.
in the case,a child was removed from the custody of her father who had been her primary caregiver,supra,th at.he had a year methamphetamine addiction,was in poor health,and had been diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder following his service in the vietnam war.the father immediately acknowledged his drug use was inexcusable and fully complied with his case plan,remained drug free,and regularly visited his daughter three days a week,supra,th at.even after a year apart,when the visits ended,the child continued to become upset and wanted to leave with her father.id.at.
the appellate court in reversed the termination of parental rights,finding substantial evidence to support application of the parental benefit exception,supra,th at.the court determined that despite the lack of daily contact,the father continued his significant relationship with the child.rather than a visitor or playmate relationship,the court found a true parental relationship that had developed during the child first three years life when she lived with her father,and which continued to develop while they lived apart.id.at.the court concluded,t he only reasonable inference is that would be greatly harmed by the loss of her significant,positive relationship with her fath
