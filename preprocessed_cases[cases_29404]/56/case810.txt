ii.discussion 
definition of masturbation 
welfare and institutions code section,subdivision a defines the term sexually violent predator as a person who has been convicted of a sexually violent offense against two or more victims and who has a diagnosed mental disorder that makes the person a danger to the health and safety of others in that it is likely that he or she will engage in sexually violent criminal behavior.
welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b defines the term sexually violent offense as the following acts when committed by force,violence,duress,menace,or fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury on the victim or another person,and that are committed on,before,or after the effective date of this article and result in a conviction or a finding of not guilty by reason of insanity,as provided in subdivision a a felony violation of paragraph of subdivision a of section paragraph of subdivision a of section section subdivision a or b of section or subdivision a of section of the penal code or sodomy or oral copulation in violation of section or of the penal code.
section provides a if the victim of an underlying offense that is specified in subdivision b of section is a child under the age of and the offending act or acts involved substantial sexual conduct,the offense shall constitute a sexually violent offense for purposes of section.b substantial sexual conduct means penetration of the vagina or rectum of either the victim or the offender by the penis of the other or by any foreign object,oral copulation,or masturbation of either the victim or the offender.
during trial,the people submitted a motion to instruct the jury that masturbation as used in section definition of substantial sexual conduct includes genital touching that is accomplished over the victim clothing.defendant submitted opposition to the motion,arguing that masturbation must involve touching of bare skin.defendant also brought a motion for summary judgment,arguing that there was no evidence he touched any of the victims bare skin.
the trial court denied defendant motion for summary judgment,explaining i reviewed the cases cited by both sides on the issue.i do not believe that the term masturbation,as used for these purposes,is limited to skin to skin contact.i think that would fly in the face of the purpose of the law,and the reason why we have this law.the trial court further stated that it would come up with an appropriate jury instruction by the end of trial.
the trial court ultimately defined masturbation as follows masturbation means any touching or contact,however slight,of the genitals of either the victim or the offender,with the requisite specific intent to arouse,appeal to,or gratify the sexual desires of either party.to constitute masturbation,it is not necessary that the bare skin be touched.the touching may be through the clothing of the child.
defendant contends the above instruction was erroneous because it permitted the jury to find that his prior offenses involved substantial sexual conduct based on evidence that he touched the minors genitals through their clothing.
in people chambless th,d,the court concluded that the definition of masturbation under the act encompasses any touching or contact,however slight,of the genitals of either the victim or the offender,with the requisite intent the chambless court did not consider whether such touching had to involve contact with the victim or offender skin.
in people whitlock th,d,the court considered the exact issue presented in the instant case and concluded that n either chambless nor the svpa requires the touching or contact of bare skin.chambless repeatedly refers to masturbation as any genital touching.citation.the focus is not on the amount of the contact but rather whether genital contact was made.citation.whether the genital touching occurs over clothing is not determinative.masturbation as it is defined in chambless and is commonly understood can occur under clothing and over clothing.
the court in whitlock further found that a requirement would be contrary to the legislature express intent to provide additional protection under the svpa for underage children from those predispose d to the commission of criminal sexual acts.citations.citation.children are particularly vulnerable to sex offenders.requiring contact for qualifying prior convictions would not advance the legislature purpose of protecting children.people whitlock,supra,th at,d.
defendant argues that whitlock was wrongly decided.he points out that in every other published case involving issues relating to substantial sexual conduct,there was evidence of touching.however,t he lack of case law on this point may simply indicate that the question has not come up before in this particular context.people whitlock,supra,th at,d.
defendant contends that the legislature could have spe
