when a defendant has been charged with delivering cocaine to a minor on or about a certain date and the minor testifies that the defendant delivered cocaine to her maybe or times during the period preceding this date,has the minor provided testimony of offenses extraneous to the charged offense no.and,can a minor be an accomplice to a defendant delivery of cocaine to her no.
a jury convicted appellant of delivering a controlled substance to a minor.see section,health and safety code.the indictment alleged that appellant committed this offense on or about september,who is appellant daughter,testified that appellant delivered cocaine to her on september.
she also testified on redirect examination that appellant delivered cocaine to her maybe or times during the period preceding the september date alleged in the indictment.appellant objected to this evidence on the basis that it was extraneous to the offense charged in the indictment and offered solely for a character conformity purpose under rule b of the texas rules of evidence.the prosecution offered the evidence as extraneous offense evidence that was admissible for a noncharacter conformity purpose under rule b.the trial court decided that the evidence was admissible for a noncharacter conformity purpose under rule b.the trial court also decided that those occasions other than the september delivery are within the statute of limitations and,therefore,are offenses that are described within the indictment.our review of the record indicates that neither party claimed that the trial court erroneously admitted the evidence on this latter basis.
prosecution okay.i do know if that suffices for the high points.and i think the door is basically has been opened in order to prove something other than character conformity in regard to those extraneous offenses,which technically would be probably the same criminal episode under the definition of criminal episode in that it criminal either the penal code or code of criminal procedure.but it,i believe.
whichever book we talking about says that it the same as a repeated commission of the same offense.and we dealing with on or about september.we basically talking about the same criminal episode in that these are repeated offenses that tend to indicate something other than character conformity,such as identity,since identity is evidently an issue based upon the and also opportunity knowledge and lack of mistake or accident.
you know,the repeated commission of that under the doctrine of i can go run and get the case law that indicates to you the analysis and rationale behind that.i not going to say that i can spout it my tongue as to why that type of evidence is admissible,but it under those theories when there has been some type of.
certainly i would even request a limiting instruction to properly curtail the jury consideration of that evidence to focus in on those issues.identity clearly has been brought into question here as to who has provided this specific drug.
and i tried to very surgically limit the questions on direct to that one occasion,and i think that on cross is the first time that the true emphasis in regarding identity came into play.
the court what are your objections 
appellant my objections are under and.and i do have case law,if i may approach and provide you a copy.i outlined the portions,your honor.i think the sole purpose for this would be to try to prove the act or conformity of that,and that not allowed under.
the case,i think,has a very appropriate paragraph back on about think it page,the column.this case is dealing with a possession of cocaine.they claimed he possessed cocaine previously in the perry case,and we have the same type of problem here.he claiming that he evidence by the is that he had allegedly given her cocaine sometime previously.that not the crime he been accused of today.
as far as it being a criminal episode,it seems like a long time nine months.i do think that still the same episode.this is the first time he has tried to introduce this type of evidence.i think when you look at the montgomery case that it clearly talks about how the court needs to weigh the evidence and the likelihood that what the witness is saying is true and accurate.
there absolutely no supporting evidence for that,your honor.no one else can confirm that he been giving her this cocaine on separate occasions.she could say,and no one could confirm that.i think the likelihood of this occurring is very suspect,your honor.i think that was one of the things that was considered in not allowing this type of evidence in.
i believe that the prejudicial probative value is substantially outweighed by the prejudicial effect it will have on my client 
the court let the record reflect that it is wednesday morning and the jury is not in the courtroom.the issues that were brought before the court yesterday evening regarding testimony as to the occasions other than september wherein she will allege that cocaine was provided to her by the defendant has been discussed in depth and reviewed in depth by the court.
and,counsel,the court is of the opinion according to the case law that i have reviewed and have been provided to those occasions are within the statute of limitations and,therefore,are offenses that are described in the indictment.
in the alternative,i do not believe i have to go to the balancing portion of b regarding extraneous offenses.however,if i do,i believe that it is a rebuttal of a defensive theory.it goes to identity,opportunity,possibly even motive.and,therefore,if it were to be within the court discretion under b,i would allow it there,also.
appellant claimed on direct appeal that the trial court erroneously admitted as extraneous offense evidence under rule b.testimony that appellant delivered cocaine to her maybe or times during the period preceding the september date alleged in the indictment.relying on this court decisions in sledge state and rankin state,the court of appeals decided that this evidence was not evidence of extraneous offenses,but rather evidence of the repeated commission of the offense alleged in the indictment and that,under these circumstances,appellant remedy was to require the prosecution to elect the occurrence in which it sought to rely for conviction.rodriguez,at see sledge state,rankin state,
appellant also challenged on direct appeal the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction.in support of this claim,he argued for the first time that was an accomplice whose testimony was not adequately corroborated which made the evidence insufficient to support the conviction.rodriguez state.though the record reflects that appellant did not request and the trial court did not sua sponte submit an accomplice witness instruction in the jury charge,the court of appeals nevertheless addressed appellant sufficiency claim and decided that was not an accomplice.id.
we granted appellant discretionary review petition to determine whether the court of appeals erroneously held that testimony that appellant delivered cocaine to her maybe or times during the period preceding the september date alleged in the indictment was not extraneous offense evidence and whether appellant was entitled to an accomplice witness instruction under article of the texas code of criminal procedure we will affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.
ground one 
the court of appeals applied law set out in our decisions in rankin and sledge and we are not inclined to revisit those decisions which answer the contentions made in appellant brief.see,rankin,at meyers,concurring summarizing the law applicable to cases like this.based on these decisions,we hold that testimony that appellant delivered cocaine to her maybe or times during the period preceding the september date alleged in the indictment was not evidence of extraneous offenses and that appellant remedy was to require the state to elect the occurrence on which it sought to rely for conviction.see id.
the benefit a defendant receives in cases like this is that,absent an election,he can not later be prosecuted for the separate acts of misconduct upon which the jury could have convicted the defendant.see rankin,at meyers,concurring subsequent prosecution for any such instance of misconduct is because it is impossible to determine which offense the jury actually found the defendant guilty of.appellant,therefore,can not be prosecuted for delivering cocaine to maybe or times during the period preceding the september date alleged in the indictment.see id.
it has been suggested that rankin and sledge should not apply here because general and vague testimony that appellant delivered cocaine to her maybe or times proved no offense especially in the absence of testimony identifying the substance delivered on the to occasions.testimony that a defendant delivered cocaine maybe or times is sufficient to support a conviction for a delivery offense.see jackson virginia,d.
it has also been suggested that the usual remedy of an election in cases like this does not apply here because it would have been impossible for the state to make an election in the absence of any testimony distinguishing one incident from another.the state,however,could have easily made an election.it could have elected at least one occurrence instead of maybe or occurrences.
ii.ground two 
appellant asserts that was a party and,therefore,an accomplice to the delivery offense.a person is an accomplice if he participates before,during,or after the commission of the crime and can be prosecuted for the same offense as the defendant or for a offense.medina state,cert.denied,d.a person is criminally responsible as a party to an offense committed by another if acting with intent to promote or assist the commission of the offense,he solicits,encourages,directs,aids or attempts to aid the person to commit the offense.section,texas penal code.
is not a party to the delivery offense that appellant committed even though appellant could not have committed this offense without participation.as the third court of appeals discussed in robinson state,there is an exception to the law of criminal responsibility where the crime is so defined that participation by another is inevitably incident to its commission,no pet.citing lafave scott,substantive criminal law section e at.delivery is such an offense.like the third court of appeals,we find the opinion of the wyoming supreme court in wheeler state instructive 
there is a definite distinction between a seller and a buyer.their separate acts may result in a single transaction,but the buyer is not aiding the selling act of the seller and the seller is not aiding the buying act of the buyer.the buyer and seller act from different poles an accomplice is one who participates in the same criminal conduct as the defendant,not one whose conduct is the antithesis of the defendant,albeit the conduct of both is involved in a single transaction.
here,as the recipient of the cocaine,was not aiding the delivering act by appellant.any offense stemming from receipt of the cocaine is separate from the delivery that appellant committed.once appellant transferred possession of the cocaine to,his participation in that offense,the offense with which he was charged,ceased.the two offenses are hermetically separated.while may have committed some type of offense by receiving the cocaine,she did not commit the same offense that appellant committed,and,therefore,she could not have been prosecuted for the delivery offense that appellant committed.any other holding would require the court to accept the nonsensical proposition that in this particular case was guilty of delivering cocaine to herself and that a female minor who has consensual sex with an adult can be guilty of committing a sexual assault against herself.
the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.
judge cochran dissenting opinion does an excellent job of explaining how the two cases on which both the court of appeals and the majority rely are not dispositive of the appellant complaint.it is disappointing that the majority has clung to such tenuous and inapposite authority to almost summarily dismiss a question of law which has huge repercussions on the introduction of extraneous offenses at the guilt stage of a trial.
while the proposition does exist that the state may introduce,for the charged crime,a separate instance of identical conduct by the defendant,it should only be considered when the record reflects that there is uncertainty as to the exact date on which the state is relying for conviction.obviously this was not the case here.it amazing how easily the trial court and the court of appeals bought into the state request to avoid the rule b prohibition.it seems apparent that the prosecution introduced the testimony herein to overwhelm the defendant with allegations that it had no ability or desire to adequately prove.its proposed remedy of allowing an election was a disingenuous gesture which had no real effect in curing the extremely prejudicial testimony erroneously allowed in.unfortunately,in the whole process,the majority has now adopted this proposition and,as a consequence,has literally rendered meaningless the protections and methodologies of rule.
rule b embodies the fundamental concept of our criminal justice system that an accused may be tried only for the charged offense and not his criminal propensities.thus,the rule sets out the procedure for the use of extraneous offense evidence in limited situations.if the state intends to introduce evidence of other crimes,wrongs,or acts,then the defendant must be provided reasonable pretrial notice this notice allows the defendant time to prepare a defense against the allegations.additionally,limiting instructions given in accordance with rule explain how the jury may or may not consider the evidence.a defendant is entitled to an instruction limiting the jury use of an extraneous offense for purposes such as proof of motive,opportunity,intent,preparation,plan,knowledge,identity,or absence of mistake or accident.the jury should be told,both at the time the evidence is admitted and in the jury charge,that the extraneous offense evidence should not be used to prove the character of a person in order to show conformity therewith.
in its haste to nearly repeal the rule,the majority has also overlooked other protections which are normally afforded to each defendant.these protections include the right to only be held for trial and eventually convicted,either by plea or by trial,based upon the indictment handed up by a grand jury.the majority also disregards the usual requirements for the sufficiency of the evidence offered and what is necessary for its introduction and review on appeal.
the texas constitution article i and texas code of criminal procedure article require a grand jury indictment in order for a defendant to be convicted.the indictment serves both to provide pretrial notice to the defendant and to delineate the elements of the offense that the state must prove.in this case,for the offense of delivery of a controlled substance to a child,the state must prove that the defendant acted knowingly,that he delivered or transferred the substance,that the substance was a controlled substance,and that the person to whom it was delivered was a child.the grand jury will not indict unless sufficient probable cause exists and there is enough evidence to formally charge a person with an offense.thus,for this type of crime,the testimony of that appellant gave her cocaine on or occasions would not alone be sufficient to obtain a grand jury indictment.for the offense that was alleged in the indictment,occurring on or about september,there was the additional evidence of positive urine test for cocaine,which proved the controlled substance element of the offense and provided the probable cause necessary to indict.
even though our caselaw has given the state latitude in presenting evidence,it is not intended to provide a way of introducing evidence concerning offenses for which it would not otherwise independently be able to seek a conviction.when introducing evidence,there must be more than a mere allegation that the offense occurred within the statutory time frame.the state is still required to provide sufficient evidence to support a conviction.in other words,the state must provide enough proof to satisfy the allegations of the indictment.testimony that her father delivered cocaine to her on or occasions would not pass a sufficiency test for a motion for directed verdict or a sufficiency review on appeal.this statement by the victim comes nowhere close to proving the essential elements of the case,and thus would be insufficient to support a conviction.the only evidence that the state presented was vague testimony that appellant provided her with cocaine maybe or times.however,the state did not provide any evidence to corroborate the statement and there was no proof that the substance that said she received from appellant on those occasions was even cocaine.in order to satisfy its burden of proof for this type of crime,the state would be required to introduce testimony identifying the substance that appellant delivered to as a controlled substance.the majority holding allows the state to allege offenses subsumed in the indictment without offering any proof to support the allegations.this now sets a much lower standard for evidence sufficient to convict someone of a crime.
if evidence that the state seeks to introduce constitutes evidence of another crime,wrong or act,its admissibility is governed by rule.this is so for offenses that happen only once as well as for offenses that take place over the course of several years.in the absence of proof to support the allegation that specific acts occurred that would fall under the indictment,the offenses were extraneous and the admissibility of the testimony should be governed by rule.
i join in the majority disposition of ground two,but i respectfully dissent to the court holding on appellant first ground for review i conclude that a portion of the disputed evidence was properly admissible as an extraneous offense under rule b to rebut defensive theories,but i disagree that evidence of the repeated commission of the same offense within the statute of limitations is automatically admissible despite rule general bar against character evidence.
appellant was charged with delivery of cocaine to his daughter,on september.the,who described herself as rebellious,testified that she loved her father very much,in part because he let her do what she wanted.she testified that on september,she was visiting her best friend,jennifer,at the beauty shop where jennifer mother worked,when appellant arrived and whispered in ear that he had some,and i knew what that was.went with appellant to her paternal grandmother house where her father lived.they went to appellant room and he broke up a of cocaine into lines with a razor blade.he then gave four dollar bills,one of which she used to snort the cocaine into her nose.she went back to the beauty salon about ten minutes later and then went home.
unfortunately,mother wanted to borrow some money for gas,so,without thinking,gave her the dollar bill that she had used to snort her father cocaine.mother soon recognized the prior use to which the dollar bill had been put and confronted,accusing friend,jennifer,and jennifer mother of supplying the cocaine.mother wanted to press charges against jennifer and her mother,and was driven down to the police station where she promptly told the police that her father,not jennifer and her mother,was the source of the cocaine.the next day urine tested positive for cocaine residue.
on,appellant lawyer raised two different defensive theories.first,to undermine the state claim that appellant had supplied with cocaine,defense counsel showed that had partaken of drugs with numerous other relatives.second,to show that had a motive to falsely accuse her father,defense counsel suggested that mother resented appellant because he failed to pay child support.
the prosecutor then asked the trial court to allow him to offer testimony,that appellant had given her cocaine some to times before,and to present testimony from friend,valerie,who had been present and seen appellant provide cocaine to on a previous occasion.the state originally offered what it called extraneous offenses as rebuttal of the defense theory.the trial court expressed some concern about admitting this evidence,but agreed to accept briefs from the state and defense before making a final ruling the following morning.
the next day,the trial judge announced that he would admit the state proffered evidence because 
according to the case law that i have reviewed and have been provided to those occasions are within the statute of limitations and therefore are offenses that are described in the indictment.
in the alternative,i do not believe i have to go to the balancing portion of b regarding extraneous offenses.however,if i do,i believe that it is a rebuttal of a defensive theory.it goes to identity,opportunity,possibly even motive.and therefore,if it were to be within the court discretion under b,i would allow it there,also.
as to the testimony of valerie,i will rule that because i have ruled that the testimony of is within the indictment and the charge in charges against the defendant as described in the indictment,that i will allow her to testify as a witness to the crimes as described in the indictment.however,i am not going to allow any testimony as to what i think is clearly an extraneous offense of the alleged supplying of cocaine to her as a minor on an unindicted offense 
appellant objected under rules and,and added that this alleged additional incident is not part of the original indictment and should not be considered for this particular case.
thereafter,testified that she began receiving cocaine from appellant in january,and continued to do so some to times through september.she described how these situations generally occurred,but she was unable to remember any of the dates or times.at one point the state,over objection,asked k if her father ever explain ed to you a different manner in which you might ingest it or take it in,other than snorting it the trial court overruled appellant objection,and responded shoots up.and he told me it was a better rush doing it that way and was better doing it that way,that you was a better rush than doing it through your nose.and so forth.
valerie then testified that one time she and had gone with appellant to a shack behind appellant mother house where appellant pulled out a plastic bag of cocaine,emptied it on a table,and made rails of cocaine,which then snorted.
the state began its closing argument with the following 
if it pleases the court,defense counsel,and ladies and gentlemen.when we began this case we discussed pushing the envelope a little bit.and we discussed that it would be pushing the envelope a little bit in regards to the law,but also in regards to decency.
and what is decency in this case decency in this case is certainly not allowing your child,much less giving your child,on to occasions in a period of time,cocaine 
but in regard to the definitions on page,the term on or about,as we discussed a bit during voir everybody agreed in taking their oath that they would give us a true answer at that time.we understood and every one of you to not necessarily have a problem or a gut problem with the fact that a charge could include anything prior to the indictment,but within the statute of limitations.
and even though the state alleged one particular date,i think that there is sufficient evidence certainly to prove that that was,in fact,the date that kelly ingested cocaine.because the very next day,on the,there was urine submitted that tested positive for cocaine.so we know she ingested it probably within to hours,from the evidence,prior to that time.
but on or about,in fact,allows you to consider any and all of the testimony that you heard basically from january of through september of to convict this defendant of delivery of cocaine not only to a minor,but a minor that is his own child.
thus,the prosecutor explicitly asked the jury to consider the evidence of the other to times said appellant had given her cocaine to prove that he had given her cocaine on september.this looks a lot like forbidden propensity evidence,with the jury asked to find appellant guilty for giving cocaine on september because he was a bad father who had given her cocaine on to other occasions.
based upon this evidence,the jury convicted appellant and,finding an enhancement paragraph true,sentenced him to sixty years imprisonment and a fine.
on appeal,appellant asserted,inter alia,that the trial court erred in admitting testimony concerning the to times appellant had previously supplied her with cocaine,as well as valerie testimony concerning the previous occasion in which she had witnessed appellant give cocaine.he asserted that this testimony was evidence of extraneous offenses barred by rule b.
the court of appeals held that 
an extraneous offense is an act of misconduct that is not shown in the charging instrument.see rankin state.the indictment in this cause alleged that appellant delivered cocaine to on or about september.when the indictment alleges that a crime occurred on or about a particular date,the state may present evidence of the offense being committed at any time prior to the filing of the indictment and within the limitations period.see sledge state.the testimony of which rodriguez complains was not evidence of extraneous offenses,but rather evidence of the repeated commission of the offense alleged in the indictment.rodriguez was entitled to require the state to elect the occurrence on which it sought to rely for conviction,but in the absence of a request for an election there was no error in admitting the challenged testimony.see worley state,dist,pet.ref see also crawford state.
a majority of this court concludes that t he court of appeals applied law set out in our decisions in rankin and sledge and we are not inclined to revisit those decisions.both rankin and sledge were opinions with multiple concurring or dissenting opinions in each they are not exactly terra firma.nonetheless,i too am not inclined to revisit those decisions.i do not think,however,that they stand for the proposition that the state may introduce any and all evidence of the defendant repeated commission of the same offense within the statute of limitations to prove he committed the charged offense.
what do rankin and sledge stand for in rankin,the defendant was charged with possession of a rock of cocaine which a police officer found in his patrol car where the defendant had been sitting the defendant testified that he had indeed possessed a rock of crack cocaine earlier in the day,but that the rock found in the patrol car was not his this court,quite understandably,held that the defendant judicial admission that he had possessed a different rock of crack cocaine on the same day was not a defense to the charged offense,nor was it an extraneous offense the indictment alleged that the defendant possessed cocaine on a particular date and the defendant testified that he did indeed do so on that date.the pertinent legal issue is not whether the defendant possessed rock a or rock b the gravamen of the offense is whether the defendant possessed any cocaine of the particular date.possession of rock b is not a defense to the possession of rock 
in sledge,the defendant was charged with aggravated sexual assault and indecency with a child on a particular date at a hearing,the state told the court that the defendant conduct had been continuous over several years.the defendant asked the state to elect the specific instances on which it would proceed the state accommodated and graphically described the two specific instances upon which it would rely,even though these particular instances did not occur on the precise date set out in the indictment the trial judge,noting that the defendant had not had sufficient notice of those particular incidents,granted the defense a continuance to prepare a defense based on the designated offenses.at trial,the prosecution presented evidence of only those two instances which,as it had acknowledged,did not occur on the date set out in the indictment.they had,however,occurred within the statute of limitations,had been graphically specified for the defendant before trial,and they were events for which the defendant was given additional time to prepare.the defendant complained on appeal that the evidence was legally insufficient because the state failed to prove that the specific offenses occurred on the date alleged in the indictment these incidents were,according to the defendant,unindicted and extraneous offenses because they occurred a year or more before the charged date no,no,said this court the state alleged two specific acts in the indictment,and the state proved two specific acts which conformed to those described in the indictment,and there was no reason to believe that the offenses presented to the grand jury were different from the offenses proven at trial.
i can not understand how the result and reasoning in rankin and sledge inexorably lead to today holding that any and all evidence of the repeated commission of the charged offense is admissible to prove the charged offense.does rankin really stand for the proposition that the state could have offered evidence of any rocks of cocaine that the defendant had ever possessed within the statute of limitations to prove that he had possessed the rock of cocaine left in the patrol car on march,does sledge really stand for the proposition that the state could have offered any and all evidence of the defendant prior molestations of the child to prove that he molested her on the charged occasion certainly the state did not do so in those cases.nor did this court ever suggest in those opinions that its reasoning or result should lead to the admission of all offenses that occur within the statute of limitations,as long as they are the repeated commission of the charged offense.
invoking the spirit of our predecessors,color me amazed.neither rankin nor sledge deal with the relevancy or admissibility of evidence.those cases concerned the sufficiency of evidence to prove the specific allegations in the indictment.
i do not know whether the state or the defense will benefit the most from the court holding in this case but both the law and policy concerning the admissibility of extraneous offenses have suffered a grievous blow.
the principle that a man may not be convicted of this crime because he has committed the same or similar crimes in the past has been a bedrock principle of the system of justice for centuries of course,it is equally well established that this same evidence of prior crimes or bad acts may be admissible if relevant for some purpose other than character conformity or propensity the key to admissibility is the proponent explanation of precisely how the proffered evidence is probative of a fact of consequence in this case,the state and the trial judge articulated two bases for admitting the evidence of appellant prior acts of supplying with cocaine appellant acts occurred within the statute of limitations,and therefore they are ipso facto admissible because they are the repeated commission of the charged offense and these acts were admissible to rebut a defensive theory.i am unaware of any doctrine that makes evidence of the repeated commission of the charged offense admissible under rule simply because it occurred within the statute of limitations.
in this case,however,the defense did raise issues concerning both the identity of the person who supplied with cocaine and whether mother and hence had a motive to falsely accuse appellant of such conduct.these are both legitimate purposes to admit evidence of prior bad acts under rule b testimony by an independent witness,valerie,concerning a single prior occasion,in which appellant supplied cocaine to his daughter in precisely the same way that he purportedly gave her cocaine on the charged occasion,is some proof of appellant identity as the person who supplied her with cocaine on september,and that same evidence tends to rebut appellant defensive theory that testimony was fabricated because her mother was angry at appellant.therefore,i conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence of this one extraneous offense to rebut the defensive theories.i can find no such legitimate p
