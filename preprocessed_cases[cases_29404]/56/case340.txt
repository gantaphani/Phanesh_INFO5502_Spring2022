after receiving father notice of appeal from the second order,we requested letter briefs from the parties as to whether the first appeal was moot and consolidated the appeals on our own motion and.having read and considered those briefs,we conclude that the appeal in case no.is not moot because the referee original order terminating parental rights was final and conclusive.we also conclude that because all acts done by the referee after issuing that order were void for lack of jurisdiction,the appeal in case no.must be dismissed.
on the merits,the parents contend that the matter must be remanded due to failure of compliance with the indian child welfare act icwa et.mother,joined by father,also contends that the juvenile court abused its discretion by denying mother request for placement of the minor with the maternal grandmother.respondent sacramento county department of health and human services the department disputes both contentions and asserts that the disentitlement doctrine bars the parents appeals because they actively concealed the minor whereabouts for over a year.
we conclude the disentitlement doctrine does not apply assuming mother has standing to attack the denial of placement with the maternal grandmother,the court did not err by denying that placement and a limited icwa remand is required.we reverse in case no.for further proceedings limited to icwa and dismiss father appeal in case no.

father had been booked and arrested on a warrant on october,and was to be released on october.
calworks staff stated that mother had an active case,was receiving aid for the minor and,and had been seen with the minor at the office the previous month.
a protective warrant was issued.a detention report,filed thereafter on october,contained additional information.father was released from custody but remained on informal probation until september.the social worker attempted twice on october,to execute the warrant for the minor at the residence where father lived with the paternal grandmother,patricia the home appeared closed up,and notices were left there for the parents.on october,the social worker attempted to execute the warrant at the home of the maternal grandmother,barbara again,the home appeared closed up,and a notice was left for mother inside the screen door.up until october,the social worker had been in emergency telephone contact with mother mother would not provide an address,saying she was homeless and was going to different hotels.on and after october,the social worker left multiple messages for mother on her cell phone informing her of the october,court date no calls were returned.there were no relatives to consider for placement barbara home had not passed a kinship evaluation,and patricia could not care for the minor due to poor health.
after the initial hearing on october,the matter was repeatedly continued because the minor had not been located.on november,the juvenile court removed the matter from calendar but informed the parents that the protective custody warrant for the minor remained in effect.
on april,the minor was found in the custody of the parents,who claimed they had not known there was a warrant out on the minor and had thought the case was closed.the department filed an amended section petition,which added the allegations that mother reunification services as to,and the parents rights as to the minor three siblings,had been terminated.
father filed a judicial council form icwa claiming cherokee heritage.mother denied indian ancestry.
at the initial hearing on april,the juvenile court found father was the minor presumed father and ordered him to complete the indian ancestry questionnaire or supplemental questionnaire and return it to the department within two days.
on april,the juvenile court ordered the minor detained.the court ordered father to complete and return the supplemental questionnaire today.
on april,icwa paralegal tony ringor declared that because father had not responded to any attempts to contact him,the three cherokee tribes had been sent only the limited information available to ringor as to the parents ancestry the names,addresses,and birth dates of the paternal and maternal grandmothers.
the department report recommended placement of the minor outside the home and bypassing services to the parents mother pursuant to,subd.b,father pursuant to,subd.b only.
the report stated that the parents continued to claim they had been unaware there was a warrant out for the minor.they denied all allegations of current substance abuse and domestic violence.
if the minor was not returned to the parents,mother wanted her placed with the maternal grandmother,barbara j.the maternal grandmother wanted placement,and father and other members of the family would support it.the kinship unit had approved the maternal grandmother home for placement as of april.
the maternal grandmother,a widow with four children and eight grandchildren,had recently retired after years at kaiser permanente.she lived alone in a,home.she could use the maternal aunt to help with childcare if needed.she was diabetic but indicated the condition was under control.she was willing to adopt the minor or to serve as her legal guardian.
the social worker had concerns about this proposed placement.first,the maternal grandmother did not call cps after learning that cps was looking for the minor,apparently because she believed mother story that the case was closed the maternal grandmother said she had no control over mother.second,the maternal grandmother had kicked out of her home she had failed a kinship assessment as to him and had never been assessed as to the minor siblings.third,her diabetes might not be under control the fire department was called to the maternal grandmother home on february,in response to a report that she was incoherent and might be having a diabetic episode.
on may,icwa paralegal ringor declared that one of the three cherokee tribes had returned a negative response and the other two had not yet responded.
on the same date,the juvenile court held a prejurisdictional status conference but continued it because father was allegedly in the hospital noting that the department had not yet received father supplemental questionnaire,the court reordered him to comply with the prior order to complete and return the questionnaire.the court ordered the department to analyze whether services should be denied to the parents under section,subdivision b 
at the rescheduled prejurisdictional status conference on may,the juvenile court asked father counsel whether the information in judicial council form icwa the form sent to the tribes was complete and accurate.counsel said yes.counsel also said,as to father the information that appears on the icwa sic is correct.
father counsel said father had completed the supplemental questionnaire and placed it in the mailbox downstairs.the court observed that that mailbox was for the use of court staff only,so anything placed there would not have reached the department.
the court set an icwa compliance hearing for july.
the parents requested placement with the maternal grandmother.the court tentatively denied the request but promised to revisit the issue.the court expressed concern that the maternal grandmother had failed a kinship screening as to and that emergency services had been called to her home in february.the court also noted that because it needed to consider concurrent planning efforts,the maternal grandmother should undergo an adoption home study as soon as possible.
on may,icwa paralegal ringor declared that the second of the three cherokee tribes had returned a negative response the third had not yet responded.
the department filed an addendum recommending placement of the minor with the maternal grandmother.her home had not been approved as to because father was living there,but he had since left.
at the pretrial conference on may,the juvenile court noted that that as of the day before,the icwa paralegal still had not received father supplemental questionnaire.
the court stated it was still concerned as to whether placement with the maternal grandmother was consistent with the best interest of the minor,given the need to consider concurrent planning.the court was also concerned about the potential protection issues in that there was evidence a social worker had tried to serve the protective custody warrant at the maternal grandmother home,yet she now claimed she did not know cps was looking for the minor.the court reserved further consideration of this issue for the hearing.
the contested hearing took place on june.
father testified that the parents did not realize there was a warrant out for the minor because her case came up together with the ongoing cases of her siblings,on which the parents were focused.when they heard that the minor case was removed from calendar,they concluded it had been dropped.the minor was living with an aunt in the bay area for most of the time she was supposedly missing.
father claimed he and mother had no relationship now.he was homeless but looking for housing,and had been employed for three weeks.he claimed he was doing visitation and services insofar as he had been given them.he denied domestic violence or current substance abuse by himself or mother.placement with the maternal grandmother was acceptable to him.
mother counsel and the minor counsel also supported placement with the maternal grandmother.
the juvenile court bypassed reunification services to mother under the provisions of section,subdivision b,and and to father under section,subdivision b,and,and set a section hearing on august.
the court again denied placement with the maternal grandmother but noted,the department can continue to assess this and t he grandmother is certainly free to get an adoption home study.the court acknowledged the statutory preference for relative placement,but found that it would not be in the minor best interest for the following reasons the maternal grandmother knew of the warrant for the minor and frustrated its execution,which also put her credibility in question when the maternal grandmother had care of,things had gone wrong the maternal grandmother state of health was still undetermined and given the impending section hearing,preferential consideration must go to a home that could adopt the minor.
the icwa paralegal filed an informational memorandum on july,which stated that the last of the cherokee tribes had returned a negative response.
at a combined icwa compliance hearing and section status review hearing on july,the juvenile court found the minor was not an indian child.
at a placement hearing on july,the juvenile court observed that the department was now pursuing placement in the home of one of the minor siblings who had been adopted.county counsel said the minor had not yet been placed there because the home did not currently qualify as an adoptive home the prospective foster parents had given up their license after adopting the minor sibling or an nrefm nonrelative extended family member placement the department was investigating how to get approval for the placement.the minor counsel supported the department recommendation.father and mother counsel objected but did not offer argument or propose alternatives.
noting that the maternal grandmother was present,the court invited her to talk to the court.the maternal grandmother stated 
a cps investigative social worker came to the maternal grandmother home before the minor was detained but did not mention that she had a warrant for the minor.she said only that she was there to look in on the well care sic of baby 
allegations that the maternal grandmother beat him and that she was a drug addict were false.nevertheless,even though he had lied about her,she loved him and still took care of him.
her diabetes was not a problem.her doctor had given her a bill of health.
she loved all of her grandchildren and fought for the chance to take care of them being retired,she could easily take care of the minor.it was painful to her that all of mother children had been taken away.
the juvenile court replied that the maternal grandmother claim that the cps social worker had not mentioned a warrant conflicted with the social worker statement that she had been there attempting to execute a warrant,which is part of an investigative social worker job.the court was concerned about the willingness to cooperate with cps,with the court,and ensure that the baby is kept safe from her parents.the social worker statement created an inference that the maternal grandmother had been less than cooperative in a case where the minor was absent from the court jurisdiction with an outstanding protective custody warrant for a very considerable period of time.
statements indicated that he might have suffered inappropriate corporal punishment from several relatives,including the maternal grandmother,and that there was a lack of appropriate care in the home.
it mattered that law enforcement had been called to the maternal grandmother home due to concerns about her health because the minor was in need of a forever home now.if the court placed the minor with the maternal grandmother,it would take a year or so to determine whether the minor could stabilize there and whether the concerns about the maternal grandmother health and allegations were unfounded.but the minor had already waited a long time for stability and permanence.
for all of these reasons,it was in the minor best interest to proceed with placement in a home that did not have the difficulties apparent in the maternal grandmother home.
the department section report,filed august,recommended termination of parental rights and adoption.the minor was generally adoptable.the department still planned to place her with her adopted sibling once the caretak
