the issue in this case is whether a video of an arrest captured by a patrol car dashboard camera is a confidential personnel record under penal code sections or on the record before us,the answer is no.we conclude the juvenile court properly determined the arrest video is not a personnel record protected by the pitchess statutes.see pitchess superior court cal d pitchess.we therefore affirm the court order requiring the city of eureka city to release a portion of the video to local reporter and real party in interest,thadeus greenson.
factual and procedural background 
arrest,charges,and internal affairs investigation 
in december,eureka police sergeant adam laird and other eureka police officers arrested the minor.sergeant laird chased the minor,who was pushed to the ground,fell to the ground,or just gave up and laid on the ground.another police officer arrived in his patrol vehicle with its video equipment activated.the patrol car mobile audio video mav recording system produced several videos of the arrest the prosecution filed a welfare and institutions code section petition against the minor,but later withdrew it.
a citizen lodged a complaint regarding the officers handling of the minor and the eureka police department conducted an internal affairs investigation.the prosecution charged sergeant laird with misdemeanor assault by a police officer without lawful necessity and with making a false report.both the prosecution and defense hired experts to review the evidence against sergeant laird.after reviewing the evidence including the arrest video the experts determined sergeant laird did not use excessive force during the arrest.the prosecution dismissed the charges against sergeant laird in january.
greenson request for disclosure of the arrest video 
in july and january,greenson wrote articles in two local newspapers about the arrest and subsequent litigation.in august,greenson filed a california public records act code,et request with the city seeking disclosure of the arrest video.the city denied the request,citing discretionary exemptions for personnel records and investigative files.
in november,greenson filed a request for disclosure form of the arrest video pursuant to welfare and institutions code section,which authorizes public disclosure of confidential juvenile records under limited circumstances.greenson averred the video formed the basis for the charges against sergeant laird,but the prosecution later dismissed the charges with little,if any,explanation.sergeant laird defense was an allegation that he been singled out for arrest by the police department for exercising his first amendment free speech rights and that the police department deliberately withheld exculpatory evidence from prosecutors.according to greenson,the public has a right to know exactly what happened during the minor arrest to evaluate the performance of both its police officers and prosecutors.the public only avenue to that knowledge,and the only thing that will allow the public to make that evaluation,is the video of the arrest.
the humboldt county probation department the county objected,claiming greenson failed to demonstrate good cause for disclosure under welfare and institutions code section.as the county explained,p ublic dissemination of the video is not necessary to facilitate public scrutiny of sergeant laird conduct because greenson had already obtained court records and other public documents describing the events depicted by the video and ha d previously published details of the incident under these circumstances,release of the video would serve only to prejudice the minor by exposing his image,his actions,and his juvenile record to widespread public scrutiny.the county also noted greenson had not served the police department with the disclosure request.the city also urged the court to deny greenson request.it argued the video was a police officer personnel record and d isclosure would require a successful pitchess m otion,which greenson had not filed.the city also claimed disclosing the video could be detrimental to the minor under welfare and institutions code section.
at a late january hearing,the court directed greenson to serve the police department and the city with the disclosure request and continued the matter to late february.before the february hearing,greenson filed a reply offering additional information about the criminal case against sergeant laird and claiming the case called into question the conduct of the entire police department.according to greenson,the public had a right to evaluate the conduct of its officers and prosecutors and needed to know why criminal charges were filed against sergeant laird when experts determined his use of force was justified.greenson also argued releasing the arrest video would not harm the minor,because he did not oppose disclosure and because the arrest had been widely reported on.finally,greenson claimed the video was not a personnel record protected by the pitchess statutes.
at a february hearing,the minor waive d his right to confidentiality of the arrest video and consented to disclosure.the county and the city,however,continued to oppose the video release.as relevant here,the city argued the police department had conducted an internal affairs investigation and the video was part of that investigation and could not be released without a successful pitchess motion.according to the city,a pitchess motion could not be filed because t here are no cases pending,no charges have been filed.nothing is pending at this point.the court indicated its inclination to review the video in camera and to determine whether there was a compelling need for the public to have that information.
pursuant to the court order,the county provided the court with an unedited version of the arrest captured by the mav units from the various patrol units involved.the court reviewed the videos in camera.in a may written order,the court ordered disclosure of the arrest video.it concluded the video was not a confidential police personnel record protected by the pitchess statutes,explaining the arrest was both the subject of a delinquency investigation and potentially actions which could result in confidential internal personnel proceedings.greenson is not requesting what might otherwise be the subject of a pitchess type motion such as confidential citizen complaints and the resulting investigation or outcomes of those investigations.he is requesting only that information which would form the basis of the original criminal complaint against sergeant laird or delinquency proceedings against the minor.
as required by welfare and institutions code section,the court considered the public interest in disclosure,including the interest of transparency of juvenile court proceedings,and the minor consent to disclosure.the court ordered the city to release the video pursuant to a protective order removing the minor name and redacting or blurring his identifying features to conceal his identity.finally,the court concluded the remainder of the mav videos were redundant or irrelevant and declined to disclose them it set a june hearing to review the redacted video.
the day before the june hearing,the city filed writ petition seeking to vacate the court may ruling.city of eureka superior court.this court denied the city writ petition.the city appealed from the court may order.
