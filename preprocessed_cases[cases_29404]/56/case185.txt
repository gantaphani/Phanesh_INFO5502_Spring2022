welfare and institutions code section et sets forth procedures that govern the extended detention of dangerous persons.section originally provided,in part,that persons under the control of the department of youth authority could be civilly committed to its control at the time they would otherwise be discharged by statute if they would be physically dangerous to the public because of a mental or physical deficiency,disorder,or abnormality.stats,ch.in order to preserve the extended detention scheme constitutionality,we interpreted the extended detention scheme to require a finding that the person mental deficiency,disorder,or abnormality causes serious difficulty in controlling behavior.in re howard cal th,d,howard,italics added.here we consider defendant claim that his civil commitment under section is unconstitutional because the petition did not allege,and the trial court did not specifically find,a serious and risk that he would reoffend if not committed.
we conclude the current extended detention scheme set forth in section et satisfies the due process and equal protection clauses of our state and federal constitutions.the scheme requirements that a person is physically dangerous to the public because of his or her mental or physical deficiency,disorder,or abnormality and that the mental or physical deficiency,disorder,or abnormality causes the individual to have serious difficulty controlling his or her dangerous behavior adequately limit the scheme applicability to youthful offenders whose mental deficiency,disorder,or abnormality causes them to be physically dangerous to the public if not recommitted.howard,supra,cal th at,d,see.a further finding that an inability to control behavior results in a serious and risk of reoffense is not required to preserve the scheme constitutionality.furthermore,although the adult civil commitment statutes for sexually violent predators svp and for mentally disordered offenders mdo have different limitations on the types of dangerous behavior that fall within their purview than the extended detention scheme challenged here,there is no equal protection violation because persons committed under section are not similarly situated to svp and mdo in several significant respects.we therefore affirm the judgment of the court of appeal 
factual and procedural background 
when defendant lemanuel was,the juvenile court adjudged him to be a ward of the court based on his admission that he sodomized his cousin.two years later,the court sustained a second allegation that defendant made a false crime report alleging that his roommate had raped him.after defendant violated his probation,the court committed him to the youth authority for a maximum term of three years and two months.before the term expired,the court extended defendant youth authority commitment for two years pursuant to section.before that extension expired,the district attorney filed a second section petition to further extend defendant civil confinement.
using the language of the statute as it then read,the second petition alleged,in pertinent part,that defendant,if discharged from the youth authority,would be physically dangerous to the public because of his mental deficiency,disorder,or abnormality 
defendant waived his right to a jury on the second petition.the trial court heard testimony from defendant youth authority psychologist,marcia asgarian.the court also received into evidence by stipulation the probable cause hearing testimony of herbert leiderman,a youth authority consulting psychiatrist who conducted a section evaluation of defendant.
leiderman concluded that defendant suffers from a mental disorder known as reactive attachment disorder as a result,defendant has difficulty in forming social relationships and sees individuals as objects rather than as sentient human beings.leiderman also concluded that defendant suffered from pedophilia.leiderman characterized defendant as an adventitious predator who is attracted to youngsters,boys particularly.the psychiatrist added that whenever circumstances permit,defendant takes advantage of youngsters who are mentally weaker and less able to defend themselves.leiderman noted that defendant lacks cognitive skills for which could enable him to develop maneuvers and thus avoid potentially dangerous situations.leiderman added that defendant admitted engaging in several incidents in the youth authority involving impermissible sexual activities with other wards that,if caught,would have been cited.leiderman mentioned that,although defendant described his several sexual misconduct incidents as consensual,defendant was beginning to rethink what consensual behavior is and appeared receptive to a possible treatment program in the youth authority to work on this issue.leiderman concluded,however,that defendant reactive attachment disorder causes him to pose a danger to the community.
asgarian worked with defendant in a youth authority group home program designed to help rehabilitate sex offenders through group psychotherapy.she testified that defendant initially seemed motivated and actively participated in weekly group therapy.however,after about eight months,defendant told asgarian that he did want to participate any more.defendant often did not attend the therapy sessions when he came to the group,he would shut down,hide his face under his jacket,and refuse to talk.before he shut down completely,defendant indicated that he would reoffend if he did receive appropriate treatment.asgarian believed defendant did not make any significant progress towards his sex offending issues during the treatment period from the late fall of to early.
the court granted the petition,finding beyond a reasonable doubt that testimony and evidence presented at the section hearing established that defendant would be a physical danger to the public by virtue of a mental deficiency,disorder,or abnormality and that he has a serious difficulty in controlling his behavior within the meaning of kansas crane,d.the court extended defendant commitment for an additional two years.the court of appeal affirmed the granting of the section petition.we granted defendant petition for review.
ii.discussion 
defendant contends section violates his right to due process of law because it does not expressly require an allegation in the petition,and a finding by the trier of fact,that there was a serious and risk that he would reoffend if not committed.
background 
at the time of defendant trial,an extended detention under section required only one finding that a person would be physically dangerous to the public because of a mental deficiency,disorder,or abnormality stats,ch.as noted above,in order to preserve the statute constitutionality,we interpreted section to require a second finding that a mental deficiency,disorder,or abnormality causes serious difficulty in controlling the person dangerous behavior.howard,supra,cal th at,d.we then held that the finding of serious difficulty in controlling dangerous behavior must be alleged in the petition for extended commitment,and demonstrated at the probable cause hearing and any ensuing trial.howard,supra,at,d.
the section petition here did not allege that defendant had serious difficulty in controlling his dangerous behavior.however,the trial court made an explicit finding,beyond a reasonable doubt,to that though the statute did not yet expressly require such a finding 
in resolving the issue whether due process required section to include an additional finding of serious difficulty in controlling a person dangerous behavior,we analyzed two decisions of the united states supreme court involving civil commitments of sexually violent predators kansas hendricks,d hendricks kansas crane,supra,d crane and two of our own decisions interpreting and applying the high court decisions to california svp law et hubbart superior court cal th,d,hubbart people williams cal th,d,williams.in so doing,we concluded that the constitutional principles set forth in those cases apply to all civil commitment schemes,including the extended detention scheme at issue here.howard,supra,cal th at,d.we reiterate here that,because civil commitment for any purpose constitutes a significant deprivation of liberty that requires due process protection addington texas,d howard,supra,cal th at,d,the extended detention civil commitment procedures under section et must comport with due process.
we summarize the holdings in hendricks,crane,hubbart,and williams below before addressing whether an explicit,separate serious and risk of reoffense finding is constitutionally required for a section extended detention civil commitment.
in hendricks,the high court held that the challenged kansas svp civil commitment law satisfied due process because the defendant admitted lack of volitional control,coupled with a prediction of future dangerousness,adequately distinguishe d him from other dangerous persons who are perhaps more properly dealt with exclusively through criminal proceedings.hendricks,supra,at.in so holding,the court noted that it previously had sustained civil commitment statutes when they have coupled proof of dangerousness with the proof of some additional factor,such as mental illness or mental abnormality citations,and it clarified that,for an involuntary civil commitment,due process requires a showing of dangerousness as well as a showing of a mental disorder linked to a difficulty of controlling dangerous behavior,rather than a finding of dangerousness,standing alone.hendricks,supra,at.
in hubbart,we upheld our state svp law,which allows for a civil commitment of a person who has been convicted of a sexually violent offense if certain conditions are met,including that the person has a diagnosed mental disorder that makes the person a danger to the health and safety of others in that it is likely that he or she will engage in sexually violent criminal behavior,subd.a.hubbart,supra,cal th at,d.in deciding that our svp law satisfied due process requirements,we relied on hendricks.we reasoned that our svp law establishes the requisite connection between impaired volitional control and the danger posed to the public because it requires a finding of a mental disorder resulting in dangerousness and links that finding to a finding that the mental disorder caused the inability to control dangerous sexual behavior.hubbart,at,d.
in crane,the united states supreme court reconsidered the kansas svp law and explained that its decision in hendricks had set forth no requirement of total or complete lack of control.crane,supra,at.the court explained that,to satisfy due process,i t is enough to say that there must be proof of serious difficulty in controlling behavior that,when viewed in light of such features of the case as the nature of the psychiatric diagnosis,and the severity of the mental abnormality itself,must be sufficient to distinguish the dangerous sexual offender whose serious mental illness,abnormality,or disorder subjects him to civil commitment from the dangerous but typical recidivist convicted in an ordinary criminal case.citations.crane,supra,at.
in williams,we interpreted crane as confirming the principle set forth in hendricks that a constitutional civil commitment scheme must link future dangerousness to a mental abnormality that impairs behavioral control,while making clear that the impairment need only be serious,not absolute.williams,supra,cal th at,d.we concluded that a commitment rendered under the plain language of the sexually violent predator act svpa necessarily encompasses a determination of serious difficulty in controlling one criminal sexual violence id.at,d,as required by crane,because the svpa requires a diagnosed mental disorder affecting the person emotional or volitional capacity that predisposes the person to commit sex crimes in a menacing degree,subd.c.williams,supra,at,d.
due process 
we now consider whether defendant civil commitment under section violates his constitutional right to due process of law because the statute does not expressly require an allegation in the petition,and a finding by the trier of fact,that there was a serious and risk that he would reoffend if not committed.
one key condition for an svp determination in california is that there is a diagnosed mental disorder that makes the person a danger to the health and safety of others in that it is likely that he or she will engage in sexually violent criminal behavior,subd.a,italics added.we agree with the court of appeal in the present case that the italicized phrase modifies the clause,that makes the person a danger to the health and safety of others,and a person thus is a danger for svp purposes in that it is likely he would reoffend,commit another sexually violent offense,subd.a,and,therefore,the likelihood of reoffending is the very crux of the person dangerousness to the public in the context of an svp determination under section et.
our recent cases analyzing the meaning of the term likely in the context of california svp law shed light on whether an explicit,separate finding of a serious and risk of reoffending is constitutionally required in order to extend defendant detention under section.
in people superior court ghilotti cal th,d,ghilotti,we considered the meaning of the term likely in section,subdivision d,which governs the initiation of svp proceedings.that section states that a prosecutor may not file an svp petition unless two mental health professionals conclude that the potential svp has a diagnosed mental disorder so that he or she is likely to engage in acts of sexual violence without appropriate treatment and custody,subd.d,italics added.
we decided that,in this context,the term likely does not mean more likely than not and therefore does not require a prediction of a greater than percent chance of reoffending.ghilotti,supra,cal th at,d.we ruled that an evaluator must conclude that the person is likely to reoffend if,because of a current mental disorder which makes it difficult or impossible to restrain violent sexual behavior,the person presents a substantial danger,that is,a serious and risk,that he or she will commit such crimes if free in the community.id.at,d.
citing hubbart and hendricks,we observed that our svp law emphasizes the themes common to valid civil commitment statutes,a current mental condition or disorder that makes it difficult or impossible to control volitional behavior and predisposes the person to inflict harm on himself or others,thus producing dangerousness measured by a high risk or threat of further injurious acts if the person is not confined.citations.ghilotti,supra,cal th at,d.we concluded that our svp law satisfies due process because it is limited in scope to the confinement and treatment of persons who have already been convicted of violent sex offenses,and who,as the result of current mental disorders that make it difficult or impossible to control their violent sexual impulses,represent a substantial danger of committing similar new crimes citations ghilotti,supra,cal th at,d.
in cooley superior court cal th,d,cooley,we relied on ghilotti in construing the word likely to mean that a potential svp poses a serious and risk of reoffending in the context of section,subdivision a.cooley,supra,cal th at,d.section,subdivision a,requires a finding of probable cause that the person named in the svp petition is likely to engage in sexually violent predatory criminal behavior upon release.italics added.
in people roberge cal th,d,roberge,we analyzed the word likely in the context of section,subdivision a,which sets forth as a condition for an svp determination that a person has a diagnosed mental disorder that makes the person a danger to the health and safety of others in that it is likely that he or she will engage in sexually violent criminal behavior.italics added.relying on both ghilotti and cooley,we construed likely in this context to mean a substantial danger,that is,a serious and risk,of reoffending.roberge,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.
the serious and risk language derives from our decisions interpreting california svp law.those decisions,and roberge in particular,reveal that a serious and risk of reoffending is merely another way of referring to the necessary finding of future dangerousness in the context of t
