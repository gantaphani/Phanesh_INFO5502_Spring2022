in an august,addendum report,the social worker made the same recommendations as she had in the previous report.she stated that father had not addressed the underlying issue of substance abuse but,in her assessment,father had made more of an effort to have contact with by his own admission,he will continue to use alcohol though he is fully aware of his alcoholism and his tendencies to be violent,blackout,to have bad judgment and to lack control when he is under the influence.
in a september,addendum report,the social worker recommendations with regard to the department section petition were unchanged.as to family maintenance review,however,the social worker now recommended continued family maintenance services for mother and supervised visitation for father.
the addendum report reiterated that father was no longer drug testing.father had attended pathway outpatient substance abuse services sporadically for months,and was discharged in june,due to continued in the program and continued use of marijuana and alcohol.father had failed to attend three meetings per week and obtain a sponsor.the report repeated that,in june,father told the social worker that he planned to continue to drink alcohol and use marijuana.

the department made the social worker available for at the september,hearing.the social worker indicated father had been smoking marijuana throughout the case.up until about march,father had been doing some of his case plan.recently,however,father was not doing any services.
the social worker acknowledged that,shortly before the family maintenance services,father had a very violent blackout drunk episode in the household.but she acknowledged that,to her knowledge,he had not had any subsequent drunken episodes of violence and had not ever returned from a visit uncared for.the social worker indicated that,during their visits,father played with,was warm toward father,and they read together.

as to visits with father,the paternal grandmother had been supervising them.if father had unsupervised contact with,the child was at risk because of father untreated alcoholism,his ongoing substance abuse,and father behaviors,such as violence,blackouts,and impatience.she acknowledged that when this case began and father also had family maintenance,father had an untreated drinking problem.
consistent with her written reports,the social worker testified that,in june,father told her that he would continue to drink and use marijuana.father did not finish the pathway program because he was discharged for failing to abstain from alcohol and marijuana.in her opinion,father was not exercising good judgment in choosing to drink.

father challenges the september,order,arguing that there was no relevant change in circumstances after the january,disposition to support modification.he asserts that,at the time of disposition,he was an admitted alcoholic,he had not yet begun treatment,he was only sporadically attending aa meetings and he had no sponsor,he was using marijuana,and he was sporadically drug testing.father further argues that there had been a fairly recent domestic violence incident between parents september,at the time of disposition but there was no recent incident of domestic violence when the court ruled on the section petition.father also maintains that the court removal findings were not supported by substantial evidence,removal was unnecessary because he was no longer living with mother and,and the court failed to consider a less drastic alternative than removal.the department asserts that it made the necessary showing and the september,order should be affirmed.
we agree that the court abused its discretion by making removal findings.we first observe that the section petition did not seek to remove from father physical custody pursuant to section,subdivision c.rather,it asked the court to order t hat the child be removed from family maintenance with the father and that the child remain in family maintenance with the mother and that father be provided supervised visitation with 
secondly,although the parents retained custody subject to the department supervision at disposition,the evidence established that the parents themselves had subsequently made custodial changes and were no longer sharing physical custody of.in response to this court request for supplemental briefing,the parties agree that,after father moved out of the home where he had lived with and mother,the existing de facto arrangement between parents was that resided full time with mother under her supervision and father had visitation.they also agree that,after father moved out of the home where he lived with and mother,was not in father care for any substantial period amounting to physical custody.thus,was not actually in father physical custody when the court made the removal findings.
the evidence was insufficient to support findings that t here is or would be a substantial danger to the physical health,safety,protection,or physical or emotional of the minor if the minor were returned home and there are no reasonable means of protecting the minor without removal,subd.c,italics added.as indicated,the statute specifies that removing an offending parent or guardian from the home may under the particular circumstances constitute a reasonable means to protect the minor without removing a child from a parent physical custody,subd.c a.here,father had already removed himself from the home.there was no evidence that father intended to move back into the home where resided with mother or that father was not abiding by mother limits on his visitation.although the social worker testified that would be at risk if father had unsupervised contact with because of father untreated alcoholism,his ongoing substance abuse,and his past conduct,in the recent months preceding the hearing mother had not allowed father to have unsupervised visits and father had been participating in supervised visits.the september,addendum report indicated that father visits have
