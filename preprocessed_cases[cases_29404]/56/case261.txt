introduction 
shortly after his birth in,the county of san diego health and human services agency the agency placed a dependent child named with appellant rita marshall.marshall cared for for two and a half years and began the process of adopting him.however,in june,the agency commenced proceedings that led to removal from marshall care and his placement in another home for adoption.
marshall filed this action against the county of san diego the county and several county social workers who were involved in the proceedings that led to removal.in the causes of action relevant to this appeal,marshall brought two claims pursuant to united states code section hereafter section against the social workers in which she claimed that the social workers violated her right to due process in removing without providing her adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard,and in making deliberately false statements to the trial court that led to the removal.marshall also brought a section claim against the county,alleging that the social workers violated her constitutional rights pursuant to a county custom or policy.
in summary judgment proceedings,the trial court concluded that the social workers were entitled to qualified immunity with respect to marshall claims against them because there was no evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that the social workers had violated marshall clearly established constitutional rights.carroll carman,caroll.a government official sued under is entitled to qualified immunity unless the official violated a statutory or constitutional right that was clearly established at the time of the challenged conduct.the court also concluded that the county was entitled to judgment as a matter of law with respect to marshall section claim.
on appeal,marshall contends that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment for the county and the social workers.with respect to marshall claims based on the social workers having purportedly made deliberately false statements to the trial court,we conclude that marshall had a clearly established constitutional right not to have placement terminated based on a social worker statement that was either deliberately false or made with reckless disregard for its truth.however,we further conclude that the social workers are entitled to qualified immunity with respect to marshall claims premised on this theory of liability because there is no evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that that placement with marshall was terminated based on statements that were either deliberately false or made with reckless disregard for their truth.we also reject the remainder of marshall other claims,and affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural backgrounda.factual.is placed in marshall care 
was born on november.within days of his birth,the trial court declared a dependent of the court and the agency placed him with marshall.
in june,marshall informed the agency that she wanted to adopt throughout his placement with marshall,respondent noreen harmelink,the primary social worker assigned to,reported to the trial court that was doing well in marshall home.
marshall initiates the adoption process for 
the court terminated the parental rights of birth parents in may,and,in november,entered an order setting adoption as permanent plan.in december,the agency received forms from marshall requesting to initiate the adoption process for j.
agency adoptions applicant worker elizabeth edwards met with marshall in march to begin the adoption homestudy process.edwards gave marshall forms to fill out and return,including the formal application to adopt form.marshall never returned the forms.
the agency seeks to remove from marshall home 
on june,respondent linda johanesen,the agency social worker for two other children placed in marshall home,and,verbally informed marshall that the agency was planning to remove,and from marshall home.on june,marshall filed an objection to the agency proposal to remove with the trial court marshall also requested that the court formally designate her as prospective adoptive parent.
johanesen and her supervisor,respondent robin thompson,filed an ex parte application on june,to remove from marshall home the june ex parte application stated in relevant part 
the agency received two recent cps child protective services referrals on the marshall home for physical discipline.currently,there are total referrals and have been holds placed on this home.this home is currently on hold.marshall has not complied with requests for the adoptive homestudy and her homestudy has been closed as unapproved.
recent psychological evaluations recently performed on two other children in this home recommend that the caregiver sic received sic psychoeducation to develop appropriate discipline strategies.it is the agency position that marshall will not comply with the recommendation since she has not complied with the requirements for the adoptive homestudy.attached is the addendum report for and who also reside in this home the agency is asking to remove these children also.marshall has been given the proper statutory notice.marshall has made no attempt to contest the children removal.
that same day,june,the trial court granted the application and vacated placement with marshall,effective that day 
the july hearing 
the trial court held a hearing on july on marshall objection to the removal and request to be designated prospective adoptive parent.just before the hearing began,harmelink gave marshall a copy of a july addendum report that outlined the reasons for the agency request that the court reaffirm its decision to vacate placement with marshall.
in the report,in support of its removal recommendation,the agency noted that there had been a recent referral alleging physical abuse on a child in marshall home,and that there had been different child abuse referrals since,which had resulted in different holds on marshall home.the report also stated that marshall typically maintains six foster children in her care,that the children were often young and with special needs,and that marshall works full time.the report stated that marshall appeared to be stretched beyond her capability to be physically and emotionally available to the children in the manner one would anticipate from an adopting caregiver.the agency also noted that and had recently undergone psychological evaluations,and that the psychologist had expressed concerns regarding the care these children have received in marshall home.the report also stated that marshall had failed to follow through with the adoptive homestudy process with j.
the trial court briefly adjourned the hearing in order to give marshall time to read the addendum report.after the brief recess,the court resumed the hearing.at the conclusion of the hearing,the court entered an order overruling marshall objection to the removal.the court also rejected marshall request to be designated prospective adoptive parent.
additional proceedings 
marshall filed a writ petition in this court seeking review of the july order.while marshall writ petition was pending,the agency removed from marshall home and placed him in a new home.
on october,this court issued an opinion vacating the trial court july order.rita superior court,nonpub.opn.rita i.the court concluded that marshall was not provided sufficient notice that would be removed and marshall would not be approved to adopt him ibid,and ordered that marshall be provided a new hearing where she will have an adequate opportunity to address the agency concerns about her care of ibid.apparently unaware that the agency had removed from marshall home between the time marshall filed her writ petition and the time of oral argument on the petition this court stated,no change of current placement is required pending this hearing.ibid.
on remand,approximately seven months later,the trial court held a new hearing and concluded that removing from his new adoptive home would not be in his best interest marshall filed a second writ petition in which she contended that the trial court erred in failing to place in her home for adoption.this court denied marshall petition.rita superior court,nonpub.opn.rita ii.
procedural history 
the complaint 
marshall filed a complaint in june against the county and various county social workers,including thompson,johanesen,and harmelink we refer to thompson,johanesen,and harmelink collectively as the social workers 
as relevant to this appeal,marshall brought claims pursuant to section against both the social workers and the county marshall claims against the social workers alleged violations of her right to due process third cause of action and her due process right to familial association fourth cause of action.both causes of action against the social workers are premised on two sets of purported constitutional violations.first,marshall claims that the social workers violated her constitutional rights by removing from the care,custody,and control of his identified prospective adoptive parent,marshall,without exigent circumstances,and without providing adequate notice or an opportunity to be heard second,marshall contends that the social workers violated her constitutional rights by using false and fabricated evidence and testimony during the pendency of the dependency proceedings 
with respect to the county,marshall claimed that the social workers committed violations of her constitutional rights pursuant to a county policy or custom.
respondents first motion for summary judgment adjudication 
respondents filed a motion for summary judgment adjudication in march.with respect to marshall judicial deception theory of liability,the trial court ruled that marshall had presented sufficient evidence from which a jury could find that the social workers had violated her due process right to be free from judicial deception with respect to statements made in the june ex parte application.however,the court concluded that the social workers were entitled to qualified immunity as to this theory of liability on the ground that marshall right to be free from judicial deception was not clearly established at the time the social workers acted.
with respect to marshall notice theory of liability,the trial court ruled that marshall had a clearly established right to notice and a full hearing before placement with her could be terminated,and that there was a triable issue of fact with respect to whether the social workers had provided marshall with adequate notice of the june ex parte hearing.accordingly,the court ruled that the social workers were not entitled to judgment as a matter of law on their qualified immunity defense with respect to marshall notice theory of liability.
the court denied respondents motion with respect to marshall claim against the county on the ground that the only evidence of the county policies and customs was a declaration of a county employee who lacked the knowledge necessary to make the statements set forth in the declaration.
county motion for summary adjudication 
the court permitted the county to file a second motion for summary adjudication of the section unlawful policies claim against it.the court reasoned in part that the denial of the first motion was based entirely on the fact that the county had supported its motion with a declaration from the wrong person,and that permitting a successive motion had the potential to obviate a lengthy trial.
the county filed a motion for summary adjudication on the unlawful practices claim in august.the court granted the motion,reasoning that marshall had failed to show that any of her alleged constitutional violations were caused by a county custom or policy.
the social workers motion for summary judgment 
the social workers filed a request for authorization to file an additional motion for summary judgment with respect to marshall notice theory of liability in november.in support of this request,the social workers contended that they had provided the required statutory notice and that this issue had not been addressed in the prior motion.the court permitted the social workers to file the new motion for summary judgment.
the social workers filed a motion for summary judgment on marshall notice theory of liability in december.in their motion,the social workers contended that it was undisputed that johanesen had provided marshall with oral notice of the agency intent to remove from marshall nine days prior to thompson and johanesen filing of the june,ex parte application and that they were entitled to qualified immunity for any deficiencies in the adequacy of the notice.the court granted the motion,ruling that a reasonable social worker would not have known that she was violating marshall due process rights.
the final judgment and appeal 
the trial court entered a final judgment in favor of respondents in january,from which marshall timely appealed.
discussiona.the trial court had inherent authority to entertain successive motions for summary judgment adjudication 
marshall contends that the trial court erred in permitting respondents to file successive motions for summary judgment adjudication.citing le francois goel cal th,le francois,marshall contends that a trial court lacks authority to grant a repetitive motion,where the requirements of code of civil procedure section,subdivision f are not satisfied.marshall contention raises a question of law,which we review de novo.see people lujan th,determining whether a trial court has the inherent authority to take an action is reviewed de novo city of dana point california coastal commission th,claims raising an issue of statutory interpretation are reviewed de novo.
governing law 
code of civil procedure section,subdivision f provides 
a motion for summary adjudication may be made by itself or as an alternative to a motion for summary judgment and shall proceed in all procedural respects as a motion for summary judgment.however,a party may not move for summary judgment based on issues asserted in a prior motion for summary adjudication and denied by the court,unless that party establishes to the satisfaction of the court,newly discovered facts or circumstances or a change of law supporting the issues reasserted in the summary judgment motion.
in le francois,supra,cal th at pages,the supreme court concluded that code of civil procedure section,subdivision f prohibit s a party from making renewed motions not based on new facts or law,but do es not limit a court ability to reconsider its previous interim orders on its own motion,as long as it gives the parties notice that it may do so and a reasonable opportunity to litigate the question.the le francois court agreed with a line of cases which holds that code of civil procedure section validly limit s the parties ability to make repetitive motions but do es not limit the court authority to act on its own motion.le francois,supra,at.the le francois court reasoned,on its face,code of civil procedure,section,subdivision f merely says that a party may not make a motion that violates its provisions.italics added.it says nothing limiting the court ability to act.le francois,supra,at.
application 
marshall contends that the trial court has inherent authority under le francois only to correct its own errors,and that le francois does not permit a trial court to allow a party to file repetitive motions for summary judgment adjudication.we do not read le francois so narrowly.the le francois court noted that the text of code of civil procedure section,subdivision f restricts only a party ability to file a motion,and does not restrict a court inherent authority in any manner.le francois,supra,cal th at.in addition,to interpret code of civil procedure section,subdivision f as prohibiting a court from allowing a party to file a successive summary judgment or adjudication motion would raise the difficult constitutional question le francois,supra,at of whether the legislature may restrict a court authority in such a fashion.see id.at noting that the court interpretation of code civ,subd.f as restricting only parties acts obviated the need to consider whether it would be constitutional for the legislature to limit the court ability to reconsider its own rulings.in contrast,interpreting code of civil procedure section,subdivision f as permitting a trial court to exercise its inherent authority to permit a party to file a successive motion for summary judgment adjudication is both consistent with the le francois court interpretation of the statute and avoids this difficult constitutional question.see myers philip morris companies,cal th,an established rule of statutory construction requires us to construe statutes to avoid constitutional infirmit ies accord le francois,supra,at,citing myers.
marshall also contends that the trial court authority was limited to grant ing reconsideration of its own motion based on the evidence originally submitted.quoting in re marriage of barthold th,barthold,italics in original.in barthold,the court of appeal applied le francois and concluded that the trial court inherent authority to correct its errors applies even when the trial court was prompted to reconsider its prior ruling by a motion filed in violation of code of civil procedure section.barthold,supra,at.in rejecting a party contention that such a holding would encourage the filing of unwarranted motions for reconsideration,the barthold court stated,w e stress that in order to grant reconsideration on its own motion,the trial court must conclude that its earlier ruling was wrong,and change that ruling based on the evidence originally submitted.id.at.
barthold does not preclude the trial court action in this case.the barthold court was discussing a trial court authority to grant reconsideration of a prior order based on a motion filed in violation of code of civil procedure section.in contrast,in this case,the trial court did not reconsider a prior order.it permitted respondents to file new motions for summary judgment adjudication.thus,even assuming that the barthold court was correct in its statement that a trial court may grant reconsideration of a prior order on its own motion based only on the evidence originally submitted neither barthold nor le francois limits a trial court authority to permit a party to file a successive motion for summary judgment adjudication supported by evidence that was not presented in connection with a prior motion.
accordingly,we conclude that the trial court did not err in permitting respondents to file successive motions for summary judgment adjudication.
b.the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of respondents 
marshall claims that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of respondents.specifically,marshall contends that the trial court erred in granting judgment as a matter of law for the social workers on her section claims against them.marshall also argues that the trial court erred in granting judgment as a matter of law for the county on marshall section claim asserted against the county.
relevant summary judgment law 
a moving party is entitled to summary judgment when the party establishes that it is entitled to the entry of judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c.a defendant may make this showing by demonstrating that the plaintiff can not establish one or more elements of all of his causes of action,or that the defendant has a complete defense to each cause of action,subd.o.this court reviews an order granting a motion for summary judgment de novo.see,jones wachovia bank th.we will affirm a summary judgment if it is correct on any ground,as we review the judgment,not its rationale,goldman sachs th,fn.
the social workers are entitled to qualified immunity as matter of law on marshall claims premised on their purported failure to provide her with notice and a full hearing before the termination of adoptive placement 
marshall claims 
marshall section claims against thompson and johanesen are based in part on her allegation that they failed to provide notice reasonably calculated to apprise marshall of the location,date,and time of an ex parte hearing,which was held on june,at which the court vacated the agency placement of with marshall.marshall also contends that harmelink failed to provide marshall a copy of a july,addendum report with sufficient time to afford her an opportunity to properly and competently defend against the accusations leveled against her.
marshall contends that these actions violated her constitutional right as a prospective adoptive parent,to notice and a full hearing before the adoptive placement can be terminated adoption of baby girl th.
b.the defense of qualified immunity 
a government official sued under section is entitled to qualified immunity unless the official violated a statutory or constitutional right that was clearly established at the time of the challenged conduct.citation a right is clearly established only if its contours are sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.citation in other words,existing precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate.carroll,supra.at.further,the united states supreme court has repeatedly told courts not to define clearly established law at a high level of generality,citation since doing so avoids the crucial question whether the official acted reasonably in the particular circumstances that he or she faced.plumhoff rickard,plumhoff.
the doctrine protects all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law carroll,supra.at,and applies regardless of whether the government official error is a mistake of law,a mistake of fact,or a mistake based on mixed questions of law and fact.pearson callahan,pearson.
finally,because qualified immunity is an immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability it is effectively lost if a case is erroneously permitted to go to trial.pearson,supra,at.for this reason,the supreme court has repeatedly stressed the importance of resolving immunity questions at the earliest possible stage in litigation.id.at.
c.the manner by which thompson and johanesen provided notice of the agency intent to remove from her care did not violate marshall clearly established constitutional right 
marshall contends that thompson and johanesen violated her constitutional right to due process by failing to provide her with notice of the june,ex parte hearing at which the court entered an order vacating placement with marshall.marshall argues that in failing to provide her with notice of the hearing,thompson and johanesen violated her right to notice and a full hearing before the adoptive placement could be terminated adoption of baby girl,supra,th at,citing,among other cases,superior court d.we are not persuaded.
marshall acknowledges in her complaint that on june,johanesen verbally informed her that the agency was going to remove marshall further acknowledges that johanesen told marshall that if marshall objected to the removal,she would have to go to court and fill out some paperwork.
in providing notice in this manner,johanesen complied with the statutory scheme governing the removal of a child from a prospective adoptive parent of a dependent child welfare and institutions code,section,subdivision n provides that p rior to a change in placement and as soon as possible after a decision is made to remove a child from the home of a designated prospective adoptive parent,the agency shall notify the designated prospective adoptive parent of the proposal johanesen june verbal notice provided marshall with notice of the agency intent to change the placement of prior to the actual change in placement,and marshall presents no argument that the notice was not provided as soon as possible after the decision was made to remove from marshall home.further,marshall cites no authority indicating that the oral notice that johanesen undisputedly provided is insufficient under welfare and institutions code section,subdivision n,and presents no argument that the form of notice mandated by statute fails to ensure the notice constitutionally required as stated in adoption of baby girl,supra,th at page.
to the extent that marshall may be understood to be contending that thompson and johanesen violated her right to due process by filing an ex parte application on june,because marshall had filed an objection to the removal on june we reject this argument,as well.placement with marshall was not terminated until october when the agency actually removed from marshall,and the court held a hearing on july well before october on marshall objection to the removal the liberty interest that invokes the protections of due process is notice and an opportunity to be heard before the child is removed.see,supra,d at here petitioners were accorded a judicial hearing before the child was removed but the court erred to their prejudice by restricting its review marten thies d,the court in discovered that the fourteenth amendment guarantee of due process requires that prospective adoptive parents be given notice and an opportunity to be heard before the termination of status and removal of the child from the preadoptive placement except in extraordinary circumstances.because was not removed from marshall home until more than three months after the ex parte hearing and after the court had conducted a hearing on marshall objection,thompson and johanesen failure to provide marshall with notice of the june ex parte hearing did not violate marshall right to notice and a full hearing before the adoptive placement can be terminated.adoption of baby girl,supra,th at.
accordingly,we conclude that the trial court properly determined that thompson and johanesen are entitled to qualified immunity with respect to marshall section claims against them insofar as those claims are premised on thompson and johanesen failure to provide marshall with notice of the june ex parte hearing.
harmelink failure to provide marshall with the july addendum report prior to the hearing did not violate marshall clearly established constitutional right 
marshall contends that harmelink violated her right to due process by failing to provide her with a copy of the july addendum report sufficiently in advance of the july hearing to provide her with time to prepare a response to the agency accusations.citing this court decision in rita i,supra,marshall contends that this action was unfair,and was in violation of her due process rights.
even assuming that harmelink failure to provide marshall with the report until the commencement of the july hearing violated marshall right to due process,marshall has presented no authority or argument demonstrating that this failure violated a clearly established constitutional right see carroll,supra.at a right is clearly established only if its contours are sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right citation,and we are aware of no such authority.
we also reject marshall suggestion that harmelink failure to provide the report earlier violated marshall clearly established right to a full hearing before the termination of adoptive placement.adoption of baby girl,supra,th at.a defendant can not be said to have violated a clearly established right unless the right contours were sufficiently definite that any reasonable official in the defendant shoes would have understood that he was violating it.plumhoff,supra.at.since marshall has pointed to no authority demonstrating that marshall right to a full hearing adoption of baby girl,supra,at encompassed the right to receive the report prior to the hearing,we can not say that all reasonable social workers would have understood that failing to provide the report earlier violated this right.
accordingly,we conclude that harmelink is entitled to qualified immunity with respect to marshall section claims against her insofar as those claims are premised on harmelink failure to provide marshall with a copy of the july addendum report prior to the july hearing.
the social workers are entitled to qualified immunity as a matter of law on marshall claims premised on judicial deception 
marshall claims 
citing chism washington state cir,chism,marshall contends that the social workers violated her due process right to be free from governmental deception in the presentation of evidence during judicial proceedings.marshall argues that the social workers violated this right by making deliberately false statements and failing to present material exculpatory evidence to the trial court in connection with the request to terminate placement with marshall.under chism,in order to demonstrate a violation of her due process right to be free from judicial deception marshall is required to make a substantial showing of the social workers deliberate falsehood or reckless disregard for the truth and establish that,but for the dishonesty,the termination of placement with her would not have occurred.citation.chism,supra,at.
marshall had a clearly established constitutional right not to have placement terminated based on a social worker statement that was either deliberately false or made with reckless disregard for its truth 
the social workers are entitled to qualified immunity unless they violated a clearly established constitutional right.carroll,supra.at.marshall contends that she had a clearly established constitutional right not to have placement terminated based on a social worker statement that was either deliberately false or made with reckless disregard for its truth.we agree.
in greene camreta cir,greene,vacated in part on other grounds by camreta greene.and vacated in part on other grounds by greene camreta cir,the ninth circuit concluded that,as of march,a parent had a clearly established right not to be subject to judicial deception perpetrated by a child protective services worker securing an order removing a child from the parent custody.greene,supra,at see id.at.the greene court reasoned 
t he right to be free from deception in the presentation of evidence during a protective custody proceeding was clearly established at the time camreta the child protective services worker filed his affidavit with the juvenile court.in devereaux perez,cir reh g en banc granted by and reh g en banc,for example,we held in the context of a child abuse proceeding that the constitutional right to be free from the knowing presentation of false or perjured evidence is clearly established.id.at.even earlier,we stated emphatically that if an officer submitted an affidavit that contained statements he knew to be false or would have known were false had he not recklessly disregarded the truth,he can not be said to have acted in an objectively reasonable manner,and the shield of qualified immunity is lost.hervey estes,cir internal quotations and citation omitted see also butler elle cir,whitaker garcetti cir,concluding that the contours of the fourth amendment right against judicial deception were clearly established by.see also snell tunnell,cir holding social workers who deliberately fabricated evidence of child sexual abuse to secure a removal order not entitled to qualified immunity.greene,supra,at.
we agree with greene,and believe that its reasoning applies equally to statements made to a court by a social worker seeking the removal of a dependent child from a caregiver custody see devereaux abbey cir,en banc devereaux precedent directly on point is not necessary to demonstrate that a right is clearly established.rather,if the unlawfulness is apparent in light of preexisting law,then the standard is met.in addition,even if there is no closely analogous case law,a right can be clearly established on the basis of common sense.in light of criminal prohibitions on making deliberately false statements under oath no social worker could reasonably believe that she was acting lawfully in making deliberately false statements to the juvenile court in connection with the removal of a dependent child from a caregiver since qualified immunity protects officials who act in ways they reasonably believe to be lawful garcia county of merced cir,we think that it is virtually devereaux,supra,at that qualified immunity does not apply to such acts.see walker city of new york d,it is axiomatic that a caseworker seeking the protection of qualified immunity can not have utilized perjury and intentional fabrications during her investigation and in presenting a case to the family court.
citing costanich dep t of soc.and health services cir,costanich,the county maintains that marshall right not to have social workers present fabricated evidence against her in a civil juvenile dependency proceeding was not clearly established until.we disagree.
to begin with,the county argument that costanich is binding precedent on this court is incorrect.see,raven deukmejian cal d,decisions of the lower federal courts interpreting federal law,though persuasive,are not binding on state courts mclaughlin walnut properties,th,since we are construing a federal statute,we must apply and interpret federal law.decisions of the united states supreme court are binding.lower federal court decisions,including those of the ninth circuit court of appeal,are not.in making this argument,the county also misapplies precedent holding that federal district courts must follow the decisions of the federal circuit courts of appeal citing hart massanari cir,hart.this court is not,as the county asserts,an inferior court to the ninth circuit,as the hart court itself recognized.ibid.distinguishing between inferior courts in the federal system and state courts.
in any event,costanich supports our conclusion.in costanich,the ninth circuit considered,whether,as of,an individual had a clearly established right not to be subjected to deliberately falsified information in a civil child abuse proceeding.costanich,supra,at.the costanich court noted that in in devereaux,supra,the ninth circuit held that there is a clearly established constitutional due process right not to be subjected to criminal charges on the basis of false evidence that was deliberately fabricated by the government.costanich,supra,at,quoting devereaux,supra,at.the costanich court concluded that the logic of devereaux applies equally to civil child abuse proceedings,stating,although devereaux does not specifically address civil child abuse proceedings,the right not to be accused based upon deliberately fabricated evidence is sufficiently obvious,and devereaux is sufficiently analogous to the facts here,that government officials are on notice that deliberately falsifying information during civil investigations which result in the deprivation of protected liberty or property interests may subject them to section liability.costanich,supra,at.
we acknowledge that the costanich court did state,g iven the distinctions between criminal prosecutions at issue in devereaux and civil foster care proceedings we can not say that this right was clearly established as of,when the conduct at issue in this case occurred.costanich,supra,at,italics added.however,even assuming we were to follow costanich reasoning that,as of,an individual did not have a clearly established constitutional right not to be subjected to deliberately falsified evidence in connection with a civil child abuse investigation the acts that are alleged to have occurred in this case took place in five years after the ninth circuit en banc decision in devereaux and three years after the alleged acts at issue in greene.thus,costanich does not support the county contention that,as of,marshall did not clearly have such a constitutional right.
we are also aware that the costanich court stated,g oing forward,reasonable government officials are on notice that deliberately falsifying evidence in a child abuse investigation and including false evidentiary statements in a supporting declaration violates constitutional rights where it results in the deprivation of liberty or property interests,be it in a criminal or civil proceeding.costanich,supra,at.however,this language can not reasonably be read as a holding by the costanich court that for acts occurring after,no clearly established right existed,since this was not the question before the costanich court rather,we read the costanich court going forward language ibid,as merely establishing that,for acts occurring after the publication of costanich,government officials are indisputably on notice of the existence of a clear constitutional right to be free from judicial deception in civil child abuse proceedings affecting the custody of a child.
accordingly,we conclude that as of the summer of,marshall had a clearly established constitutional right not to have placement terminated based on a social worker statement that was either deliberately false or made with reckless disregard for its truth.
c.the social workers are entitled to qualified immunity because there is no evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that placement with marshall was terminated based on statements that were either deliberately false or made with reckless disregard for their truth 
marshall judicial deception claim is based on statements made by the social workers in the june ex parte application and the july addendum report.we consider marshall claims concerning each document,in turn.
marshall contends that the june ex parte application contained several statements that thompson and johanesen knew or should have known were false.first,marshall argues that the statement that she had not complied with requests for an adoptive homestudy was false.edwards stated in a declaration that,in march,she gave marshall several documents that had to be completed as part of the adoption homestudy process,including an application to adopt form.edwards also stated that marshall failed to return the forms.marshall points to no evidence demonstrating that she in fact returned the application to adopt,or that edwards statement was false.thus,a reasonable juror could not find that thompson and johanesen deliberately fabricated the statement,marshall has not complied with requests for the adoptive homestudy.
in a related argument,marshall contends that the statement in the ex parte application that her homestudy has been closed as unapproved,was false.in support of this contention,marshall cites evidence that,at best,suggests that the agency may have not have formally closed her homestudy application until shortly after the filing of the june ex parte application.this evidence does not establish that the statement was materially false,since the gist of the statement was that the agency had decided not to approve marshall home for adoption.thus,a reasonable juror could not find thompson and johanesen liable for this statement.
marshall further argues that the statement,marshall has been given the proper statutory notice,was untrue.we reject this contention for the reasons stated in part,ante.marshall also contends that the statement,marshall has made no attempt to contest the children removal,was untrue as to while marshall presented evidence that she mailed the agency her objection to the agency proposal to remove on june,there is no evidence that either thompson or johanesen was aware of this objection on june when they signed the application or on june when they filed the ex parte application.thus,there is no evidence on which a reasonable jury could find that thompson or johanesen deliberately fabricated the statement that marshall had not attempted to contest removal.
marshall also argues that because johanesen was not social worker,she could not have had personal knowledge of the events described in the ex parte application,and thus,she committed perjury in submitting it to the court.we reject this argument because the vast majority of the statements in the ex parte application did not pertain to,but rather,referred to the suitability of marshall home in general,as well as to issues related to and with respect to the one statement that arguably related only to,the statement that marshall had not complied with requests necessary to complete the adoptive homestudy,marshall has failed to demonstrate that a reasonable juror could find the statement to be false.thus,a reasonable jury could not find that johanesen committed perjury in making this statement 
marshall also argues that harmelink and thompson deliberately fabricated several statements in their july addendum report.to begin with,for the reasons stated above,we reject marshall arguments with respect to statements in the report to the effect that she not had complied with requests for the adoptive hom
