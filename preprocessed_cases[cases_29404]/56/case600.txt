joshua seeks writ relief from an order of the superior court compelling him to testify in proceedings initiated by the district attorney to extend his commitment in a juvenile facility because he poses a danger to the public based on an alleged mental illness.see welf,et further statutory references are to this code unless specified otherwise.joshua invokes the constitutional prohibition against compelled testimony in criminal proceedings,but because commitment proceedings are essentially civil in nature,authority requires that we repeat this reasoning.joshua also argues section affords him the right not to testify in these proceedings because it expressly extends to juveniles facing commitment all rights guaranteed under the federal and state constitutions in criminal proceedings.we agree the plain language chosen by the legislature includes not just some of the constitutional rights afforded in criminal proceedings,but all of them.we therefore grant the writ petition.
factual and procedural background 
the relevant background is brief.the district attorney filed a petition pursuant to section to extend joshua detention in juvenile facilities for an additional two years,alleging the commitment was necessary because joshua mental illness psed a danger to the public on march,the superior court commenced a probable cause hearing on the petition.the district attorney called joshua to testify at the hearing and,over his objection,the superior court required him to testify.the court continued the hearing to march,before joshua completed his testimony.
in the meantime,joshua petitioned for a writ of mandate,which we summarily denied.the california supreme court,however,granted review and transferred the matter with directions to issue an order to show cause why the petition should not be granted.we issued the order and,after briefing by the parties and oral argument,we now turn to the merits.
discussiona.no constitutional right to avoid testifying at juvenile commitment proceedings 
joshua argues the constitutional prohibition on compelled testimony applies to preclude the district attorney from calling him as a witness in these proceedings.under precedent,we disagree.
the fifth amendment to the united states constitution and article i,section of the california constitution guarantee the privilege against.the privilege encompasses two separate and distinct testimonial privileges in a criminal matter a defendant has an absolute right not to be called as a witness and not to testify.citations.further,in any proceeding,civil or criminal,a witness has the right to decline to answer questions which may tend to incriminate him in criminal activity citation.cramer tyars cal d,cramer.
the privilege of a criminal defendant not to testify has not been extended to civil committees.in allen illinois,d,the united states supreme court held that the privilege did not apply to proceedings under the illinois sexually dangerous persons act because the proceedings were not criminal within the meaning of the fifth amendment to the united states constitution id.at.in cramer,the california supreme court held the privilege did not apply to the commitment proceedings there see because commitment of mentally retarded persons must be deemed essentially civil in nature.cramer,supra,cal d at.our supreme court has concluded the extended commitment proceedings for juveniles under section et are civil in nature.in re howard cal th,d.it follows,therefore,that the constitutional right to refuse to testify does not apply.
statutory privilege not to testify at commitment proceedings 
the absence of a constitutional privilege not to testify in civil commitment proceedings does not,of course,prevent the legislature from affording that right by statute.joshua contends the legislature did so by enacting section.we are not the first court to consider this issue.see people lopez th,d lopez concluding no such statutory right exists in but see in re luis th,d luis reaching contrary conclusion.before we address these decisions,we briefly review the commitment process the legislature has established for offenders detained in juvenile facilities 
the juvenile commitment process under section et.
section provides for a trial on a district attorney petition see,to extend a juvenile offender commitment to the division of juvenile facilities because he or she poses a danger arising from a mental or physical disorder.the purpose of the trial is to answer the question is the person physically dangerous to the public because of his or her mental or physical deficiency,disorder,or abnormality which causes the person to have serious difficulty controlling his or her dangerous behavior the trial takes place only if the district attorney first demonstrates probable cause supporting commitment.if the court orders a trial and the trier of fact determines the person poses the requisite risk of harm,he may be detained for two years before the district attorney may seek to renew the commitment by means of another petition.absent renewal,the authorities must discharge the person.ibid.
rights afforded by section,as construed in luis and lopez 
section affords juveniles facing commitment or recommitment enumerated rights that include a jury trial,a unanimous verdict,and proof of the necessity of commitment beyond a reasonable doubt.additionally,section states t he person shall be entitled to all rights guaranteed under the federal and state constitutions in criminal proceedings.finding this sentence clear and unambiguous,the fifth district court of appeal concluded in luis that the legislature chosen language included the right of defendants in criminal proceedings not to be called as a witness.luis,supra,th at,d.the court reasoned if the legislature did not intend that all rights apply,than the specify which rights applied.ibid.the legislature amended section the following year to specify that a disorder warranting commitment must cause the person to have serious difficulty controlling his or her dangerous behavior,a provision necessary to avoid violating substantive due process.in re howard,supra,cal th at,d,see kansas crane,d kansas hendricks,d.but the legislature did nothing to disturb luis interpretation of the statute.
in,however,division two of the fourth district court of appeal disagreed with luis see lopez,supra,th,d.in lopez,the court considered an equal protection challenge raised by a defendant civilly committed as a mentally disordered offender mdo,subds.a c.the defendant argued admission of his testimony in his mdo commitment hearing subjected him to disparate treatment compared to persons who enjoyed the right to refuse to testify under other commitment statutes.
specifically,the defendant pointed to luis interpretation of section and to another decision by the fifth district court of appeal,people haynie th,d haynie,where the court analyzed the commitment proceedings under penal code section for persons found not guilty by reason of insanity ngi.then,as now,section,subdivision b,provided that the potential ngi committee shall be entitled to the rights guaranteed under the federal and state constitutions for criminal proceedings.in haynie,the court concluded the statutory rights conferred by this language included the absolute right to decline to testify.haynie,supra,th at,d.
rejecting haynie and luis,the lopez court scuttled the premise of the defendant equal protection argument.lopez concluded the legislature did not extend the right not to testify to juvenile or ngi civil committees,and it therefore followed that the legislature did not single out mdo for disparate treatment by failing to accord that right.lopez,supra,th at,d.lopez confined its discussion to haynie and did not separately address luis,viewing the rationale of the fifth district two decisions as identical.see id.at,d.lopez did not address the distinction between the legislature grant of all rights to potential juvenile committees in section see luis,supra,th at,d and the absence of similarly broad language in the ngi statute under consideration in haynie.against the backdrop of luis and lopez,we turn now to examine section.
applicable statutory interpretation principles 
our task in examining any enactment is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent.citations.we turn first to the words of the statute themselves,recognizing that they generally provide the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.citations.when the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous and thus not reasonably susceptible of more than one meaning,there is no need for construction,and courts should not indulge in it.citations.people gardeley cal th,d,see in re anthony th,d anthony section unambiguously includes prohibition against double jeopardy.when considering the statutory language,we adhere to the maxim that c ourts should give meaning to every word of a statute if possible,and should avoid a construction making any word surplusage.citation.reno baird cal th,d.where the terms of a statute are plain and not absurd,a court may not presume a drafting error and thereby substitute its judgment for the legislature.people castro cal d,fn.to do so would contravene our constitutional role,tread into the domain of a coequal branch,and inject intolerable uncertainty into the drafting and lawmaking process,since neither the legislature nor the public could rely on a court to follow plain statutory language.
section includes the right not to testify 
we agree with luis that the plain language employed by the legislature in section requires the conclusion that juveniles facing commitment under that provision may decline to testify.as luis observed,the legislature words are clear and unambiguous the person is entitled to all rights guaranteed under the federal and state constitutions in criminal proceedings.luis,supra,th at,d.among the constitutional rights guaranteed in criminal proceedings is the defendants absolute right not to be called as a witness,amend cal,art.i.this right is necessarily included in the rights afforded by section because the word all means all and not some.the legislature chosen term leaves no room for judicial construction.
like luis,the third district court of appeal in anthony recently reached the same conclusion we reach today the language of section is clear and unambiguous.anthony,supra,th at,d.there,the court considered whether section incorporates into juvenile commitment proceedings the constitutional prohibition on double jeopardy.the court recognized the legislature could not have intended jeopardy principles to bar the commitment trial itself,since it is not a renewed criminal prosecution and a bar would have the absurd effect of nullifying the very commitment process established by the legislature.id.at,d.the court noted,however,that under the plain terms of section,once a commitment trial commences,all constitutional rights come into play,italics added.observing that t he statute does not limit or qualify this guarantee in any way ibid,the court concluded a holding that those rights do not include double jeopardy citation would render the word all meaningless.ibid.accordingly,the court applied jeopardy principles to bar retrial and ordered the juvenile discharged where the prosecuting attorney failed to satisfy his evidentiary burden on the commitment petition.id.at,d.
according to the district attorney,anthony stands for the proposition the term all rights in section is not as expansive as a literal reading would suggest and does not actually incorporate all rights because,in recognizing double jeopardy does not bar a juvenile commitment proceeding in the first instance anthony,supra,th at,d,the court demonstrated occasions exist where a constitutional right seemingly guaranteed by the broad statutory language does not apply.
the district attorney misconstrues the nature of double jeopardy.by definition,double jeopardy never applies in the first instance.a civil,juvenile commitment proceeding is a trial in the first instance in its own right,distinct in kind from the earlier juvenile jurisdiction hearing.the trials are aimed at resolving different questions.one adjudicates guilt and the other the juvenile prospective dangerousness over a period covered by a particular petition.simply put,the s ection hearing does not involve adjudication of the factual elements of a offense as is present in a jurisdictional hearing to which jeopardy attaches.in re steven th,d accord,anthony,supra,th at,d citing steven.because jeopardy does not attach in criminal proceedings to bar later civil adjudication of a juvenile dangerousness,there is no reason to read anthony as adopting a selective incorporation of the all rights accorded in section.contrary to the district attorney argument,we remain convinced that all means all in section.
the manner in which the legislature added the all rights language to section supports our conclusion the legislature meant what it said when it employed this broad term.the legislature added the final three sentences of section in following the decision in people superior court vernal d.there,the court held the juvenile commitment scheme violated due process in two respects first,it authorized commitment based on less than a unanimous jury verdict id.at,and second,section implied the civil preponderance of the evidence standard applied id.at,fn.as the supreme court recognized in in re howard,t he legislature promptly responded by amending the extended detention scheme to provide for proof beyond a reasonable doubt and a unanimous verdict.in re howard,supra,cal th at,d.clearly,the last two sentences of the revised section accomplish this change.but what of the first of the three sentences,the one that includes the all rights language 
the legislature was entitled,had it chosen to do so,to select language for the first sentence that merely restated the latter two for emphasis or clarity.the legislature choice of the word all,however,forecloses this interpretation because the federal and state constitutions guarantee more than just the due process rights of a unanimous verdict and proof beyond a reasonable doubt.had the legislature elected to leave out the word all,some precedent would support the conclusion the remaining language only codified judicial decisions holding due process rights applicable to commitment proceedings.compare lopez,supra,th at,d,with haynie,supra,th at,d.
but the legislature charted a different course.we agree with anthony that the legislature decision not to utilize the same language in section as it did in statutes governing other commitment proceedings is meaningful.since it did not employ the same language,instead specifying that the defendant is entitled to all constitutional rights in criminal proceedings,we must give the word all its inclusive commonsense meaning.anthony,supra,th at,d.
the legislature is not constrained merely to enact the statutory version of a judicial holding when it amends a statute.true,the legislative history gives no inkling the legislature intended to do more than codify vernal when it amended section in see howard,supra,cal th at,d,quoting legislative committee analyses,but the words the legislature chooses are the best expression of its intent and we are bound by their plain meaning.kavanaugh west sonoma county union high school dist.cal th,d,statute plain meaning controls and obviates resort to extrinsic sources to determine the legislature intent.as noted above,moreover,the legislature amended section in without countermanding luis and w hen a statute has been construed by judicial decision,and that construction is not altered by subsequent legislation,it must be presumed that the legislature is aware of the judicial construction and approves of it.citations.people meloney cal th,d.
we decline to follow lopez 
the district attorney relies on lopez,which we do not find persuasive because it did not address the all rights language in section.lopez relied on cases construing statutory language not section.for example,in people henderson d,the defendant argued the law governing commitment of mentally disordered sex offenders mdso entitled him to the privilege against.the defendant relied on section,which provided the patient shall be entitled to the rights guaranteed under the
