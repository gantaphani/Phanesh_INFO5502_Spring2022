under certain circumstances,found by a preponderance of evidence,and indicating that a minor child is bereft of care or support by a parent or guardian,or has suffered or risks actual or threatened serious injury,illness,emotional damage,or sexual abuse because of a custodial parent or guardian inadequacy,neglect,or mistreatment,the child may be adjudged a dependent of the juvenile court.welf.a dependency adjudication is a preliminary step that allows the juvenile court,within specified limits,to assert supervision over the endangered child care.but it is merely a first step,and the system includes many subsequent safeguards to ensure that parental rights and authority will be restricted only to the extent necessary for the child safety and welfare.
thus,unless a custodial parent or guardian has abandoned or voluntarily relinquished the child,the court may not remove a dependent child from the parent or guardian physical custody unless it finds,by clear and convincing evidence,that such action is necessary to protect the child from serious harm,subd.c.even if removal is ordered,the court must provide social services,including family reunification services,designed to facilitate the parent or guardian resumption of full custody and control,unless the court finds specified circumstances by clear and convincing evidence.only if the court permissibly denies reunification services,or such services have failed,may the court conduct permanency planning proceedings that contemplate a final termination of parental rights.
among the findings allowing an initial adjudication of dependency is that t he child parent or guardian caused the death of another child through abuse or neglect,subd.f,italics added section f.here,a father two young surviving children were adjudged juvenile court dependents,in part because of findings under section f.these findings were based on evidence that,in violation of law,the father transported his third child,an month old daughter,in an automobile without securing her in a child safety seat,and she was fatally injured when another vehicle collided with their car.the court of appeal affirmed the juvenile court judgment.
we granted the father petition for review to address three issues first,does the lethal neglect to which section f refers require criminal negligence,a degree of culpable misfeasance or malfeasance that would support the parent or guardian criminal conviction for causing a child death second,does section f require discrete evidence and findings that the particular circumstances of the child fatality demonstrate a current risk of substantial harm to surviving children in the parent or guardian care third,what is the meaning of caused,as used in section f,is a substantial or contributing cause sufficient,and what is the effect,if any,of any intervening or superseding cause 
like the court of appeal majority in this case,we conclude that section f does not limit its application to criminal negligence.on the contrary,section f allows but does not require the juvenile court to adjudge a child a dependent if the court finds that the want of ordinary care by the child parent or guardian caused another child death.we further conclude that the juvenile court may adjudicate dependency under section f without any additional evidence or finding that the circumstances surrounding the parent or guardian fatal negligence indicate a present risk of harm to surviving children in the parent or guardian custody.
finally,we determine that normal concepts of legal causation apply under section f.here,we are persuaded,the father negligent failure to secure his young daughter in a child safety seat was a substantial contributing cause of her death in an ensuing traffic accident.the father counsel conceded as much in the juvenile court.nor does the evidence permit a conclusion that the accident itself was an unforeseeable intervening or superseding event that absolves the father of causation responsibility.the superseding cause doctrine can not apply where,as here,the duty the father breached is intended to guard against the precise,and thus foreseeable,risk that materialized,a young child injury or death in a traffic collision.
accordingly,we will affirm the judgment of the court of appeal.
facts and procedural 
defendant william william and his wife kimberly kimberly had three children,ethan ethan,born in january,valerie valerie,born in november,and jesus jesus,born in november.in march or april of,william and kimberly separated.kimberly returned to her family home,while ethan,jesus,and valerie lived with william in the home of his mother the children paternal grandmother.
on june,william left valerie in the care of his mother and sister.when he returned to the house,he noticed that valerie arm was injured.he decided to take her to the hospital to have the arm examined.during the trip,valerie was not secured in a child safety seat she sat on an adult relative lap.en route to the hospital,another vehicle collided with william car.valerie died as the result of blunt force injuries.there is no indication william was at fault for the traffic accident itself 
a week after valerie death,the department responded to a report that ethan and jesus were victims of general neglect by their parents.investigation revealed that the household in which william was living with the children included as many as persons.the conditions were unsanitary,and the children in the household were dirty and seemed unsupervised.in particular,ethan appeared to be a victim of inadequate care,and he showed signs of delayed development.he lacked language skills,was confused about the difference between day and night,did not know how to use eating utensils,and had several rotten teeth that required extraction.
the department investigators were told that kimberly had a history of sometimes suicidal depression,anger management problems,a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder,and cognitive impairments that limited her functioning to the level of an year old.they learned the couple had engaged in episodes of domestic violence,with kimberly as the primary aggressor.members of kimberly family indicated she could care take care of her children,but only with extensive help and guidance.a psychologist expressed serious reservations about her ability to do so.on the other hand,members of kimberly family insisted that the children had been seriously neglected in the home of william relatives,and that jesus and ethan would be in danger if they remained there.
william expressed extreme remorse about the fatal accident.he told the investigators that valerie arm injury apparently happened when she fell out of bed while unsupervised.he explained that when he decided to take valerie to the hospital,his car,which had a child safety seat,was being used by someone else,and he was unable to get another seat from kimberly,so he drove to the hospital with valerie sitting unsecured in his sister lap.kimberly indicated she was not sure william ever had a child safety seat.
initially,william,kimberly,and the department agreed to a voluntary plan whereby ethan and jesus would be temporarily removed from the physical custody of the parents,who would be allowed monitored visits with the children and would participate in a family reunification program.william began parenting classes and grief counseling.however,the department concern about his failure to leave his mother home and establish a safe living environment for ethan and jesus,the pending criminal investigation against him in connection with valerie death and kimberly serious mental health,cognitive,anger management,and physical violence issues,led to a departmental recommendation that the juvenile court take jurisdiction.
on august,the department filed a dependency petition alleging that ethan and jesus came within the juvenile court jurisdiction under the provisions of section,subdivisions a,b,f,and j.under subdivisions a and b,the petition alleged that the parents history of domestic violence placed the children at risk of serious harm allegations a,b.the petition further alleged under subdivision b that the children were placed in an endangering situation,and were at risk of serious harm,because kimberly cognitive limitations required the provision of extensive services to enable her to properly supervise and care for her children allegation b.finally,the petition alleged under subdivisions b,f,and j that william had placed ethan and jesus at serious risk by driving their sibling,valerie,without the use of a child safety seat,which omission resulted in valerie death in a traffic accident allegations b,f,j.
after a detention hearing that same day,and finding statutory cause,the juvenile court ordered ethan and jesus removed from the parents physical custody pending a hearing.the court authorized the department to place the children with any suitable relative,or in foster care,and the parents were granted monitored visits.
the hearing occurred on october.as noted,both parties waived trial and submitted on the basis of the reports prepared by the department social workers.william counsel was permitted to argue,and did argue,that the allegations under section,subdivisions b,f,and j should not be sustained insofar as they were based on william failure to secure valerie in a child safety seat.
in making this argument,william counsel first asserted the department reports were mistaken in claiming that valerie was thrown from the car in the accident.counsel represented that the department attorney was willing to enter a stipulation to that effect.according to counsel,valerie was not thrown from the car.william mother was thrown from the car from the front seat.valerie sustained head injuries in the backseat and died from blunt force trauma to the head.however,counsel agreed,it is true,as alleged,that valerie died from injuries sustained as a result of not being strapped in a safety seat.that is what it says.italics added.
nonetheless,counsel urged,dependency jurisdiction over surviving children can not be based on a parent mere ordinary negligence causing death to another child the parent acts or omissions,he insisted,must have risen to the level of criminal negligence.william failure to secure valerie in a child safety seat,counsel argued,was no more than ordinary negligence,and thus would not support jurisdiction.
at the conclusion of the hearing,the court ordered allegations a domestic violence raising danger of nonaccidental injury to children and b danger to siblings from valerie death while not restrained in child safety seat dismissed or stricken.however,the court sustained,by a preponderance of evidence,allegations b risk of harm to children from parents domestic violence and b danger to children from kimberly cognitive impairments and the remaining allegations based on the fatal traffic accident allegations f,j.on the safety seat issue,the court observed,the law is absolutely clear about buckling a child in a child safety seat.i mean,i ca even imagine what the argument could possibly be.the section f count says the following the child parent or guardian caused the death of another child through abuse or neglect.he neglected to put his child in a child safety seat 
the court adjudged ethan and jesus to be dependent children.by clear and convincing evidence,the court further found that returning physical custody to william and kimberly would create a substantial risk of danger to the children physical and emotional,and that there were no reasonable means of protecting them without removing them from the parents physical custody.accordingly,the court placed the children under the department physical supervision.with the department approval,the court further ordered that william and kimberly should be allowed monitored visits with the children,and should receive family reunification services.
william appealed,urging that the allegations under subdivisions f and j of section allegations f and j,respectively could not be sustained on the basis of his mere civil negligence in failing to secure valerie in a child safety seat william also argued there was insufficient evidence to sustain the allegations under subdivision b of section concerning danger to the children from the parents domestic violence and kimberly cognitive impairments allegations b and b,respectively.the department also appealed,asserting that the trial court had improperly dismissed the allegations under subdivision b of section that were also based on the safety seat incident allegation b.
in a split decision,the court of appeal for the second appellate district,division one,rejected william arguments and accepted the department.the court of appeal reversed the trial court dismissal of allegation b,but otherwise affirmed.
in the court of appeal,william made two arguments that valerie traffic death while she was unrestrained in a child safety seat could not be a basis for dependency jurisdiction.first,william urged,as in the trial court,that the abuse or neglect leading to a child fatality,as specified in section f,requires criminal negligence flagrant,aggravated,or reckless conduct not a mere ordinary breach of care such as his single failure to secure valerie properly in his vehicle.second,he insisted that the lack of a safety seat was not a substantial contributing cause of valerie death,which was the result of a traffic accident in which another driver was entirely at fault.
in rejecting the first argument,the court of appeal majority noted that section f requires only a parent or guardian abuse or neglect italics added as a cause of another child death.nothing in the statute plain words,the majority noted,suggests that neglect means anything more than ordinary negligence.if there is ambiguity,the majority concluded,it is resolved by the legislative history of section f,on which william argument also relied.
as both william and the court of appeal noted,prior to,dependency jurisdiction under section f required the parent or guardian criminal conviction of causing another child death.the stated purposes of the revision were to eliminate the delay attendant on criminal proceedings,and to substitute a civil preponderance of evidence for a criminal beyond reasonable doubt standard of proof.
william urged,however,that the implicit requirement of a criminal degree of negligence was unchanged by the amendment.the majority disagreed.the legislature,the majority reasoned,sought to lessen the burden of establishing a child fatality basis for dependency jurisdiction by reverting to language that simply requires neglect by a parent or guardian,resulting in the death of another child.such a construction,the majority observed,is consistent with the dependency statute civil nature,and with its nonpenal purpose to protect children who are at risk in their parents or guardians care.hence,the majority concluded,the allegations based on william failure to secure valerie in a child safety seat,after which she died in a traffic accident,were properly sustained 
the court of appeal dissent urged it was unnecessary to determine what level of negligence is necessary for dependency jurisdiction under section f,because that provision requires that the surviving children under a parent or guardian care have suffered,or are currently at risk of,physical,sexual,or emotional harm.in the dissenter view,william single failure to secure valerie in a child safety seat,however tragic its consequences,was insufficient evidence of current risk of injury or harm to ethan and jesus.
william sought review,raising the criminal negligence and current risk of harm issues we granted review,and directed that,in addition to the arguments raised by the petition,the parties address the meaning of caused,as used in section f.thus,our order provided that i n addition to the issues specified in the petition for review,the parties are ordered to brief the following issue what is the definition of the word caused in the context of dependency jurisdiction under welfare and institutions code section,subdivision f does it mean the sole cause,or the contributing cause,or should the existence of an intervening,superseding cause be considered as part of the analysis we turn to these issues.
overview of dependency scheme.
notwithstanding any other provision of law,the purpose of the juvenile dependency law et is to provide maximum safety and protection for children who are currently being physically,sexually,or emotionally abused,being neglected,or being exploited,and to ensure the safety,protection,and physical and emotional of children who are at risk of that harm.the focus shall be on the preservation of the family as well as the safety,protection,and physical and emotional of the child.ibid.
the juvenile court takes a first,and preliminary,step in its protective duties by adjudging a minor to be a dependent of the court.with qualifications not pertinent here,a minor may be adjudged a dependent,subd.d if the juvenile court finds,by a preponderance of evidence,subd.a,any of the following the child has suffered or is at risk of suffering a serious,nonaccidental physical harm inflicted by a parent or guardian,subd.a or b serious physical harm or illness because of a parent or guardian i failure or inability to adequately supervise the child,ii willful or negligent failure to provide the child with adequate food,clothing,shelter,or medical treatment,or iii inability,due to mental illness,developmental disability,or substance abuse,to provide regular care for the child,subd.b the child is suffering serious emotional damage because of a parent or guardian conduct or because there is no parent or guardian capable of providing appropriate care,subd.c the child has been sexually abused a by a parent,guardian,or household member,or b by another person when the parent or guardian knew or reasonably should have known of the danger of abuse but failed to adequately protect the child,subd.d the child is under five years old,and has suffered serious physical abuse by a person known to the parent or guardian,if the parent or guardian knew or reasonably should have known that the abuse was occurring,subd.e t he child parent or guardian caused the death of another child through abuse or neglect,subd.f,italics added the child has been abandoned without support,or an incarcerated or institutionalized parent or guardian is unable to arrange for appropriate care,or the parent whereabouts are unknown and no other relative or adult custodian is willing to provide care and support,subd.g the child has been freed for adoption by relinquishment or by termination of parental rights,or an adoption petition has not been granted,subd.h the child has suffered acts of cruelty by a parent,guardian,or household member,or the parent or guardian knew or reasonably should have known the child was in danger of suffering acts of cruelty but failed adequately to protect the child from such acts,subd.i or t he child sibling has been abused or neglected,as defined in subdivision a,b,d,e,or i,and under the particular circumstances surrounding the abuse or neglect of the sibling there is a substantial risk that the child will be abused or neglected,as defined in those subdivisions,subd.j.
if the child has been taken into temporary protective custody,and remains in custody at the time the dependency petition is filed see et,the court must promptly hold a detention hearing to determine whether he or she should be returned to the parent or guardian pending the hearing.absent other extenuating circumstances that make the child release to the parent or guardian impossible or impractical see,subd.b,the court must order such release from custody unless it makes specific findings that the child physical health is in danger,or the child is suffering severe emotional damage,and there are no means of protecting the child physical or emotional health except by removing the child from the parent or guardian custody,subds.b,e.the court must consider whether there are available services that would prevent the need for further detention,subd.d,must provide such services if it believes they will allow the child to be returned to the parent or guardian,subds.b,e,d,and,in the event further detention is warranted,may order the child placement with a suitable relative,subd.f.
even after a dependency finding has been made,the statutory scheme is designed to allow retention of parental rights to the greatest degree consistent with the child safety and welfare,and to return full custody and control to the parents or guardians if,and as soon as,the circumstances warrant.thus,the juvenile court may limit the parent or guardian supervision and control of the child in specified ways,subd.a,but it can not remove the child from the parent or guardian physical custody,except in cases of voluntary relinquishment of the child,unless it finds,by clear and convincing evidence,that such custody would pose a substantial threat to the child of physical harm or sexual abuse,or that the child is suffering extreme emotional damage,and that there are no reasonable means of protecting the child physical or emotional short of such removal,subds.b d.if separation from one parent or guardian,but not both,is necessary,the court may consider the alternatives of removing the offending parent from the child home or allowing the nonoffending parent to retain custody,subd.c.if a fit nonresident parent is willing to assume custody,the court must order such placement,subds.a,e,and it may otherwise authorize placement of the child in the approved home of a relative or a nonrelative extended family member,subd.e.preferential consideration must be given to a request for placement by a fit relative of the child.
other than in cases of voluntary relinquishment,the general rule is that when a dependent child is removed from the parent or guardian physical custody,child welfare services,including family reunification services,must be offered,subd.a.reunification services need not be provided,however,when the court finds,by clear and convincing evidence,the existence of one or more specified circumstances,including the parent or guardian unknown whereabouts mental disability disinterest severe untreated substance abuse poor reunification performance,failure to obtain reunification services,or loss of parental rights,in another dependency case indicators of violent recidivism or severe or chronic abuse or neglect of the dependent child,a sibling,or another child,subd.b.among the findings that will permit a denial of reunification services is that the parent or guardian has caused the death of another child through abuse or neglect,subd.b.but even in these specified circumstances,the court may provide reunification services if it finds,by clear and convincing evidence,that reunification is in the dependent child best interest,subd.c.
when offered,reunification services must be provided for at least six months unless earlier terminated for cause,subd.a,and for up to months when it appears such extended services will result in the dependent child return to the parent or guardian custody,subd.c.meanwhile,court status reviews must occur at least every six months,to determine whether reunification efforts should continue or be terminated for cause,and whether the dependent child may be returned to the parent or guardian.at an month permanency review hearing,the court must order the child return unless the social worker responsible for managing the case can demonstrate,by a preponderance of evidence,that such return would create a substantial risk of detriment to the safety,protection,or physical or emotional of the child,subd.a.if the child is not returned at this point,the court must order a permanency planning hearing ibid,at which parental rights may be terminated and the child may be placed for adoption,except that permanency planning may be postponed in limited circumstances where a extension of reunification services is permitted,subd.b.
does a finding under section f require criminal negligence 
william first urges that an initial adjudication of dependency based on the parent or guardian neglect leading to the death of another child f requires evidence that the parent or guardian was guilty of criminal negligence,not a mere want of ordinary care.we disagree.
we have indicated that c riminal negligence refers to a higher degree of negligence than is required to establish negligent default on a mere civil issue.the negligence must be aggravated,culpable,gross,or reckless.citations.stark superior court cal th,d,stark.we see nothing in section f s language,history,or policies that demands such a standard.
when construing a statute,we look first to its words,because they generally provide the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.citation.we give the words their usual and ordinary meaning citation,while construing them in light of the statute as a whole and the statute purpose citation.pineda williams sonoma stores,cal th,d.if there is no ambiguity in the language,we presume the legislature meant what it said and the plain meaning of the statute governs.citation.only when the statute language is ambiguous or susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation,may the court turn to extrinsic aids to assist in interpretation.citation,at,d.
the noun neglect has a commonly understood meaning that is not confined to particularly gross,reckless,or blameworthy carelessness.for example,lay dictionaries define neglect,when used as a noun,as w ant of attention to what ought to be done the fact of leaving something undone or unattended to negligence oxford english dict.ed,the action of neglecting something,where to neglect as a verb is to fail to attend to sufficiently or properly not give proper attention or care to or to carelessly omit doing something that should be done webster new internat.dict,or the act or an instance of neglecting something merriam webster collegiate dict.ed,where to neglect as a verb is to leave undone or unattended to esp.through carelessness,d,or t o fail to do or carry out,as through carelessness or oversight american heritage,coll.ed.
resort to the most prominent legal reference work yields a similar result.black law dictionary ed.black defines the noun neglect as.t he omission of proper attention to a person or thing,whether inadvertent,negligent,or willful the act or condition of disregarding or.t he failure to give proper attention,supervision,or necessities,esp.to a child,to such an extent that harm results or is likely to result,d,italics added.
moreover,we derive no different sense of the word neglect,as used in section f,by reading this subdivision in conjunction with the other provisions of section.thus,section permits such an adjudication where,for example,a child has suffered,or is at risk of suffering,serious harm because of the parent or guardian failure or inability to adequately supervise or protect the child,subd.b or willful or negligent failure to adequately protect the child from a custodian with whom the child has been left or to provide the child with adequate food,shelter,or clothing,italics added or because the parent or guardian has failed to adequately protect the child against actual or threatened sexual abuse,or from acts of cruelty,of which the parent or guardian knew or reasonably should have known,subds.d,i or because a very young child has suffered severe physical abuse of which the parent or guardian knew or reasonably should have known,subd.e or when there is a substantial risk that the child will be abused or neglected,as measured by these standards,because his or her sibling has been similarly abused or neglected,subd.j.nothing in these terms suggests that when serious harm to a child has occurred or is threatened,the legislature intended to limit the neglect that can result in dependency to criminal negligence.
we also note the definition of neglect contained in the child abuse and neglect reporting act,et the purpose of this law is to protect children from abuse and neglect,subd.b by requiring certain persons who,in their professional or employment capacities,come into regular contact with children,to report their knowledge or reasonable suspicions that particular children are being abused or neglected.for purposes of this statute,neglect is defined as the negligent treatment or the maltreatment of a child by a person responsible for the child welfare under circumstances indicating harm or threatened harm to the child health or welfare.the term includes both acts and omissions on the part of the responsible person,italics added.
though the meaning of neglect,as used in section f,thus seems plain and unambiguous on its face,william urges that the history of this particular provision compels a different interpretation.as below,william stresses that prior to,section f specified that a child came within the juvenile court jurisdiction,and could be adjudged a dependent child of the court,if t he minor parent or guardian has been convicted of causing the death of another child through abuse or neglect.former f,as adopted by stats,ch,italics added.any such criminal conviction,william reasons,would necessarily have required not merely a breach of ordinary care,but a criminal level of abuse or neglect,an aggravated,culpable,gross,or reckless act or omission,stark,supra,cal th,d,leading to the child death,see,people anderson cal th,d,people concha cal th,d,but,subd.c crime of vehicular manslaughter includes traffic death caused by driver unlawful,nonfelonious act without gross negligence,or his or her lawful,potentially lethal act,performed in unlawful manner without gross negligence.hence,william suggests,the word neglect,as used in former section f,included the implicit requirement of a criminal,or gross,absence of care.
in,however,section f was amended to delete the requirement of a criminal conviction,and to provide simply for dependency jurisdiction on the basis that t he minor parent or guardian caused the death of another child through abuse or neglect.stats,ch,italics added.the legislative history of the amendment,william notes,indicates its purposes were to lower the dependency standard of proof,in child fatality cases,from the criminal standard of beyond a reasonable doubt to the usual civil dependency standard of a preponderance of evidence,and perhaps to avoid the delay of waiting for a criminal adjudication before proceeding in the dependency matter.com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended may,pp.but these aims,william argues,implied no third purpose to change the meaning of neglect,as used in the prior version of subdivision f,from the criminal level to a mere civil level of negligence.
however,we find nothing in section f legislative history to support either william premise,or his proposed conclusion.we have carefully examined the history of senate bill reg.sess.senate bill,which had adopted,in chapter of the statutes of,the criminal conviction requirement in former section f.this history discloses that a purpose of senate bill,which made major revisions to the child dependency law,was to n arrow the definition of abuse for purposes of dependency proceedings.the decision to remove a child from his or her home terminate parental rights would be based on the immediate danger or threat of danger to the child.under current law,the definition of abuse is broader it includes provisions regarding lack of parental control and is not focused solely on the immediate danger to the child.rules,off.of floor analyses,reading analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended may,see robert presley,letter to governor deukmejian,urging signature.but nothing in the legislative materials reveals the reason for imposing a criminal conviction requirement in particular,nothing indicates the legislature thereby sought,by implication,to alter the commonly understood meaning of neglect.
former section f merely required the existence of a criminal conviction arising from the lethal abuse or neglect of a child.neither the language nor the history of this section reveals any care or concern by the legislature about the specific offense for which the parent or guardian was convicted,or about the elements of such a conviction,including any heightened standard of negligence or neglect that might apply in the criminal proceeding 
the effect of the amendment,on the other hand,was to expand the provision concerning a parent or guardian involvement in a child fatality by eliminating the requirement of a conviction and instead simply to provide that the parent has caused the death of another child.com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended may,c,italics added.in sum,there is no basis in section f history to conclude the legislature ever specifically contemplated a special meaning of neglect,as used in the statute,such that a parent or guardian neglect resulting in the death of a child must have risen to the level of criminal negligence.
we have found no precedent for the proposition william advances.in in re th,d,the case closest on point,the court of appeal found sufficient evidence to support a dependency finding under section f.there,the father sought to quiet his newborn baby,who was sleeping between him and the baby mother.the father pushed the child toward the mother,felt the baby turn on its side,heard sounds he knew indicated the child was struggling to breathe,but,after two minutes,went back to sleep.while the father was sleeping,the baby suffocated,and the father efforts to resuscitate the child failed.the autopsy physician initially listed the death as accidental,but later changed the listing to undetermined.in re,at,d.he indicated he was unable to opine whether there was negligence,because simply allowing a baby to lie facedown is not generally sufficient to cause death,and he could not conclude that leaving the baby on its stomach for two minutes was reasonably likely to produce that result,at,d.
nonetheless,the court of appeal noted that the father knew there was a risk to his infant child,had the ability to assess the risk,was in a position to intervene,and failed to do so even though he heard the baby struggling to breathe.the appellate court did not suggest the father actions could,or did,amount to criminal negligence.it simply ruled that t he evidence is sufficient to support the juvenile court finding that the father caused the death of the baby through neglect.in re,supra,th,d.
we are referred to a number of decisions that apply not section,but section.as noted above,this latter statute governs the juvenile court authority to order the provision of reunification services,after it has adjudicated dependency and after it has found,on clear and convincing evidence,the need to remove the dependent child from the parent or guardian custody.section specifies that the court need not provide reunification services when,by clear and convincing evidence,it has found that the dependent child parent or guardian has caused the death of another child through abuse or neglect,subd.b and may not do so in such a case unless it further finds,by clear and convincing evidence,that such services are in the dependent child best interest,subd.c.in each cited case,the court of appeal simply found,on the particular evidence,that the aggravated circumstances surrounding the parent or guardian behavior leading to a child death either supported the juvenile court decision to deny or terminate reunification services,or demonstrated that the court decision to grant such services was an abuse of discretion.
thus,in in re alexis th,d alexis,the court of appeal dismissed a presumed father appeal from a juvenile court decision to terminate reunification services originally offered to him,when,at the month review,the court found that reunification would be detrimental to the child.the court of appeal deemed the appeal,which was based on alleged technical deficiencies in the juvenile court termination order,moot in light of the presumed father intervening felony child abuse conviction arising from the death of the dependent child sibling.as the court of appeal noted,the dependent child removal from parental custody had been based on that lethal incident,which involved very serious acts of abuse acts too shocking to ignore when the issue was whether the offending parent should receive reunification services,at,d.though the presumed father subsequent felony conviction was not a factor in the juvenile court decision to end reunification efforts,the court of appeal concluded,it would have been,in the wake of the conviction,an abuse of the juvenile court discretion to have offered the presumed father reunification services,at,d.
in patricio superior court th,d,the court of appeal,upholding a denial of reunification services,cited evidence that the mother children were victims of battered child syndrome at the hands of her former boyfriend,at,d that chronic,severe physical abuse had led to the death of one child,for which the boyfriend was convicted of murder that although made aware the boyfriend was mistreating the children,the mother had failed to take action to protect them that she remained in denial about the severity of the abuse and continued to think of the homicide as an accident and that because of her psychological makeup,she was likely to be involved in similar abusive relationships in the future.the court of appeal noted the juvenile court comment that the evidence demonstrated the mother general reckless disregard for the welfare of the minors,at,d,and further observed that the juvenile court had concluded the mother neglect rose to a level of criminal culpability,at,d,but also stressed that the juvenile court had considered all the reunification factors set forth in former subdivision h now subd.i of section before deciding that reunification services should not be provided.patricia,supra,at,d.
in in re ethan th,d ethan,the court relied heavily on alexis,supra,th,d,to conclude,under section,subdivisions b and c,that the evidence failed to support the juvenile court decision to grant reunification services to a mother of dependent children removed from her custody.the evidence indicated that the mother neglect of all her children,fueled by her methamphetamine habit,had allowed her husband to murder her infant son through chronic physical abuse culminating in asphyxia caused by a golf wad of paper lodged in the baby esophagus a crime for which the husband had been sentenced to life without parole.the court of appeal acknowledged the mother subsequent progress in drug rehabilitation,as stressed by the juvenile court.nonetheless,the appellate court applied the strong presumption against reunification services when a parent or guardian abuse or neglect has caused another child death.though the legislature has left open a tiny crack for reunification in such a case,the court of appeal explained ethan,supra,at,d,a parent seeking reunification under such circumstances faces an enormous hurdle,and the cases in which a parent will be able to justify reunification will be rare,at,d.the enormity of a death arising out of child abuse,the court of appeal stated,swallows up almost all,if not all,competing concerns,at,d,quoting alexis,supra,th,fn,d.
finally,in mardardo superior court th,d,mardardo,the evidence indicated that the dependent child father,when years old,raped and murdered another child.he subsequently engaged in violent and sexually inappropriate behavior while confined in the former california youth authority cya,failed to complete a sex offender program while in cya,was identified as a continuing threat to society with an antisocial personality disorder at the time of his dishonorable discharge from cya at age,and had since sustained convictions for failing to register as a sex offender and for an episode of domestic violence,at,d.under these circumstance,the court of appeal concluded,the juvenile court denial of reunification services was amply supported 
pointing to the aggravated facts of the cases described above,and the opinions various descriptions of the parents abuse or neglect therein as very serious,too shocking to ignore,reckless,criminal,and culpab le,william insists these decisions stand for the proposition that the strong presumption against reunification services when the parent or guardian has caused the death of another child through abuse or neglect,subd.b,applies only to a criminal level of lethal negligence.hence,he urges,we must apply the same standard to the parallel language in section f,the statute governing the initial adjudication of dependency.
we disagree.contrary to the inferences william seeks to draw,we find no implication in these decisions that criminal negligence is required under either statute.they merely concluded,in particular aggravated circumstances,that it was necessary,or proper,to apply the statutory presumption against reunification against a parent or guardian whose abuse or neglect had caused another child death.nothing in the reasoning or results of these cases suggests that only criminal negligence leading to a child fatality will allow a dependency finding under section f,or trigger the presumption against reunification set forth in section,subdivisions b and c.
on the contrary,it is t he enormity of a death of a child arising from parental inadequacy that invokes the provisions of sections and.ethan,supra,th,d,quoting alexis,supra,th,fn,d,italics added.the legislature has clearly provided that when one abuse or neglect has had this tragic consequence,there is a proper basis for a finding that his or her surviving child may be made a dependent of the juvenile court,and that,if the circumstances then also justify the child removal from the parent or guardian physical custody,a presumption against reunification should arise.
on the other hand,a finding of dependency based on section f does not automatically lead to the denial of reunification services under section.this case illustrates the point.with the department approval,the juvenile court granted such services to william,implicitly finding that,under all the circumstances applicable here,efforts to reunify him with ethan and jesus,and to restore his full parental rights,were in the children best interest 
william urges that an interpretation of section f to include mere ordinary negligence causing a child death may produce collateral estoppel problems when the same fatality gives rise to both dependency proceedings and criminal prosecution.as he notes,collateral estoppel issues were raised as concerns about the amendment to section f,which eliminated the need for a criminal conviction as a prerequisite to dependency proceedings based on another child death.com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended may,o care must be taken that the juvenile court action does not create a bar collateral estoppel as to any issues of fact.however,the legislature passed the amendments anyway.even under william interpretation,these amendments reduced the standard of proof of lethal abuse or neglect in a dependency case,and thus created a potential bar to criminal prosecution if an antecedent dependency proceeding resulted in a finding that criminal negligence had not been established by even a preponderance of evidence.see in re nathaniel d.lockwood superior court d.but see people percifull th,d,lucido superior court cal d.no additional potential interference with criminal prosecution arises from a dependency determination that even mere ordinary negligence was not established by a preponderance of evidence.a fortiori,such a conclusion would mean that criminal negligence could also not have been shown by that standard.
conversely,an antecedent criminal finding,beyond reasonable doubt,that the parent or guardian was guilty of criminal culpability in a child death would require that a dependency allegation under section f be sustained,regardless of whether the dependency standard was criminal,or mere civil,negligence.see people sims cal d,teitelbaum furs,dominion ins,cal d,century ins.schurtz th,d.thus,william fails to persuade us that collateral estoppel considerations influenced the legislature,contrary to the plain words of section f,to require criminal negligence before a parent or guardian neglect that caused the death of another child can lead to a dependency adjudication.
william cites in re th,d,which held that a dependency allegation under subdivision b of section a child has suffered,or there is a substantial risk that the child will suffer,serious physical harm as a result of the parent or guardian failure to adequately supervise or protect the child requires a finding of current risk,and thus can not be based on a single episode of parental misjudgment,even when a child was thereby injured.in re,at,d,disagreeing with contrary suggestions in in re th,d.but whatever the merits of that conclusion,it does not apply to section f so as to require criminal negligence,or otherwise bar a dependency finding,where a single episode of carelessness resulted in a child fatality.by its plain terms,section f applies whenever a parent or guardian abuse or neglect caused the death of another child.this phrase is singular,not plural,and it leaves no room for a conclusion that multiple instances of lethal carelessness are required.
william urges that applying a mere civil negligence standard to section f would lead to absurd results.he posits the examples of homeowning parents who fail to maintain the fence around their swimming pool,thus allowing a neighbor child to enter and drown in the pool,or a parent momentarily distracted by a cell phone conversation who,while driving,negligently strikes and kills a child who darts into the street 
but there is no absurdity in the plain language of section f.as we discuss in further detail below,the legislature could rationally conclude that when a parent or guardian negligence has led to the tragedy of a child death,the dependency court should have the power to intervene for the safety and protection of children remaining in the parent or guardian custody,even if the parent lethal carelessness can not necessarily be characterized as sufficiently gross,reckless,or culpable to be labeled criminal.indeed,the very purpose of the amendment was to promote the purposes of the juvenile dependency scheme by allowing such intervention,in the case of a child fatality,without the necessity of a criminal conviction.
the dependency scheme in general,and section f in particular,leaves ample room for discretionary treatment that allows for the equities of particular situations.informal investigation may confirm that no intervention by social service agencies is necessary in a particular case.or,as initially occurred here,parents may be offered voluntary services without judicial intervention.even where a dependency petition is filed,and its allegations are sustained,the court is not thereby required to declare dependency,or to remove children from the parent or guardian custody,or to deny reunification services.see discussion,ante.
under these circumstances,no inherent unfairness arises from applying the plain words of section f.thus,the issues raised by william fail to demonstrate that we should depart from them.accordingly,we conclude that,for purposes of a dependency adjudication under section f,the neglect by which a parent or guardian caused the death of another child may include the parent or guardian breach of ordinary care,and need not amount to criminal negligence.
there can be no doubt that william failure to secure his month old daughter in a child safety seat before driving her in a vehicle a direct violation of statute,subd.a,constituted,at a minimum,a breach of ordinary care,and william does not argue otherwise.hence,the dependency findings based upon section f do not fail on grounds that he failed to meet the statutory standard of abuse or neglect.
does section f require independent evidence of a current risk of harm to living children in the parent or guardian care 
william next urges,as did the court of appeal dissent,that a dependency finding under section f requires specific evidence of a nexus between the particular circumstances of the child fatality caused by the parent or guardian and a substantial current risk of harm to living children in that person custody and care.again,we disagree.
william points to section statement that the purpose of the dependency statutes is to provide maximum safety and protection for children who are currently being abused,neglected,or exploited,and to ensure the safety,protection,and of children who are at risk of that harm.italics added.he also notes that many other subdivisions of section stress actual harm to a child,or a substantial risk that such a child will suffer harm,as a prerequisite to the child eligibility for dependency,id,subds.a child has suffered
