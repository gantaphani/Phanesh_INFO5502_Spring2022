in an effort to address the intractable problem of parental drug abuse in juvenile dependency cases,the san diego county superior court implemented an aggressive treatment program known as the substance abuse recovery management system sarms.a parent who is believed to have alcohol drug issues will be assessed and,if necessary,ordered to participate in sarms as part of a family reunification case plan.super.san diego county,local rules,rule hereafter rule.the san diego court enforces parental compliance with sarms using not just the carrot of reunification,but also the stick of compulsory jail time.for every incident of noncompliance with sarms,an offending parent may be cited for contempt and incarcerated for up to five days.rule.the stick proved to be quite large in this case,in which a mother was sentenced to days in custody for failing to enter drug treatment.
the court of appeal found,and all parties agree,that this lengthy jail sentence was an abuse of the juvenile court discretion.however,in reaching this decision,the court of appeal declined to resolve whether a court may,under some circumstances,enforce its reunification orders through contempt proceedings and incarceration.we granted the mother petition for review limited to the following issues did the court have authority to require the minor mother to participate in a substance abuse program as part of her reunification plan did welfare and institutions code section authorize the court to hold her in contempt and incarcerate her for failing to comply with that component of the plan 
the first question is not controversial.both sides agree,and we conclude,that a juvenile court has the power to order a parent to participate in substance abuse treatment as part of a reunification plan.as to the second question,we conclude contempt sanctions may not be used as punishment solely because the parent failed to satisfy a reunification condition.
the court certainly has broad statutory authority and inherent power to enforce its orders using contempt sanctions.however,the juvenile court intervention to protect a child from abuse or neglect is regulated by an explicit statutory scheme.if the court determines that a child is at risk,it is authorized to remove the child from parental custody and ultimately to terminate parental rights.in order to regain custody,a parent must demonstrate,generally through compliance with a reunification plan,that a return to parental care is in the child best interest.it is well settled,however,that reunification services are voluntary,and an unwilling parent may not be compelled to participate.the statutory scheme contains a specific remedy for parental shortcomings during reunification.the statutes consistently provide that a parent failure to participate in services is evidence that a return to parental custody would be detrimental to the child,subd.a,subds.e f,subd.a.if the problem is left uncorrected,these findings will ultimately lead to a permanent loss of custody and parental rights.real party suggests the availability of brief periods of incarceration for contempt would be beneficial,before a court imposes the ultimate sanction of parental rights termination.while that argument can be made,there is no indication that the legislature intended parents to be punished in this manner.moreover,as the facts of this case demonstrate,allowing juvenile courts to incarcerate parents for failing to comply with reunification orders is problematic because there are no statutory principles to guide or constrain the court.accordingly,given the unique nature of reunification orders,we conclude that the juvenile court may not use its contempt power to incarcerate a parent solely for the failure to satisfy aspects of a voluntary reunification case plan.
background 
the relevant facts are not disputed.on the day of his birth,both nolan and his mother,kayla,tested positive for amphetamines.mother admitted using drugs and alcohol during pregnancy and agreed she needed residential treatment.mother had not been in contact with the child father and did not know how to reach him.
the san diego county health and human services agency agency filed a juvenile dependency petition alleging that because of her drug use mother had failed to protect her child,subd.b.mother submitted the case on the social worker report.the juvenile court found the allegations true and placed the minor with a maternal aunt.when mother agreed to participate in a reunification plan,the court ordered her to enroll in the sarms program.the court specifically advised mother that if she failed to follow the program rules she could be held in contempt of court and sentenced to five days in jail for each violation.mother acknowledged receiving a copy of the order referring her to sarms.
when mother enrolled in sarms on july,she tested positive for methamphetamine.as part of sarms,she was directed to attend sessions at a recovery center five days a week.during the next month,mother frequently missed recovery sessions,failed to stay in contact with sarms,and did not submit to drug testing.when mother also failed to appear in court for her first sarms review hearing,the court issued a bench warrant for her arrest.mother remained out of contact with sarms,and on october,the court removed her from the program.
on december,mother appeared in court for a hearing on a section petition to change the minor placement.after mother admitted her sarms violations,the court found her in contempt on counts of noncompliance with the sarms participation the court entered a contempt judgment and sentenced mother to five days for each violation,for a total of days in custody.however,it stayed imposition of judgment on the condition that mother enroll in and complete a residential drug treatment program.mother failed to do so and failed to appear at a contested review hearing.based on the agency report,the court terminated reunification services and set the matter for a permanency planning hearing.the court also issued a warrant for mother arrest for her failure to appear.
two weeks later,following her arrest,mother was returned to court.nolan counsel joined mother attorney in arguing that mother should not be punished for failing to complete services because services had been terminated and there was a great likelihood mother would lose parental rights at the upcoming section hearing.nonetheless,because mother broke her promise to enter treatment,the court lifted the stay of the contempt judgment and sentenced mother to days in custody.she was later released after serving days.although the juvenile court had initially intended to keep mother jailed until she had served percent of the sentence days,it was persuaded to release her when all counsel,including counsel for the agency,argued mother continued confinement was pointless because reunification services had been terminated.the court expressed frustration with parents who break their agreements and voiced an intent to impose future contempt sentences immediately for instances of noncompliance.
mother attempted to appeal from the contempt order.the appellate court held that the exclusive means of challenging such an order is by a petition for extraordinary writ relief.rather than dismissing the appeal,however,the court exercised its discretion to treat it as a writ petition.the court also concluded mother claims were not moot because the juvenile court had not vacated its original order and the dependency proceedings had not reached finality.the court declined to reach the merits of mother argument that the juvenile court lacked the authority to issue the contempt order.even assuming the trial court had such authority,the court of appeal observed the sentence,imposed after reunification services had been terminated,was a clear abuse of discretion.
we conclude the juvenile court does have authority to order parental participation in substance abuse treatment as part of a reunification plan,but section does not permit the court to punish a parent for contempt solely on the basis that the parent has failed to comply with the treatment.
discussion 
i.the sarms program 
the juvenile court of san diego county implemented sarms in april sarms is an intensive case management program operated by contract with an independent provider that specializes in managing drug and alcohol cases.see milliken rippel,effective management of parental substance abuse in dependency cases center for families,children cts,hereafter milliken rippel.
if a social worker notifies the juvenile court that the parent of a minor child may have a substance abuse problem,the court refers the parent to sarms for an assessment.rule.if the parent has not voluntarily submitted to a sarms assessment by the time the court assumes jurisdiction over the minor,the court will order the parent to report to sarms for assessment within hours.ibid.the san diego court thus requires a sarms assessment in all dependency cases when the potential for parental substance abuse exists.if the assessment indicates a need for treatment,a sarms caseworker prepares a recovery services plan,which is made part of the parent reunification case plan.the sarms plan typically includes counseling,therapy,education and support groups,as well as frequent random drug and alcohol tests.every two weeks,sarms reports to the court on the parent compliance and the results of drug tests.every days,the court holds a hearing to review the parent progress in treatment.milliken rippel,supra,center for families,children,at.
once participation in sarms is made part of a parent reunification case plan,the parent can not withdraw from the program without suffering consequences.any noncompliance with the sarms recovery plan,including missed or failed drug tests or missed meetings,results in a cascade of judicial sanctions made mandatory by a local court rule.rule states that every noncompliant event will result in the following sanctions for the first violation,the parent will receive a judicial reprimand.for each subsequent violation,the parent will be cited for contempt of court for disobeying a court order a finding of contempt may result in a fine incarceration for up to five days.after a parent has been jailed for contempt,he or she is referred to the county dependency drug court.ibid.the dependency drug court supervises a program involving even more judicial oversight.milliken rippel,supra,center for families,children,at.as with sarms,a parent failure to comply with drug court orders results in sanctions of increasing severity,including up to five days in custody for each noncompliant event.ibid.repeated failures to comply with drug court orders may result in the parent termination from drug court and the scheduling of a permanency planning hearing.
ii.authority to order substance abuse treatment in reunification plan 
the overarching goal of dependency proceedings is to safeguard the welfare of california children.in re josiah cal th,d.family preservation,with the attendant reunification plan and reunification services,is the first priority when child dependency proceedings are commenced.citation.reunification services implement the law strong preference for maintaining the family relationships if at all possible.citation.in re elizabeth th,d.reunification services are typically understood as a benefit provided to parents,because services enable them to demonstrate parental fitness and so regain custody of their dependent children.see,in re baby boy th,d explaining reunification services are a benefit and rejecting an argument that parents have a constitutional entitlement to services.
the legislative scheme reflects this reunification goal.with some limited exceptions not relevant here,section requires the juvenile court to order child welfare services for both parent and child when a minor is removed from parental custody.unless an exception applies,whenever a child is removed from a parent or guardian custody,the juvenile court shall order the social worker to provide child welfare services to the child and the child mother and statutorily presumed father or guardians,subd.a see tonya superior court cal th,d,parent receipt of services is presumed at the outset of dependency proceedings.this requirement implements the law strong preference for maintaining the family relationship if at all possible.citation.in re baby boy,supra,th at,d.
the reunification statute further provides when counseling or other treatment services are ordered,the parent or guardian shall be ordered to participate in those services,unless the parent or guardian participation is deemed by the court to be inappropriate or potentially detrimental to the child,subd.a.in addition,under section,subdivision c the juvenile court may direct any and all reasonable orders to the parents or guardians of the child who is the subject of any proceedings under this chapter as the court deems necessary and proper to carry out the provisions of this section that order may include a direction to participate in a counseling or education program,including,but not limited to,a parent education and parenting program operated by a community college,school district,or other appropriate agency designated by the court the program in which a parent or guardian is required to participate shall be designed to eliminate those conditions that led to the court finding that the child is a person described by section.we have held that this provision authorizes the juvenile court to order that a parent undergo counseling as a condition of visitation even after dependency proceedings have ended.in re chantal cal th,d.
of course,the juvenile court discretion in fashioning reunification orders is not unfettered.its orders must be reasonable and designed to eliminate those conditions that led to the court finding that the child is a person described by section,subd.c.the reunification plan must be appropriate for each family and be based on the unique facts relating to that family.citation.in re christopher th,d.thus,in in re basilio th,d,the court reversed a dispositional order requiring substance abuse counseling because there was no evidence to suggest either parent had a substance abuse problem.on the other hand,a reunification order requiring submission to random drug and alcohol testing was found to be appropriate in the case of a father who had a history of excessive alcohol and drug use.in re christopher,at,d see also sara superior court cal th,d,requirement that mother be free of drugs and alcohol during visitation was reasonable to protect the children.
the legislature has given juvenile courts broad discretion to fashion reunification orders designed to address the problems that have led to a dependency proceeding.unfortunately,in a great many dependency cases,parental substance abuse is one such problem.the juvenile court has authority to require a parent to submit to substance abuse treatment as part of a reunification plan as long as the treatment is designed to address a problem that prevents the child safe return to parental custody.it is important to note that a parent may choose to waive reunification services,subd.b.but when a parent accepts services,and when substance abuse treatment is reasonably related to the minor welfare,the juvenile court has authority to order the parent to participate,subd.a.
here,no one disputes that the court appropriately ordered substance abuse treatment as part of the reunification plan to which mother agreed.mother tested positive for methamphetamine when her son was born,and she admitted that she needed drug treatment.however,the parties interpret this order differently.whereas mother views it as a condition of reunification,the agency views it as a command that,if disobeyed,may be punished by incarceration.the disagreement thus concerns how a reunification order can be enforced.
iii.use of contempt power to enforce reunification orders 
a notable feature of sarms is its reliance on judicial officers to enforce requirements by imposing increasingly severe sanctions for every noncompliant event.rule.the san diego county superior court form order directing participation in sarms identifies the following behavior as sanctionable failure to timely enroll in the sarms program a positive result from an test dirty test failure to appear for a court hearing failure to appear for an test no show diluting or tampering with a urine sample provided to sarms for an test failure to participate in all required sarms and treatment program activities failure to attend required counseling sessions failure to comply with the rules of the sarms recovery services plan and treatment program a dishonest statement to the court.form sdsc.the court local rules explicitly provide for standardized sanctions for the first violation,the parent will receive a judicial reprimand.for each subsequent violation,the parent will be cited for contempt of court for disobeying a court order rule.although the rules do not dictate a specific punishment for such contempt findings,a report on the sarms program prepared by the san diego county juvenile court indicates incarceration is frequently imposed.
a.the contempt power 
it is well settled that the court has inherent power to enforce compliance with its lawful orders through contempt.shillitani united states,d in re michael cal d.the legislature has recognized this power of the juvenile court in section,which states any willful disobedience or interference with any lawful order of the juvenile court or of a judge or referee thereof constitutes a contempt of court.see in re michael,at,in re ricardo th,d concluding,based on michael,that juvenile court inherent contempt power is statutorily implemented by.
however,not every violation of a court order is subject to punishment as a contempt of court.the court traditional contempt power rests on the premise that the right of courts to conduct their business in an untrammeled way lies at the foundation of our system of government and that courts necessarily must possess the means of punishing for contempt when conduct tends directly to prevent the discharge of their functions.wood georgia,d.in re michael,supra,cal d at.based on this premise,we long ago explained that contempt is an act,committed in or out of the court presence,which tends to impede,embarrass or obstruct the court in the discharge of its duties.in re shortridge cal.the contempt power represents the inherent power of a trial court to exercise a reasonable control over all proceedings connected with the litigation before it,a power which should be exercised by the courts in order to insure the orderly administration of justice.citations.cooper superior court cal d.contempt is generally a summary procedure designed to protect the dignity of the court in the exercise of its jurisdiction.in re buckley cal d.
the court power to compel compliance with its orders to ensure the orderly administration of justice does not extend to punishing violations of substantive law when such violations do not impair the dignity or functioning of the court.when the legislature has established a specific penalty for a transgression,courts may not impose a contempt punishment that is inconsistent with the legislative scheme.in re lynch cal d,in our tripartite system of government it is the function of the legislative branch to define crimes and prescribe punishments,and such questions are in the first instance for the judgment of the legislature alone.violations of substantive law,whether criminal or otherwise,must be adjudicated and punished in accordance with the legislature directives.as explained below post,d at,at,the legislative scheme involved here contemplates that the ultimate penalty for a parent failure to satisfy reunification plan requirements is the loss of parental rights.
relevant case law 
we previously addressed the juvenile court contempt power in the context of delinquency proceedings.in in re michael,supra,cal d at pages to,a minor who had been made a ward of the court under section,subdivision b,was ordered to attend school regularly as a condition of his probation.after learning that the minor had several unexcused absences,the juvenile court held a hearing,found the minor in contempt for willful disobedience of the order to attend school,and ordered the minor confined for hours in the custody of the probation department.in re michael,at.although we upheld this exercise of contempt power id.at,the juvenile court authority over a delinquent ward is quite different from its authority over the parent of a dependent child.when a juvenile delinquency petition is sustained,the court assumes jurisdiction over the minor and has the power to issue orders controlling the minor conduct,subd.a.likewise,in dependency proceedings,the juvenile court jurisdiction is over the minor it is the abused or neglected minor who becomes a ward of the court,not the deficient parent.the juvenile court authority to control the behavior of a parent in dependency proceedings is not direct,but rather ancillary to its jurisdiction over the child.when the court orders a parent to participate in certain services,compliance with the order is a condition the court has placed on the parent reunification with the child.accordingly,our decision in michael is not directly applicable here 
no published decision from a california appellate court has explored the extent of the juvenile court power to impose contempt sanctions as punishment for a parent failure to comply with reunification orders.in the cases cited by the agency,most of the statements about the juvenile court ability to exercise contempt power are dicta,and none addresses the use of contempt to enforce reunification orders.see in re ashley th,fn,d suggesting contempt could be used to force an unwilling child welfare agency to provide services in re stacy th,fn,d suggesting parent failure to appear in court constitutes a contempt,not a default in re nemis th,d same in re tiffany th,d suggesting parent violation of a confidentiality order could be punished as a contempt.nationwide,the agency has directed us to only one case suggesting the juvenile court may use contempt power to enforce reunification orders,and that decision rests on louisiana statutes that have no apparent california counterpart.see state in the interest of anderson so d,holding juvenile court may use contempt to enforce orders directing a parent into drug counseling and psychological testing but only after it has adjudicated her a parent in need of supervision pursuant to a specific statutory procedure.
the lack of pertinent authority matters because reunification orders are unlike orders in other types of civil cases.when a juvenile court orders a parent to comply with a reunification case plan,it directs the parent to do and refrain from doing many things,often of a highly personal nature.these reunification orders are not limited to controlling the conduct of litigation or the parties behavior in court.reunification orders also differ from court orders in criminal cases.reunification orders may resemble criminal probation orders in the scope of conduct they regulate,but,unlike probationers,parents of dependent children are not subject to the court jurisdiction because they have been convicted of a crime.instead,they agree to a reunification plan to avoid losing custody of their children.further,if a criminal defendant fails to comply with a probation condition,any penalty is imposed following a hearing on the alleged violation,not by a summary contempt proceeding.in the dependency context,the juvenile court intervenes to protect a child,not to punish the parent.in re malinda cal d.the statutory scheme is designed to permit the parent to remedy a deleterious situation and resume parental rights and responsibilities.
c.the statutory scheme governing reunification 
participation is voluntary 
to the extent reunification orders intrude upon a parent liberty,the legislature has determined these intrusions are justified by the need to protect children and enable their safe return to competent parental care whenever possible.however,it is not the court role to force a parent to participate in services.it is well established that r eunification services are voluntary,and can not be forced on an unwilling or indifferent parent.citation.in re jonathan d.in re christina th,d see also in re michael d,fn.there is no requirement that a social worker take the parent by the hand and escort him or her to and through classes or counseling sessions.section,subdivision b explicitly states that reunification services need not be provided to a parent who wishes to forgo them this rule makes sense.while reunification is the preferred outcome when it serves the interests of both parent and child,no interest is well served by compelling inadequate parents to shoulder responsibilities they are unwilling to accept or unable to discharge.
nevertheless,the agency contends a parent participation in reunification services becomes mandatory if services are ordered at the dispositional hearing.in other words,according to the agency,once services are ordered a parent can not change her mind.she must participate,or risk a contempt order and possible incarceration.the agency cites no support for this argument beyond the statement in section,subdivision a that,w hen counseling or other treatment services are ordered,the parent shall be ordered to participate in those services italics added.the agency contends this requirement that parental participation be ordered,combined with the court power to enforce its orders with contempt proceedings,indicates the legislature intended to enable the juvenile court to use contempt sanctions to secure compliance with its reunification orders.
we decline to adopt this novel reading of the statutes.by providing that a parent shall be ordered to participate in services,section,subdivision a imposes a duty on the juvenile court to order participation as part of the parent reunification plan unless the court finds such participation would be inappropriate or potentially harmful to the minor.this language in itself does not impose a mandatory duty on the parent to participate in services.
consequences of failure to participate 
in considering the nature of a parent obligation to comply with reunification orders,it is important to examine what sanctions or punishment the legislature has specified for noncompliance.section itself provides that,with respect to a dependent child under age three at the time of detention,the court must inform the parent that failure to participate regularly in any treatment programs or to cooperate or avail himself or herself of services provided as part of the child welfare services case plan may result in a termination of efforts to reunify the family after six months,subd.a.at the same time,the court must inform parents about section and the specific possibility that parental rights may be terminated,subd.a.these prescribed warnings do not include the possibility of being held in contempt of court,and punished by fine or incarceration,for failure to participate in services.indeed,this possibility is not mentioned in any of the numerous statutorily required advisements.
given the complexity of the statutory scheme governing dependency,a single provision can not properly be understood except in the context of the entire dependency process of which it is part.cynthia superior court cal th,d.other dependency statutes indicate the legislature envisions the punishment for noncompliance with reunification services to be loss of those services and,ultimately,loss of parental rights.for example,at the review hearing,the juvenile court must decide whether return of a dependent child to the parent would be detrimental to the child.section,subdivision e requires the court,in making this decision,to consider the efforts or progress,or both,demonstrated by the parent and the extent to which he or she availed himself or herself of services provided,and it specifies that failure of the parent or legal guardian to participate regularly and make substantive progress in treatment programs shall be prima facie evidence that return would be detrimental.likewise,a parent failure to progress in treatment constitutes evidence of detriment at the,subd.f and,subd.a review hearings.additionally,if the child was under age three when removed from custody or part of a sibling group with a child under age three,a finding at the review hearing that the parent failed to participate regularly and make substantive progress in a treatment plan can result in the termination of services at that point and scheduling of a section permanency planning hearing,subd.e.
these findings are critical.once services have been terminated,the juvenile court focus shifts from family reunification to the child permanent placement and,and the burden accordingly shifts to the parent to show that a termination of parental rights is not in the child best interests.in re marilyn cal th,d,in re zachary th,d.a parent may regain custody after reunification services have been terminated only by showing that changed circumstances demonstrate a return to parental custody is in the child best interests.in re marilyn,at,d,in re kimberly th,d.this burden may be especially difficult to sustain for a parent who failed to continue with substance abuse treatment during the reunification period.see in re kimberly,at,fn,d.
thus,the dependency statutes repeatedly make clear that the consequence of failure to participate in reunification services is the loss of parental rights.the agency has not called our attention to a single california statute or judicial decision approving the notion that juvenile courts may force compliance with reunification orders by punishing parental lapses with contempt proceedings and incarceration.although the agency suggests the threat of incarceration offers a useful strategy for preventing substance abuse relapses its reasoning could just as logically be applied to other aspects of a parent case plan.for example,parents are often ordered to adhere to a certain visitation schedule.under the agency analysis,a parent who misses a visit could be held in contempt of court and fined,or incarcerated.setting aside the question of whether such a sanction would be excessive,it seems clearly inconsistent with the statutory scheme governing reunification 
use of contempt to punish noncompliance with sarms 
downplaying the punitive nature of incarceration,the agency seeks to characterize the sanctions imposed for noncompliance with sarms as civil contempt.its argument overlooks the distinctions long recognized between civil and criminal contempt.where the primary object of contempt proceedings is to protect the rights of litigants,the proceedings are regarded as civil in character.on the other hand,where the object of the proceedings is to vindicate the dignity or authority of the court,they are regarded as criminal in character even though they arise from,or are ancillary to,a civil action.citation.morelli superior court cal d.civil contempt is a remedy imposed to coerce compliance with a lawful order of the court.shillitani united states,supra,at.civil contemnors hold the key to the jail cell in their own pocket,and can secure their release at any time by following the court order.in re lifschutz cal d,fn,morelli,at,basis for civil contempt is the omission to perform an act which is still within the person power to perform see code civ,subd.a.because the confinement imposed for civil contempt is conditional in nature,based on continuing conduct,the length of incarceration is indefinite,depending entirely upon the contemnor continued defiance.shillitani,at.on the other hand,so long as specific procedures are observed to safeguard due process,criminal contempt may be used to punishpast conduct in violation of a court order.see code civ,see also cal.judges benchguide courtroom control cjer contempt and sanctions,describing required procedures for exercise of contempt power.the object of such proceedings is to vindicate the dignity or authority of the court.morelli,at.
all parties appear to agree that the contempt order in this case was purely punitive.the juvenile court sentenced mother to days in custody because she broke her promise to enter treatment.reunification services had already been terminated and mother had been ejected from the sarms program.the contempt order here can not be construed as civil in nature.
the agency would have us look beyond the facts of this case,however,arguing that the contempt orders typically made to enforce sarms compliance are civil in nature.the assertion fails.the fact remains that contempt orders in this context are punitive in purpose and effect.after a reprimand for the first violation,the san diego county court local rules mandate that the court issue contempt citations for every incidence of a parent noncompliance with sarms.rule.although the court retains discretion to set the particular fine or sentence for each contempt citation ibid,in all such cases the punishment will be based on the parent past conduct and imposed for a set period of time.there is nothing a parent who has been incarcerated for a noncompliant event rule can do or say to purge the contempt.the mere fact that a contempt order has been made in the course of civil proceedings does not render it a civil contempt.see shillitani united states,supra,at.character and purpose of the contempt order are what determine whether it is civil or criminal.when a sarms contempt order is based on completed conduct,and can not be purged or cured by the parent,the sanctions imposed are criminal in nature.although sarms contempt orders might be characterized as efforts to secure future parental compliance with reunification orders,the sanctions have this effect only in the general sense that all punishment can have a deterrent effect.certainly,if a court finds a tardy litigant in contempt and orders him jailed for a day,the order will encourage the litigant to appear on time for his next hearing.but this deterrence of future tardiness does not render the original contempt order civil in nature.because it punishes past,rather than ongoing,conduct,the order constitutes a criminal contempt.the same is true here.
the routine imposition of criminal contempt sanctions for noncompliance with sarms underscores the troubling aspect of injecting punitive measures into reunification.dependency proceedings are not designed to prosecute parents.in re malinda,supra,cal d at,in re walter th,d.in a dependency proceeding,the state is empowered to intervene because a parent inadequacy puts a child at risk.parents who fail or refuse to meet their parental obligations face the profound loss of a relationship with their child.parents who break the law are subject to criminal prosecution,but they are also entitled to the panoply of rights and protections provided by constitution and statute to those who stand accused of a crime.
conclusion 
rule of the san diego county superior court local rules is disapproved to the extent that it calls for imposition of a fine or jail sentence under the mechanism of contempt solely for the purpose of punishing a parent failure to comply with a condition of a reunification case plan.we emphasize that our decision here is not intended to strip the juvenile court of its contempt authority to control the proceedings before it and protect the dignity of its exercise of jurisdiction.in re buckley,supra,cal d at.extreme parental misconduct that jeopardizes the child safety,such as taking the child without permission or engaging in dangerous acts during visitation,could well justify punishment by contempt because such conduct interferes with the court exercise of its own authority over the dependent child.our holding in this case is limited to the use of contempt power to punish a parent failure to satisfy a condition imposed simply to facilitate reunification.we express no opinion on the propriety of contempt sanctions in other circumstances.
disposition 
the judgment of the court of appeal is affirmed.
i agree with the majority insofar as it affirms the court of appeal decision to annul the contempt judgment entered against mother in the juvenile court.however,i do so for reasons invoked not by the majority itself,but by the court of appeal,namely,that use of the contempt power under the particular facts of this case constituted a clear abuse of discretion.mother noncompliance with the reunification plan led to her ejection from the substance abuse recovery program in which she was ordered to participate,the termination of reunification services which the juvenile court was required to provide and which mother never duly waived,and the scheduling of permanency planning proceedings necessary to terminate her parental rights.once this chain of events occurred,the juvenile court had no discretion to use the sanction of,a hefty term of days in as punishment for failing to follow orders whose sole purpose was the retention of parental rights.as evidenced by the court of appeal opinion,no more needs to be said to resolve this case.
i respectfully disagree with the majority broader rationale and conclusion that the contempt power is never available to enforce lawful orders routinely directed at parents in the course of the reunification process before those services have been terminated.until today ruling,it appears juvenile courts had authority to at least sparingly order modest fines brief stints in to punish past failures to comply with the conditions of to encourage wavering parents who have not spurned the statutory process altogether,and who have submitted to the court jurisdiction,to abide by their continuing duty to undergo substance abuse treatment ordered to help the family reunite.today contrary holding,which gives juvenile courts no ability to enforce their orders other than by permanently terminating the rights of such parents,seems at odds with the statutory scheme,which seeks to restore functional families whenever possible.the majority decision will likely come as a surprise to juvenile courts statewide,whose inherent and statutory powers of enforcement are now diminished,and to the legislature,whose statute authorizing contempt in dependency cases has now been judicially curtailed.my reasoning is as follows.
the juvenile court is a department of the superior court specially authorized to administer the juvenile court law,including the dependency scheme.see welf,in re ashley th,d.as relevant here,the juvenile court is required,upon removing a dependent child from parental custody see,subd.c,to order that social welfare services be provided to parent and child,and that parents who wish to retain their parental rights participate in those services,subd.a see cynthia superior court cal th,d.various provisions give the juvenile court power to compel parental participation in this regard unless the parents have made clear,by the means set forth in the statute,that they wish to forgo reunification.
as noted by the majority,such compulsion of a participating parent comes in the form of orders designed to eliminate the substance abuse or other problems that caused the child to be adjudged a dependent of the court and removed from parental custody in the first place,ante,at,at.thus,section,subdivision c contemplates the issuance of any and all reasonable orders to the parents of the dependent child as the court deems necessary and proper for treatment,counseling,and educational purposes.another provision,section,allows the juvenile court to direct all such orders to the parent or parents that best provide for the care,custody,and support of the children under its jurisdiction.
of course,reunification services need not be provided to a parent who does not wish to maintain the family unit,and who makes an informed decision to reject them.as noted by the majority,section,subdivision b allows the parent to waive such services,where the waiver is expressed in writing,executed while the parent is represented by counsel,and accompanied by an advisement of the possible consequences,including the termination of parental rights and placement of the dependent child for adoption.see,ante,at,fn,at,fn.see also,subd.a parental decision to forgo reunification may lead to establishment of legal guardianship.nothing in the statutory scheme or the majority opinion suggests there are any limits on the time for waiving reunification services and relinquishing the parental role.see,subd.b parent may voluntarily relinquish dependent child to state welfare or county adoption agency at any time.the legislature has thus ensured that the mo
