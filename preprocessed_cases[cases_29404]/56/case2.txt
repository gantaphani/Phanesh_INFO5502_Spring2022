eighteen months after her husband,robert capato,died of cancer,respondent karen capato gave birth to twins conceived through in vitro fertilization using her husband frozen sperm.karen applied for social security survivors benefits for the twins.the social security administration ssa denied her application,and the district court affirmed.in accord with the ssa construction of the social security act act,the court determined that the twins would qualify for benefits only if,as h a specifies,they could inherit from the deceased wage earner under state intestacy law.the court then found that robert was domiciled in florida at his death,and that under florida law,posthumously conceived children do not qualify for inheritance through intestate succession.the third circuit reversed.it concluded that,under e,which defines child to mean,inter alia,the child or legally adopted child of an insured individual,the undisputed biological children of an insured and his widow qualify for survivors benefits without regard to state intestacy law.
held the ssa reading is better attuned to the statute text and its design to benefit primarily those supported by the deceased wage earner in his or her lifetime.moreover,even if the ssa longstanding interpretation is not the only reasonable one,it is at least a permissible construction entitled to deference under chevron natural resources defense council.
a congress amended the act in to provide that,as relevant here,e very child as defined in section e of this title of a deceased insured individual shall be entitled to a child insurance benefit.d.section e,in turn,defines child to mean the child or legally adopted child of an individual,a stepchild under certain circumstances,and the grandchild or stepgrandchild of an individual or his spouse under certain conditions.unlike e and,e lacks any elaboration of the conditions under which a child qualifies for benefits.section h a,however,further addresses the term child,providing in determining whether an applicant is the child or parent of an insured individual for purposes of this subchapter,the commissioner of social security shall apply the intestacy law of the insured individual domiciliary state.an applicant who does not meet h a criterion may nonetheless qualify for benefits under other criteria set forth in h b and h,but respondent does not claim eligibility under those other criteria.regulations promulgated by the ssa closely track h and in defining w ho is the insured natural child,cfr.as the ssa reads the statute,h governs the meaning of child in e and serves as a gateway through which all applicants for insurance benefits as a child must pass.
b while the ssa regards h as completing e sparse definition of child,the third circuit held,and respondent contends,that e alone governs whenever the claimant is a married couple biological child.there are conspicuous flaws in the third circuit and respondent reading the ssa offers the more persuasive interpretation.
nothing in e tautological definition suggests that congress understood the word child to refer only to the children of married parents.the dictionary definitions offered by respondent are not so confined.moreover,elsewhere in the act,congress expressly limited the category of children covered to offspring of a marital union,see d a,and contemporaneous statutes similarly distinguish child of a marriage from the unmodified term child.nor does e indicate that congress intended biological parentage to be prerequisite to child status.a biological parent is not always a child parent under law.furthermore,marriage does not necessarily make a child parentage certain,nor does the absence of marriage necessarily make a child parentage uncertain.finally,it is far from obvious that respondent proposed definition would cover her posthumously conceived twins,for under florida law a marriage ends upon the death of a spouse.
the ssa finds a key textual cue in h a opening instruction in determining whether an applicant is the child of an insured individual for purposes of this subchapter,the commissioner shall apply state intestacy law.respondent notes the absence of any in e to h,but she overlooks that h provides the crucial link it requires reference to state intestacy law to determine child status not just for h purposes,but for purposes of this subchapter,which includes both d and e.having explicitly complemented e by the definitional provisions contained in h,congress had no need to place a redundant in e.
the act commonly refers to state law on matters of family status,including an applicant status as a wife,widow,husband,or widower.see,b,h a.the act also sets limitations,see weinberger salfi,and time limits qualify the statutes of several states that accord inheritance rights to posthumously conceived children.in contrast,no time constraint attends the third circuit ruling in this case,under which the biological child of married parents is eligible for survivors benefits,no matter the length of time between the father death and the child conception and birth.
because a child who may take from a father estate is more likely to be dependent during the parent life and at his death,mathews lucas,reliance on state intestacy law to determine who is a child serves the act driving objective,which is to provide dependent members of a wage earner family with protection against the hardship occasioned by the loss of the insured earnings,califano jobst.although the act and regulations set different eligibility requirements for adopted children,stepchildren,grandchildren,and stepgrandchildren,it hardly follows,as respondent argues,that applicants in those categories are treated more advantageously than are children who must meet a h criterion.respondent charges that the ssa construction of the act raises serious constitutional concerns under the equal protection component of the due process clause.but under review,the appropriate standard here,the regime passed by congress easily passes inspection.
c because the ssa interpretation of the relevant provisions,is at least reasonable,the agency reading is entitled to this court deference under chevron.chevron deference is appropriate when it appears that congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law,and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.united states mead.here,the ssa longstanding interpretation,set forth in regulations published after rulemaking,is neither arbitrary or capricious in substance,n or manifestly contrary to the statute.mayo foundation for medical ed.and research united states.it therefore warrants the court approbation.

michael astrue,commissioner of social security,petitioner karen capato,on behalf of,et.
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit 
justice ginsburg delivered the opinion of the court.
karen and robert capato married in.robert died of cancer less than three years later.with the help of in vitro fertilization,karen gave birth to twins months after her husband death.karen application for social security survivors benefits for the twins,which the social security administration ssa denied,prompted this.the technology that made the twins conception and birth possible,it is safe to say,was not contemplated by congress when the relevant provisions of the social security act act originated or were amended to read as they now do.
karen capato,respondent here,relies on the act initial definition of child in e c hild means the child or legally adopted child of an insured individual.robert was an insured individual,and the twins,it is uncontested,are the biological children of karen and robert.that satisfies the act terms,and no further inquiry is in order,karen maintains.the ssa,however,identifies subsequent provisions,h and h c,as critical,and reads them to entitle biological children to benefits only if they qualify for inheritance from the decedent under state intestacy law,or satisfy one of the statutory alternatives to that requirement.
we conclude that the ssa reading is better attuned to the statute text and its design to benefit primarily those supported by the deceased wage earner in his or her lifetime.and even if the ssa longstanding interpretation is not the only reasonable one,it is at least a permissible construction that garners the court respect under chevron natural resources defense council.
karen capato married robert capato in may.shortly thereafter,robert was diagnosed with esophageal cancer and was told that the chemotherapy he required might render him sterile.because the couple wanted children,robert,before undergoing chemotherapy,deposited his semen in a sperm bank,where it was frozen and stored.despite robert aggressive treatment regime,karen conceived naturally and gave birth to a son in august.the capatos,however,wanted their son to have a sibling.
robert health deteriorated in late,and he died in florida,where he and karen then resided,in march.his will,executed in florida,named as beneficiaries the son born of his marriage to karen and two children from a previous marriage.the will made no provision for children conceived after robert death,although the capatos had told their lawyer they wanted future offspring to be placed on a par with existing children.shortly after robert death,karen began in vitro fertilization using her husband frozen sperm.she conceived in january and gave birth to twins in september,months after robert death.
karen capato claimed survivors insurance benefits on behalf of the twins.the ssa denied her application,and the district court for the district of new jersey affirmed the agency decision.see app.to pet.for cert.decision of the administrative law judge,at district court opinion.in accord with the ssa construction of the statute,the district court determined that the twins would qualify for benefits only if,as h a specifies,they could inherit from the deceased wage earner under state intestacy law.robert capato died domiciled in florida,the court found.under that state law,the court noted,a child born may inherit through intestate succession only if conceived during the decedent lifetime,at 
the court of appeals for the third circuit reversed.under e,the appellate court concluded,the undisputed biological children of a deceased wage earner and his widow qualify for survivors benefits without regard to state intestacy law,courts of appeals have divided on the statutory interpretation question this case presents.compare ibid.and barnhart,biological but posthumously conceived child of insured wage earner and his widow qualifies for benefits,with beeler astrue,and schafer astrue,posthumously conceived child qualification for benefits depends on intestacy law of state in which wage earner was domiciled.to resolve the conflict,we granted the commissioner petition for a writ of certiorari.
congress amended the social security act in to provide a monthly benefit for designated surviving family members of a deceased insured wage earner.child insurance benefits are among the act measures.stat,as amended,d.an applicant qualifies for such benefits if she meets the act definition of child,is unmarried,is below specified age limits or or is under a disability which began prior to age,and was dependent on the insured at the time of the insured death.d 
to resolve this case,we must decide whether the capato twins rank as child ren under the act definitional provisions.section d provides that e very child as defined in section e of this title of a deceased insured individual shall be entitled to a child insurance benefit.section e,in turn,states the term child means the child or legally adopted child of an,a stepchild under certain circumstances,and the grandchild or stepgrandchild of an individual or his spouse who meets certain conditions.
the word child,we note,appears twice in e opening sentence initially in the prefatory phrase,t he term child means,and,immediately thereafter,in subsection e child or legally adopted child the first of three beneficiary categories.unlike e and,which specify the circumstances under which stepchildren and grandchildren qualify for benefits,e lacks any elaboration.compare e referring simply to the child of an individual with,e applicant must have been a stepchild for at least nine months before the insured individual death.
a subsequent definitional provision further addresses the term child.under the heading determination of family status,h a provides in determining whether an applicant is the child or parent of an insured individual for purposes of this subchapter,the commissioner of social security shall apply the intestacy law of the insured individual domiciliary state.
an applicant for child benefits who does not meet h a criterion may nonetheless qualify for benefits under one of several other criteria the act prescribes.first,an applicant who is a son or daughter of an insured individual,but is not determined to be a child under the provision,nevertheless ranks as a child if the insured and the other parent went through a marriage ceremony that would have been valid but for certain legal impediments.h b.further,an applicant is deemed a child if,before death,the insured acknowledged in writing that the applicant is his or her son or daughter,or if the insured had been decreed by a court to be the father or mother of the applicant,or had been ordered to pay child support.h c i.in addition,an applicant may gain child status upon proof that the insured individual was the applicant parent and was living with or contributing to the support of the applicant when the insured individual died.h c ii 
the ssa has interpreted these provisions in regulations adopted through rulemaking.the regulations state that an applicant may be entitled to benefits as a natural child,legally adopted child,stepchild,grandchild,stepgrandchild,or equitably adopted child.cfr.defining w ho is the insured natural child,the regulations closely track h and h.they state that an applicant may qualify for insurance benefits as a natural child by meeting any of four conditions the applicant could inherit the insured personal property as his or her natural child under state inheritance laws the applicant is the insured natural child and his or her parents went through a ceremony which would have resulted in a valid marriage between them except for a legal impediment before death,the insured acknowledged in writing his or her parentage of the applicant,was decreed by a court to be the applicant parent,or was ordered by a court to contribute to the applicant support or other evidence shows that the insured is the applicant natural father or mother and was either living with,or contributing to the support of,the applicant.cfr a internal quotation marks omitted.
as the ssa reads the statute,h governs the meaning of child in e.in other words,h is a gateway through which all applicants for benefits as a child must pass.see beeler,at the regulations make clear that the ssa interprets the act to mean that the provisions of h are the exclusive means by which an applicant can establish child status under e as a natural child.
karen capato argues,and the third circuit held,that h,far from supplying the governing law,is irrelevant in this case.instead,the court of appeals determined,e alone is dispositive of the controversy,at.under e,child means child of an insured individual,and the capato twins,the third circuit observed,clearly fit that definition they are undeniably the children of robert capato,the insured wage earner,and his widow,karen capato.section h comes into play,the court reasoned,only when a claimant status as a deceased child is in doubt.at.that limitation,the court suggested,is evident from h caption determination of family status.here,there is no family status to determine,the court said,at,so h has no role to play.
in short,while the ssa regards h as completing e sparse definition of child,the third circuit considered each subsection to control different situations h governs when a child family status needs to be determined e,when it does not.when is there no need to determine a child family status the answer that the third circuit found plain whenever the claimant is the biological child of a married couple.at 
we point out,first,some conspicuous flaws in the third circuit and respondent karen capato reading of the act provisions,and then explain why we find the ssa interpretation persuasive.
nothing in e tautological definition child means the child of an individual suggests that congress understood the word child to refer only to the children of married parents.the dictionary definitions offered by respondent are not so confined.see webster new international dictionary ed.defining child as,inter alia,i n law,legitimate offspring also,sometimes,esp.in wills,an adopted child,or an illegitimate offspring,or any direct descendant,as a grandchild,as the intention may appear collegiate dictionary ed.child means son or daughter,or descendant see also restatement third of property a n individual is the child of his or her genetic parents,and that may be so whether or not the parents are married to each other elsewhere in the act,congress expressly limited the category of children covered to offspring of a marital union.see d a referring to the legitimate child of an individual.other contemporaneous statutes similarly differentiate child of a marriage legitimate child from the unmodified term child.see,servicemen dependents allowance act of,ch,stat.defining child to include legitimate child,child legally adopted,and,under certain conditions,stepchild and illegitimate child internal quotation marks omitted.
nor does e indicate that congress intended biological parentage to be prerequisite to child status under that provision.as the ssa points out,i n,there was no such thing as a scientifically proven biological relationship between a child and a father,which is part of the reason that the word biological appears nowhere in the act.reply brief.notably,a biological parent is not necessarily a child parent under law.ordinarily,a relationship does not exist between an adoptee and the adoptee genetic parents.uniform probate code a,supp.amended.moreover,laws directly addressing use of today assisted reproduction technology do not make biological parentage a universally determinative criterion.see,cal.fam.code ann.b west supp.the donor of semen for use in artificial insemination or in vitro fertilization of a woman other than the donor wife is treated in law as if he were not the natural father of a child thereby conceived,unless otherwise agreed to in a writing signed by the donor and the woman prior to the conception of the child.laws,ch,west any child born to a married woman as a result of artificial insemination with the consent of her husband,shall be considered the legitimate child of the mother and such husband.
we note,in addition,that marriage does not ever and always make the parentage of a child certain,nor does the absence of marriage necessarily mean that a child parentage is uncertain.an unmarried couple can agree that a child is theirs,while the parentage of a child born during a marriage may be uncertain.see reply brief respondent errs in treating marital and undisputed as having the same meaning.
finally,it is far from obvious that karen capato proposed definition biological child of married parents,see brief for respondent would cover the posthumously conceived capato twins.under florida law,a marriage ends upon the death of a spouse.see price price,so.if that law applies,rather than a preemptive federal law,the capato twins,conceived after the death of their father,would not qualify as marital children 
resisting the importation of words not found in e child means the biological child of married parents,brief for respondent the ssa finds a key textual cue in h a opening instruction in determining whether an applicant is the child of an insured individual for purposes of this subchapter,the commissioner shall apply state intestacy law.emphasis added.respondent notes the absence of any in e to h.brief for respondent.she overlooks,however,that h provides the crucial link.the subchapter to which h refers is subchapter ii of the act,which spans through.section h reference to this subchapter thus includes both d and e.having explicitly complemented e by the definitional provisions contained in h,congress had no need to place a redundant in e.see schafer,at congress,in h a,provided plain and explicit instruction on how the determination of child status should be made on this point,the statute text could hardly be more clear.
the original version of today h was similarly drafted.it provided that,i n determining whether an applicant is the child of an insured individual for purposes of sections of this title,the board shall apply state intestacy law.m ed.emphasis added.sections embraced c and k,the statutory predecessors of d and e ed,respectively.
reference to state law to determine an applicant status as a child is anything but anomalous.quite the opposite.the act commonly refers to state law on matters of family status.for example,the act initially defines wife as the wife of an insured individual,if certain conditions are satisfied.b.like e,b is,at least in part,tautological wife means the insured wife one must read on,although there is no,to h rules on d etermination of family status to complete the definition.section h a directs that,for purposes of this subchapter,the law of the insured domicile determines whether the applicant and the insured individual were validly married,and if they were not,whether the applicant would nevertheless have the same status as a wife under the state intestacy law.emphasis added.the act similarly defines the terms widow,husband,and widower.see c,f,g,h a.
indeed,as originally enacted,a single provision mandated the use of state intestacy law for determining whether an applicant is the wife,widow,child,or parent of an insured individual.m ed.all wife,widow,child,and parent applicants thus had to satisfy the same criterion.to be sure,children born during their parents marriage would have readily qualified under the formulation because of their eligibility to inherit under state law.but requiring all child to qualify under state intestacy law installed a simple test,one that ensured benefits for persons plainly within the legislators contemplation,while avoiding entanglement in the traditional realm of family relations.
just as the act generally refers to state law to determine whether an applicant qualifies as a wife,widow,husband,widower,h ed,child or parent,h a,so in several sections b,c,e,f,g,the act sets limitations.see weinberger salfi,discussing e requirement that,as a check against deathbed marriages,a relationship must exist not less than nine months immediately preceding insured death time limits also qualify the statutes of several states that accord inheritance rights to posthumously conceived children.see cal.prob.code ann.c west supp.allowing inheritance if child is in utero within two years of parent death.stat.ann.child in utero within three years or born within months iowa code ann.a west supp.child born within two years.stat.ann.a west child born within three years cent.code ann.lexis child in utero within three years or born within months.see also uniform probate code k,supp.treating a posthumously conceived child as in gestation at the individual death,but only if specified time limits are met.no time constraints attend the third circuit ruling in this case,under which the biological child of married parents is eligible for survivors benefits,no matter the length of time between the father death and the child conception and birth.see tr.of oral arg.counsel for karen capato acknowledged that,under the preemptive federal rule he advocated,and the third circuit adopted,a child born four years after her father death would be eligible
