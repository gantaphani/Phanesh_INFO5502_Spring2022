describing the matter as shocking to me,even after all of these years,and one of the worse cases i have seen,where there such sadism and such disregard for a child feelings,the experienced dependency bench officer in this proceeding sustained allegations under welfare and institutions code section,subdivisions a serious physical harm inflicted nonaccidentally two counts,b failure or inability to protect five counts,i cruelty two counts and j abuse of sibling three counts declared cristian and his sister alice dependents of the juvenile court removed the children from the care and custody of their mother,angela,and from zachary,cristian stepfather and alice father angela current husband placed cristian in arizona with his presumed father,mark and ordered an expedited evaluation by the los angeles county department of children and family services department of possible placement of alice with her maternal grandmother or.reunification services for both angela and zachary were denied.
without in any way challenging the overwhelming evidence of extreme physical abuse inflicted on cristian by zachary or attempting to defend her passive role in allowing zachary to torture her son,angela appeals from the jurisdiction findings and disposition order,emphasizing cristian had been the subject of a family law custody order in arizona and arguing,even though she was the custodial parent and living with zachary and cristian in california,the juvenile court findings and order are void because the court failed to fully comply with the procedural requirements of the uniform child custody jurisdiction and enforcement act uccjea,et after it had initially exercised temporary emergency jurisdiction to protect cristian.we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
the arizona custody order,angela move to california and mark efforts to enforce his rights 
cristian was born in june in tucson,arizona.due to father mark our child life,in september angela and mark,who had never married,signed a memorandum of care plan following a successful mediation through the family center of the conciliation court,arizona superior court in pima county.a september,arizona state court family law order granted angela sole legal custody and primary physical custody of cristian.mark was granted visitation parenting time over various weekend periods and holidays.
angela and zachary married on september,after dating for approximately three years.according to angela,she,zachary and cristian moved to california sometime in while she was pregnant with alice who was born in may.angela subsequently told one of the department social workers she left arizona after cristian told her and zachary that mark and mark father had sexually molested him.
records submitted by the department,however,reflect that cristian had attended school in tucson through friday,march,immediately before the school spring break.mark reported he had gone to the school the following friday,march,to pick up cristian for the weekend,unaware the school was closed.mark stated angela had confirmed he would be picking up cristian on that friday in his last conversation with her.on march,angela sent mark a text message informing him she was traveling to california with cristian.mark,who had previously contacted the tucson police department to report angela interference with his visitation rights,filed a missing person report on april,with the tucson police.
following cristian disappearance mark initiated proceedings in the arizona family law case seeking full custody of his son.angela was served by publication.on september,the court found angela had taken cristian out of the state without notice to mark in violation of arizona law and ordered angela to return cristian to arizona to permit mark to exercise his parenting time with the child.a further hearing was set for november.the court directed mark to personally serve angela,whose address in california he now had,with notice of the hearing.
the emergency call following zachary extreme physical abuse of cristian 
on september,angela called the police emergency operator to report child abuse in progress.responding officers were met at the door by zachary,whom they detained,and found cristian standing naked in the bathtub with cuts and bruises all over his face and body,including severe bruises on his genitals.cristian told officers zachary had tried to cut his penis off with scissors.
both cristian and alice were immediately detained.cristian was taken to the pediatric intensive care unit at northridge hospital alice was placed in shelter care.at the hospital,where his injuries were extensively documented,cristian explained zachary had burned him with a stick that had fire at the end and cut his face using a drill gun.cristian also reported zachary had kept him locked in a closet for four months,only letting him out to use the bathroom,and made him smoke marijuana.
zachary was arrested.while los angeles police officer barrios was obtaining zachary personal information,zachary volunteered,the boy is my.his mom and i have him here together.we moved from arizona where his father and grandfather were molesting him.now i find out he is doing the same thing to my month old daughter there was blood in my daughter vagina and he was touching my wife while she slept.i lost it and hit him.when alice was subsequently examined,there were no signs of sexual abuse.
los angeles police officers simmons and palmer interviewed angela at a parking lot shortly after she called the emergency operator.holding alice and crying hysterically,angela said she and zachary had left tucson because mark was sexually abusing cristian.after angela and zachary got married about a year ago,zachary became physically abusive,including beating her with his fists and choking her until she almost passed out.angela had bruises consistent with physical abuse.zachary also physically abused cristian,who was continually covered from head to toe in old and new bruises,and the abuse was becoming increasingly more violent.angela corroborated cristian assertions he had been forced to live in a closet and smoke marijuana she did not send cristian to school because she was afraid mark would be able to track him down and get visitation.she did not report the abuse,much of which she had witnessed,because she did not want zachary to get caught growing marijuana.angela also told officers she had been diagnosed with schizophrenia,chronic depression and manic depression 
the dependency petition and detention hearing 
on september,the department initiated dependency proceedings on behalf of cristian and alice pursuant to welfare and institutions code section,subdivisions a serious physical harm,b failure to protect,d sexual abuse and i cruelty.with respect to sexual abuse,the petition alleged mark had sodomized cristian.at a detention hearing the same day,angela and zachary submitted to the removal of the children without challenging the evidentiary presentation in the department detention report.angela was granted monitored visitation with both children but zachary,who was then incarcerated on charges of child and spousal abuse,was granted monitored visitation with only alice and ordered not to have any contact with cristian.the department was given discretion to release cristian to mark.the court set a further hearing for september,for an update on efforts to locate and interview mark.
in a report submitted in connection with the september,hearing,the department summarized its interview with mark and his wife mark first found out angela had married zachary after cristian told him zachary had beaten him with a wooden spoon when he failed to eat his dinner.angela and cristian disappeared in march after mark had started taking steps to go to court.after mark became too distraught to talk,his wife explained she had discovered cristian engaging in simulated sex with her son.cristian told her he had seen angela and zachary having sex and a magazine with naked people in it.angela later called mark,reporting that zachary said cristian told him he was being sexually abused by his father and paternal grandfather.cristian,however,had never met his paternal grandfather,who lived in mexico.the court appointed counsel to represent mark and ordered monitored visitation for him in california.
the ceding of jurisdiction by the arizona court 
in its report for the jurisdiction and disposition hearing,initially scheduled for october,the department described the arizona family law custody and visitation order and provided copies of the child care plan signed by angela and mark and the september,order directing cristian return to the state.in a supplemental report the department summarized an assessment of cristian by a multidisciplinary assessment team.cristian said he wanted to live with mark and had lied when he previously told the social worker mark had sodomized him.the department recommended cristian be released to mark with a order and family maintenance services.
at the october,hearing mark counsel questioned whether the juvenile court,having issued its initial detention order to protect cristian from zachary,continued to have jurisdiction under the uccjea in light of the custody case in arizona.the court agreed to contact the arizona court before the november,arizona court date to determine if it would allow the case to proceed in california.angela did not challenge the california court jurisdiction at this hearing or at any other time while the matter was pending before the juvenile court.
the court ordered cristian released to mark on the condition mark obtain therapy and other services for cristian.angela was ordered to have no contact with cristian pending a report from his therapist.the case was continued to november,for a progress report on the uccjea issue.the matter was again continued to december,because the juvenile court had not yet contacted the arizona court.
at the november,hearing in arizona superior court,mark,appearing in person,was sworn and questioned by the court as was artin narssiyan,a dependency investigator for los angeles county,who appeared telephonically.a minute order filed november,stated,the court notes that the juvenile court in california has given custody of the minor child to mark,and the minor child is residing with him.there are criminal charges that have been brought forth against angela and her current husband for child abuse against the minor child the court finds that the juvenile court in california has jurisdiction in this matter and this case shall proceed in the state of california at this time 
at the december,progress hearing the juvenile court stated,the arizona superior court in pima county has ceded jurisdiction to this court,and that court found that juvenile court in california has jurisdiction and the case shall proceed in the state of california.the court continued the matter to january,for the jurisdiction hearing.
the jurisdiction and disposition hearings 
at the conclusion of the jurisdiction hearing on january,the court dismissed the allegations cristian had been abused by mark,struck a reference to alcohol abuse by angela and sustained the petition as amended.the court declared the children dependents of the court,ordered them removed from angela and zachary custody,denied reunification services,and placed cristian with mark.the court retained jurisdiction over cristian,notwithstanding he was doing well with mark and mark had obtained services for him,because of the severity of the trauma.
angela and zachary filed timely notices of appeal from the court january,order.angela appeal does not challenge the court findings and order as to alice.zachary appointed counsel filed a brief that raised no issues,and zachary has submitted no additional letter identifying any contentions he wished to raised on appeal.accordingly,his appeal is dismissed as abandoned pursuant to in re phoenix cal th and in re sade cal th 
discussion 
temporary emergency jurisdiction under the uccjea 
the uccjea,adopted in california effective january,see in re th,and arizona effective january,see welch doden roberts,governs dependency proceedings and is the exclusive method for determining the proper forum to decide custody issues involving a child who is subject to a sister state custody order,subd.b s ubdivision a of is the exclusive jurisdictional basis for making a child custody determination by a court of this state see in re stephanie cal th,in re jaheim th.all parties here agree that arizona is cristian home state within the meaning of the uccjea see,subd.g see generally in re marriage of nurie th,parent abduction of his child from the other parent can not form the basis for establishing jurisdiction in the abductor state of residence and that,at the outset of these proceedings,arizona had exclusive,continuing jurisdiction to make all custody decisions regarding cristian except as specified in section provisions for temporary emergency jurisdiction.
section provides an exception to the exclusive jurisdictional bases for making an initial child custody determination or modifying a sister state custody order,subds.a,b.a california court may exercise temporary emergency jurisdiction when a child is present in this state and it is necessary in an emergency to protect the child because the child is subjected to,or threatened with,mistreatment or abuse,subd.a.an emergency exists when there is an immediate risk of danger to the child if he or she is returned to a parent.in re jaheim,supra,th at in re nada th.although emergency jurisdiction is generally intended to be short term and limited,the juvenile court may continue to exercise its authority as long as the reasons underlying the dependency exist.in re jaheim,at see in re nada,at.
the finding of an emergency should only be made after an evidentiary hearing,supra,th at u nsubstantiated allegations are insufficient to invoke emergency jurisdiction.nonetheless,the child may be detained prior to that hearing for his or her protection.see id.at,fn.w hen a petition contains allegations of an emergency situation,it is proper for a court to issue an interim custody order to protect the child pending the hearing in re th.
when a california court asserting temporary emergency jurisdiction is aware that a child custody determination has been made by another jurisdiction,the california court shall immediately communicate with the other court,subd.d.to make an appropriate order under the uccjea,the california court needs to know whether the sister state court wishes to continue its jurisdiction and how much time it requires to take appropriate steps to consider further child custody orders,supra,th at accord,in re marriage of fernandez abin sanchez th.the court may allow the parties to participate in the communication.if the parties are not able to participate in the communication,they must be given the opportunity to present facts and legal arguments before a decision on jurisdiction is made,subd.b.additionally,a record must be made of substantive communications between the courts,and the parties granted access to the record,subds.c,d.
both california and arizona,in identical language adopted from the uniform child custody jurisdiction and enforcement act,provide a court of the state with exclusive,continuing jurisdiction to make child custody determinations may decline to exercise its jurisdiction at any time if it determines that it is an inconvenient forum under the circumstances and that a court of another state is a more appropriate forum.under both statutes the parties are permitted to submit information,and the court is directed to consider all relevant factors in deciding whether it is appropriate for a court of another state to exercise jurisdiction,including the nature and location of the evidence required to resolve the pending litigation see welch doden roberts,supra,at the child best interests may be considered in the context of a request under to determine that arizona,although the home state,is an inconvenient forum such that jurisdiction should be elsewhere.
failure to comply with the procedural requirements of the uccjea is subject to harmless error analysis,supra,th at see in re jesusa cal th,w e typically apply a analysis when a statutory mandate is disobeyed,except in a narrow category of circumstances when we deem the error reversible per se.before any judgment can be reversed for ordinary error,it must appear that the error complained of has resulted in a miscarriage of justice.cal,art.vi.reversal is justified only when the court,after an examination of the entire cause,including the evidence,is of the opinion that it is reasonably probable that a result more favorable to the appealing party would have been reached in the absence of the error.people watson cal d,see in re th,failure to require statutory procedures for terminating dependency jurisdiction subject to watson harmless error review.
the juvenile court properly exercised emergency jurisdiction any error in failing to follow the procedural requirements of the uccjea was harmless 
angela does not dispute nor could she on any reasonable basis the juvenile court properly detained cristian under section following the initial hearing on september.the evidence presented by the department at the detention hearing established the child had been the victim of a horrendous,beating and his removal from zachary and angela was unquestionably necessary for his protection.there was significant evidence an emergency existed under the uccjea.see in re,supra,th at e mergencies under the uccjea generally involve sexual or physical abuse.rather,angela contends the juvenile court failed to follow the required procedures to maintain its jurisdiction after the initial detention order it did not immediately contact the arizona court,allow her to participate in communications with arizona,permit her to argue whether arizona was an inconvenient forum or hold an additional evidentiary hearing before arizona ceded jurisdiction.because of those procedural errors,angela contends,the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction and its january,jurisdiction findings and disposition orders are void.
the juvenile court proceedings here,although flawed,substantially complied with the essential procedural requirements of the uccjea and fully satisfied the central goals of the act.see in re jaheim,supra,th at t he purposes of the uccjea in the context of dependency proceedings include avoiding jurisdictional competition and conflict,promoting interstate cooperation,litigating custody where child and family have closest connections,avoiding relitigation of another state custody decisions,and promoting exchange of information and other mutual assistance between courts of other states.the juvenile court conducted an evidentiary hearing the detention hearing before concluding immediate action was necessary to protect cristian from an ongoing threat of serious physical harm and only then entered a temporary custody order.angela was present at that hearing,with appointed counsel,and did not challenge the department evidentiary presentation.this initial assertion of jurisdiction was fully consistent with,and authorized by,section.
angela insistence that some additional evidentiary hearing was necessary for the juvenile court to maintain temporary emergency jurisdiction over cristian is misplaced.in people beach d beach the validity of a mother conviction for stealing her child from her husband custody turned on the jurisdiction of the california court to make a temporary award of custody to the husband under the uccja,the predecessor to the uccjea.in upholding the custody order and affirming the conviction,the court of appeal explained,the uccja involves a multistep process.initially,the court must determine whether it has jurisdiction over the particular custody dispute.the jurisdictional determination is a vitally important preliminary decision.citation.it should not be made in a rush to judgment but rather after a full and fair evidentiary hearing.id.at.the beach court statement was directed to a finding of jurisdiction under any of the four grounds listed in former civil code section for asserting jurisdiction under the uccja,not solely the exercise of jurisdiction to prevent an emergency under former civil code section,subdivision c,the forerunner of section.several subsequent cases involving temporary emergency jurisdiction under section have either quoted or paraphrased the beach court full and fair hearing language.contrary to angela argument,however,none of those cases holds a detention hearing under welfare and institutions code section at which the parents and child their counsel are present does not constitute the evidentiary hearing required to assert temporary emergency jurisdiction.see in re,supra,th at,supra,th at.
to be sure,if the juvenile court had attempted to exercise something beyond temporary emergency jurisdiction if it had proceeded to adjudicate the dependency petition and to enter disposition orders without the arizona court first ceding jurisdiction a further evidentiary hearing would have been required to determine the basis on which the california court had jurisdiction to modify the arizona court custody order.see,see generally,supra,th at e xcept as authorized by section,a california court may not make an initial custody order or modify a sister state child custody order unless prescribed conditions not here present exist.that is the lesson of beach and the mandate of section,which requires notice and an opportunity to be heard be given to all persons entitled to notice before a child custody determination is made under the uccjea.but the juvenile court here deferred the hearing on the dependency petition until information about the california proceedings had been exchanged with the arizona family law court and it gave the arizona court an opportunity to conduct its own hearing to determine whether to exercise its exclusive,continuing jurisdiction.once the arizona court ceded that jurisdiction,the juvenile court was empowered to conduct further hearings on the dependency petition.
nonetheless,there is some merit to angela critique of the juvenile court conduct of these proceedings.although the court was aware at the detention hearing in that arizona had made an initial custody order,the court failed to immediately communicate with the arizona family law court.indeed,although the juvenile court on october,belatedly stated it would contact the arizona court,the record is devoid of any evidence direct communications ever took place.it appears the arizona court received information about the california dependency proceedings from mark and one of the department investigators,who both appeared mark in person the investigator by telephone at the family court hearing on november,in pima county.the california court information about the arizona proceedings was limited to the receipt of minute orders from that court in addition,the court failed to expressly limit the duration of its detention order,which temporarily removed cristian from angela custody,to a period sufficient to permit the department to seek an appropriate order from the arizona court as required by section,subdivision c.
both of these procedural flaws,however,were harmless.see,supra,th at statutory requirement to immediately contact the court that had issued the initial custody order is directory rather than mandatory the failure to comply with this procedural step does not invalidate the governmental action to which the procedural requirement relates.although the exchange of information was delayed,by the time the arizona court ceded jurisdiction on november,and well before the juvenile court conducted the jurisdiction hearing on the dependency petition,each court was fully advised of what had transpired in the other.it is not reasonably probable the delay and indirect method of communication had any impact on the outcome of the case.
angela remaining contention that the juvenile court erred in not allowing her to argue whether arizona was an inconvenient forum is simply mistaken.the determination arizona,cristian home state,was an inconvenient forum and california should continue to assert jurisdiction to decide the pending custody issue was not made by the juvenile court,but by the family law court in arizona after an evidentiary hearing in a proceeding in which angela was a party and as to which she had been serv
