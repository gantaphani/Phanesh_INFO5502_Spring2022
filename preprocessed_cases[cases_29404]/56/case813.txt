introduction 
defendant,hoy chan,appeals after he was convicted of counts of forcible lewd conduct with a child,subd.b.further,defendant was convicted of counts of lewd conduct on a child,subd.a.also,defendant was convicted of a single count of failing to register as a sex offender,subd.g.finally,the jury found defendant had previously been convicted of a violation of section,subdivision a,a serious and violent felony,within the meaning of sections,subdivision a,subdivisions a and d,and,subdivision c.
on appeal,defendant and the attorney general raise various contentions.in the published portion of the opinion,we address the sufficiency of the evidence defendant failed to register as a previously convicted sex offender the effect of convictions on counts for both the greater and included offense of violations of section,subdivisions b and a respectively and the contention of the attorney general that the trial court should have imposed indeterminate terms as to all of the section,subdivision b child molestation by force counts.in terms of the issues raised in the published portion of this opinion,we conclude that the failure to register charge in count is supported by substantial evidence defendant may not be convicted as to counts through of violating both section,subdivision b,lewd conduct by force,and the lesser offense of a violation of section,subdivision a,lewd conduct without force and the trial court should have imposed consecutive indeterminate terms as to counts through.in the unpublished portion of the opinion,we make other changes to the judgment.
ii.discussion 
sufficiency of the evidence 
defendant argues there was insufficient evidence he failed to register as a previously convicted sex offender within the meaning of section,subdivision g.there are two components to defendant sufficiency of the evidence analysis.first,defendant presents a general sufficiency of the evidence contention focusing on the fact he only made a slight error when registering on march.second,he asserts the corpus delicti rule requires we find the evidence is insufficient as to the registration charge.we respectfully reject each contention.
defendant,a resident of long beach,california,had previously been sentenced to prison on may,for a lewd act on a child in violation of section,subdivision a.as required of convicted sex offenders,defendant registered with the long beach police department on november.detective michael holguin described the procedures utilized by the long beach police department for registering sex offenders a convicted sex offender must register within five days of his or her birthday if the offender moves,written notification must occur within five days the convicted sex offender fills out written forms provided by the california department of justice and the information placed on the forms by the convicted offender must be accurate.
defendant first registered with the long beach police department on november.defendant indicated on the registration form that he resided at cherry avenue in long beach.on march,defendant filed his annual registration form with the long beach police department.defendant listed his address as walnut avenue,apartment in long beach.as will be noted,no such address exists.attached to the registration form is defendant photograph.defendant right thumbprint is on the march,registration form.additionally on march,defendant signed a registration card,also containing his thumbprint,indicating he was a convicted sex offender.the registration card was mailed to defendant on march,but was returned by the postal service.on may,officer james foster attempted to go to walnut avenue,apartment in long beach.this was the address appearing on the registration form and card,both signed by defendant on march.officer foster discovered that the address of walnut did not exist.
on may,defendant returned to the long beach police department and registered his address as lewis avenue,apartment a.as in the case of the march,registration,defendant right thumbprint was on the may,form.both the march and may,department of justice forms are signed under penalty of perjury.
on june,long beach police officer joe pirooz went to lewis avenue.as noted previously,defendant listed his address when registering on may,as being lewis avenue.defendant was at lewis avenue in the presence of three minor girls.the following testimony was presented by officer pirooz concerning the lewis avenue address q did the defendant tell you if he lived at that location a yes.defendant testified he knew he had a duty to register as a sex offender.while testifying,defendant admitted he resided at walnut avenue,apartment on march,not walnut avenue,apartment as appears on the registration form and card executed by him under penalty of perjury on that date.
there is no merit to the contention the foregoing evidence is insufficient to support the failing to register conviction.we review the evidence in a light most favorable to the judgment.jackson virginia,d people osband cal th,d,taylor stainer cir.in reviewing a challenge of the sufficiency of the evidence,we apply the following standard of review we must consider the evidence in a light most favorable to the judgment and presume the existence of every fact the trier could reasonably deduce from the evidence in support of the judgment.the test is whether substantial evidence supports the decision,not whether the evidence proves guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.people mincey cal th,d,fn.omitted people hayes cal d.our sole function is to determine if any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime true beyond a reasonable doubt.jackson virginia,supra,at.people bolin cal th,d.the standard of review is the same in cases where the prosecution relies primarily on circumstantial evidence.people rodriguez cal th,d,people stanley cal th,d.the california supreme court has held,reversal on this ground is unwarranted unless it appears that upon no hypothesis whatever is there sufficient substantial evidence to support the conviction.people bolin,supra,cal th at,d,quoting people redmond cal d.
defendant has been convicted of failing to register in violation of section,subdivision g the california supreme court has described the section convicted sex offender registration responsibility as follows a convicted sex offender must register not only on conviction,but whenever coming into any city,county,or city and county in which he or she temporarily resides or is domiciled,subd.a.supplemental address change information helps law enforcement agencies keep track of sex offenders who move within the same city or county or are transient.in large cities such as los angeles or huge counties like san bernardino,where offenders can easily relocate without reregistering,section f seeks to prevent them from disappearing from the rolls.ensuring offenders are readily available for police surveillance barrows municipal court cal d,depends on timely notification.without it law enforcement efforts will be frustrated and the statutory purpose thwarted.the statute is thus regulatory in nature,intended to accomplish the government objective by mandating certain affirmative acts.compliance is essential to that objective lack of compliance fatal.wright superior court cal th,d.
the supreme court has described the requisite mental state for a section failure to register violation thusly in a case like this,involving a failure to act,we believe section requires the defendant to actually know of the duty to act.both today and under the version applicable to defendant,a sex offender is guilty of a felony only if he willfully violates the registration or notification provisions of section,former subd.g,as amended by stats,ch,present subd.g.the word willfully implies a purpose or willingness to make the omission.logically one can not purposefully fail to perform an act without knowing what act is required to be performed.as stated in people honig th,d,the term willfully imports a requirement that the person knows what he is doing.citation.consistent with that requirement,and in appropriate cases,knowledge has been held to be a concomitant of willfulness.fn.omitted.accordingly,a violation of section requires actual knowledge of the duty to register.a jury may infer knowledge from notice,but notice alone does not necessarily satisfy the willfulness requirement.people garcia cal th,d,orig.italics see people barker cal th,d.
however,merely forgetting to register is not a defense to a section charge.in people barker,supra,cal th at page,d,the supreme court held that the willfulness element of section may not be negated by just forgetting to register.the supreme court explained,w e conclude that countenancing excuses of the sort given by he just forgot about his registration obligation would effectively eviscerate the statute just as surely as characterizing violation of the statute as an instantaneous offense would have eviscerated it.wright superior court supra,cal th at d.we emphasize the limits of our holding.we do not here express an opinion as to whether forgetfulness resulting from,for example,an acute psychological condition,or a chronic deficit of memory or intelligence might negate the willfulness required for a section violation.people barker,supra,cal th at,d,orig.italics accord,people cox th,d.
there is substantial evidence defendant willfully failed to accurately register his address with the long beach police department as required by section,subdivision g.defendant had previously been convicted of lewd conduct with a child in violation of section,subdivision a.defendant had knowledge of the duty to register.he initialed the rear of the form acknowledging he knew of his duty to register.defendant had registered prior to march.he knew he had a duty to provide accurate information.the registration forms are executed under penalty of perjury.on march,defendant wrote on the registration form he resided at walnut avenue in apartment an address that does not exist.defendant also executed a registration receipt which lists the nonexistent walnut avenue address.defendant right thumbprint is on the registration form and the receipt.hs photograph is attached to the registration form.the registration receipt was mailed to defendant and returned by the postal service.on may,officer foster went to the walnut address provided by defendant and discovered it did not exist.defendant reregistered on may,listing his address as lewis avenue,apartment a.when arrested on june,by officer pirooz,defendant was at lewis which was other than the residence than where he had reregistered on may.this constitutes substantial evidence defendant gave a false address on march.
there is no merit to defendant assertion that his admission he lived at lewis when arrested on june,is of no legal consequence.as noted previously,officer pirooz testified thusly q did the defendant tell you if he lived at that location a yes.defendant suggests that the answer yes is too vague to be of material consequence.defendant reasons that when he answered yes,it could have meant he in fact lived at lewis.on the other hand,defendant argues his response is consistent with the conclusion he merely answered the question do you live here at lewis but did not in fact admit residing there.had he resided at lewis,he potentially would be subject to a violation for giving a false address since he registered the lewis address with the police.no doubt,in the trial court,officer pirooz one word yes answer could be the subject of legitimate debate.but this case is now on appeal and officer pirooz response is to be taken in a light most favorable to the judgment.the california supreme court has explained in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a judgment of conviction,we examine the entire record in the light most favorable to the prosecution,presuming in support of the judgment the existence of every fact the trier could reasonably deduce from the evidence,to determine whether a rational trier of fact could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.people coffman cal th,d,citing people hayes,supra,cal d at.when viewed in a light most favorable to the judgment,the answer indicates defendant admitted on june,he lived at lewis avenue seven days after falsely registering the lewis avenue address.defendant false statement on the may,registration form that he lived at lewis is evidence of moral turpitude thereby undercutting his in court testimony he only made a mistake when registering on march.cal,art i,subd.d right to see city of los angeles superior court cal th,d,nonfelony conduct involving moral turpitude is admissible to impeach a witness in a criminal case.further,it was evidence of a unique common scheme on defendant part to mislead long beach police officers as to where he lived while maintaining the plausible explanation that he only made a nonwillful innocent mistake,subd.b people catlin cal th,d,despite the prohibition against admitting evidence of an uncharged crime to demonstrate a defendant criminal propensity,such evidence is admissible to show the existence of a common scheme or plan.
additionally,defendant argues a subtle variant of the i forgot defense posited in barker and rejected there by the california supreme court.defendant argues all that occurred was a slight digit error when he registered the walnut,apartment address.to begin with,defendant falsely wrote the imaginary walnut,apartment address not only on the registration form,but signed the receipt which contained the same fictional residence.moreover,so long as the accused,with knowledge of the registration requirement,acts willfully as explicitly specified in section,subdivision g,and such is proven beyond a reasonable doubt to the trier of fact,forgetting one correct address while registering is not a defense any more than not remembering to register.people barker,supra,cal th at,d,people cox,supra,th at,d.we need not therefore address the related argument of the attorney general that there is substantial evidence defendant violated section,subdivision g by falsely registering the lewis avenue,apartment a address on may.
finally,there is no merit to defendant corpus delicti argument.until the adoption of california constitution article i,section,subdivision d,there were two aspects to the corpus delicti rule the first aspect involved the admissibility of evidence.prior to the constitutional amendment,evidence of an accused admission or confession was inadmissible in the face of a corpus delicti objection absent some independent proof of the criminal conduct.people alvarez cal th,d,people robbins cal d.however,the supreme court has held that the admissibility of evidence rule was abrogated by the adoption of the provisions of article i,section,subdivision d of the california constitution in.people sapp cal th,d,people alvarez,supra,cal th at,d.the second aspect of the corpus delicti rule,which involves the sufficiency of the evidence as well as related instructional matters at issue in this case,remains in effect notwithstanding the provisions of california constitution,article i,section,subdivision d.people sapp,supra,cal th at,d,people alvarez,supra,cal th at,d.the corpus delicti rule is based on the common law and not premised on any constitutional requirement.people gutierrez cal th,d,people alvarez,supra,cal th at,d.
defendant argues that the evidence was insufficient because of california corpus delicti rule.the supreme court has described the corpus delicti rule thusly in every criminal trial,the prosecution must prove the corpus delicti,or the body of the crime,the fact of injury,loss,or harm,and the existence of a criminal agency as its cause.in california,it has traditionally been held,the prosecution can not satisfy this burden by relying exclusively upon the extrajudicial statements,confessions,or admissions of the defendant.citations,people alvarez,supra,cal th at,d,accord people ochoa cal th,d.the scope of the rule is as follows in requiring independent evidence of the corpus delicti,california has not distinguished between actual confessions or admissions on the one hand,and preoffense statements of intent on the other.thus,the rule in california has been that one can not be convicted when t
