we are asked to review the dismissal of a juvenile dependency petition for a young man,appellant david,who at age,months,was on the cusp of adulthood when the dependency petition in this case was filed,but who is now over age.
david,a victim of past gun violence,is a diabetic in need of medical assistance.he was living in a homeless shelter when the dependency petition was filed.the petition alleges he was abandoned by his mother and left without means of support.if that is true and the juvenile court erred in dismissing the petition,he would almost certainly benefit from transitional support as a nonminor dependent until age.
but there is a catch.dependency jurisdiction may not be initiated in the first instance over someone who is over age it must be initiated before age,and by the plain terms of the juvenile court law,may only be retain ed,continu ed or resum ed for nonminors in certain circumstances until age,welf.inst.code,subds.a,c,subd.c.
in essence,the legislature created a form of dependency jurisdiction for nonminors until age,but made it derivative of dependency jurisdiction assumed prior to age.what that means here,according to respondent contra costa county children and family services bureau the bureau,is that this case is now moot and any error by the juvenile court in failing to assume dependency jurisdiction over david is effectively unreviewable.
reluctantly,we must agree.because david is now over age,he could not be declared a dependent on remand even if we were to conclude the juvenile court erred,and thus,at this point,we have no power to provide effective relief.we can order many things in resolving an appeal,but we can not order david to be again.we will therefore dismiss the appeal as moot.
background 
on september,the bureau filed a dependency petition on behalf of david under section.in the petition,the bureau contended the juvenile court had jurisdiction under section,subdivision g,alleging specifically that david mother was unwilling or unable to provide for him,and that her whereabouts were unknown.the bureau alleged david father was deceased.
in a detention report filed on september,the bureau stated it received a referral about david in july.a social worker spoke with david,who was and hospitalized due to complications from his diabetes.david told the social worker he was in the wheelchair because he had been shot several times in the past.the social worker stated he was pleasant but unwilling to provide personal information or family history.he told the social worker that both of his parents were deceased.the social worker spoke with david godmother,who stated david parents were deceased but would not provide additional information.upon his discharge from the hospital,david returned by taxi to the youth homeless shelter where he had been staying.the bureau closed the july referral,stating it could not verify his parents were deceased,he was receiving services at the shelter,and he was refusing the bureau services.
in september,the bureau received another referral.david had left the shelter to live in san francisco but had returned.he told the social worker that he had been living on the streets with his cousin,but that his cousin had been killed.he said he wanted to start a new life,including obtaining a high school diploma and living and working on his own,and needed the bureau assistance to do so.the social worker told david that,in order for the bureau to provide him with assistance,he would need to provide truthful information about his situation.david then told the social worker that his mother was living in louis,but that he was unable to provide contact information for her.he provided a telephone number for a maternal aunt the social worker left two voicemail messages at that number but received no response.the social worker sent a letter to an address she located for david mother,asking her to contact the bureau.the social worker also tried calling a number david provided for his mother boyfriend,but the number was disconnected.at some point,david stated his mother lived in chicago,rather than louis.
a case manager at the homeless shelter told the social worker that david was receiving some services through the shelter.the shelter had assisted him in taking steps to apply for public benefits and housing,to enroll in high school,and to obtain a california identification card.an attorney with bay area legal aid contacted the social worker and stated he was working with david to ensure he received services from the bureau.
at the detention hearing on september,the court found there was a prima facie showing that david was a person described by section.consistent with the recommendations of counsel for the bureau and counsel for david,the court ordered that david be detained and that he remain at the homeless shelter where he had been staying,pending the location of a suitable placement.the court set a jurisdiction hearing for october,and a disposition hearing for october,both prior to david birthday.the court told david he could be eligible for services until he turned.the court also told david it was important that he be brutally honest with the bureau as it continued its investigation.
in a memorandum report submitted for the october hearing,the bureau stated that both staff at the shelter and school personnel had reported david was not compliant with his diabetes medication regimen and was unwilling to monitor his blood sugar levels regularly.staff at the shelter are not able to administer medication or require residents to take their medication staff can only encourage residents to do so.a blood test conducted in july showed david diabetes had been out of control since at least april.he needed to be to stay in school.
shelter staff also reported david had been hospitalized on sunday,october.david had left the shelter after dinner on friday,october,and had not returned until sunday evening.he appeared intoxicated and was vomiting,and paramedics rushed him to the hospital.the paramedics stated david was combative during the ride to the hospital.at the hospital,it was determined he was hyperglycemic and suffering from diabetic ketoacidosis.he also had possible swelling of the brain.he was confused,incoherent and combative,and had to be restrained by hospital staff.once his condition stabilized,the hospital was ready to release him,but wanted shelter staff to be trained to administer david insulin shots.as noted,however,shelter staff can not administer medication.shelter staff informed the social worker that the shelter has a respite program with medical supervision,and the bureau was also exploring other possible placements for david 
at the october hearing,counsel for the bureau stated the bureau had managed to contact david adult sister,who lived in san francisco.counsel stated that david sister had reported their mother was alive and identified the city and state where the mother lived.counsel stated the sister reported that the mother raised both david and the sister,and that david had left home on his own.counsel stated the bureau wanted to attempt to send formal notice to the mother,stating this may not be an abandonment case.counsel for david responded by stating she believed the department had already sent two letters to the mother and had not received a response.the court set a contested hearing for october.
in a memorandum report submitted for the october hearing,the bureau,in a turnabout from its initial position in the case,recommended the petition be dismissed,stating that the information on which it had been based had turned out not to be true.the bureau stated it had spoken with david maternal aunt.the aunt stated she is the only one who cares about david b.the aunt told the bureau that,when david father died,david mother and maternal grandmother took david back to jennings,missouri to live.david later made his way to chicago,illinois,where he was shot,and then to texas,where he was shot again.the aunt stated that,after david was shot in texas,he contacted his maternal grandmother,but she would not allow david to return home to jennings,missouri.instead,david grandmother told him to make his way to san francisco to locate his maternal uncle,whom david did not know.david located his uncle,who is homeless,and lived with him on the streets of san francisco.david later lived in youth homeless shelters.the aunt herself was unable to provide care for david because she was years old,lived in a studio apartment with no kitchen,and was on a fixed income.
the bureau also reported it had spoken with david sister.although the sister provided information,she responded to most of the social worker questions by saying i do know.the sister stated their mother was in jennings,missouri.the bureau stated that david sister reported that their mother was willing to be involved in david care.david sister stated their mother had cared for them.she described her childhood with their mother as great and told the bureau that their mother provided for their material needs and supported them emotionally.the bureau reported that the sister stated the reason david was not with their mother was that he wanted to be grown and to do what he wanted to do.the sister declined to forward any information about david situation to their mother.
the bureau also described its unsuccessful efforts to contact david mother.on october and,the social worker telephoned david maternal grandmother twice and left voicemail messages,explaining the reason she was calling and requesting a return call,but the grandmother did not call back.the social worker also repeatedly attempted to reach david mother by telephone using a number provided by david sister from october through october.the social worker left two detailed messages,each time identifying herself,stating the reason for her call,and requesting that the mother of david return the call.on the third attempt,the social worker spoke with a woman who identified herself as david mother cousin.the cousin stated that the phone number belonged to her,and that david mother was using it as a temporary contact number.the cousin stated she lived in new york.she stated david mother was temporarily in new york for an unknown period of time,but the cousin did not know david mother whereabouts.the cousin declined to forward information to david mother about his situation.
the hospital social worker told the bureau that david diabetes was under control and he was medically ready to be discharged.but he needed to be discharged to a caregiver who was trained to assist in administering his insulin,and the hospital was waiting for the bureau to locate a placement in which such care could be provided.hospital staff also recommended david undergo a neuropsychiatric evaluation,in light of questions about his critical thinking and his ability to make sound decisions.he was unable to provide consistent information about his medical or personal history.
the social worker had spoken with a representative of the county health services department,who identified a respite center that was able to accept david into its program.the program works with young adults,has medical staff on hand five days a week,and works closely with the homeless shelter where david had been staying,so his case manager at the shelter could continue in that role.
the bureau stated in its report that david had not been forthcoming with the bureau.david had declined to meet with the social worker unless his case manager from the shelter was present,which created a barrier due to the conflicting schedules of the social worker and the case manager.he also declined to meet with the social worker when she tried to visit him at the hospital on october.the bureau also stated much of the information david had provided was inaccurate such as stating that he had no relatives in the area,and that the shelter was withholding his medication.the family members the bureau had been able to contact had not been willing to provide much information.the bureau stated that,due to david failure to provide accurate information,the bureau had not had enough time to locate his mother,notify her of the proceedings,and assess her willingness or ability to provide care or select an appropriate substitute care provider for her son.the bureau stated the information provided by david sister showed the allegations in the petition were not true.
the bureau stated it intended to continue to coordinate and secure appropriate services for david,including a neuropsychiatric evaluation and services identified by the respite center and the homeless shelter.
at the october,hearing,the court stated it had reviewed the bureau reports.david was not present at the hearing but was on the telephone from the hospital.the court admitted into evidence a letter from david physician explaining why david could not attend the hearing.david counsel asked that david be permitted to testify telephonically.the court denied this request,stating that it needed to be able to see a witness to evaluate his or her demeanor when testifying.the court,however,permitted david to make a statement for the record.david stated that his father died when he was young,and that his mother did not adequately care for him.he began living with his older brother,sometimes on the streets.he had been shot several times.he expressed interest in pursuing a high school diploma and vocational training,and stated he needed help with his health,education and housing.
david counsel argued david had been left without any provision for support and was described by section,subdivision g counsel noted david had been living in a homeless shelter for children and was now hospitalized and in need of specialized medical care.noting the bureau unsuccessful efforts to locate david mother,david counsel argued there was no evidence the mother was willing or able to care for david counsel argued that,in this context,the bureau assertion that david was not a reliable reporter was irrelevant to whether the petition should be sustained.counsel also suggested that,as an alternative to section,subdivision g,david was described by section,subdivision b 
counsel for the bureau argued for dismissal,contending that the information provided by david was unreliable,and that the information provided by his sister showed he was a runaway and was not abandoned.
the court dismissed the petition.the court stated it had carefully reviewed the evidence and concluded it did not show david had been left without any provision for his support.the court found that david had a support system in place but had chosen to leave it behind to be on his own.he was not abandoned.the court concluded there was not sufficient evidence to support a finding that david was described by section,either under subdivision g or under subdivision b.the court encouraged the bureau to follow through on its promise to assist david with referrals for medical services and coordination of other services.
david appealed the court dismissal order joined in part by amicus curiae bay area legal aid,he contends that no substantial evidence supports the court finding he was not described by section,subdivisions b and g.in response,the bureau contends the appeal is moot because david now is over age and can not be declared a dependent,and the court properly dismissed the petition in any event.as we shall explain,we conclude the appeal is moot.
ii.discussion 
in general,it is a court duty to decide actual controversies by a judgment which can be carried into effect,and not to give opinions upon moot questions or abstract propositions,or to declare principles or rules of law which can not affect the matter in issue in the case before it.eye dog foundation state board of guide dogs for the blind cal d.t he critical factor in considering whether a dependency appeal is moot is whether the appellate court can provide any effective relief if it finds reversible error.in re th.a court ordinarily will dismiss an appeal when it can not grant effective relief,but may instead exercise its inherent discretion to resolve an issue when there remain material questions for the court determination citation,where a pending case poses an issue of broad public interest that is likely to recur citation,or where there is a likelihood of recurrence of the controversy between the same parties or others.id.at.
the bureau contends this appeal is moot because david is now over age and the juvenile court can not take jurisdiction for the first time of a person older than.we agree the appeal is moot.
a.the juvenile court can not initiate dependency jurisdiction over a person who is over age 
section provides that a child who comes within any of the following descriptions is within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court which may adjudge that person to be a dependent child of the court the primary provision at issue in this case is section,subdivision g,describing an abandoned child who has been left without any provision for support once the court obtains jurisdiction,it may,and in some instances shall,exercise jurisdiction beyond age,potentially until the minor reaches age,subd.a court may retain jurisdiction over any person who is found to be a dependent child of the juvenile court until the dependent child attains the age of years,subd.b o n and after january,the court shall have within its jurisdiction any nonminor dependent,as defined in,subd.v in re shannon th,in re th.

decisions by the courts of appeal support the bureau position that a juvenile court may not make an initial adjudication of dependency for a person who is over age.in in re gloria d,gloria,the court of appeal held that,for a juvenile court to obtain dependency jurisdiction over a minor,it is not sufficient for the dependency petition to be filed before the minor birthday the jurisdictional hearing must occur before that date.gloria,supra,at.in gloria,the dependency petition was filed when the minor,gloria,was years old,and the jurisdiction hearing was initially set for a date prior to her birthday,but was continued because counsel for one of the parties was ill.id.at.at the jurisdiction hearing,which ultimately was held after gloria had turned,the juvenile court sustained the petition.id.at.
on appeal from the subsequent disposition order,the court of appeal reversed and ordered the petition dismissed.gloria,supra,d at.the appellate court held that,under the applicable statutes former,the juvenile court may only take jurisdiction over persons who are under age.gloria,supra,at.the gloria court noted the language of former section,which stated,any person under the age of years who comes within any of the following descriptions is within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court which may adjudge that person to be a dependent child of the court former,as amended by stats,ch,ch,gloria,supra,at id.at,fn.in turn,former section,governing the jurisdiction hearing,stated,at the hearing,the court shall first consider only the question whether the minor is a person described by section former,as added by stats,ch,gloria,supra,at.the appellate court stated the language of these two statutes leaves little room for interpretation.the first time the juvenile court was called upon to determine the question of its jurisdiction,gloria was over and no longer within the group defined by section.clearly,the court had no jurisdiction over gloria at the time of the adjudication hearing.gloria,supra,at.
the gloria court concluded its ruling was not in conflict with the statutory provision permitting retention of jurisdiction until age then found in former section.gloria,supra,at.the court stated,t his section is premised on the court having properly exercised jurisdiction,pursuant to section,in the first instance,at the adjudication hearing.gloria,supra,at id.at had the adjudication hearing been held before gloria turned,the court could have retained jurisdiction until she was.in subsequent decisions,the courts of appeal have adhered to this distinction,stating a juvenile court may not initiate dependency jurisdiction over a person if he or she is years of age or older,while noting that once a juvenile court has obtained jurisdiction of a minor it may retain jurisdiction until he or she reaches age,in re,supra,th at to become a dependent child subject to jurisdiction under the dependency statutes,a person must be under years of age.in re,supra,th at while the juvenile court is precluded from initiating jurisdiction over a person who has reached the age of citation,after it has properly obtained jurisdiction,it may retain jurisdiction over any person who is found to be a dependent child of the juvenile court until the ward or dependent child attains the age of years.in re holly th,holly while the juvenile court may not acquire jurisdiction over a person who is years of age or older,once it has obtained jurisdiction of a minor it may retain jurisdiction until the dependent child turns.in re robert th,while the juvenile court is precluded from initiating jurisdiction over a person who has reached the age of citation,after it has properly obtained jurisdiction,it may retain jurisdiction over any person who is found to be a dependent child of the juvenile court until the ward or dependent child attains the age of years.
the language of former section,relied on by the gloria court,does differ from the current language of section,to be sure,but after scrutinizing the change in the statutory language we think the difference is of no moment.
instead of specifying a ny person under the age of years who comes within certain descriptions is within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court see former,as amended by stats,ch,ch,gloria,supra,d at,section now states a child who comes within the specified descriptions is within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court,which may adjudge that person to be a dependent child of the court.similarly,statutes describing the determinations to be made at the jurisdiction and disposition hearings refer to the subject of a dependency proceeding as the minor or the child,rather than expressly stating that only a person who is under age may be declared a dependent,subd.a at jurisdictional hearing,court shall first consider only the question whether the minor is a person described by after hearing evidence at jurisdictional hearing,court shall make a finding whether or not the minor is a person described by,subd.a after finding that a child is a person described in,the court shall hear evidence on the question of the proper disposition to be made of the child,subd.d after considering evidence as to the proper disposition,the court may order and adjudge the child to be a dependent child of the court.
the bureau argues that the use of the term child in section,without more,requires the conclusion that the only persons encompassed are those under age.we think that is an overstatement the statutory term child can not bear the weight the bureau seeks to place upon it.
first,a close reading of the statutory scheme reveals that the bureau reliance on the definition of child or minor in section is misplaced.the definitions in section do not apply to terms used in section or related statutes.section states the listed definitions apply to the specified terms a s used in this chapter,chapter of part of division of the welfare and institutions code governing special advocates.the statutes at issue here,including section and the other cited provisions pertaining to the jurisdiction and disposition hearings,appear in chapter of part of division of the code the juvenile court law,see.but see in re,supra,th at relying on definition of dependent in.in addition,contrary to the bureau assertion,the current version of section does not define child or minor to mean a person under years of age.effective january,the statute defines child or minor to mean a person under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court pursuant to section,or,subd.b,as amended by stats,ch,former,subd.b,as amended by stats,ch.
second,it is that what the bureau portrays as a at age has exceptions that,in some circumstances,potentially extend the dependency age to age.in in re,for example,the appellate court stated the principle that t o become a dependent child subject to jurisdiction under the dependency statutes,a person must be under years of age in re,supra,th at,but the court also recognized that the term child may in some contexts include persons over age ibid.relying in part on the language of section and the statement in section,subdivision a,that a juvenile court may retain jurisdiction until the dependent child attains the age of years,the appellate court in in re concluded it is clear that the terms child,dependent or dependent child include persons subject to jurisdiction under the dependency statutes up to the age of years.in re,supra,at.
ultimately,however,we reach the same conclusion that the bureau does in construing the statutory language,not by reliance on the single statutory term child,but by reading the statutory scheme as a whole.when various provisions describing nonminor dependency jurisdiction for persons over age are read in context,it seems plain that this particular form of dependency jurisdiction is merely derivative of jurisdiction assumed earlier,prior to age.as we read it,the statutory scheme reflects a clear recognition by the legislature that,while dependency jurisdiction may continue to age,it must be initiated before age.section,subdivision a provides the juvenile court may retain jurisdiction over any person who is found to be a dependent child of the juvenile court until the dependent child attains the age of years.italics added.an authorization for the court to retain jurisdiction to age would be unnecessary if the court could initiate jurisdiction over persons between the ages of and.other statutory provisions governing nonminor dependents similarly authorize a juvenile court to continue or resume dependency jurisdiction over a person between the ages of and,subd.c nonminor dependent who has not attained years of age and who exited foster care at or after the age of majority may petition the court under,subd.e to resume dependency jurisdiction over himself or herself,subd.c court shall continue dependency jurisdiction over a nonminor who meets the definition of a nonminor dependent as described in,subd.v unless court finds certain disqualifying conditions are present.
the statutory scheme governing nonminor dependents also makes clear that persons over age are adults,even if they fall within the juvenile court continuing dependency jurisdiction.section,subdivision d states in part nothing in this code shall be construed to provide legal custody of a person who has attained years of age to the county welfare or probation department or to otherwise abrogate any other rights that a person who has attained years of age may have as an adult under california law.a nonminor dependent shall retain all of his or her legal decisionmaking authority as an adult.this provision is consistent with the longstanding recognition by california courts that,while persons over age may be subject to continuing dependency jurisdiction in some circumstances,they are adults and are in many ways differently situated from persons under age.holly,supra,th at the principle that minors and adults are treated differently is of course deeply embedded in our legal system discussing numerous legal disabilities and privileges that are removed when a person turns.while the legislature has sought to facilitate the transition to adulthood of persons who entered the dependency system before age,there is no indication the legislature contemplated or authorized the initiation of dependency jurisdiction over adults.
b.this appeal is moot 
we can not provide effective relief 
because the juvenile court can not initiate dependency jurisdiction over david,the present appeal is moot.as noted,the court found at the october jurisdictional hearing that david was not a person described by section and dismissed the petition the court therefore did not reach the dispositional stage and did not declare david a dependent,subd.a,subd.d.if we were to find the court erred in finding david was not described by section,we could not grant effective relief,we could not remand for the court to initiate dependency jurisdiction over david,who is now over age and,indeed,turned before he filed his notice of appeal.in short,we can not direct the juvenile court to take an action that is beyond the scope of its power.
in addressing mootness in their briefs,and in response to our request that the parties focus their attention at oral argument on the issue of mootness,david and amicus curiae do not argue the juvenile court could hold a new jurisdictional hearing.they contend,however,that david was described by section,subdivision g as a matter of law,and that,even though david is now over,this court should direct the juvenile court to declare him a dependent as of the date of the original jurisdictional hearing.we are not persuaded we can order entry of a finding david is a dependent minor 
david cites code of civil procedure section which states that,upon reversal of a judgment,a reviewing court may direct that the parties be returned so far as possible to their positions before enforcement of the judgment,such as by ordering restitution of property.this provision does not confer judicial authority to return a person to a younger age.amicus curiae refers to code of civil procedure section,which authorizes an appellate court to stay proceedings during the pendency of an appeal or to make orders to preserve the status quo.no stay was sought here,and an appealed dependency order generally is not stayed,subd.a.
amicus curiae also argues we can direct the trial court to assume jurisdiction over david pursuant to the nunc pro tunc doctrine.this argument confuses the power of nunc pro tunc correction with the power of appellate review.the nunc pro tunc doctrine does not authorize the retroactive replacement of the juvenile court order finding david was not described by section with a wholly different order finding david was described by section,and going on to determine david should be adjudged a dependent of the court.see hamilton laine th,i t is not proper to amend an order nunc pro tunc to correct judicial inadvertence,omission,oversight or error,or to show what the court might or should have done as distinguished from what it actually did.an order made nunc pro tunc should correct clerical error by placing on the record what was actually decided by the court but was incorrectly recorded.it may not be used as a vehicle to review an order for legal or judicial error by correcting the order in order to enter a new one.
finally,amicus curiae notes that,when a juvenile court has assumed jurisdiction over a person,the person birthday does not divest the court of jurisdiction and does not necessarily render moot an appeal from an order entered in the dependency proceedings.see,subd.a in re ruth d,fn.ruth in re,supra,th at.here,the court never assumed jurisdiction over david,so this principle does not apply.
ruth is illustrative.in that case,four minor siblings were made dependents of the juvenile court at a permanency planning hearing,the juvenile court ordered a plan of foster care and the children mother appealed.ruth,supra,d at.the appellate court noted the oldest sibling had turned during the pendency of the appeal,and stated however,it is necessary for this court to review the order as it affects the rights of the parties as of the time it w
