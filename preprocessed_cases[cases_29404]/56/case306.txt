a jury convicted frank eli heard of two counts of attempted willful,deliberate and premeditated murder,subd.a.the jury found true that heard committed the offenses for the benefit of a street gang,subd.b.the jury also found true certain firearm use enhancements under section,subdivisions c and d and section.heard subsequently pled guilty to voluntary manslaughter,subd.a based on a shooting unrelated to the counts for attempted murder.he also admitted that he committed that offense for the benefit of a street gang,subd.b and discharged a firearm causing great bodily injury and death within the meaning of section,subdivision a.
the superior court sentenced heard to prison for a determinate term of years for the manslaughter count and a consecutive indeterminate term of years to life for the two counts of attempted murder.heard was years old when he committed the two counts of attempted murder and years old when he committed the voluntary manslaughter.
heard brings this petition for writ of habeas corpus,contending that his sentence is equivalent to a sentence of life without the possibility of parole,and thus,violates the holding of people caballero cal th caballero.in caballero,our high court conclude d that sentencing a juvenile offender for a nonhomicide offense to a term of years with a parole eligibility date that falls outside the juvenile offender natural life expectancy constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the eighth amendment.id.at.
the attorney general does not dispute that heard sentence is the equivalent to life without the possibility of parole,but counters that caballero,supra,cal th only applies to nonhomicide crimes and because heard pled guilty to voluntary manslaughter,caballero is distinguishable from the instant matter.as such,the attorney general asserts heard sentence does not violate the eighth amendment,citing the united states supreme court recent case miller alabama,miller concluding mandatory sentences for juveniles violate the eighth amendment,but noting a sentence is permissible for homicide offenses although uncommon in the sentencing court discretion.
the attorney general is correct that heard was sentenced,in part,for committing a homicide.our high court in caballero,supra,cal th did not address such a situation.instead,it left miller,supra.to be applied in the homicide context.caballero,supra,at,fn.yet,this case does not present the same issue as the one addressed in miller,supra,namely the unconstitutionality of a mandatory life without the possibility of parole sentence for a homicide offense.here,heard did not receive such a sentence,and the portion of his sentence attributable to his homicide crime is years,hardly the harshest possible penalty that concerned the supreme court in miller.see id.at.
despite this matter not falling directly under the ambit of either miller,supra.or caballero,supra,cal th,we remain concerned by heard sentence.ironically,it is not the homicide that leads to the troubling nature of heard sentence,but the nonhomicide offenses,which account for the majority of heard prison term.when added to the determinate sentence heard received for voluntary manslaughter,the year to life indeterminate sentence for the nonhomicide offenses results in a de facto life without the possibility of parole sentence.also,the homicide offense occurred six months after heard two attempted murder offenses.additionally,heard homicide offense was for voluntary manslaughter,a crime the legislature has not seen fit to punish with a life sentence.under these unique circumstances,we follow caballero,supra,cal th and conclude heard sentence violates the eighth amendment.
however,recently the legislature enacted senate bill sb,which amends the california penal code to address the sentencing concerns expressed in miller,supra,caballero,supra,cal th,and graham florida graham.sb,which took effect january,provides almost every juvenile offender an opportunity parole hearing whereby the juvenile would be given a meaningful opportunity for release during his or her lifetime.the attorney general maintains that this new law essentially moots heard petition because he will have the opportunity to be released during his lifetime.despite sb offering the possibility of release during heard lifetime,we nevertheless conclude a sentencing court must comply with graham,miller,and cabarello in sentencing juvenile offenders.accordingly,we grant the requested relief.
factual and procedural background 
heard was charged in an amended indictment with two counts of attempted murder and a third count of murder.the two attempted murders occurred about six months before the homicide.the amended indictment further alleged certain enhancements related to each count,including that the offenses were committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang,subd.b and a variety of firearm use enhancements,subds.c,d e.
the attempted murder charges stemmed from heard participation in a criminal gang style shooting in which two victims,alleged rival gang members,were injured the murder charge allegedly involved heard shooting a minor whom he thought was selling drugs in heard criminal street gang territory 
the trial court granted heard motion to sever counts and from count.counts and proceeded to a jury trial.at that trial,the jury found heard guilty of both counts of attempted murder.the jury also found true the firearm allegations as well as the gang allegations.
after the verdict,heard entered into a plea agreement on count.he pled guilty to the lesser included offense of voluntary manslaughter and admitted to committing the offense for the benefit of a criminal street gang under section,subdivision b and personally using a firearm under section,subdivision a.
prior to heard sentencing hearing,heard counsel filed a sentencing memorandum arguing it would be cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the eighth amendment to impose a life sentence on heard.in the memorandum,heard urged the court to consider heard age,family situation,exposure to violence at an early age,limited intelligence,and introduction to criminal street gangs as a toddler.
during the sentencing hearing,heard attorney continued to advance a constitutional argument that the court should not sentence heard to life in prison.the court was not convinced,commenting clearly,objectively there no constitutional infirmity for the imposing of a life sentence for an attempted premeditated murder.that is the desire of the legislature.it has been confirmed by the court.the court proceeded to explain that the issue that it must determine in sentencing heard,was whether a subjective analysis of heard personally renders such a sentence constitutional ly infirm.
the court explained that heard was the poster child for the legislative intervention with regard to gangs.considering the legislature focus on gang violence and the statutes enacted to address it,the court found no constitutional infirmity in the application of either a life sentence as to the counts or a life sentence as to the enchancements.accordingly,the court sentenced heard to prison for a total of years to life plus years comprised of the following years to life for count attempted murder,years to life for the firearm enhancement under section,subdivision d on count years to life for count attempted murder,years to life for the firearm enhancement under section,subdivision d on count and years for count voluntary manslaughter.the court stayed additional year enhancements under section,subdivision c and section for counts and.the court elected to run the sentences for counts,and consecutively.
heard appealed his conviction and sentence,and this court affirmed the judgment in people heard,nonpub.opn,review denied may.heard filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus with the superior court,claiming,among other things,his prison sentence is excessive because he will not be eligible for parole during his lifetime.the superior court denied the petition.
heard then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus with this court,raising again the argument that his sentence was excessive.we requested an informal response to the petition from the attorney general.after the attorney general filed an informal response,heard filed a reply.after considering the papers,we issued an order to show cause why relief should not be granted.
counsel was appointed for heard,and heard filed a supplemental petition for a writ of habeas corpus.the attorney general filed a return,to which heard filed a traverse.shortly before oral arguments were scheduled in this matter,the attorney general,by way of letter with an attached supplemental return,requested permission to file a supplemental return based on the legislature passage of sb.the attorney general argued that sb addressed heard concerns in his petition,and thus,this court should discharge the order to show cause.
we granted the attorney general request and filed the supplemental return.after doing so,we requested heard file a response to the supplemental return,and we vacated oral argument in this case,which was to be rescheduled at a future date.
heard filed his response to the supplemental return,and we recalendered oral argument in this matter.
discussion 
the instant matter presents two issues for our consideration.the first is whether heard sentence constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the eighth amendment of the united states constitution if we determine heard sentence violates the eighth amendment,we next must consider whether sb cures the constitutional violation.
heard sentence and the eighth amendment 
over the past several years,the united states supreme court has addressed the constitutional limits of punishment for a juvenile criminal offenses.in roper simmons,the united states supreme court held the imposition of capital punishment on juvenile offenders for any offense whatsoever violated the eighth amendment.id.at.the court explained that because juveniles have lessened culpability they are less deserving of the most severe punishments.id.at.the court noted that,as compared to adults,juveniles have a lack of maturity and an underdeveloped sense of responsibility they are more vulnerable or susceptible to negative influences and outside pressures,including peer pressure and their characters are not as well formed.id.at.
in graham,supra,the united states supreme court continued to limit the scope of punishment applicable to juvenile offenders.applying much of the reasoning it found persuasive in roper,supra,the court held that the eighth amendment prohibits states from sentencing a juvenile convicted of nonhomicide offenses to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole lwop.graham,supra,at.in graham,the year old defendant,terrance graham,committed armed burglary and attempted armed robbery,was sentenced to probation,and subsequently violated the terms of his probation when he committed other crimes.id.at.the trial court revoked his probation and sentenced him to life in prison for the burglary.id.at.graham sentence amounted to an lwop because florida had abolished its parole system,leaving graham with no possibility of release unless he was granted executive clemency.ibid.
the supreme court stated that nonhomicide crimes differ from homicide crimes in a moral sense and that a juvenile nonhomicide offender has a twice diminished moral culpability as opposed to an adult convicted of murder both because of his crime and because of his undeveloped moral sense.graham,supra,at.the court relied on studies showing that developments in psychology and brain science continue to show fundamental differences between juvenile and adult minds.for example,parts of the brain involved in behavior control continue to mature through late adolescence.citations.juveniles also are more capable of change than are adults,and their actions are less likely to be evidence of irretrievably depraved character than are the actions of adults.id.at,quoting roper,supra,at.no legitimate penological interest,the court concluded,justifies an lwop sentence for juvenile nonhomicide offenders.graham,supra,at.
most recently,the supreme court applied the holding of graham,supra,to homicide crimes,decreeing that the prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment set forth in the eighth amendment prohibits the imposition of a mandatory lwop sentence on a juvenile offender.miller,supra.at.citing roper,supra,and graham,the court explained that in homicide cases involving juvenile offenders,the sentencing court is required to take into account how children are different,and how those differences counsel against irrevocably sentencing them to a lifetime in prison.miller,supra,at,fn.omitted.the court elaborated 
mandatory life without parole for a juvenile precludes consideration of his chronological age and its hallmark features among them,immaturity,impetuosity,and failure to appreciate risks and consequences.it prevents taking into account the family and home environment that surrounds him and from which he can not usually extricate himself no matter how brutal or dysfunctional.it neglects the circumstances of the homicide offense,including the extent of his participation in the conduct and the way familial and peer pressures may have affected him.indeed,it ignores that he might have been charged and convicted of a lesser offense if not for incompetencies associated with youth for example,his inability to deal with police officers or prosecutors including on a plea agreement or his incapacity to assist his own attorneys.id.at.
however,the supreme court in miller,supra,made clear that,in homicide cases,it was not foreclos ing the ability of a sentencing court to impose this harshest possible penalty of lwop on the rare juvenile offender whose crime reflects irreparable corruption.id.at,quoting roper,supra,at.
with the guidance of roper,supra,graham,supra,and miller,supra,the california supreme court recently determined sentencing a juvenile offender for a nonhomicide offense to a term of years with a parole eligibility date that falls outside the juvenile offender natural life expectancy constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the eighth amendment.caballero,supra,cal th at.the court in caballero reasoned miller made it clear that graham flat ban on life without parole sentences applies to all nonhomicide cases involving juvenile offenders,including the sentence that amounts to the functional equivalent of a life without parole sentence imposed in this case.defendant in the present matter will become parole eligible over years from now.citation.consequently,he would have no opportunity to demonstrate growth and maturity to try to secure his release,in contravention of graham dictate.citations.graham analysis does not focus on the precise sentence meted out.instead it holds that a state must provide a juvenile offender with some realistic opportunity to obtain release from prison during his or her expected lifetime.citation.id.at,fn.omitted.
in reaching these conclusions,our high court in caballero noted miller,supra.had extended graham reasoning but not its categorical ban to homicide cases caballero,supra,cal th at.the court pointed out miller also observed that none of what graham said about children about their distinctive and transitory mental traits and environmental vulnerabilities is.those features are evident in the same way,and to the same degree,when a botched robbery turns into a killing.so graham reasoning implicates any sentence imposed on a juvenile,even as its categorical bar relates only to nonhomicide offenses.citation.caballero,supra,at.
these cases provide clear rules for the sentencing of juveniles.a juvenile can not be sentenced to capital punishment for any crime.roper,supra,at.a sentencing court may not sentence a juvenile to prison for life without the possibility of parole for nonhomicide offenses.graham,supra,at.a sentence for a juvenile who committed a nonhomicide offense that consists of a term of years with a parole eligibility date that falls outside the juvenile offender natural life expectancy is prohibited.caballero,supra,cal th at.mandatory life without parole sentences for juveniles,even those who commit homicide,are not permitted.miller,supra.at.an lwop sentence for juveniles who committed a homicide offense is allowable only if the court considers the mitigating qualities of youth and limits this harshest possible penalty to those rare juvenile offender s whose crime s reflect irreparable corruption.id.at.the instant matter,however,does not neatly fit under any of these rules.
heard contends,and the attorney general does not refute,that his sentence amounts to lwop.the parties agreement in this matter ends there.
the attorney general argues that graham,supra,and caballero,supra,cal th are distinguishable because heard committed a homicide.the attorney general further contends heard sentence is constitutional under miller,supra.we agree that heard commission of a homicide here,voluntary manslaughter ostensibly distinguishes this matter from graham and caballero.yet,we are not persuaded that miller somehow renders heard sentence constitutional.further,we are concerned that the majority of heard sentence was based on his nonhomicide offenses,which raises the specter of the unconstitutional sentences prohibited by graham and caballero.
miller,supra.concerned two year old offenders.the first,a juvenile in arkansas,was convicted of capital felony murder and aggravated robbery.arkansas law required the juvenile be sentenced to prison for life without the possibility of parole.id.at.the second,a juvenile in alabama,was convicted of murder in the course of arson,which carried a mandatory minimum punishment of life without the possibility of parole.id.at.in contrast,here,heard pled guilty to voluntary manslaughter and was sentenced to prison for years,the bulk of which resulted from enhancements.california law did not require or even allow a mandatory life without the possibility of parole sentence for heard homicide offense.
in addition,heard was sentenced well before miller,supra.was decided.the court in miller determined a mandatory life without the possibility of parole sentence for a juvenile unconstitutional,among other reasons,because it did not allow the sentencing courts to consider the juvenile age and its hallmark features among them,immaturity,impetuosity,and failure to appreciate the risks and consequences and family and home environment.id.at.the court in miller emphasized that the sentencing court must take into account how children are different,and how those differences counsel against irrevocably sentencing them to a lifetime in prison.id.at.here,it is unclear from the record to what extent,if any,the sentencing court considered these factors in determining heard sentence.indeed,the court emphasized its lack of discretion during the sentencing hearing and focused on heard gang involvement in figuring heard sentence.
also,the attorney general argument overlooks the fact that the lion share of heard sentence years to life stems from two nonhomicide offenses unrelated to heard homicide offense.no such concern was present in miller.for this reason as well,we are not persuaded that heard sentence is constitutional under miller,supra.
yet,although we determine that heard sentence should not be analyzed under miller,supra,the question remains whether heard homicide offense negates the constitutional protections provided to heard under graham,supra,and caballero,supra,cal th.under the novel circumstances before us,we conclude that heard particular homicide offense does not take this case outside the safety of graham and caballero.paradoxically,our conclusion to apply both graham and caballero here is buttressed by miller,supra.
in miller,supra,the supreme court stopped short of applying graham categorical ban on lwop sentences for juveniles.id.at.it did so because the juveniles there were convicted of homicide crimes.the court,however,expressed its belief that very few juveniles,even those convicted of homicide offenses,would be sentenced to life without the possibility of parole 
but given all we have said in roper,graham,and this decision about children diminished culpability and heightened capacity for change,we think appropriate occasions for sentencing juveniles to this harshest possible penalty will be uncommon.that is especially so because of the great difficulty we noted in roper and graham of distinguishing at this early age between the juvenile offender whose crime reflects unfortunate yet transient immaturity,and the rare juvenile offender whose crime reflects irreparable corruption.citations.although we do not foreclose a sentencer ability to make that judgment in homicide cases,we require it to take into account how children are different,and how those differences counsel against irrevocably sentencing them to a lifetime in prison.miller,supra,at.
thus,miller,supra.leaves open the possibility that a court could sentence a juvenile to life without the possibility of parole,but may only do so if it considers certain factors and the circumstances of the crime to determine the juvenile is that rare offender whose crime reflects irreparable corruption.id.at,italics added.however,the court made clear in graham,supra,that a nonhomicide crime can not serve as the basis for an lwop sentence.accordingly,under graham and miller,the justification for an lwop sentence must come from the homicide crime itself.see miller,supra,at graham,supra,at.
here,heard pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter.in california,voluntary manslaughter is punishable by imprisonment of three,six,or years,subd.a.heard also admitted to enhancements under sections,subdivision b c and,subdivision a.these allowed for additional prison terms of years and three,four,or years respectively.thus,at most,the court could have sentenced heard to prison for years for the voluntary manslaughter offense.instead,it sentenced heard to years,far short of the length of sentence that concerned the supreme court in miller,supra.simply put,the homicide crime here could not have subjected heard to an lwop sentence,and heard sentence for voluntary manslaughter is not a sentence that implicates the constitutional protections of miller.put differently,considering the maximum sentence for the specific homicide crime,the offense of voluntary manslaughter can not be a crime that reflects irreparable corruption as required by miller.see id.at.
therefore,we are left with heard sentence for his nonhomicide crimes,which is years to life.having determined that heard homicide crime is not of the caliber that triggers miller,supra,we must evaluate this case under graham,supra,and caballero,supra,cal th.in light of this precedent,we determine that heard sentence constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the eighth amendment.we do so,however,based on the unique circumstances before us.
heard committed the attempted murders at age and the voluntary manslaughter at age.the nonhomicide offenses and the homicide offense were unrelated,having occurred almost six months apart.heard homicide offense is voluntary manslaughter for that crime,including the enhancements that he admitted true,the sentencing court could have sentenced heard to a total of years,but sentenced him to years instead.the majority of heard sentence is attributable to his nonhomicide crimes,comprising two year to life sentences.the court ordered heard to serve those sentences consecutively after serving his year sentence on the manslaughter offense.the presence of the specific homicide crime here is not the talisman that protects heard sentence from constitutional scrutiny.in other words,we do not believe the constitution allows for the sentencing judge to ignore the holdings of graham,supra,and caballero,supra,cal th because of a homicide that carries a maximum sentence far short of life without the possibility of parole.under these distinctive facts,we determine that heard sentence violates the eighth amendment.
having determined that heard sentence violates the eighth amendment,we next consider whether sb negates the need to remand this matter back to the trial court for resentencing.section of sb states in relevant part the legislature finds and declares that,as stated by the united states supreme court in miller alabama d,only a relatively small proportion of adolescents who
