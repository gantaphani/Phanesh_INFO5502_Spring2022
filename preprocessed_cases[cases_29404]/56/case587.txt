this is an appeal from the jurisdictional and dispositional orders entered in a juvenile delinquency matter involving appellant minor usef appellant contends the juvenile court erred in issuing those orders by failing to first discharge two mandatory statutory duties to determine his suitability for the deferred entry of judgment program,and to determine whether the offense sustained against him was a felony or misdemeanor.for reasons discussed below,we reject appellant first contention,but set the dispositional order aside and remand the matter to the juvenile court for the court to determine,in the exercise of its discretion,whether the sustained offense was a felony or misdemeanor,and to sentence accordingly.
factual and procedural background 
on december,a juvenile wardship petition was filed under welfare and institutions code section,subdivision a alleging that appellant had committed felony vehicle theft,subd.a count,felony possession of stolen property,count,and misdemeanor hit and run driving,subd.a count on the same day,the prosecutor filed a notice that appellant was eligible for the deferred entry of judgment program.
a contested jurisdictional hearing was held march and.there,eunice vandermeer testified that,on may,she discovered her dodge stratus missing from the front of her home.she had not given anyone permission to borrow the vehicle.vandermeer vehicle was later returned to her home,but had sustained damage to its front end.
chris borek testified that in the late evening of may or the early morning of may,he heard a loud crash outside his home.borek went outside with his girlfriend,rachelle qutob,and saw appellant standing alone next to a dodge stratus that had crashed into his house.borek knew appellant lived next door to his aunt,and considered him a friend.borek told appellant,you just hit my house and threw my brother off the couch.appellant apologized,and agreed that borek would send appellant father a bill for the damage.borek watched as appellant drove away in the vehicle.
qutob testimony largely corroborated that of borek.qutob,like borek,knew appellant as the neighbor of borek aunt,and also recognized him from school.in addition,qutob testified that,soon after appellant drove off in the dodge stratus that had collided with borek home,qutob and her mother followed the vehicle in their own vehicle and,in doing so,saw appellant park it a short distance away on carlton street.on,qutob acknowledged failing to inform the police that she and her mother had followed appellant,and a defense investigator,janita thurman,testified that qutob also failed to tell her of that fact.
on may,officer albert schmeck,responding to a police call,visited the accident scene and took statements from borek and qutob.officer schmeck saw the damage to borek home.based on the information provided by borek and qutob,officer schmeck later found the dodge stratus with a damaged front end parked about one mile away on carlton street.
at the conclusion of the contested jurisdictional hearing,the juvenile court found true the allegation in count one that appellant had committed vehicle theft pursuant to vehicle code,section,subdivision a,and made no findings on the remaining counts.at a dispositional hearing held may,the juvenile court declared appellant a ward of the court and placed him on probation in the custody of his father.this appeal followed.
discussion 
appellant raises two contentions on appeal.first,appellant contends the juvenile court erred by failing to determine whether he was a suitable candidate for the deferred entry of judgment program dej under section et.second,appellant contends,and the people agree,the juvenile court erred by failing to make an express finding on the record whether the sustained offense for violation of vehicle code section was a felony or a misdemeanor.we address each contention in turn.
failure to rule on appellant suitability for deferred entry of judgment.
the prosecutor in this case determined appellant was eligible for dej,and provided written notice of his eligibility to both appellant and the juvenile court.a hearing on appellant suitability for dej was scheduled for december.appellant failed to appear at that hearing,apparently having not been personally served with notice of it,and the matter was continued to january.at the january hearing,and at all subsequent hearings in the matter,the record reveals no mention by the juvenile court,appellant,his attorney,nor the the dej determination.
appellant attorney indicated at the february hearing,however,that appellant was denying the allegations in the section petition,and requested that the juvenile court schedule a contested jurisdictional hearing.as set forth above,a contested jurisdictional hearing was thus held,after which the juvenile court found true the allegation that appellant had committed vehicle theft,adjudged him a ward of the court,and placed him on probation.
according to appellant,the juvenile court failure to address the dej issue at any of the scheduled hearings was error.appellant reasons that the juvenile court failed to discharge a mandatory statutory duty to exercise its discretion to determine his suitability for dej.he thus asks us to set aside the court jurisdictional and dispositional orders and remand for further proceedings in compliance with the dej provisions of the welfare and institutions code.
the people,to the contrary,contend the juvenile court had no mandatory statutory duty to determine appellant dej suitability because appellant declined to admit the allegations against him contained in the section petition.to address the merits of the parties contentions,we thus must examine the relevant statutory framework.
our colleagues in the court of appeal,fourth appellate district,division one,have provided the following helpful overview of the dej the dej provisions of section et were enacted as part of proposition,the gang violence and juvenile crime prevention act of,in march.the sections provide that in lieu of jurisdictional and dispositional hearings,a minor may admit the allegations contained in a section petition and waive time for the pronouncement of judgment.entry of judgment is deferred.after the successful completion of a term of probation,on the motion of the prosecution and with a positive recommendation from the probation department,the court is required to dismiss the charges.the arrest upon which judgment was deferred is deemed never to have occurred,and any records of the juvenile court proceeding are sealed,subd.a,subd.c.in re martha th,d.
more specifically,section,subdivisions a and b provide that where,as here,a minor is alleged in a section petition to have committed a felony offense,the prosecutor must review the file to determine whether the minor meets the qualifications for the dej,subds.a,b.the minor is eligible for the dej if all of the following circumstances apply the minor has not previously been declared to be a ward of the court for the commission of a felony offense.the offense charged is not one of the offenses enumerated in subdivision b of section.the minor has not previously been committed to the custody of the youth authority.the minor record does not indicate that probation has ever been revoked without being completed.the minor is at least years of age at the time of the hearing.the minor is eligible for probation pursuant to section of the penal code,subd.a.
undisputedly,here,the prosecutor determined appellant was eligible for the dej and,consistent with his further statutory duties under section,subdivision b,provided written notice to appellant and the juvenile court of that fact.once,however,a determination is made that a minor is eligible for the dej,there must also be a determination that he is suitable for the dej,subd.b.otherwise stated,once eligibility is established,the statutory language empowers but does not compel the juvenile court to grant dej.in re sergio th,d see also in re martha,supra,th at,d while eligibility is a necessary condition for dej,it is not alone a sufficient basis.under proper circumstances the court may refuse dej even to minors eligible under se
