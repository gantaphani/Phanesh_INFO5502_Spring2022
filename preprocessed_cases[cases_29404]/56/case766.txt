the roman catholic bishop of oakland,a corporation sole bishop,petitions for a writ of mandate to preclude plaintiff bob thatcher from seeking punitive damages in thatcher suit against the bishop for childhood sexual abuse by one of the bishop priests.according to the bishop,punitive damages in this case violate the ex post facto clauses of the united states and california constitutions because they are sought only by virtue of a statute that revived the statute of limitations on otherwise barred tort claims for childhood sexual abuse.code civ.we hold that the statute does not violate the ex post facto doctrine,and deny the request for extraordinary relief.
facts and procedural history 
the statute of limitations for tort claims based on allegations of childhood sexual abuse is found at code of civil procedure section although claims based on liability for failing to take reasonable steps to prevent sexual abuse by others ordinarily have to be brought by the plaintiff birthday,section was amended in to permit a period for the revival of such abuse claims that had expired under the previous limitations period,subds.b,c see stats,ch.in april,bob thatcher sued the roman catholic bishop of oakland,bishop john cummins,and father robert ponciroli,a priest who worked for the bishop of oakland according to thatcher,ponciroli sexually molested him during the years through,at a time when thatcher was a minor.his complaint stated causes of action on several theories of negligent and intentional torts 
in april,the trial court granted thatcher permission to file a second amended complaint which sought punitive damages against the bishop.the amended pleading was based on allegations that the bishop knew ponciroli was a child molester but took no steps to protect young churchgoers from his advances.based on those allegations,the new pleading stated causes of action against the bishop for negligent and intentional misconduct.the bishop moved to strike the punitive damage claims,contending that because section had revived the expired statute of limitations,those claims violated the constitutional prohibitions against ex post facto laws.although finding the issue to be a close one,the trial court denied the motion because it believed that punitive damages sought as part of a civil law tort claim fell outside the reach of the ex post facto prohibition.the bishop then filed a writ petition asking us to reverse the trial court order.we issued an order to show cause why the writ should not be granted 
discussion 
general principles of ex post facto analysis as applied to statutes of limitations 
under both the federal and california constitutions,the states are barred from passing ex post facto laws,art.i,cl.cal,art.i.we interpret the california provision in the same manner as its federal counterpart.people superior court th,d.in american jurisprudence,the seminal definition of the ex post facto clause was supplied by justice chase in calder bull dall,wl calder the prohibition,in the letter,is not to pass any law concerning and after the fact but the plain and obvious meaning and intention of the prohibition is this that the legislatures of the several states,shall not pass laws,after a fact done by a subject,or citizen,which shall have relation to such fact,and shall punish him for having done it.the calder court described the four different types of ex post facto laws.every law that makes an action,done before the passing of the law,and which was innocent when done,criminal and punishes such action.every law that aggravates a crime,or makes it greater than it was,when committed.every law that changes the punishment,and inflicts a greater punishment,than the law annexed to the crime,when committed.every law that alters the legal rules of evidence,and receives less,or different,testimony,than the law required at the time of the commission of the offence in order to convict the offender.ibid.more recently,and more succinctly,the united states supreme court stated that ex post facto laws apply only to penal statutes which disadvantage the offender affected by them.collins youngblood,d.according to our highest court legislatures may not retroactively alter the definition of crimes or increase the punishment for criminal acts.id.at.
in stogner california,d,the united states supreme court confirmed that the revival of a lapsed criminal law statute of limitations violated ex post facto principles.because the limitations period acts as a sort of amnesty that might lull a suspected offender into believing it was no longer necessary to preserve exculpatory evidence,legislation reviving a lapsed criminal charge was unfair and dishonest.id.at.considering,subd.g,which revived the lapsed limitations period for childhood sex abuse prosecutions upon certain conditions.
it is equally well settled that legislation reviving the statute of limitations on civil law claims does not violate constitutional principles.in chase securities donaldson,the court held that due process notions were not affected by the revival of a civil law claim because civil limitations periods find their justification in necessity and convenience rather than in logic they are by definition arbitrary,and their operation does not discriminate between the just and the unjust claim,or the avoidable and unavoidable delay their shelter has never been regarded as a fundamental right the history of pleas of limitation shows them to be good only by legislative grace and to be subject to a relatively large degree of legislative control.fns.omitted.in liebig superior court d,the court held that the legislature had the power to revive lapsed common law claims based on childhood sexual abuse under an earlier version of section.finally,the court in delonga diocese of sioux falls d,held in another case based on allegations of childhood sexual abuse by priests that a south dakota statute reviving lapsed civil actions based on such conduct did not violate the ex post facto doctrine.
we proceed to a description of the unique interplay between the revival of civil claims for punitive damages and the ex post facto clause.
bishop contentions applicability of landgraf and 
according to ex post facto doctrine,the fact that a statute is labeled as civil is not dispositive.if the effect of a statute is to impose punishment that is criminal in nature,the ex post facto law is implicated.kansas hendricks,d hendricks.because punitive damages serve much the same function as the criminal both punish and deter the bishop contends that section violates the ex post facto prohibition to the extent it acts as a vehicle by which thatcher may claim punitive damages for conduct that at one time was not actionable because it had been barred by the statute of limitations 
according to the bishop,this case calls for application of the traditional tests for determining whether a statute is valid for ex post facto purposes.first,we should examine the legislative intent to determine whether the legislature intended to impose criminal punishment.if not,we then are to apply the factors to determine whether the net effect of the statute amounts to criminal punishment smith doe,d smith hendricks,supra,at.as discussed below,the bishop concedes that the legislature did not intend to impose criminal punishment.see fn,post.the bishop contends,however,that under,the effect of section is to do just that.
in calling forth the factors,the bishop relies heavily on dicta from landgraf,supra.the plaintiff in that case sued her employer for sexual harassment under federal civil rights law.when she first sued,the statute provided only for back pay and other equitable relief,but did not provide for compensatory or punitive damages.although the trial court found the plaintiff had been the victim of sexual harassment,it also found she had not been subjected to a sufficiently hostile environment but instead had voluntarily resigned.because she did not qualify for equitable relief and because no other relief was then available,the trial court dismissed her action.while the plaintiff appeal was pending,a new law went into effect that gave sexual harassment plaintiffs the right to a jury trial if they sought compensatory and punitive damages,two forms of relief which had not previously been available.the plaintiff attempt to revive her action and seek compensatory and punitive damages was denied.on appeal,the issue before the supreme court was whether congress intended the new provision to have retroactive effect.as part of its discussion,the court noted that concerns over statutory retroactivity were expressed through different constitutional theories,including the ex post facto clause,and others.id.at.in determining whether congress intended the new remedies to be retroactive,the court examined the new punitive damage provision.because such damages share much in common with criminal sanctions,the court observed that their retroactive imposition would raise a serious constitutional question.id.at.ultimately,the court concluded congress did not intend the amendments to apply retroactively.id.at.
the bishop uses this language from landgraf to contend that punitive damages are criminal in nature and would likely be held to violate ex post facto doctrine under.we reject the bishop reliance on that decision for several reasons.first,before it could consider the ex post facto issue,the landgraf court said it would have to be confronted with a statute that explicitly authorized punitive damages for preenactment conduct.landgraf,supra,at.the court did not reach the issue that is before us now,and the language relied on by the bishop is therefore dicta.in fact,the court said earlier that for its purposes it would presume that congress could make the new law retroactive if it wanted to.id.at,fn.next,the decision is inapplicable in two ways although the court discussed its ex post facto concerns,those were merely part of its overall retroactivity analysis.at issue in landgraf was proof of congress intent to make a new law retroactive,not whether that law violated the ex post facto clause to the extent ex post facto concerns were implicated by landgraf,they are substantially different from those at issue here.landgraf did not concern a common law tort claim.instead,it concerned the retroactive application of a new statutory punitive damage remedy to preexisting conduct which occurred at a time when no such damages were recoverable.this distinction animated the landgraf court analysis in cases like this one,in which prior law afforded no relief,the new law can be seen as creating a new cause of action,and its impact on parties rights is especially pronounced.id.at.as a result,the new statute resembled a statute increasing the amount of damages available under a preexisting cause of action.id.at.neither landgraf nor the cases it cites concerned or considered the ability to recover punitive damages as part of a statute reviving a common law tort cause of action.see usery turner elkhorn mining,d award of benefits under federal coal mining health and safety act de veau braisted,d new york state waterfront commission act precluding convicted felons from collecting or receiving union dues louis vuitton spencer handbags cir treble civil damages under criminal trademark counterfeiting law.
at issue here,however,is the revival of a lapsed civil limitations period in order to restore common law remedies that actually existed at the time of the alleged misconduct.as noted,numerous federal and california decisions have held that there is no constitutional impediment to such legislation.in light of those decisions,and in the absence of any such issues or discussion in landgraf,we do not believe landgraf can be read as having any applicability here instead,as we explain below,we hold that a statute reviving the limitations period for a common law tort cause of action,thereby allowing the plaintiff to seek punitive damages,does not implicate the ex post facto doctrine and therefore does not trigger the test at all.
ex post facto principles are inapplicable to revival of common law punitive damages claims 
as part of justice chase discussion of the ex post facto clause in calder,supra,he said that the clause was not inserted to secure the citizen in his private rights,of either property,or contracts.id.at.no reported decision of any federal or state court has ever held that punitive damages awarded pursuant to a common law tort claim might constitute criminal punishment under the ex post facto clause our courts and others have held just the opposite.in grimshaw ford motor d.grimshaw,the defendant auto maker contended that punitive damages for an automotive design defect violated the ex post facto clause because at the time the cars were manufactured it had no warning that such damages might be recoverable under civil code section.the appellate court rejected that notion with little discussion,finding it without merit because the doctrine extends to criminal statutes and penalties,not to civil statutes.id.at.grimshaw holding was endorsed in peterson superior court cal d,peterson,where our supreme court considered whether plaintiffs injured by drunken drivers were entitled to retroactive application of a judicial decision allowing punitive damage awards against the defendants who caused their injuries.even though the ex post facto doctrine is not applicable to judicial decisions,the plaintiff advanced an argument based on that theory.citing to some of the same decisions relied on in grimshaw,the peterson court held that although punitive damages can be viewed as a type of punishment,the ex post facto doctrine did not apply to cases presenting the possible exposure to civil penalties.peterson,supra,at.in logan drew,the court considered whether punitive damages in a federal civil rights claim against two police officers violated the ex post facto doctrine.because the federal statute was intended to create a species of tort liability,the district court held that the ex post facto clause did not apply.id.at.none of these cases considered or even mentioned the type of analysis required by.instead,they quickly disposed of the defendants ex post facto arguments on the ground that the doctrine had no application to civil remedies.
our conclusion is bolstered by language from the analogous context of the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment to the united states constitution.the clause provides that no person shall be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.it protects against only multiple criminal punishments for the same offense.hudson united states,d hudson,original italics.whether a punishment is criminal under the double jeopardy clause turns on exactly the same test used to determine whether a punishment is civil or criminal for ex post facto purposes the test of legislative intent and the factors.id.at.smith,supra,at.factors migrated to ex post facto cases from double jeopardy jurisprudence hendricks,supra,at.court held that its determination that no ex post facto violation occurred under factors also meant that no second prosecution occurred for double jeopardy purposes cir,fn.same test applies to both double jeopardy and ex post facto claims.therefore,if a punishment is not criminal for purposes of double jeopardy,it can not be criminal under the ex post facto clause.see myrie commissioner cir,double jeopardy and ex post facto share common thread they apply to only punishments or fines that are criminal,not civil,in nature.
in united states halper,d halper,the supreme court deviated from the factors and held that civil claims seeking statutory penalties that were brought by the federal government under the federal false claims act were barred under the double jeopardy clause by the defendant earlier criminal conviction for medicare fraud.that approach was later overturned in hudson,supra,d,which reaffirmed the vitality of the factors.even though the halper court took a more restrictive and now outdated view of punishment under the double jeopardy clause,that court was still intent on making a distinction between the federal false claims statute and common law torts finally,nothing in today opinion precludes a private party from filing a civil suit seeking damages for conduct that previously was the subject of criminal prosecution and punishment.the protections of the double jeopardy clause are not triggered by litigation between private parties.halper,supra,at,fn.omitted,italics added.
other courts have reached the same result.ely cir,bank directors indicted for federal bank fraud contended prosecutions were barred under double jeopardy clause due to earlier civil suit by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic because government sued in its capacity as the bank receiver,the civil suit seeking compensatory and punitive damages did not have double jeopardy effect racich celotex cir,racich double jeopardy protections not triggered by punitive damage claims in common law tort actions for asbestos exposure shore gurnett th,d defendant convicted of vehicular manslaughter for drunken driving was sued for wrongful death,where punitive damages were awarded double jeopardy not implicated by purely private litigation lemer boise cascade,d.class action settlement did not raise double jeopardy bar to separate fraud action toole,d.drug maker earlier no contest pleas to federal charges did not raise double jeopardy bar to award of punitive damages in later common law tort claim although punitive damages were sought,the action was still purely civil in nature.as with the ex post facto cases mentioned earlier,these decisions simply found the analogous double jeopardy clause inapplicable without engaging in any analysis 
the supreme court has also found no impediment to common law punitive damage claims in other constitutional contexts.in industries of vermont,kelco disposal,d,the court considered whether the eighth amendment proscription against excessive fines applied to awards of punitive damages in cases between private parties.given the legislative history and original intent of the clause,the court concluded that it was concerned solely with governmental action and had no application to suits between private parties.id.at.even though punitive damages are imposed through the courts,serve to advance governmental interests,and advance traditional criminal law interests of punishment and deterrence,because they are based on private civil actions,they are too far afield from the concerns that animate the eighth amendment.id.at.see also racich,supra,at language in supports holding that punitive damages do not violate double jeopardy clause.
finally,and perhaps most tellingly,the supreme court decision in gore,supra,d,confirms our belief that the ex post facto doctrine does not apply here.in a case which sought to rein in the size of punitive damage awards,the court linked its ruling to other constitutional provisions which ensure that a person will receive fair notice of the conduct that might expose him to punishment,along with the nature of the penalty for that conduct.among these was the ex post facto doctrine.however,as the court noted,these strict constitutional safeguards afforded to criminal defendants are not applicable to civil cases,although the basic protection against judgment without notice afforded by the due process clause citation,is implicated by civil penalties id.at,fn,original italics.
we recognize that even a common law tort claim for punitive damages involves some level of government action.the forum for their established by the government and are operated through the government judicial officers.the procedures for litigating such claims,including statutes of limitations,are determined by legislatures.the mechanisms for enforcing a civil judgment are also established by the government.these can sometimes set in motion a series of judicial actions,including judgment debtor examinations and other discovery methods code civ,wage garnishment code civ,et,and the forced sale of personal and real property.code civ,subd.a.these are essentially neutral administrative functions,however.none transmutes the underlying common law right into some form of criminal punishment.see,supra,at.even though common law punitive damages are imposed through the court,their private nature fails to implicate the eighth amendment excessive fines clause.at bottom,we believe that the cases we have cited in this part of our discussion,such as gore,supra,at,footnote,supra,at.halper,supra,at,and grimshaw,supra,d at,stand for the proposition that despite certain similarities with criminal sanctions,punitive damages arising from common law causes of action possess and retain a quintessentially civil flavor.that flavor keeps them outside the zone of constitutional protections such as double jeopardy and the ex post facto clause,which are intended to protect citizens against sanctions 
even under,the punitive damages claim here is not criminal punishment 
we alternatively hold that even under the analysis,section does not violate the ex post facto clause in considering the validity of a statute for ex post facto purposes,we must determine whether the legislature meant to establish or affect civil proceedings or,by intention or practical effect,imposed criminal punishment.smith,supra,at.holding that alaska registration scheme for convicted sex offenders was not an ex post facto law.whether a statutory scheme is civil or criminal under the ex post facto doctrine is first of all a question of statutory construction.we consider the statute text and structure to determine the legislative objective.if we conclude that the statute as applied retroactively was intended to punish,then our inquiry is over and we will find an ex post facto violation.id.at.although the manner of codification and the statute placement in a civil or criminal code are not dispositive,they are strong indicators of the legislature intent.id.at.section is found in our code of civil procedure in a chapter prescribing the limitations periods for a variety of common law and other civil causes of action.code civ.that chapter,in turn,is contained in a title of the code of civil procedure which is called of the time of commencing civil actions.code civ,part,title.section is,by its terms,applicable to action s for recovery of damages suffered as a result of childhood sexual abuse,subd.a.the companion revival of otherwise barred criminal proceedings for child molesters was found in penal code section,subdivision g,the statute found unconstitutional in stogner.based on this,we conclude that the legislature did not intend to impose punishment of a criminal nature 
despite the legislature clear intent to establish civil,not criminal proceedings,we will find an ex post facto violation if the statutory scheme is so punitive in purpose or effect that it negates the legislature intentions.this requires the clearest proof,however.only i n those limited circumstances will we consider the statute to have established criminal proceedings for constitutional purposes.hendricks,supra,at.according to the bishop,because punitive damages share certain characteristics in common with criminal punishment,they satisfy this standard as set forth below,we disagree.
in analyzing whether the revival of punitive damages under section creates an essentially criminal proceeding,we refer to the seven factors noted in,which we have quoted verbatim in footnote,ante.smith,supra,at.because these factors apply in various constitutional contexts,they are useful guideposts and are not exhaustive or dispositive.smith,supra,at.
the first factor asks whether punitive damages impose an affirmative disability or restraint.imprisonment is the paradigmatic restraint.smith,supra,at.itself is an affirmative disability case,as a citizen was stripped of his citizenship,supra,at,fn,there are many ways in which a man might lose his freedom.civil monetary penalties and loss of one occupation,on the other hand,are not affirmative disabilities or restraints.hudson,supra,at.united states ward,d.much the same as civil penalties,punitive damages impose neither an affirmative disability nor any restraint.
our second inquiry is to determine whether common law punitive damages have historically been regarded as criminal punishment.although it is true,as discussed earlier,that punitive damages are designed to impose punishment,we do not believe
