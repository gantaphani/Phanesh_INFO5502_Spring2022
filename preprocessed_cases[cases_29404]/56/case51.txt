james anthony mason appeals the district court sentencing determination that he is a career offender under sentencing guidelines manual.mason argues that he is not a career offender because his state conviction for unarmed robbery committed when he was sixteen should not have been counted.mason robbery conviction can be used to sentence him as a career offender under only if the offense would be counted in the computation of criminal history points under guidelines d.section,application note,requires an adult sentence before the conviction can be counted.because mason received a juvenile sentence for his robbery conviction,that conviction can not serve to make him a career offender.we therefore vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing.
in april mason pled guilty to distributing cocaine base in violation of a.in the presentence report the probation officer assigned mason a total offense level of.in addition,the probation officer concluded that mason was a career offender,which automatically placed him in criminal history category vi.mason objected to this conclusion,arguing that one of the convictions used to classify him as a career offender should not have been counted.according to mason,that conviction,one for an unarmed robbery committed when he was sixteen,does not qualify under guidelines because he was not convicted and sentenced as an adult.the district court overruled mason objection and adopted the probation officer recommendation.as a result,mason total offense level of and his criminal history category of vi yielded an imprisonment range of to months.on july,the district court sentenced mason to months in prison and three years of supervised release.
a defendant is a career offender under guidelines if he was at least eighteen when he committed the instant offense of conviction,the instant offense of conviction is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense,and he has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.mason conceded at sentencing that he met conditions and.he also conceded that he had one prior felony conviction that qualified as a predicate offense under condition.this was a federal conviction for a controlled substance offense that mason committed when he was.mason argued,however,that a unarmed robbery,committed when he was a juvenile,did not result in an adult conviction and sentence and should not have been counted as a predicate offense.
the history of mason conviction and sentence for the unarmed robbery is as follows.on july,when he was sixteen,mason was taken into custody in connection with a robbery in kanawha county,west virginia.the county prosecutor petitioned the circuit court the state trial court to transfer mason case from the court juvenile jurisdiction to its adult criminal jurisdiction.the petition for transfer was granted,and a grand jury then indicted mason on two counts of robbery and one count of malicious wounding.on july,mason pled guilty to one count of unarmed robbery,a felony,in exchange for the dismissal of the other two counts.in its order adjudging mason guilty of unarmed robbery,the court indicated that mason understood that he could be sentenced to the west virginia penitentiary for an indeterminate term of five to eighteen years.mason was not sentenced to the penitentiary,however.instead,on august,the circuit court sentenced mason as a juvenile offender under west virginia code e,which permitted such treatment even though mason had been convicted under the court adult jurisdiction.specifically,mason was sentenced to the custody of the commissioner of corrections until his twentieth birthday.mason was confined to the industrial home for boys until he turned eighteen on march,at which time his sentence was suspended and he was placed on three years probation.mason got into trouble before his probation expired.on april,mason was found to have violated the conditions of his probation by breaking into an automobile and committing larceny and by possessing marijuana.his probation was revoked,and he was sent to the penitentiary for an indeterminate term of five to eighteen years.he was paroled in and discharged from parole in.
at mason sentencing on the current offense the central issue was whether his conviction and sentence was an adult disposition that qualified as a predicate conviction for career offender status.the district court concluded that mason was prosecuted as an adult,a fact that was not altered by the juvenile sentence imposed under west virginia code e.thus,according to the district court,mason had a second adult conviction under guidelines that qualified as a predicate offense for career offender status.mason appeals this legal determination,which we review de novo.see united states daughtrey,cir.we apply the november,guidelines,which were in effect in july when mason was sentenced on his current offense.see a.
mason argues that the district court erred in using his conviction for a robbery offense,committed when he was sixteen,to classify him as a career offender.specifically,mason argues that guidelines,covering career offenders,directs the sentencing court to refer to to determine whether an offense can be counted.see,cmt.mason further argues that under d and its commentary his conviction should be counted only if he received both an adult conviction and an adult sentence.finally,mason contends that because he was sentenced as a juvenile for the robbery conviction,that conviction should not have been counted.we agree with mason and hold that he should not have been classified as a career offender.
the career offender classification requires,among other conditions,that the defendant have at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.a p rior felony conviction means a prior adult federal or state conviction,cmt.emphasis added.therefore,a juvenile conviction can not be counted in determining whether a defendant is a career offender.in addition,not all adult convictions for violent crimes or drug offenses count towards career offender status.before an adult conviction is counted,the guidelines for computing criminal history must be consulted the provisions of definitions and instructions for computing criminal history are applicable to the counting of convictions under,cmt.our court has been very clear about the role of in determining career offender status under whether a prior conviction must be counted under is determined by reference to.united states bacon,cir.
section d deals with whether offenses committed prior to age eighteen are to be included in the criminal history calculation 
if the defendant was convicted as an adult and received a sentence of imprisonment exceeding one year and one month,add points under a for each such sentence.
in any other case,
a add points under b for each adult or juvenile sentence to confinement of at least sixty days if the defendant was released from such confinement within five years of his commencement of the instant offense 
b add point under c for each adult or juvenile sentence imposed within five years of the defendant commencement of the instant offense not covered in a.
the commentary to gives further instructions on how to count offenses committed prior to age eighteen 
attempting to count every juvenile adjudication would have the potential for creating large disparities due to the differential availability of records.therefore,for offenses committed prior to age eighteen,only those that resulted in adult sentences of imprisonment exceeding one year and one month,or resulted in imposition of an adult or juvenile sentence or release from confinement on that sentence within five years of the defendant commencement of the instant offense are counted.
cmt.emphasis added.
mason was sixteen when he committed the robbery leading to the conviction that he claims the district court erroneously counted.when mason commenced the offense in this case in,more than five years had passed since his sentence and release from confinement under his conviction.for that reason,the conviction
