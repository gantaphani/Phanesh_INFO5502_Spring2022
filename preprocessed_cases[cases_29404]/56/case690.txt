in this opinion involving petitions filed in the juvenile court by the people pursuant to welfare and institutions code section,we hold a purported assignment of such cases for all purposes,including trial,to a particular judge in a particular department did not constitute a valid assignment for all purposes sufficient to trigger the time for peremptory challenge of the judge code civ,where the purported assignment was made in the notice of petition by a deputy court clerk,pursuant to an informal court practice rather than a court rule or order.
we consolidated the petitions of the two minors,daniel and jamie,who were the subjects of unrelated proceedings.they separately petitioned this court for writs of after the juvenile court denied as untimely their peremptory challenges to judge barbara kronlund.after receiving a preliminary opposition from the people in daniel case,we issued alternative writs in both cases and orders staying further proceedings in the juvenile court.
we now discharge the alternative writs and issue peremptory writs directing the juvenile court to vacate its orders denying the section challenges and to accept the challenges.
factual and procedural background 
on may,the district attorney filed in juvenile court a petition against daniel,alleging he committed three felony violations of penal code section,subdivision a,lewd or lascivious act on a child under age.the document began with a notice,the first paragraph of which stated 
a petition as hereafter set forth has been filed in the above entitled court and has been set for hearing on thursday june,at the hour of,in the juvenile court,san joaquin county,located at address.the case has been assigned to judge kronlund,in for all purposes,including trial.the underlined words were handwritten on underlined blanks in the typewritten paragraph.the notice part of the document ended with a date stamp,a typewritten reference to the court clerk,and signature or signature stamp of a deputy court clerk on the next line,the petition began.copies of the first pages of the documents filed against daniel and jamie are attached to this opinion as an appendix,with identifying information deleted.
at the initial hearing on june,which both sides call an arraignment,judge kronlund appointed counsel and set the matter for a jurisdictional hearing on july,in department.nothing in the minute order reflected an assignment for all purposes.
on july,daniel case was called in department,with an assigned,retired judge,judge richard haugner,presiding.daniel denied the allegations,and the matter was set for a contested jurisdictional hearing on august,in department also on july,daniel filed a peremptory challenge to judge kronlund.
on august,the case was called for the contested jurisdictional hearing before judge kronlund.she struck the section peremptory challenge as untimely,on the ground that the case was assigned to her for all purposes in the notice of petition,and therefore the section challenge should have been made no later than days after the june,arraignment.the hearing was continued.
daniel filed in this court a petition for writ of and stay of proceedings.at our request,the people filed a preliminary opposition,and daniel filed a response.on october,we issued an alternative writ of mandate and stayed juvenile court proceedings with respect to daniel 
daniel petition alleges,and the people admit,that the juvenile division of respondent court has two juvenile delinquency departments,and judge michael coughlan regularly sits in,while judge kronlund regularly sits in.daniel deputy public defender submitted a declaration stating that respondent court,in an effort to distribute the juvenile delinquency case workload evenly,instituted in october a procedure whereby,at arraignment,cases are assigned to and cases are assigned to,regardless of complexity or subject matter.sometimes,but not always,the people juvenile petitions would state assignments to judge coughlan or judge kronlund for all purposes.at jurisdictional hearings,most matters set for contested hearings are set in the same department unless a section challenge is filed.the juvenile court has not conducted itself as if cases were assigned for all purposes.the two departments transfer cases between themselves and also frequently have visiting judges fill in when judge kronlund or judge coughlan is absent,without any reference to assignment for all purposes.daniel attorney declared that a recent unrelated case was initially assigned to judge coughlan for a contested jurisdictional hearing,but he was presiding over another hearing,so the case was transferred to judge kronlund,who refused to consider the case as assigned to judge coughlan for all purposes and insisted on hearing the case until counsel filed a section challenge.
daniel also submitted a reporter transcript from the hearing at which judge kronlund denied the section challenge.the transcript shows daniel attorney argued that when a case is assigned to one judge for all purposes,there is supposed to be an attempt to schedule matters so as not to conflict with the judge absences,and,it not the way this court is run.counsel said his short experience in this juvenile division was that other judges frequently heard whatever was on the calendar for that day,and daniel case had had two judges for three appearances.
the people return denies the foregoing allegations and submits declarations including the following 
judge richard vlavianos declared that in november,while he was presiding judge of the juvenile court within the san joaquin county superior court,he made the decision to implement a direct calendar or one kid,one judge system,with the concurrence of our presiding judge presumably the presiding judge of the san joaquin county superior court.the purpose was to equalize the court workload and provide consistency that would benefit the children and their families.judge vlavianos said,i ran my thoughts by my presiding judge who agreed and authorized me to implement a one kid,one judge calendar.judge vlavianos met with supervisors of the public defender and district attorney offices and told them he wanted a one kid,one judge system,and that cases would be assigned to department,and cases would be assigned to department,except for drug court and certain vehicle code cases.the judge showed the supervisors a court calendar,effective november,which said nothing about assignment for all purposes,but merely contained the word odd under department and even under department,where two judges sat at the time.judge vlavianos declared that in early after we issued a writ in an unrelated case due to lack of notice,respondent court began placing notices of the assignments on the courtroom doors,on counsel tables inside the courtrooms,and in the notice of petition judge vlavianos declared at all times i believed that the court has the inherent power to choose the calendaring system that it believes will best serve its constituents.i am unaware of any requirement that a rule of court be promulgated prior to a calendaring system being put into place.
the people also submitted a declaration from judge kronlund,who declared she is the regular judge in department,and her name appears on the courtroom door and on a nameplate on the bench.judge kronlund attested that c ases are not frequently transferred out of one juvenile delinquency department and sent to the other.on rare occasion a visiting judge will fill in if myself or judge michael coughlan is away from the court,but these instances are few and far between.it is not common practice to transfer cases out of the department to which the case has been assigned for all purposes,and that happens only rarely for good cause,if it happens at all.in this circumstance,i permit a motion to be filed since there would have been a change in the assigned judge.this is the same practice and policy followed by our civil departments who are under a direct calendar system as well.
while acknowledging a different judge handled daniel july,hearing,judge kronlund declared this was very unusual and was necessitated by her covering for absent manteca court judges judge kronlund said she has informed lawyers on a fairly regular basis that the cases assigned to her have been assigned for all purposes but she did not say she informed the lawyers in either of the cases now before us.
the people also submitted a declaration from a deputy court clerk who described her practice and her performance in daniel case of filling in the blanks in the section petition to assign cases to judge kronlund in department.attached to the clerk declaration was an apparent checklist used by deputy court clerks for opening juvenile petitions.
daniel filed a replication with a declaration from four deputy public defenders assigned to the juvenile division,who attested it happens quite frequently that visiting judges preside in and handle matters scheduled in departments and,and we can not recall any of them ever asking to continue any case for a particular judge return from absence because that case had been assigned at first arraignment to an absent judge for all purposes.instead,such visiting judges simply handle the case load for that particular day,whatever it may be.
jamie case followed a similar path.on june,the people filed a petition alleging he committed a felony violation of penal code section,subdivision a forcible rape,one felony violation of penal code section first degree burglary,and one felony violation of penal code section,subdivision a dissuading a witness.the notice of petition stated with a deputy court clerk signature or signature stamp that the case was assigned for all purposes,including trial,to judge kronlund in department.at the arraignment on august,judge kronlund appointed counsel and set a jurisdictional hearing for september.a retired judge judge glenn ritchey,presided at the september hearing where jamie denied the allegations and set the matter for a contested jurisdictional hearing on october,jamie immediately made a section challenge,which judge kronlund later denied as untimely.the court allowed the people to add another felony violation and continued the hearing.
on october,jamie filed in this court his petition for a writ of and stay of proceedings.we consolidated the cases of daniel and jamie for purposes of proceedings in this court.on november,we issued an alternative writ of mandate and stayed juvenile court proceedings with respect to jamie as we had previously done with daniel.the people filed a return,and jamie filed a replication.

writ review of orders denying peremptory challenge 
an order denying a peremptory challenge is not an appealable order and may be reviewed only by way of a petition for writ of mandate,subd.d.the standard of review is abuse of discretion,and a trial court abuses its discretion when it erroneously denies as untimely a section challenge.hemingway superior court th,d hemingway grant superior court th,d.

as a general rule,section permits challenge of a judge at any time before commencement of a trial or contested hearing,with three exceptions the assignment rule at issue in this case the master calendar rule and the rule.people superior court lavi cal th,d,lavi.
the first exception,assignment,involves assignments that instantly pinpoint one judge who will be expected to preside at trial and to process the case in its totality from the time of the assignment,thereby acquiring expertise with the factual and legal issues in the case,which will accelerate the legal process.lavi,supra,cal th,d.section,subdivision a,provides if directed to the trial of a cause that has been assigned to a judge for all purposes,the motion shall be made to the assigned judge or to the presiding judge by a party within days after notice of the all purpose assignment,or if the party has not yet appeared in the action,then within days after the appearance.
the second exception,master calendar courts,refers to a system where a case is assigned to a judge the peremptory challenge must be filed no later than the time the case is assigned for trial,subd.a lavi,supra,cal th,d.
the third exception,known as the rule,provides that where the judge other than a judge assigned for all purposes is known at least days before the date set for trial,the motion shall be made at least five days before the trial date,subd.a lavi,supra,cal th at,d.
the applicability of these exceptions is not necessarily determined by labels used by the court,but by function and purpose.lavi,supra,cal th,d,that judge department was labeled as master calendar court,although persuasive,was not conclusive see also,ruiz appellate division of the superior court th,d ruiz court did not have master calendar system merely because it assigned cases to ready courts on the direction of the assistant supervising judge,where the court did not give notice that it was a master calendar system.labels used by the court may be viewed as prima facie evidence as to what type of assignment occurred,and the party contesting the label has the burden of establishing that the label does not fit.id.at,d,shipp superior court th,d.
section calls for automatic reassignment to another judge if a challenge is duly presented,subd.a.
iii.application to these cases 
the minors argue the district attorney office has no authority to assign cases to a judge.however,as we have explained fn,ante we are satisfied that the assignments were made by the court clerk,not by the district attorney office.
the people argue the assignment for section purposes was made in the notice of petition when the court clerk assigned each case to judge kronlund for all purposes,including trial pursuant to the unwritten local practice of respondent court.the minors argue these notices were ineffective for section purposes,and respondent court does not otherwise treat cases as assigned to one judge for all purposes.we shall conclude that,for purposes of triggering the time demands of section,an assignment can not be made by a deputy court clerk pursuant to an informal,unwritten local practice,but rather requires a valid order from a judge or a valid written local court rule.
daniel made his peremptory challenge at his second appearance,at the conclusion of the first jurisdictional hearing at which there was no adjudication of any contested issue,when judge haugner set the case for a contested jurisdictional hearing.
jamie also made his peremptory challenge at his second appearance,at the conclusion of the first jurisdictional hearing at which there was no adjudication of any contested issue,when judge ritchey set the case for a contested jurisdictional hearing.
in their preliminary opposition to the writ petition,the people suggested that,because contested issues could have been adjudicated at the first jurisdictional hearing,any section challenge should have been made before the first jurisdictional hearing even though the first such hearing for each minor turned out to have a visiting judge.we disagree.for purposes of applying section in juvenile court proceedings,trial means the adjudicatory phase of the jurisdictional hearing,the hearing at which the minor is exposed to a finding of truth of allegations contained in a petition filed pursuant to welfare and institutions code section.in re abdul d.at the first jurisdictional hearing under welfare and institutions code section,the juvenile court reads the petition,advises of the right to a hearing on the issues raised by the petition,and asks if the minor admits or denies the allegations.rule.if the minor denies the allegations,the court shall hold a contested hearing to determine whether the allegations in the petition are true.rule.in abdul,we said the rules contemplated the jurisdictional hearing may be bifurcated into two phases,and we distinguished between the preliminary phase of the jurisdictional hearing,which is the functional equivalent of the pretrial stage of adult criminal proceedings,and the adjudicatory phase.abdul,supra,d at.we said that,so long as a peremptory challenge is filed in an otherwise timely fashion before the commencement of the adjudicatory phase,the challenge complies with the statutory timetable.ibid.we also held that section may be triggered if the preliminary phase of the jurisdictional hearing includes a hearing on contested fact issues relating to the merits,a motion to suppress evidence,of a confession or other matter tending to establish guilt or innocence of the accused.abdul,supra,d at.
here,the minute orders do not reflect adjudication of any contested issues during the first jurisdictional hearing for each minor.
thus,the minors peremptory challenges were timely,unless the assignment rule applies,such that each minor would have been required to make the section challenge within days of his first appearance.the question is whether each case was validly assigned for all purposes to judge kronlund by the time of the arraignment,as the people contend.
an assignment to one judge for all purposes,including trial,is sometimes called direct calendaring.zilog,superior court th,d.as noted in lavi,supra,cal th at,d,section does not explain when an assignment to a judge may be deemed one for all purposes.an assignment clearly contemplates assignment to a specific judge to process the litigation in its totality rather than a trial department in which the identity of the judge is subject to the vagaries of personal and administrative necessity.the purpose of such assignment is to permit the efficient disposition of complex matters and this commendable purpose would be utterly frustrated unless there is certainty that once assigned,the judge will preside over the action from beginning to end.citation.thus,when there is an all purpose assignment,t he litigant does not need any further information to know who will try the case,because the assignment instantly pinpoints that judge.citation.lavi,supra,cal th at,d.f or a case assignment to be an all purpose assignment,two prerequisites must be met.first,the method of assigning cases must instantly pinpoint the judge whom the parties can expect to ultimately preside at trial.fn.omitted.second,that same judge must be expected to process the case in its totality citation,from the time of the assignment fn.omitted,thereby acquiring an expertise regarding the factual and legal issues involved,which will accelerate the legal process.citation.c omplicated and potentially long case s are particularly conducive to all purpose assignments.citations.id.at,d.
lavi clarified in a footnote that it is not necessary particularly in criminal cases that a single judge handle every matter in a given case in order to make an all purpose assignment.it suffices if,at the time of the all purpose assignment,substantial matters remain to be processed in addition to trial,and the assigned judge is expected to process all those matters from that point on thus allowing him or her to acquire expertise in,and familiarity with,the intricacies of the case lavi,supra,cal th at,fn,d.
lavi also noted in a footnote,when there is an assignment to a department by number,if a particular judge regularly presides in that department and that judge identity is either known to the litigant or discoverable on reasonable inquiry,and if there is reasonable certainty that this judge will ultimately hear the case,evidence is produced indicating that the case will likely remain in the department to which it was initially assigned,then a court may properly invoke the all purpose assignment rule,assuming such an assignment is involved.lavi,supra,cal th at,fn,d.
here,the people acknowledge there was no court order assigning these cases.they nevertheless argue the assignment was made pursuant to rule,which says,the presiding judge may,on the court motion,order the assignment of any case to one judge for all or such limited purposes as will promote the efficient administration of justice.however,section defines an order as follows every direction of a court or judge,made or entered in writing,and not included in a judgment,is denunciated an order.italics added.here,the presiding judge neither made nor directed entry of a written order assigning for all purposes the two cases at issue in this opinion.consequently,rule is inapplicable.
the people argue it was local court policy to assign juvenile cases for all purposes based on case number odd numbers went to department and even numbers went to,and therefore the case was validly assigned when the deputy court clerk filled in the blanks on the notice of petition,assigning the cases for all purposes to judge kronlund in department,and therefore the minors should have invoked section within days of their first appearance 
however,there was no formal local court rule or court order creating assignment to one judge for all purposes,but rather a mere informal practice set up by a former presiding judge of the juvenile court with apparently verbal consent of the presiding judge of the superior court.
the people suggest no formal rule was required.although the judge who instituted the practice did not cite any statutory authority in his declaration,the people invoke section,which provides in part a every court shall have the power to do all of the following to provide for the orderly conduct of proceedings before it,or its officers.to compel obedience to its judgments,orders,and process to amend and control its process and orders so as to make them conform to law and justice,subd.a.
however,section merely confers authority it says nothing about how that authority is exercised.we shall conclude that,if a court wants a direct calendar system for all juvenile court cases for section purposes,the court must adopt a formal local rule as respondent court did with other types of cases in san joaquin county,so that counsel will not be left guessing when a section challenge must be filed.
division iv trial court administration of title six of the california rules of court states in rule that the presiding judge of the trial court has ultimate authority to make judicial assignments must d esignate a presiding judge of the juvenile division must s upervise the court calendar and may delegate any of the specific duties listed in this rule to another judge or,if the duty does not require the exercise of judicial authority,to the court executive officer.rule c,d.
every court may make rules for its own government and the government of its officers not inconsistent with law or with the rules adopted and prescribed by the judicial council,subd.a see also presiding judge of superior court may propose local rules to expedite the business of the court.
although courts have inherent supervisory and administrative powers to carry out their duties motion picture television fund hospital superior court,supra,th at,d,i t is unrealistic to expect all counsel,including those who may primarily practice in other counties,to be aware of the unwritten rules for assignment of cases ruiz,supra,th at,d there was no official designation or even advance notice that the court was acting as a master calendar court merely because it assigned cases to ready courts on the direction of the assistant supervising judge.
the right to exercise a peremptory challenge under section is a substantial right and an important part of california system of due process that promotes fair and impartial trials and confidence in the judiciary.citation.courts must refrain from any tactic or maneuver that has the practical effect of diminishing this important right.hemingway,supra,th at,d.hemingway,which involved domestic violence courts,held a purported assignment was of no legal consequence for section purposes,where there was no evidence the presiding judge or the supervising judge had ever delegated any assignment power to the judge who was sitting as a magistrate when she first assigned the case to herself and the court conceded magistrates lacked jurisdiction to make all purpose assignments hemingway,at,d an administrative order relied on by the court did not state that domestic violence cases were assigned to one particular judge or courtroom id.at,d domestic violence cases were handled by a master calendar system that assigned a ready case to an open court id.at,d and domestic violence courts could not be governed by local custom but required formal published rules id.at,d.hemingway said the record was devoid of any evidence that the superior court created or intended to create a direct calendaring system.id.at,d.
although the facts of our case differ from hemingway,supra,th,d,here respondent court did attempt to create a direct calendar system,we find applicable to these juvenile court cases hemingway reasoning that the structure and procedures of domestic violence courts can not be governed by local custom and tradition,but must be governed by existing law and implemented by rules adopted in compliance with california rules of court,rule this provision requires that each court publish its local rules controlling the practice or procedure of a court,or judge,and make copies available for distribution to attorneys and litigants.local rule is defined as every rule,regulation,order,policy,form,or standard of general application adopted by a court to govern practice or procedure in that judge courtroom.should the presiding judge choose to delegate any aspect of his or her authority to another judge,adequate notice must be given so litigants and lawyers can make intelligent decisions regarding the filing of disqualification motions.hemingway,supra,th at,d rule j rule does not apply to local rules that relate only to the internal management of the court.
hemingway reasoning hemingway,supra,th,d applies to section challenges in juvenile court cases under welfare and institutions code section.we add that the policy of adequate notice is not satisfied by the fact that respondent court told representatives of the offices of the prosecutor and public defender about the practice when it was first started in.employees come and go,institutional memory dims,and minors rights to invoke section in future cases should not depend on the vagaries of unwritten rules that may or may not be passed down from one generation of employees to the next.
the people cite shipp superior court,supra,th,d,which held that,under a local trial court policy assigning family law cases for all purposes to a specific judge in a specific department and requiring all proceedings in the case to be held in the assigned department unless otherwise ordered by the court,there was an assignment for all purposes within the meaning of section.in shipp,however,the local policy was a formal policy printed in the manual of procedures for the family law department of the los angeles county superior court,a manual of which the petitioner was concededly aware.id.at,d.here,as indicated,there was some evidence of an intent to create a direct calendar system by the former presiding judge of the juvenile division.however,there is no evidence such a system was ever validly created.there is no formal policy or rule of court printed in a court manual that gives notice to litigants or their attorneys that would put them on notice of the need to exercise a peremptory challenge under section.at most,there was only an informal arrangement of calendaring.
though not cited by the parties,we note an unwritten practice by a juvenile court was endorsed in a juvenile dependency case welf,et in in re jeanette d,which said,under the juvenile court inherent power,the informal adoption of a policy requiring the mutual exchange of witnesses in appropriate cases is justified even in the absence of a more formal rule.id.at.however,in addition to encouraging adoption of a formal rule id.at,fn,the appellate court specified,our holding here does not extend to juvenile court proceedings arising under section et of the welfare and institutions code where minors fifth amendment rights may be implicated.id.at.moreover,section itself implicates due process rights,and c ourts must refrain from any tactic or maneuver that has the practical effect of diminishing this important right.hemingway,supra,th at,d.thus,jeanette is inapposite.
we conclude that,if respondent court wants to have a local practice that has the dire consequence of starting the clock on section rights in a juvenile case under welfare and institutions code section,it must do so by adopting a formal local rule.
here,there are no published local rules governing the assignment of juvenile cases in respondent court.respondent court has published local rules for its juvenile court,but nothing in those rules addresses assignment of cases.
the people argue this case is governed by san joaquin county superior court local rule which authorizes the court clerk to give notice of an assignment for all purposes including section when the case is subject to direct calendaring.however,local rule can not apply to juvenile court cases,because it expressly states it applies to unlimited jurisdiction cases only.juvenile courts are courts of limited jurisdiction.welf,each superior court shall exercise the jurisdiction conferred by this chapter which includes welf,and while sitting in the exercise of such jurisdiction,shall be known and referred to as the juvenile court in re chantal cal th,d,a juvenile court is a superior court exercising limited jurisdiction arising under juvenile law.
the people argue that,even if local rule does not apply to juvenile cases,its principle is parallel ed in the informal practice used in the juvenile court division.to the contrary,local rule express restriction to cases of unlimited jurisdiction,together with the absence of a similar provision in the local rules governing juvenile cases,suggests respondent court can not import local rule substance into juvenile cases,particularly since there is some question as to whether the juvenile court division truly treats assignments as assignments for purposes other than section 
we conclude that,for purposes of section challenges in juvenile cases under welfare and institutions code section,an assignment for all purposes requires either a valid order from a judge or a valid written local court rule.
iv.whether a formal policy would trigger section 
petitioners suggest that if the san joaquin court were to institute a formal written policy assigning cases to judges for all purposes,based on the case number being odd or even,such policy would constitute an abuse of discretion because it would conflict with the policy of expeditious resolution of juvenile cases and would violate the equal protection and due process clauses of the united states and california constitutions.
we decline to consider these arguments.they appear inconsistent with the statement in petitioners replications that daniel does not dispute that the san joaquin superior court may,if it wishes,create a direct calendaring system for juvenile delinquency cases additionally,the arguments are not necessary to resolution of the two cases now before us,and the answers may depend on the specifics of any future policy formally adopted by respondent court.
thus,as we have noted,there is an unresolved factual issue as to whether respondent court treats assignments as true assignments for purposes other than section.we can not tell from this record what happens when a visiting judge handles a scheduled matter,whether or not there is any acknowledgement that the case has an assigned judge,and whether the court attempts to schedule matters around the assigned judge scheduled vacations or judicial conferences.
thus,even assuming respondent court adopts a formal written rule for juvenile cases,that may not end the matter,because future parties may challenge the rule on the ground that the rule places a meaningless label on cases.as indicated,the label used by the court is prima facie evidence but is not necessarily controlling.lavi,supra,cal th at,d,that judge department was labeled as master calendar court,although persuasive,was not conclusive.
we conclude the assignments in these two cases were not made by order of a judge or pursuant to a written local rule,and therefore the
