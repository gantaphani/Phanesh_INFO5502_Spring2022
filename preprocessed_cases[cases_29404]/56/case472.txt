factual and procedural background 
on may,agency filed a petition in the juvenile court alleging was at substantial risk of harm because her parents had a history of substance abuse and domestic violence,and on may,michael injured during a physical altercation he had with mother,elena welf,subds.a,b.the court held a detention hearing that day,but the whereabouts of and the parents were unknown.because michael was an enrolled member of the viejas tribe and was eligible for enrollment,the court found icwa applied and ordered agency to send notice to the tribe.the court issued a and detain order for 
at the time of the jurisdiction hearing on june,the parents whereabouts remained unknown,who was represented by counsel,was present in court.mary was also present.the court sustained the allegations of the petition under welfare and institutions code section,subdivisions a and b,again found icwa applied,and ordered agency to evaluate all relatives for placement.at the conclusion of the jurisdiction hearing,was taken into protective custody.mary gave the social worker belongings,as well as a form entitled designation of indian custodian,signed by elena on may,transferring temporary care and custody of under icwa to mary and the paternal aunt,amber 
in a report prepared for the july disposition hearing,agency attached the designation of indian custodian form signed by elena.agency also attached a letter from the viejas tribe stating its preference for placing with amber on the viejas indian reservation.at the july hearing,the court and counsel acknowledged and discussed mary indian custodian status.
agency recommended be placed in an foster home,but not with amber or mary because amber did not want to care for,and mary did not pass background checks.agency was also concerned about mary ability to protect because in,mary was indian custodian for a period of time and failed to protect from the ongoing violence between the parents.at the request of counsel for the viejas tribe tribal counsel,the court continued the disposition hearing.
at the continued hearing on july,tribal counsel argued that because mary had custody of at the time the petition was filed,agency was required to seek removal from her.on august,agency filed a subsequent petition under welfare and institutions code section,alleging mary,indian custodian,was aware of and failed to protect from severe domestic violence between the parents.tribal counsel suggested the court appoint counsel for mary on the subsequent petition because she became indian custodian before the court made its jurisdictional findings.agency acknowledged mary could be entitled to counsel.the court continued the hearing to address the indian custodian issue and ordered mary to return.
at the time of the continued hearing on august,elena filed with the court a document entitled revocation of designation of indian custodian,revoking her transfer of care and custody to mary and amber.the court granted agency request to dismiss the welfare and institutions code section subsequent petition on the ground mary was no longer indian custodian.
on september,agency reported that had been placed in an indian foster home approved by a foster family agency but not by the viejas tribe.agency was still trying to locate a foster home.michael had not contacted agency or visited in several months.in october,michael was arrested following a shooting incident on the viejas indian reservation.
at a disposition hearing that began on november and concluded on december,the court admitted into evidence a declaration by indian expert phillip powers,stating active efforts had been made to provide remedial and rehabilitative services to the parents to prevent the breakup of the indian family,and those efforts had been unsuccessful.powers recommended the court declare a dependent and remove her from parental custody based on evidence would be at great risk of serious physical and emotional harm in her parents care.
the social worker testified continued to live in the indian foster home.the caregivers engaged in tribal cultural activities and had other indian children in their care.a foster home approved by the viejas tribe had not been found.the social worker could not recommend placing with mary because she had a criminal and child welfare history,and because she previously had custody of and returned her to the parents even though she knew about the domestic violence.agency could not waive mary conviction for cruelty to a child for purposes of placing with her.
michael testified he wanted placed with mary or other paternal relatives.he said he signed a designation of indian custodian form on may,transferring custody of to mary.he did not revoke the transfer and intended that mary remain indian custodian.the court admitted michael designation of indian custodian form into evidence.
mary testified she was present when both parents signed the designation of indian custodian forms on may.was in mary custody from may until june.mary explained that in she was arrested for driving under the influence with a child in the car,resulting in her conviction for child endangerment.
mary further testified she had not seen any bruises on elena,and was unaware of the domestic violence incident in may.she believed the juvenile court previously intervened in because elena was immature and jealous.mary denied knowing michael was physically abusive to elena.she had never seen michael hit elena,but she would consider the possibility that domestic violence had occurred.mary had not visited since she was placed in foster care.
elena testified she voluntarily designated mary as indian custodian on may,and she signed the form in the presence of mary and michael.elena rescinded the designation in october,but now wanted mary to be indian custodian.
after considering the evidence and hearing argument of counsel,the court declared a dependent and removed her from parental custody under welfare and institutions code section,subdivision c and united states code section e.the court disagreed with the position of michael and the viejas tribe that the jurisdictional findings must be vacated because mary,as indian custodian,was entitled to icwa notice and appointment of counsel.the court noted mary was no longer indian custodian,and neither mary nor the viejas tribe had asserted her status before it was revoked.
the court declined to place with mary,finding mary was unlikely to adequately protect,given her lack of insight regarding michael role in the domestic violence between the parents.the court found current placement qualified as an indian foster home,and even if it did not,there were no other indian homes currently available for 
discussion 
ithe court and agency did not violate icwa notice provisions for an indian custodian 
michael contends the jurisdictional findings and dispositional order must be reversed because the court and agency failed to comply with icwa notice requirements as to mary,who was indian custodian.he asserts that under state and federal law,mary was entitled to notice of her rights to intervene in the proceedings and have counsel appointed.
rights of the indian custodian under icwa 
in,congress enacted icwa in an effort to protect and preserve indian tribes and their resources.icwa was specifically designed to help indian children retain their familial,tribal and cultural ties.in re robert th,d.it sets forth minimum federal standards for removing indian children from their families and placing these children in foster or adoptive homes that reflect the unique values of indian culture.mississippi choctaw indian band holyfield,d.consistent with congress goals,p roceedings in state courts involving the custody of indian children shall follow strict procedures and meet stringent requirements to justify any result in an individual case contrary to those preferences.guidelines for state courts indian child custody proceedings,guidelines.

mary was indian custodian from may,to august,
mary status as indian custodian was created by the parents temporary transfer of physical care,custody and control under icwa to mary on may.the parties do not dispute that was in mary exclusive custody from may until was taken into protective custody on june.the parents,who signed and submitted designation of indian custodian forms,testified it was their intent to confer indian custodian status on mary 
we disagree with agency assertion that the documents signed by the parents were insufficient to show mary was indian custodian.the statutory authority for designation of an indian custodian by a parent does not require a writing.as noted in the house report,a parent temporary transfer of physical custody of an indian child to extended family is often done on an informal basis,supra,reprinted in cong,at.we also disagree with agency assertion that a determination of indian custodian status requires the court to consider the nature,frequency,and duration of contacts between the indian child and his or her custodian.this position has no support in icwa language,legislative history or guidelines,or in any published authority discussing indian custodian status.rather,the concept of the indian custodian grew out of congress concern for the failure of administrative and judicial bodies to recognize the essential tribal relations of indian people and the cultural and social standards prevailing in indian communities and families.to impose standards regarding the nature,frequency,and duration of the indian child contacts with his or her indian custodian would essentially ignore the critical role of extended family in indian society,and thereby perpetuate one of the problems that congress expressly sought to remedy by enacting icwa.
as the juvenile court here noted,elena had temporarily signed over her rights under icwa to the paternal grandmother,making her the indian custodian.the record supports a finding that mary was indian custodian from may to august,the date elena revoked that status.
the failure to send statutory notice to mary did not violate icwa 
the record shows mary was aware of the dependency proceedings because she attended the jurisdiction hearing on june.she did not inform the court or social worker that she had a designation of indian custodian document signed by elena.the court sustained the allegations of the petition and the proceedings concluded without the court or agency ever knowing mary was indian custodian.although mary was not required or expected to understand the legal implications of icwa,disclosure of her status as indian custodian was a matter entirely within her control.because the court and agency did not know or have reason to know mary was indian custodian at the time of the jurisdiction hearing,they can not be faulted for failing to provide her with notice under icwa.
when agency took into protective custody immediately following the jurisdiction hearing on june,mary gave the social worker a designation of indian custodian form,thus putting agency on notice that she was indian custodian.at that point,it was incumbent on agency to provide icwa notice to mary
