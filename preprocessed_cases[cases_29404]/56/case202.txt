factual and procedural summary 
in may,became angry with his mother when she would not give him shopping money.he went into his bedroom in his grandfather home,punched and kicked the walls,and threatened his grandfather when his grandfather tried to intervene.mother called the police,who arrived to find a broken lock on bedroom door,a damaged bed frame,holes in the wall,and damaged furniture.
the san diego county district attorney filed a petition pursuant to section,alleging that had committed felony vandalism pen.code,subd.a b.the juvenile court ordered that be detained outside the home and that he undergo a psychological evaluation.
psychologist richard jordan evaluated and submitted a report.informed jordan that he had previously been diagnosed with adhd attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and odd oppositional defiant disorder,but he claimed to no longer experience adhd symptoms and said that he had not taken medication in two years.told jordan that he had an individualized education program iep at school but did not state the reason test results indicated that he had a composite in the percentile and was functioning in the range intellectually,with no significant strengths or weaknesses.scores indicated that he was performing in the average range,with no significant strengths or weaknesses and that he did not have a learning disorder.jordan concluded that cognition appeared normal and intact his memory was good,and his insight and judgment were fair.he diagnosed with disruptive behavior disorder and recommended individual therapy,but he found to be stable and and did not recommend a psychotropic medical evaluation.
at the settlement conference in early june,asked the court to release him on home supervision.his trial counsel stated that had to attend an iep appointment at school,attend individual counseling,and see a psychiatrist to inquire about adhd medication.the court granted the request and released on home supervision.
at the adjudication hearing on june,the juvenile court heard testimony from mother,grandfather,and the responding police officer and received in evidence a video recording of the incident.the court determined that the people had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the damage exceeded so as to sustain the felony vandalism allegation in the petition.however,the court sustained the petition,finding that had committed the lesser included offense of misdemeanor vandalism pen.code,subd.b a.
in late june,the probation department submitted a social study evaluating for the disposition hearing.the social study noted history of damaging property when upset and his mother tendency to downplay his volatile behavior.the social study indicated that entered special education during his elementary school years but did not take advantage of available services,and that he had an iep of an unknown date.mother reported that had had an iep in place since elementary school the probation department requested a copy of current iep,but the high school registrar did not honor the request.high school did send a record of his grades,attendance,and disciplinary actions.received failing grades in all of his classes in his first semester of high school,and he had a history of truancy.he was suspended for possessing marijuana and was subsequently expelled from his high school.he finished his freshman year at san diego academy,where he received slightly better grades.mother reported that her son did not drink alcohol,consume illicit substances in the last year,or have any gang affiliations.
given poor academic performance and history of truancy,the social study recommended that the court order him to participate in reflections as a condition of probation,suggesting that would benefit from the structured environment,psychiatric and counseling services,and wraparound services that the program would provide.the probation department attached a copy of jordan psychological evaluation to the social study.
at the disposition hearing on june,the juvenile court adopted the probation department recommendations,adjudged a ward of the court pursuant to section,and placed him on supervised probation under his mother care.among the conditions of probation was a requirement that participate in the reflections program the reflections condition 
the minor shall successfully complete the reflections day center program and abide by the rules and conditions of the program.if,for the protection of the minor,staff,or other wards,the reflections staff deems it necessary to temporarily remove minor from the program,the minor may be detained in juvenile hall for a period not to exceed hours for stabilization and mental health crisis intervention.
objected to the reflections condition,but the court overruled his objection and denied his request to set a contested disposition hearing to assess his special educational needs in addition to the reflections condition,the juvenile court imposed the following search condition 
minor shall submit person,property,or vehicle,and any property under immediate custody or control to search at any time,with or without probable cause,with or without a search warrant by any law enforcement officer or peace officers,probation officers,school officials or officers,and any other state security officers or agents engaged in the lawful performance of their duties.
timely appealed.
discussion 
on appeal,challenges the reflections condition,arguing that the juvenile court failed to make necessary findings under rule b as to his special educational needs.he also challenges the search condition as unconstitutionally vague and overbroad because it could permit warrantless searches of electronic devices and data.we disagree with both contentions and conclude that the juvenile court sufficiently considered educational needs when it imposed the reflections condition forfeited his overbreadth challenge by failing to object in the juvenile court and reasonably construed,the search condition does not encompass searches of electronic data and is not unconstitutionally vague.
a.the reflections condition 
contends that the juvenile court failed to comply with rule b d when it imposed the reflections condition.as we explain,we conclude that the court complied with the rule by sufficiently considering educational needs.
legal principles 
special education law involves an interplay of state and federal statutes.pertinent here,at the federal level,congress enacted the individuals with disabilities education act idea to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education that emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs d a.pursuant to the idea,a child with a disability is a child who needs special education and related services on account of intellectual disabilities,hearing impairments including deafness,speech or language impairments,visual impairments including blindness,serious emotional disturbance,orthopedic impairments,autism,traumatic brain injury,other health impairments,or specific learning disabilities.a see a.
the idea lays out a substantive procedure for developing an individualized education program iep for children with disabilities.county of san diego california special ed.hearing office cir.a parent or local educational agency may request an initial evaluation.a b.if a child is deemed to be a child with a disability,an iep team consisting of parents,teachers,and local agency representatives then prepare an iep for the student.d a b.the iep describes how the student disability affects his or her performance in the general education curriculum,recommends specifically designed instruction and related services reasonably calculated to enable a child to make progress appropriate in light of the child circumstances,and sets measurable annual goals.d a i endrew ex rel.joseph douglas county school dist,see in re carl,supra,th at.
at the state level,education code section provides that all individuals with exceptional needs have a right to participate in free appropriate public education.an individual with exceptional needs is one who has been identified by an iep team as a child with a disability under the idea has an impairment that requires instruction and services,which can not be provided with modification of the regular school program and meets certain eligibility criteria.ed.code,subds.a d see cal.code,tit.students whose educational needs are due primarily to limited english proficiency a lack of instruction in reading or mathematics temporary physical disabilities social maladjustment or environmental,cultural,or economic factors are not individuals with exceptional needs.ed.code,subd.e.
the california rules of court implement these federal and state mandates in juvenile delinquency proceedings.rules of court have the force of law and are as binding as procedural statutes as long as they are not inconsistent with statutory or constitutional law.superior court th.rule incorporates federal and state laws regarding education and developmental services but does not purport to create new rights.rule a.pursuant to rule b a,at the disposition hearing or any subsequent hearing affecting the minor education,the juvenile court must determine whether the minor educational needs,including the need for special education and related services,are being met.the court findings and orders must address whether the minor educational needs are being met and indicate any special education and related services,assessments,or evaluations the minor may need.rule b e.
before a dispositional hearing,the juvenile court must ensure that,to the extent the information was available,the social worker or the probation officer provided certain information in the report for the hearing.rule c,italics added.in particular,where available,reports must indicate whether the child has physical,mental,or disabilities or other characteristics indicating a need for developmental services or special education and related services indicate whether the child is receiving special education and related services or any other services through a current iep and attach a copy of the minor current iep.rule c c.
although both parties suggest that the de novo standard of review applies to evaluate the court compliance with rule,we conclude that the correct standard is abuse of discretion.the juvenile court has broad discretion to select appropriate conditions of probation,subd.b see in re sheena cal th,sheena.a discretionary order that is based on the application of improper criteria or incorrect legal assumptions is not an exercise of informed discretion,and is subject to reversal even though there may be substantial evidence to support that order.in re ray th.under this standard,we find no error.
application 
at the dispositional hearing,the court indicated that it was inclined to follow the recommendations set forth in the probation department social study.objected to the reflections condition and requested that he instead be allowed to return to his high school.mother argued that would do better in a regular school environment,whereas reflections would set him back.she acknowledged his poor school attendance record but claimed that took longer than others to recover from illnesses.by contrast,the people argued that actions demonstrated his need for a more structured environment,which reflections would provide.
the court then imposed the reflections condition.the court found that grades and behavior were poor and observed that his psychological evaluation,which was attached to the social study,indicates that he could use the additional support that will be provided at reflections.the court found to be a young man who definitely needs the structure and support that reflections will provide.
those findings satisfy rule b d requirements.the juvenile court considered and rejected argument that his educational needs would be better met at his high school and credited the probation department contrary recommendation that reflections would provide him the support and structure that he needed.in making its findings,the court appropriately relied on the probation department social study and the psychological evaluation.the psychological evaluation stated that,based on test scores,he was performing in the average range and further stated that a learning disorder is not indicated the evaluation indicated that had normal cognition,good memory,and fair insight and judgment.the social study noted failing grades,truancy,poor behavior,and expulsion and recommended the reflections condition in the hope that the program structured environment would lead to an improvement in his academic performance and behavior the juvenile court reasonably followed that recommendation.
contends that the court erred when it imposed the reflections condition without a single detail about his iep,and suggests that the court was required to procure a copy of the iep.although the social study stated that had been a special education student during his elementary school years and that he had an iep of an unknown date,there is no indication that the court failed to consider this information in making its findings.rule b d requires merely that the court address the minor educational needs and does not specify the information on which the assessment must rest.consistent with rule c,the probation department requested a copy of current iep to attach to the social study and provided his educational history to the extent the information was available.the court was not obligated to procure iep in order to make findings under rule b 
also argues that the juvenile court failed to complete the form,as required under rule b b.the form does not appear to be part of the normal record on appeal rule a,but the law presumes that an official duty has been regularly performed evid.code.we therefore presume that the appropriate form was completed 
after the court made its ruling,requested a contested disposition hearing to challenge the reflections condition but made no proffer as to what new information he might present at such a hearing.counsel suggested that could meet with an education specialist and high school representative to determine whether he could benefit from educational services.however,in seeking release on home supervision three weeks prior,stated that he had to attend similar meetings,including an iep appointment at school,a counseling session,and a psychiatric appointment.these appointments,which were scheduled to take place before the dispositional hearing,did not result in new information presented to the court regarding his educational needs.in the absence of a proffer of new relevant information that would be presented at a contested hearing,the court could have reasonably concluded that there was no reason to schedule a hearing at that time.
moreover,remained free to revisit the reflections condition through an appropriate petition for modification.the juvenile court specifically stated that could present new information to the probation department to challenge the reflections condition and that if the probation department suggested a need to do so,the court would be willing to set a special hearing to reevaluate the condition.
in arguing that the juvenile court failed to make required findings,relies chiefly on in re angela th angela.in that case,the juvenile court committed the minor to the california youth authority cya after she admitted to having violated the terms of her probation.id.at.the minor evaluating p
