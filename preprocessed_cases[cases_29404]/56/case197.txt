a man who receives a child into his home and openly holds the child out as his natural child is presumed to be the natural father of the child,subd.d hereafter section d.the presumption that he is the natural father is a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of proof and may be rebutted in an appropriate action only by clear and convincing evidence,subd.a hereafter section a.the question presented by this case is whether a presumption arising under section d is,under section a,necessarily rebutted when the presumed father seeks parental rights but admits that he is not the biological father of the child.
the answer to this question is of the gravest concern to the boy involved in this case.while his presumed father is providing a loving home for him,his mother has not done so,and his biological father,whose identity has never been judicially determined,has shown no interest in doing so.therefore,if,as the court of appeal concluded,the juvenile court had no discretion under section a but to find that the presumption arising under section d was rebutted by the presumed father admission that he is not the biological father,this child will be rendered fatherless and homeless.
this harsh result,we conclude,is not required by section a.the court of appeal paraphrase of section a reveals the fundamental flaw in its analysis.w e are not free to ignore the statute,which expressly states that the section d presumption is rebutted by clear and convincing evidence that the presumed father is not the child natural father.italics added.however,that is not what section a says.rather,the section provides that a presumption under section is a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of proof and may be rebutted in an appropriate action only by clear and convincing evidence.a,italics added.
the juvenile court acted well within its discretion in concluding that this case,in which no one else was a candidate for the privilege and responsibility of fathering this little boy,was not an appropriate action in which to find that the section d presumption of fatherhood had been rebutted.
factual and procedural background 
the alameda county social services agency the agency filed a juvenile dependency petition alleging that nicholas was taken into custody pursuant to section,subdivision b of the welfare and institutions code because his parents had failed to adequately supervise and protect him.our recitation of the events constituting the factual basis for the petition is taken from the opinion of the court of appeal.
on january,thomas obtained temporary custody of nicholas after filing a petition to establish a parental relationship with nicholas in alameda county superior court.in his january petition,thomas alleged the following facts thomas lived with kimberly from may until december and from january until september.thomas and kimberly are the parents of nicholas who was born on august.kimberly can not keep a job,is often homeless,and has been in trouble with the law.since their separation,kimberly has prevented thomas from having contact with his son.most recently,the two fought over nicholas during a holiday visit in december at the home of thomas mother,carol,who lives in lakewood,california.kimberly attacked and bit thomas.the police were called and kimberly was arrested for felony assault.while kimberly was still in jail,thomas returned to his home in alameda county and brought nicholas with him.
in his petition,thomas asserted that family and friends of both thomas and kimberly supported his request for custody of nicholas and have acknowledged that kimberly can not adequately care or provide for nicholas.thomas also submitted letters of support from his friends and family.in one letter,thomas sister explained why thomas should be considered nicholas real father even though he is not the boy biological father.
on february,kimberly appeared at the fremont police department and reported that thomas took nicholas without her permission.kimberly told police she was in jail in los angeles when thomas took nicholas from the home of thomas mother to live with him in union city.kimberly gave police a copy of a los angeles county protective order dated september,restraining thomas from having contact with kimberly or nicholas until march.police further determined that thomas had an outstanding misdemeanor assault warrant.they also discovered that thomas had obtained the january temporary custody order.
kimberly gave police the following information thomas was not the biological father of nicholas.the two met when kimberly was pregnant and both had wanted thomas to be nicholas father.thomas was thus named as the father on nicholas birth certificate.kimberly and thomas never married but they lived together with nicholas.after a few years,the couple had problems,which led to domestic violence.thomas was arrested for battering kimberly and the restraining order was issued.the couple tried living together again despite the restraining order but they could not get along and often fought about how to raise nicholas.kimberly told police about the holiday visit at thomas mother home which resulted in her arrest for battery and thomas arrest for outstanding warrants.kimberly reported that,after thomas was released,he took nicholas to union city without kimberly knowledge or permission.
police went with kimberly to thomas work.thomas told the officer his version of the holiday visit and that he had obtained temporary custody of nicholas.he complained that kimberly was an unfit mother,that she took drugs and that she was homeless.thomas told the police that the outstanding warrant against him was for failing to complete an anger management class after he was arrested for battering kimberly in.police arrested thomas on the outstanding warrant.thomas refused to give permission to release nicholas to kimberly.the police therefore placed nicholas in the custody of the agency.
a long series of,jurisdictional,dispositional,and for the purpose of framing the narrow issue we are considering,the evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to the findings and orders of the juvenile court,may be summarized as follows.
when kimberly was pregnant with nicholas,she moved in with thomas.thomas is not nicholas biological father,as he admits,but both kimberly and thomas wanted thomas to act as a father to nicholas,so thomas participated in nicholas birth,was listed on nicholas birth certificate as his father,and provided a home for kimberly and nicholas for several years.
thomas has been the constant in nicholas life.as the court of appeal observed,in concluding the evidence more than satisfied the requirements of section d,thomas has lived with nicholas for long periods of time,he has provided nicholas with significant financial support over the years,and he has consistently referred to and treated nicholas as his son.in addition,there is undisputed evidence that nicholas has a strong emotional bond with thomas and that thomas is the only father nicholas has ever know n.
kimberly,on the other hand,has been a frail reed for nicholas to lean upon.the investigation report prepared by a family services counselor stated that information from friends and relatives of the family supported thomas allegations of kimberly drug use,transiency,lack of gainful employment and violence towards others.the juvenile court finding that nicholas had to be removed from her custody was based on the following grounds one,kimberly continues to lead an unstable lifestyle,without housing or means of support of her own number two,nicholas has continually stated he does not wish to reside with his mother because she is mean to him she hits and slaps him and she smokes weed.three,and most importantly to me as i have observed kimberly demeanor throughout this case,particularly during her testimony,i have grown increasingly concerned about her mental and emotional health 
jason,kimberly claims,is nicholas biological father.however,jason has not come forward to assert any parental rights he may have,and because the agency has been unable to obtain enough information from kimberly to locate jason,his paternity could not be established.
on this record,the juvenile court found that the presumption under d that thomas was nicholas natural father had not been rebutted.the court expressly rejected the contention that thomas admission that he is not nicholas biological father necessarily rebutted the presumption.if i were to agree with county counsel that thomas admission that he is not nicholas biological father rebuts the presumption,then what we would be doing is leaving nicholas fatherless.
the court of appeal summarized the juvenile court dispositional findings and orders with respect to disposition,the court found there was clear and convincing evidence that nicholas must be removed from kimberly physical custody.however,the court rejected the agency recommendation that nicholas be removed from thomas care.the court acknowledged that thomas had problems but concluded that thomas had been caring toward and responsible for nicholas.the court was also swayed by nicholas clear expression of his love for thomas and his preference to live with him.thus the court concluded that nicholas care and custody would be committed to the agency but that his placement should continue in thomas home.the court ruled that both kimberly and thomas were entitled to family reunification services and both were ordered to participate in psychological evaluations.the court also vacated its prior order that jason submit to a paternity test.finally,the court ruled that thomas could relocate to southern california with nicholas and return to the county for appointments and visits with kimberly.
discussions 
the court of appeal concluded that thomas qualified as nicholas presumed father under section d,but that,under section a,his admission that he is not nicholas biological father necessarily rebutted that presumption.
the court of appeal reached the latter conclusion through the following analysis t he section presumption that a man is the natural father of a child can be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence.to properly evaluate the juvenile court ruling that the section presumption was not rebutted in this case,we focus on the two statutory terms we have just quoted from the relevant statutes.the court of appeal satisfied itself through an examination of relevant family code provisions that the legislature has used the term natural to mean biological,and,through a review of family law decisions,that courts construing sections and have assumed that natural means biological.clear and convincing proof demands a high probability,the court of appeal observed.accordingly,when read in conjunction with section,the court of appeal concluded,section means that the presumption that a man is a child natural father is rebutted by evidence establishing a high probability that the man is not the child natural,biological father.evidence establishing a high probability that thomas is not nicholas biological father was adduced in this case,namely,the testimony of both kimberly and thomas under oath that thomas is not nicholas biological father.therefore,even though its decision would have the effect of rendering nicholas fatherless,the court of appeal felt it was not free to ignore the statute,which expressly states that the section d presumption is rebutted by clear and convincing evidence that the presumed father is not the child natural father.italics added.
in its misreading of section a that the section d presumption is rebutted by clear and convincing evidence that the presumed father is not the child natural father italics added the court of appeal appears to have conflated two of the three subdivisions of section.subdivision a provides that a presumption under section is a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of proof and may be rebutted in an appropriate action only by clear and convincing evidence.italics added.subdivision c,on the other hand,provides that t he presumption under section is rebutted by a judgment establishing paternity of the child by another man.italics added.no judgment establishing the paternity of another man has been entered here.kimberly asserts jason is nicholas biological father,but jason has not come forward to affirm that claim and,indeed,has not even been located.a man who may be the father of a child,but whose biological paternity has not been established,or,in the alternative,has not achieved presumed father status,is an alleged father.citation.in re zacharia cal th,d,fn.zacharia.
our a man does not lose his status as a presumed father by admitting he is not the biological also supported by subdivision b of section.subdivision b provides if two or more presumptions arise under section which conflict with each other,the presumption which on the facts is founded on the weightier considerations of policy and logic controls.as a matter of statutory construction,if the legislature had intended that a man who is not a biological father can not be a presumed father under section,it would not have provided for such weighing,for among two competing claims for presumed father status under section,there can be only one biological father.
moreover,for persons who are presumed fathers under section by virtue of a voluntary declaration of paternity pursuant to section,the legislature permits but does not require that blood test evidence may be considered to extinguish such a person presumed paternity,subd.b.it is unlikely the legislature explicitly so a contrary rule that blood test evidence or an admission must defeat the claim of a person who claims presumed father status under section d.
the court of appeal cited two of our cases in support of its statement that courts construing sections and have assumed that natural means biological.see,in re zacharia,supra,cal th at,fn,d,a biological or natural father is one whose biological paternity has been established adoption of kelsey cal th,fn,d,defining the statutory term natural father to mean a biological father who does not qualify as a presumed father 
the court of appeal read too much into the passages it selected from zacharia and adoption of kelsey s.we did not in those cases address the question we confront here,but we did observe in passing that it is possible for a man to achieve presumed father status,with its attendant rights and duties,without being the biological father zacharia,supra,cal th at,fn,d,and that even if paternity is denied and legally disproved,a man may be deemed,under some circumstances,to be a presumed father adoption of kelsey,supra,cal th at,fn,d.
moreover,several court of appeal cases have held that a presumption arising under section d is not,under section a,necessarily rebutted by clear and convincing evidence that the presumed father is not the biological father of the child.indeed,two courts of appeal have held that,in the words of one of them,biological paternity by a competing presumptive father does not necessarily defeat a nonbiological father presumption of paternity.in re kiana th,d kiana.
in steven matthew th,d steven,two men qualified as presumed fathers of michael.matthew qualified under subdivision a of civil code former section now,because he was married to michael mother,julie,when michael was born.matthew also qualified under evidence code former section now,on the basis of blood test evidence.steven,at,fn,d.steven qualified under civil code former section,subdivision a now,d because he had received michael into his home and held him out as his child.steven,at fn,d.the trial court found steven presumption of paternity controlling on the ground he had the more prolonged,intensive and continuing relationship with michael.id.at,d.
the court of appeal affirmed.former section,subdivision b of the civil code provided that when presumptions conflict,the presumption which on the facts is founded on the weightier consideration of policy and logic controls.the paternity presumptions are driven by state interest in preserving the integrity of the family and legitimate concern for the welfare of the child.the state has an interest in preserving and protecting the developed relationships which give young children social and emotional strength and stability.susan jack
