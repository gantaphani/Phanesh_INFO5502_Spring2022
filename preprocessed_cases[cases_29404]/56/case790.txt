discussion 
christopher contends the court violated his federal constitutional right to privacy and the privilege by ordering,as conditions of his probation,sweeping,unnecessary and overbroad disclosure of his medical and psychiatric health records.we reject these contentions.
background 
the probation officer in this matter recommended that the court adopt proposed conditions of probation and which together required that all records relating to christopher medical and psychological treatment be made available to the court and the probation officer upon request.defense counsel objected to,and moved to strike,these proposed conditions of probation,claiming they were overbroad,infringed on christopher right of privacy,and were not necessary.defense counsel represented that christopher parents,who were present at the hearing,were shell shocked by christopher behavior,they were at last aware of his substance abuse problem and the poor choices he had been making,and the family was ready to move forward in a positive way.
the court indicated it was going to adopt conditions of probation and and stated,i do know what might happen while he in custody or otherwise,but some of these would absolutely be essential for ongoing treatment.defense counsel asked the court to do as other courts have done and strike anything to do with mental health,adding,i think this obviously works against a minor seeking assistance if they sic need it.
urging the court to adopt these probation conditions without modification,the prosecutor advised the court that t hey are in sync with the federal law,and i know that there a lot of work that has gone into fashioning this language.and i know that the assistant presiding judge has researched this issue and has permitted these two items to be on as part of the terms and conditions of probation.italics added.the prosecutor did not identify the federal law to which he was referring 
defense counsel responded by stating,i do have a copy of the federal law.my understanding is that it not mandated that the court order this.it to provide access for funding,and i just raising the objection.defense counsel also claimed it was not in the best interest of minors to tell them that if you go to a mental health person for assistance with something,it going to be released to your probation officer in court.and i do think that it is helpful in the minor rehabilitation.objecting that t his is a blanket order that means that if you want to call kaiser and get christopher full file,you can do that,defense counsel also stated that christopher was willing to sign a release for things that relate to his court rehabilitation.
the court disagreed with the defense arguments and denied christopher motion to strike conditions of probation and.the court stated that in trying to rehabilitate as opposed to punish christopher,it needed to have access to this information.
applicable legal principles 
the juvenile court is statutorily authorized to place a ward on probation and impose and require any and all reasonable conditions that it may determine fitting and proper to the end that justice may be done and the reformation and rehabilitation of the ward enhanced,subd.b,italics added.section grants courts broad discretion in establishing conditions of probation in juvenile cases.in re ronny th,d.t he power of the juvenile court is even broader than that of a criminal court.in re binh th,d.the juvenile court exercise of discretion in establishing conditions of probation in juvenile cases will not be disturbed in the absence of manifest abuse.in re josh th,d.
a juvenile probation condition is generally valid unless it has no relationship to the crime of which the offender was convicted,relates to conduct which is not in itself criminal,and requires or forbids conduct which is not reasonably related to future criminality.people lent cal d,superseded by as described by people wheeler cal th,d,in re binh supra,th at,d.
as explained in in re antonio th,d,juvenile conditions may be broader than those pertaining to adult offenders.this is because juveniles are deemed to be more in need of guidance and supervision than adults,and because a minor constitutional rights are more circumscribed.the state,when it asserts jurisdiction over a minor,stands in the shoes of the parents.and a parent may curtail a child exercise of the constitutional rights because a parent own constitutionally protected liberty includes the right to bring up children citation,and to direct the upbringing and education of children.citation.citations.the antonio court further explained that even conditions infringing on constitutional rights may not be invalid if they are specifically tailored to fit the needs of the juvenile.ibid.in planning the conditions of a juvenile probationer supervision,the juvenile court must consider both the circumstances of the crime and the juvenile entire social history.in re binh supra,th at,d.
reasonableness of the probation conditions 
here,an examination of christopher criminal record and his social history demonstrates that the probation conditions at issue here are reasonable and tailored to fit his reformative and rehabilitative needs.respondent argues that christopher committed a series of offenses which demonstrated a lack of conscience and psychological problems.the record supports this argument.with respect to his current offense,christopher admitted the allegations in count of the amended delinquency petition that he had committed a robbery and that the offense constituted a hate crime.christopher and his four juvenile companions drove up to their hispanic victim,monjaraz,and christopher used a video camera to tape record the crime as two of his friends robbed monjaraz at gunpoint.
the probation report shows that when they were interviewed by the police,christopher and the other juveniles involved in the current offense described a series of similar incidents in which they assaulted robbed transients,illegal aliens and a retarded man.christopher videotaped most of the offenses.in one of those incidents,christopher and his companions drove up to a developmentally disabled man,and two of the juveniles hit the victim in the back with a pvc pipe.nicholas reported to the police that christopher had videotaped the crime and had encouraged nicholas to assault the victim.christopher told the police that nicholas and michael had robbed a retarded man before they robbed a mexican monjaraz later that same day.
christopher admitted to the probation officer that the robberies were videotaped,and he had seen the videos.christopher tried to minimize his culpability by telling the probation officer he only videotaped some of the robberies,by denying he participated in any of the assaults and robberies,and by stating he did not receive any of the money taken from the victims.
the probation report also shows that christopher admitted he had brought hallucinogenic psilocybin mushrooms to school with intent to sell and he had been a member of the vsm varrios san marcos street gang and had participated in gang banging activities such as stealing beer from delivery trucks and getting into fights with other rival gangs.claiming he decided to quit the vsm gang,christopher described himself as a ruthless person who lacked empathy for people during the time he was in the gang.he admitted that he had experimented with alcohol,marijuana,vicodin,and mushrooms he had previously been charged with possession of a controlled substance and he was still using alcohol.
christopher father informed the probation officer that he had enrolled christopher in counseling sessions due to his disobedience of house rules,especially the curfew set for him,but allowed christopher to stop attending the sessions because he did not like the advice the counselor gave to christopher and him.
the probation report also shows that in november,prior to his commission of the current offense,christopher was placed on informal probation after he was charged with possession of a controlled substance health,subd.a,and he signed an informal supervision contract requiring that he complete counseling and participate in a substance abuse program.the probation report shows that christopher did not complete any of the conditions,and he violated the contract by committing the new offense.
the foregoing record shows that the court decision to impose conditions of probation and is reasonably tailored to fit christopher reformative and rehabilitative needs,given his demonstrated lack of empathy toward others,his history of gang banging activity and participation in criminal conduct that involved violence against innocent victims,his unwillingness to take full personal responsibility for his antisocial behavior,his substance abuse problems,and his refusal to meaningfully participate in counseling and a substance abuse program as he had promised to do as a condition of a prior grant of probation.the probation conditions at issue here,and the access to christopher treatment records they provide,will assist the probation officer and the court to determine whether christopher is fully complying with the numerous conditions of his new grant of probation,and whether,in the interest of rehabilitation and reformation,treatment is succeeding in helping him to overcome his psychological,behavioral,and substance abuse problems.
constitutional right to privacy 
christopher contends that conditions of probation and should be stricken because they violate his federal constitutional right to privacy.we reject this contention.
the parties agree that the question of whether the probation conditions at issue here violate christopher constitutional right to privacy is governed by the decision in hill national collegiate athletic cal th,d.in hill,the california supreme court held that to prove a violation of this constitutional guarantee,the complaining party must show a legally protected privacy interest a reasonable expectation of privacy under the circumstances and conduct constituting a serious invasion of the privacy interest.id.at,d.the hill court also held,however,that even if these three elements are established,a violation of the right to privacy will not be found where the invasion of the privacy interest is justified because it substantially furthers one or more legitimate competing or countervailing privacy or interests.id.at,d.
here,it is undisputed that christopher has a privacy interest in his medical and psychological treatment records.however,the state has a legitimate countervailing interest in protecting the public against christopher violent and antisocial conduct,and determining both whether he is fully complying with the numerous conditions of his new grant of probation,and whether treatment is succeeding in helping him to gain empathy for others,renounce completely his gang affiliation,and overcome his substance abuse problem.we conclude the court did not violate christopher right to privacy by imposing conditions of probation and.
equally unavailing is christopher contention that conditions of probation and should be stricken b
