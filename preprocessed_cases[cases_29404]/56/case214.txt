finally,the court scheduled a section hearing for may.
section report 
ahead of the section hearing,travis substituted in new counsel,philip bianco.
the section report recommended termination of parental rights and selection of adoption as the permanent plan for all four children.
the report discussed leann attempts to get placement of the children.on july,a relative assessment referral was initiated for leann.the relative assessment was denied on december,because the criminal exemptions for leann and her son trevor were not completed.
on march,leann left a voicemail with the social worker again requesting placement of the children.on march,the social worker created a new relative assessment referral.a relative assessment social worker went to the home where leann was living on april,to provide a criminal exemption packet for leann and trevor.during the inspection,leann mother ruth identified herself as the homeowner.ruth asked,what is this for,this is only for visits right the social worker said,no.ruth said,i told leann that i can not handle the kids in my home.i am years old and i ca handle it and only want visits here with the kids.the social worker told leann that ruth is the homeowner and that her request would be honored.as a result,the home could not be approved for placement.
since the january hearing,neither cheyenne nor travis contacted cws to inquire about the of the children and while the court had permitted travis to send correspondence to the children at the january hearing,he had not sent any.
leann and ruth did visit jonathan,christopher and tristan for two hours on march.they brought toys,easter baskets,and mcdonald food to the visit.jonathan and christopher played with their toys while tristan slept for the majority of the visit.during the visit,jonathan kept asking about his foster mother and asked when it was time to leave.hannah chose not to visit because her family did not love her,and they made her do bad things.
section hearing 
the section hearing occurred on july.travis appeared at the hearing,still in custody.travis counsel identified himself as the attorney for both travis and leann.
travis counsel argued that travis was improperly eliminated and his parental rights terminated in january of this year on the basis that he had not complied with all that was required of him to reunify in that he was in custody from november of even to the present date.cws object ed to that line of argument because reunification services were already terminated and that the present hearing is not about reunification services.the issue here is permanency and whether the child should be adopted.travis counsel responded that he was requesting the court reopen and reconsider its finding in light of these facts.it was obvious that he could perform the reunification requirements being in custody.the court said,as far as the reunification issue,as cws pointed out,that was previously litigated.however,i will consider the comments made by counsel today.the court then concluded the decision made to terminate reunification was appropriate at the time and remained sic appropriate today.
travis counsel then requested that the court allow the paternal grandmother,leann,to be interviewed by the social worker so that she can be considered for an adoptive parent or,in the alternative,a guardian for the children in this matter.cws countered that ruth did not agree to have the children live in the home.cws later offered an objection on the ground that leann is not a party to this action.travis counsel continued his argument,later saying,all we asking for at the end of this proceeding is that the court order that the social worker redo her assessment and her investigation into leann ability to be the foster parent.
leann testimony 
travis counsel called leann as a witness.leann testified that she learned the children might possibly be placed for adoption around march.leann told social workers she had no criminal history,but cws were seeing it differently because she had been accused of an assault and battery,but the charge was deemed by the judge as disturbing the peace.leann admitted she never turned in her criminal exemption packet to cws.
leann home burned down in,so she was living with her mother when a social worker visited on march.according to leann,the social worker said the purpose of the visit was to consider leann for placement.the social worker inspected the home and made no complaints as to the suitability of the home.leann mother told the social worker that she just thought the visit was for visitation,not for permanency.however,the social worker told leann that her request for placement was going to be denied because of what her mother had said.the social worker did not tell leann she was out of the picture.
leann claimed she could have rented a place apart from her mother if she had known it would disqualify her.she also said she could provide the children a permanent home and stability.
leann testified she never missed a visit with the children.she also testified that before tristan was born,she had daily contact with jonathan and christopher.
leann testified that travis was currently in custody for striking her,causing her to be hospitalized for broken ribs and contusions.leann said the incident was a one time thing.she said she would not have a problem getting a restraining order against travis if necessary to protect the children.
additional argument 
cws argued that leann testimony was consistent with cws position she was not able to obtain a criminal exemption and,therefore,she could not be assessed for placement.counsel for the children argued that if they were placed with leann,there would be grave concerns about her ability to keep the children safe from travis.
the court terminated cheyenne and travis parental rights.travis appealed.
discussion 
travis failure to challenge the january,order via petition for extraordinary writ precludes review of the order in this appeal 
travis seeks to challenge the court termination of reunification services at the review hearing on january.before reaching the merits of that claim,we must address cws contention that travis failed to challenge the january,order by writ petition and therefore can not raise the issue on appeal from the subsequent order terminating parental rights.
prerequisites for appellate review of an order setting a section hearing 
an order setting a section hearing is not appealable unless a petition for extraordinary writ review is timely filed,subd.l a.failure to file a petition for extraordinary writ review within the period specified by rule,to substantively address the specific issues challenged,or to support that challenge by an adequate record shall preclude subsequent review by appeal of the findings and orders made pursuant to section,subd.l.
there is no dispute that travis did not file a timely writ review challenging the january,order setting the section hearing in this case.
notice of writ review requirements 
section directs the judicial council to adopt rules of court to ensure that after a dependency court sets a section hearing,it shall advise all parties of the requirement of filing a petition for extraordinary writ review in order to preserve any right to appeal,subd.l a.this notice shall be made orally to a party if the party is present at the time of the making of the order or by mail by the clerk of the court to the last known address of a party not present at the time of the making of the order,subd.l a,bold print added.
the judicial council implemented california rules of court,rule rule,which reads in relevant part 
when the court orders a hearing under welfare and institutions code section,the court must advise all parties and,if present,the child parent,guardian,or adult relative,that if the party wishes to preserve any right to review on appeal of the order setting the hearing under welfare and institutions code section,the party is required to seek an extraordinary writ by filing a notice of intent to file writ petition and request for record california rules of court,rule form or other notice of intent to file a writ petition and request for record and a petition for extraordinary writ california rules of court,rules,form or other petition for extraordinary writ.
the advisement must be given orally to those present when the court orders the hearing under welfare and institutions code section.
within one day after the court orders the hearing under welfare and institutions code section,the advisement must be sent by mail by the clerk of the court to the last known address of any party who is not present when the court orders the hearing under welfare and institutions code section.
the advisement must include the time for filing a notice of intent to file a writ petition.
copies of petition for extraordinary writ california rules of court,rules,form and notice of intent to file writ petition and request for record california rules of court,rule form must be available in the courtroom and must accompany all mailed notices informing the parties of their rights.rule b,italics and bold print added.
at the january,hearing travis was personally served with an information sheet and forms and,notifying him of the necessity to seek writ review.however,the court did not orally advise travis of the necessity to seek writ review as required by rule b 
combined effect of travis failure to challenge the january,order by writ and the court failure to orally advise travis of the necessity of seeking writ review pursuant to rule b 
there is no question that rule b was not followed here.we must determine whether that rule violation requires us to ignore section,subdivisions l through which would otherwise preclude appellate review without a prior writ petition.
first,we note that nothing in subdivisions l and l condition their applicability on compliance with the oral advisement requirement.
second,as discussed below,the law concerning the analogous issue of remedies for statutory violations does not support the result urged by travis.
a statutory requirement may impose on the government a duty to act in a particular way,and yet failure to do so may not void the governmental action taken in violation of the duty.citations.this distinction is generally expressed in terms of calling the duty mandatory or directory.t he directory or mandatory designation does not refer to whether a particular statutory requirement is permissive or obligatory,but instead simply denotes whether the failure to comply with a particular procedural step will or will not have the effect of invalidating the governmental action to which the procedural requirement relates.citation.in re richard cal d,richard.as richard indicates,the distinction between mandatory versus directory concerns the remedies for violating a statute while the distinction between obligatory and permissive concerns whether compliance with the statute is optional 
here,it is clear that the legislature and judicial council want dependency judges to always advise parents of the necessity for writ review orally,subd.l a rule b.the use of the word shall strongly indicates such a legislative intent.thus,rule b is clearly obligatory.
but we must go a step further and det
