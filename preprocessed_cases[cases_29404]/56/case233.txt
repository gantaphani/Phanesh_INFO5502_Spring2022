background 
on april,the public guardian filed an lps conservatorship petition for appointment of a conservator of appellant person and estate,pursuant to section,and also seeking imposition of several special disabilities,pursuant to section.on may,the public guardian filed an investigator report,pursuant to section,recommending the appointment of an lps conservator and imposition of the requested special disabilities.
after appellant informed the court of his intention to contest the petition,the court held a bench trial on june.james holden testified for the public guardian as an expert on the issue of grave disability.on june,holden had interviewed appellant for minutes and had reviewed numerous documents,including a recent functional assessment and psychological evaluation,the conservatorship investigator report,and recent hospital treatment and progress notes.holden testified that appellant had recently been hospitalized after bystanders who saw him near or on a bridge over the russian river became concerned and called police.the police took him to a hospital,where he was evaluated,found to be gravely disabled due to a mental disorder,and hospitalized pursuant to section.appellant was homeless at the time.
appellant had a history of m ultiple prior hospitalizations in both texas and california.he had been diagnosed during his most recent hospitalization with schizoaffective disorder,bipolar type.he had previously been diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder,as well as various substance abuse disorders,including amphetamine abuse,cannabis abuse,benzodiazepine,disorder,and nicotine.appellant told holden that he has taken psychiatric medications since childhood,starting with medication for attention deficit disorder.he also reported that he has had auditory hallucinations since childhood,but said,l uckily i know the voices are real.when i put the right kind of energy out,they go away.
holden further testified that appellant had not been compliant with his medications at the time of his most recent hospitalization,and had a history of being noncompliant.at the time holden interviewed him,appellant was on his medications and told holden that he would contact his former psychiatrist and continue taking his medications if released from conservatorship.appellant said he believed there were two medications that were particularly helpful to him zyprexa and invega.even on these medications,however,he continued to experience auditory hallucinations,which he had described as being just white kids.they are listening to us right now.they go away when i am around good energy and good memories.appellant also exhibited paranoid ideations during the interview,saying that the police and some of the medical staff had plotted against him and inaccurately described his condition.with schizoaffective disorder,the symptoms can be kept under control t o a degree.there can be residual symptoms even with the medication.
appellant told holden that he had a friend he wanted to stay with.the friend,mike elmer,called holden and told him that he knew appellant father well and had prior experience helping appellant.nevertheless,after evaluating appellant,holden concluded that he currently remains gravely disabled.i did find a verifiable plan,a realistic verifiable plan to provide for his own food,shelter,and clothing or the presence of a third person that could assure those things were provided for him.when the court asked how appellant mental condition interferes with his ability to provide for his food,shelter,and clothing,holden stated,it disrupts his thinking,his logic,reasoning.it led him to live out in the woods on various occasions.and to have aspirations to live a free lifestyle that i felt would be very difficult for him to pull off.i felt he would be very easily taken advantage of and has been in the past,i believe.holden further testified,however,that appellant had said he did not want to live on the streets anymore,and would eventually like to end up in a house of his own.
appellant testified,as part of the public guardian case in chief,that he first learned of his schizophrenia diagnosis when he was years old,and he began breaking down and hearing voices when he was.he did not really believe the voices were real,but nonetheless thought there is some sort of motivation somewhere to where these people are bothering me.i do really think i have a mental condition.i think i am being victimized by other people that are jealous of me.when asked if he did not believe he has a mental illness,appellant responded,no.i did say i do have mental conditions,but it does make me ill.i do really think i have a mental condition.i am actually a very intelligent person.appellant believed people victimized him because they had taken his kindness for weakness and they stole things from him.
appellant testified that the medications he was taking cogentin,trileptal,perphenazine,and invega helped,but also believed that it really does matter if i take them or not,because it is more of a psychological problem and drugs just null sic the pain,but they they ca they ca really heal schizophrenia.regarding holden testimony that appellant had said he believed the police and medical personnel had plotted against him,appellant testified that that was not true,and that the people who called the police made up a story saying i was going to jump they were saying i was waiving sic my hands,that i was going to jump or something.that is an absolute lie.instead,appellant testified,i was lured up there by four of these kids who have just been out to get me.as he was lying in the sun,these kids came along and they started throwing pebbles at me,started calling me names and stuff.so i went out there to see what their deal was,i got to the top of the bridge and the four of them were even facing me.they had their backs turned to me,like they were scheming something,whatever.so i walked across to the middle of the bridge,looking around,kind of enjoying the view and stuff.appellant believed the claim that he was waving his hands and looking like he was going to jump was a false report.
when asked about a statement he made to holden that voices spied on him through his eyes,appellant said,that was more of a religious belief than anything else,because it the truth.he affirmed that he would take his medication if he were not on a conservatorship because it did help his vision and helped him to relax,even though it could not stop the voices.regarding his specific plan to provide for himself,appellant testified that he had a steady income through social security,which would total per month if he had a place to live.he wanted to live with his buddy mike,whom he had known for over seven years and who had never taken advantage of him.mike had a trailer and would manage his money and help him with budgeting.mike would drive him to appointments with his psychiatrist.appellant also wanted to go back to church because,when he was in church,he never heard voices.
michael elmer testified on appellant behalf.he had known appellant for about eight years and appellant had lived with him off and on for about a year.when appellant lived with him,he was compliant with household rules and had not exhibited any violent conduct.if appellant lived with him,there would be no drugs or drinking,and they would start going to church.he would keep any alcohol in his home locked up in his room.he also would drive appellant to appointments with his psychiatrist.appellant would pay him per month in rent.elmer worked at johnson pear sheds and he planned to get appellant a job there too.
elmer would also help appellant with buying groceries and taking his medicine twice a day.he was not aware of appellant having a drug problem,but believed all kids have experimented.when asked what he would do if appellant did not take his medication,elmer testified,h e would have to.you know,he he needs to stay focused.when appellant had stayed with elmer in the past,he had been taking his medication a s far as i know.elmer testified that,when appellant was with him,appellant was a good kid and had never shown any indication that he might want to harm himself.
when asked on whether appellant had been suffering from mental illness for the entire time elmer had known him,elmer responded,i i have really seen much of that.when he with me,he seems straight down on it,you know.elmer would not allow any drugs in his home and would get appellant to quit smoking.he would watch appellant take his medication and,if he refused to take it,elmer would make sure he did so.elmer had never seen appellant act out,but if he had problems,elmer would take him to seek help.he also would have appellant sign a release so that he could consult with appellant doctors.
at the conclusion of the trial,the court found appellant gravely disabled.it therefore granted the petition and appointed the public guardian conservator of appellant person and estate.the court explained that appellant impresses me as a very intelligent person.he seems to have some awareness of mental issues and that he been aware of them for some time.he also states his willingness to take medications.he he appears to be candid about the existence of the voices that he hearing.he does he seems aware of it well,he aware of the voices certainly.but also seems to be able to distinguish when he hearing them sic and does seem to allow them to interfere with his life.does seem to be anything in the record that states that the voices are themselves interfering with his abilities.
however i am concerned based on the testimony of holden that even when appellant is on his medications that the underlying medical condition interferes with his ability to provide for his food,shelter,and clothing.i think it a very close case because appellant is aware of has such a strong awareness of his problems and of his medication and so on.and it seems that he he attempting,not withstanding that,to cope with life and to cope with stressors during his life.but i think based on the record on which holden has relied,that he he has quite reached that ability to overcome the problem with his mental illness to allow him to provide for his own food,shelter,and clothing.
i have listened to the testimony of elmer,who i think is very sincere in his ability sic to help his friend appellant.but i just do think that the assurance is there that he will be able to provide the assistance to appellant when he needs it if elmer is going to be at work during all or part of the day,then he not there to help appellant when and if he needs help.and elmer did really seem to have developed a plan of how he could help appellant when he not able to take his medication or whether sic his mental illness perhaps is breaking through or not being controlled by his mental illness sic medication.
so i do think at this time that appellant is able to take care of his provide for his own food,shelter,and clothing.i think it a situation where he can,hopefully perhaps soon,i do know with some additional medication.i do know what particular what would give him that ability.but i think right now i find he gravely disabled and unable to take care of his food,shelter,and clothing.
although not mentioned during the trial,in the written order appointing the conservator,the court also imposed special disabilities prohibiting appellant from possessing a driver license,entering into contracts in excess of,refusing to consent to treatment related to his grave disability,and possessing any firearm.the court found that the least restrictive appropriate level of placement for appellant was a locked facility.
on july,appellant filed a notice of appeal.
discussion 
i.the sufficiency of the evidence that appellant was gravely disabled 
the lps act affirms that p ersons with mental illness have the same legal rights and responsibilities guaranteed all other persons by the federal constitution and laws and the constitution and laws of the state of california,unless specifically limited by federal or state law or regulations.moreover,n o person may be presumed to be incompetent because he or she has been evaluated or treated for mental disorder,regardless of whether such evaluation or treatment was voluntarily or involuntarily received.see in re qawi cal th,one of the cardinal principles of lps,is that mental patients may not be presumed incompetent solely because of their hospitalization see also conservatorship of early cal d.
under the lps act,a conservator may be appointed for a person who is gravely disabled as a result of a mental disorder.gravely disabled is defined as,inter alia,a condition in which a person,as a result of a mental health disorder,is unable to provide for his or her basic personal needs for food,clothing,or shelter,subd.h a.under section,subdivision e,a person is not gravely disabled if that person can survive safely without involuntary detention with the help of responsible family,friends,or others who are both willing and able to help provide for the person basic needs for food,clothing,or shelter.the clear import of the lps act is to use the involuntary commitment power of the state sparingly and only for those truly necessary cases where a gravely disabled person is incapable of providing for his basic needs either alone or with help from others.citation.conservatorship of smith d,smith.
in the trial court,to establish that a person is gravely disabled,the evidence must support an objective finding that the person,due to mental disorder,is incapacitated or rendered unable to carry out the transactions necessary for survival or otherwise provide for his or her basic needs of food,clothing,or shelter,and the public guardian must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the proposed conservatee is gravely disabled.conservatorship of carol th,carol,citing smith,supra,d at.on appeal,we apply the substantial evidence test to determine whether the record supports the court finding of grave disability.the testimony of one witness may be sufficient to support such a finding.conservatorship of johnson d,johnson.
in the present case,appellant does not dispute that he suffers from a mental disorder.he contends,however,that the evidence was insufficient to support the trial court finding that he is gravely disabled as a result.the court found that this was a very close case because appellant had such a strong awareness of his problems and of his medication,including some understanding that the voices he heard were not real he did not seem to allow the voices to interfere with his life.the court nevertheless concluded that appellant had not quite reached that ability to overcome the problem with his mental illness to allow him to provide for his own food,shelter,and clothing.
we agree with the court that this is a close case.had the evidence presented solely addressed appellant ability to survive safely on his own,without any third party assistance,we may well have concluded the court ruling was supported by substantial evidence.however,regardless of whether appellant would be gravely disabled if he were on his own,we find that,in light of evidence regarding the offer of third party assistance by appellant friend,michael elmer,the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to demonstrate that appellant could not survive safely in the community.see,subd.e person is not gravely disabled if he or she can survive safely without involuntary detention with the help of responsible family,friends,or others who are both willing and able to help provide for the person basic needs for food,clothing,or shelter johnson,supra,d at.
