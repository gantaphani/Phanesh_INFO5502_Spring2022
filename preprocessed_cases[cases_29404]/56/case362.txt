a prosecutor charged year old,who is mildly mentally retarded with assault with a deadly weapon a court found he was not competent to stand trial,and pursuant to a challenged special instruction,the jury may have found him dangerous solely because he is an incompetent defendant charged with a violent felony.he contends the special instruction renders his civil commitment unconstitutional.welf.we agree.
following an day jury trial,the court committed to porterville developmental center porterville and set a recommitment hearing for september.since appeal will be decided beyond his commitment period,his appeal is technically moot.people bailie th,d,fn.bailie.he has either been released from porterville or he has been recommitted on new facts.as a result,the facts of the underlying case are,for the most part,irrelevant.
nevertheless,courts have decided such appeals where the issues are recurring and present important questions of law.citation.bailie,supra,th at,fn,d.this case presents an important question of law that may evade appellate review.that question alone therefore circumscribes the scope of our review.whereas at trial the focus was whether mental retardation was a substantial factor in causing him serious difficulty controlling his dangerous behavior,the sole focus on appeal is whether he was deprived of due process by the special instruction allowing the jury to find him dangerous based only on the fact he was declared incompetent and had been charged with,not tried for or convicted of,a violent felony.
there was an abundance of evidence that had multiple disorders unrelated to his mild mental retardation.indeed,the psychologist did not diagnose him with mild mental retardation until.but no one disputes he had a history of violent outbursts.one doctor opined suffered from posttraumatic stress syndrome resulting from the violence he observed and was subjected to by his parents,who separated and got back together multiple times.there were numerous reports to child protective services,many restraining orders,and police reports suggesting a turbulent and dysfunctional family.repeatedly expressed fear of his father.two psychologists and a physician testified that suffered from depression,intermittent explosive disorder,seizure disorder,attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,and oppositional defiant disorder.
but the facts underlying the original commitment,as well as an evaluation of harmlessness,are moot.we will not recite or evaluate the additional evidence that was a danger to himself or others because the challenged instruction allowed the jurors to ignore that evidence in determining was dangerous,and indeed,the prosecutor encouraged them to do so.nor will we consider evidence,as the attorney general urges,to support a finding that the instruction was harmless.as the court held in people sweeney th,d sweeney,we decline to determine whether the trial court error was harmless,because the order of commitment is moot.we have chosen to address the issues raised by sweeney because they involve matters of public interest that are likely to reoccur yet normally evade review however,there would be little value in a harmless error analysis.thus we proceed to the narrow,but important,question before us.
due process 
the prosecution had the burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that was mentally retarded,a danger to himself or others,and that his mental retardation was a substantial factor in causing him serious difficulty controlling his dangerous behavior.bailie,supra,th,d.the special instruction explained the criteria for assessing the second element whether was dangerous.ct 
special instruction is the target of constitutional challenge.special instruction states 
the respondent is a danger to himself or others when 
there has been a finding of incompetence to stand trial on the charged offense 
respondent is charged with a felony involving death,great bodily injury,or an act which poses a serious threat of bodily harm to another person 
respondent is a present danger to himself or others.
contends that instructing the jury it could find him dangerous based on the fact that he was deemed incompetent and charged with a violent felony violated the due process and equal protection clauses of the united states constitution.we conclude his due process challenge has merit and do not consider his equal protection argument.
as a proposition so close to the heart of a free people commitment to liberty,it hardly needs repeating that civil commitment for any purpose constitutes a significant deprivation of liberty that requires due process protection.addington texas,d.over time,the united states supreme court has our notion of due process to limit involuntary civil confinement to those who suffer from a volitional impairment rendering them dangerous beyond their control.in re howard cal th,d,howard,quoting kansas hendricks,d see kansas crane,d hendricks,supra,at heller doe,d.
california courts have been out in front of the legislature in assuring that persons facing civil commitment under a variety of statutory schemes are afforded due process.in five poignant examples,the courts implied or inferred a due process requirement to salvage a statute from an otherwise meritorious constitutional challenge.each case stands as a sobering reminder that the criminal law is fundamentally designed to deal with dangerous persons who breach the social contract,and it is only in extreme and limited cases that civil commitment can be justified to intercede and remove a person deemed dangerous.i f individuals could be civilly confined as dangerous without any difficulty in controlling their dangerous behavior,there would be no adequate distinction from the general run of dangerous persons who are subject exclusively to the criminal law.people williams cal th,d.in short,due process requires an inability to control dangerous conduct.hubbart superior court cal th,d.
in conservatorship of hofferber cal d,hofferber,the supreme court preserved the constitutionality of a civil commitment statute even though the relevant statutes did not expressly require a showing of continuing dangerousness,but appeared to permit indefinite maintenance of lps lanterman petris short act,et conservatorships solely because the incompetence continues and the violent felony charges have not been dismissed.hofferber,at.in hofferber,an individual could be found gravely disabled based only on a showing that he was charged with a violent felony and was incompetent to assist in his defense because of a mental disorder.id.at.the court construed the statute to require a finding that an incompetent defendant remained currently and violently dangerous.id.at.
in people alvas d.alvas,we too found that a statute failure to define dangerousness for all people within its scope was not fatal to its constitutionality.we explained both the lps act and section et have been enacted for the obvious purpose of protecting and treating those who due to various mental deficiencies pose a danger to themselves or others.citation.secton of the lps act equates danger to the potential for infliction of substantial physical harm.citation.given the similarity of purpose behind the lps act and section proceedings,there is simply no reason to ascribe different meanings to the same term.therefore we conclude that insofar as dangerousness is not defined in section,it should be construed to mean the potential for infliction of substantial harm upon the defendant himself or upon others.alvas,at.
section et provides for the civil detention of juveniles beyond a commitment to the department of corrections and rehabilitation,division of juvenile justice.the supreme court in howard,supra,cal th,d,considered whether such an extended detention scheme violates due process because it does not expressly require a finding that the person mental deficiency,disorder,or abnormality causes serious difficulty in controlling behavior.id.at,d.following an exhaustive analysis of the united states supreme court jurisprudence on due process principles regarding civil commitment,the california supreme court concluded an extended detention sche
