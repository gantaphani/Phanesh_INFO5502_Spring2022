by way of this interlocutory appeal,cam,who was seventeen years old when he was charged as a delinquent and arrested in,seeks relief from the district court transfer order of december,authorizing his prosecution as an adult in the district of maryland.see united states,the transfer order in his appeal,cam contends that the charging juvenile delinquency information contravenes the constitution and is otherwise legally insufficient,that the transfer proceedings violated his procedural rights under the applicable statutes and the constitution,and that the court abused its discretion in entering the transfer order.as explained below,we affirm in part and dismiss in part.
the transfer order was entered by the district court pursuant to the juvenile justice and delinquency prevention act the act,specifically that part of the act codified at.as we have previously recognized,the primary purpose of the act is to remove juveniles from the ordinary criminal process in order to avoid the stigma of a prior criminal conviction and to encourage treatment and rehabilitation.united states robinson,cir quoting united states brian,cir the act establishes several procedures for the handling and disposition of juveniles in the federal system,but does not create a substantive federal juvenile offense.see united states allen,cir.accordingly,a proceeding concerning the potential transfer of a juvenile to adult prosecution in federal court addresses only the juvenile status it is not a criminal proceeding and does not result in an adjudication of guilt or innocence.see united states juvenile male,cir recognizing applicability of preponderance burden of proof in transfer hearing because such a proceeding is civil in nature,t he procedures used at a hearing on the transfer of a juvenile do not need to conform to all the requirements of a criminal trial.united states doe,cir.significantly,the federal rules of evidence do not generally apply in a juvenile transfer proceeding.see united states slw,cir comparing transfer proceeding to preliminary examination in criminal case,in which evidentiary rules are inapplicable in re,cir same doe,at same see also.d.
the act establishes several procedural hurdles for the transfer of a juvenile under.first,the government may initiate a juvenile proceeding only by the filing of a delinquency information,and not by indictment.second,a united states attorney must certify one of three potential jurisdictional bases for proceeding in federal court that no state possesses,or is willing to exercise,jurisdiction over the juvenile that the state lacks adequate programs and services for the juvenile or that the juvenile has committed a felonious crime of violence or drug offense in which there is a substantial federal interest.see united states white,cir.
third,before a district court may exercise jurisdiction in a juvenile proceeding,it must satisfy itself that such jurisdiction has been properly invoked,by reviewing the stated reasons underlying the government decision to proceed in federal court.juvenile male,at see also united states,cir recognizing subject matter jurisdiction to review the government assertions in its certifications.in assessing a transfer motion,however,a court is not required to examine the veracity of the allegations lodged against the juvenile it is entitled to accept the prosecution allegations as true.see united states juvenile,cir observing that seven courts of circuit to have considered the issue have held that a district court may assume that the juvenile committed the alleged offense for purposes of transfer proceeding 
after confirming its jurisdiction,a district court possesses the discretion to transfer the juvenile to adult prosecution,but must first assess the statutory factors specified in the fifth unnumbered paragraph of,which are as follows 
the age and social background of the juvenile the nature of the alleged offense the extent and nature of the juvenile prior delinquency record the juvenile present intellectual development and psychological maturity the nature of past treatment efforts and the juvenile response to such efforts and the availability of programs designed to treat the juvenile behavioral problems.
in order to grant a transfer request,the court must conclude that a transfer order would be in the interest of justice by a preponderance of the evidence.robinson,at.as we have explained,t he district court may determine what weight to give the various factors,although,in the weighing of the various factors,the nature of the crime clearly predominates.id.internal quotation marks omitted.with this procedural background in mind,we turn to the specifics of this appeal.
cam was arrested in maryland on august,approximately three months before his eighteenth birthday,on the basis of a juvenile delinquency information filed one day earlier by the united states attorney the initial information.the initial information charged cam with delinquency on the basis of his involvement in a conspiracy to participate in a racketeering enterprise,which would have been a crime in violation of title,united states code,section d,if he had been an adult.pursuant to,the united states attorney also filed a certification to proceed in federal court,endeavoring to specify the jurisdictional predicate of the proceeding the certification.
cam provided authorities with two statements that potentially implicate him as being involved in criminal activity.cam made the first statement during an interview with federal agents on april,months before his arrest.the second statement was provided on the day of his arrest,after cam had signed a written waiver of his miranda rights.in the august statement,cam discussed his involvement with a gang known as.in addition to providing his statement,cam assisted authorities in locating a firearm that had been used in a homicide.cam asserts that the august statement was made during a delay between his arrest and his initial appearance,and that such delay contravened the forthwith mandate of the act.see whenever a juvenile is taken into custody for an alleged act of juvenile delinquency,he shall be taken before a magistrate forthwith.cam also maintains that the april and august statements were taken in violation of his miranda rights 
on june,after weighing the statutory factors of,the district court transferred cam to adult prosecution.see united states.june,the initial transfer invoking the doctrine,cam immediately appealed to this court,and we vacated and remanded.in so doing,we predicated on a concession of error by the the initial information and certification were defective in failing to comply with,by insufficiently alleging a crime of violence.see united states,app x,cir.in remanding,we authorized the united states attorney to cure the jurisdictional defect by amending either the information or the certification.id.
on november,in an effort to secure another transfer,the united states attorney filed the amended delinquency information underlying this appeal,specifying,inter alia,that the conspiracy involved violent acts of murder,attempted murder,kidnapping,and robbery the amended information in support thereof,the amended information incorporated the affidavit of the investigating agent,which had been filed on august,the affidavit the affidavit stated,inter alia,that 
cam was a member of in prince george county,maryland,and that the gang had engaged in a pattern of racketeering activities which affected interstate commerce 
cam was a passenger in a vehicle when the driver engaged in a shooting 
cam had participated in an attack on a rival gang member,where a victim sustained injuries caused by a machete and 
cam had participated in jump ins,where members of initiated new gang members by beating them for thirteen seconds.
two weeks later,on december,the district court issued the transfer order now contested on appeal.it therein observed that neither party had requested the presentation of further information on the transfer issue,and it adopted and incorporated the substantive analysis and rulings made in the initial transfer.in weighing the statutory factors of,the court,in the initial transfer,concluded that cam age and social background,plus the severity of the alleged offense,supported his transfer.the court found that cam lack of a criminal record weighed against a transfer,and concluded that three of the intellectual development and psychological maturity,his past response to treatment efforts,and the availability of rehabilitative neutral on the transfer issue.balancing the factors,the court concluded that cam transfer to adult prosecution was warranted.
cam again appealed,contending that the transfer order is defective in multiple respects.his appellate claims fall into three categories.first,he asserts that the amended information is constitutionally and otherwise legally insufficient second,he contends that the transfer proceedings violated the procedural protections afforded him by the applicable statutes and the constitution finally,he maintains that the district court abused its discretion in entering the transfer order cam asserts that we possess jurisdiction of his appeal under the doctrine.we first address the jurisdictional question,and identify those claims over which we possess or lack jurisdiction.
on the jurisdictional issue,it is elementary that a court of appeals may,as a general proposition,only consider appeals arising from final judgments of the district courts.see.an exception to this rule,however,is the doctrine,which authorizes a court of appeals to review an interlocutory decision when three requirements are satisfied.first,the issue sought to be appealed must conclusively determine the question second,the question must constitute an important issue independent of the merits of the underlying controversy and third,the issue must be effectively unreviewable after trial.see coopers lybrand livesay,d cohen beneficial indus.loan.on the jurisdictional issue,we must consider whether cam claims individually satisfy the doctrine a determination that we possess jurisdiction as to certain of his claims does not extend our jurisdiction to others that are outside the narrow ambit of that doctrine.see abney united states,d recognizing that additional claims are appealable if,and only if,they too fall within cohen exception united states blackwell,cir same.
in assessing the jurisdictional underpinning of the issues cam seeks to pursue,we reach a mixed result.with respect to cam procedural and substantive challenges to the transfer order,our jurisdiction is controlled by seminal doctrine principles and our decision in united states smith,cir,which was also a juvenile proceeding.smith was initially charged as a juvenile,but after he turned eighteen the government dismissed its juvenile charge and indicted him as an adult.see smith,at.after the district court denied smith motion to dismiss the indictment,he appealed to this court,maintaining that the doctrine authorized his appeal.id.at.in concluding that we possessed jurisdiction over his appeal,we explained that the court refusal to dismiss the indictment had conclusively establishe d that the defendant may be tried as an adult and not as a juvenile that the issue was separate and distinct from the issue of guilt and that declining to hear the appeal would render the issue effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.id.
the doctrine has been recognized as authorizing interlocutory challenges to juvenile transfer orders and procedural issues that relate directly to such orders.see united states angelo,cir the justifications for allowing the immediate appeal of transfer orders remain the same regardless of whether the appeal is based on an alleged procedural or substantive deficiency.it is not surprising,therefore,that every circuit that has addressed the question ha s concluded that an order transferring a juvenile to adult status is immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine.united states leon,cir.importantly,the act was specifically designed to afford those juveniles charged in federal court with unique procedural protections,such as anonymity.furthermore,it has been recognized that a juvenile may be irreparably injured if he is improperly transferred to adult status.see angelo,at.pursuant to these authorities,we possess jurisdiction under the doctrine to consider cam claims of procedural and substantive errors that directly relate to the transfer order 
independent of his contentions on the transfer order,cam also seeks to pursue three challenges to the amended information itself.the first two challenges assert that the amended information contravenes the constitution,and the third contends that the amended information is otherwise legally insufficient.more specifically,cam contends that the rico conspiracy offense alleged in the amended information exceeds the bounds of the commerce clause,because it is predicated solely on intrastate activity that the amended information unconstitutionally seeks to criminalize his personal associations,in violation of the first amendment and that the amended information is otherwise legally deficient because it fails to allege that the rico conspiracy offense substantially affected interstate commerce,and that,absent such an allegation,the statutorily required certification of a substantial federal interest is deficient.these appellate claims present more difficult jurisdictional issues,because they relate to the propriety of the amended information itself,rather than the transfer order.
cam seeks to pursue two constitutional challenges to the amended information,that is,that it contravenes the commerce clause and the first amendment.notably,a juvenile delinquency information functions as an indictment.and,like an indictment,the amended information must be recognized,if valid on its face,as enough to call for trial of the charges on the merits.see united states mills,cir internal quotation marks omitted.importantly,an order declining to dismiss an indictment is generally not subject to an interlocutory appeal.see midland asphalt united states,d only a defect so fundamental that it causes the indictment no longer to be an indictment,gives rise to the constitutional right not to be tried.in a significant exception,the supreme court has recognized that the denial of a motion to dismiss an indictment on double jeopardy grounds is immediately appealable under the doctrine,because such a claim embraces the right not to be tried at all.see abney,at.see also united states macdonald,d.the constitutional protections relied on by cam,however,fail to include any as double would be irreparably lost if appellate review awaits the entry of a final judgment.in these circumstances,we lack jurisdiction to review cam constitutional challenges to the amended information under the doctrine,and must dismiss them.
we reach a different conclusion,however,with regard to cam contention that the amended information is legally insufficient for failing to allege a substantial federal interest.this claim challenges the jurisdictional propriety of the certification.because a proper certification,that the rico conspiracy offense affected interstate commerce,is a jurisdictional predicate to a juvenile transfer proceeding,that issue satisfies the requirements of the doctrine and can thus be reviewed in this appeal.see united states white,cir united states,app,cir.
we turn now to the merits of the appellate contentions over which we possess jurisdiction that the amended information is legally insufficient for failing to allege a substantial federal interest,that the transfer proceedings violated the procedural protections afforded cam by the applicable statutes and the constitution,and that the district court abused its discretion in entering the transfer order.as a general proposition,we review for abuse of discretion a district court decision to transfer a juvenile to adult prosecution.see united states robinson,cir.an abuse of discretion occurs if the district court fails to make the required factual findings,or if those factual findings are clearly erroneous.id.quoting united states juvenile male,cir internal citations and quotation marks omitted.we review de novo the court legal rulings,statutory and to the entry of a transfer order.see united states,cir united states helem,cir.
first,cam contends that the amended information is legally insufficient in failing to allege a substantial federal interest,that the rico conspiracy offense affected interstate commerce.in assessing whether a substantial federal interest has been properly certified,a court must decide whether the crime is of a sufficiently serious type that federal resources should be called upon,without regard to the state willingness or ability to handle the matter.united states juvenile male,cir.indeed,o ur prior cases have placed importance on the severity of the penalty prescribed for the offense and the sense of urgency by congress in deciding to federalize the crime.united states,cir.in conducting such an assessment,however,we accord substantial deference to the united states attorney.see juvenile male,at.
in this situation,the united states attorney proceeded under the third prong of the jurisdictional predicate of,and certified that cam had committed a crime of violence.in the earlier certification,filed in august in connection with the initial transfer,the prosecutor certified that there was a substantial federal interest in pursuing the delinquency proceeding against cam due to the severe nature of the underlying acts in furtherance of the conspiracy and the dangerous nature of the alleged enterprise.the amended information plainly alleges that cam violated the rico conspiracy statute,and the statutory maximum penalty for that offense underscores its severity.see,at.moreover,the fact that congress intended rico to be a potent tool in halting the infiltration of organized crime into the american economy,united states baker,cir,demonstrates the sense of urgency and importance that congress has placed on combating criminal organizations,at.in this context,the prosecution reflected in the amended information,certification,and a substantial federal interest and thus satisfy the mandate of.cam challenge to the sufficiency of the government certification of a substantial federal interest thus lacks merit.
next,cam raises three procedural challenges to the transfer proceeding.we address these contentions in turn.
in the first of his procedural challenges,cam asserts that the act barred the united states attorney from amending the initial information and thereby satisfying after our remand to the district court.in that appeal,we agreed that the initial information was flawed but authorized the prosecution to amend it.this defect was promptly cured on remand by the filing of the amended information cam contends,however,that the act accords the united states attorney with only one opportunity to certify a juvenile for transfer to adult prosecution.if an initial information is legally insufficient,according to cam,the act bars any subsequent effort to cure the defect.
on its face,does not mandate any specific procedure for the required certification.indeed,as we explained in the earlier appeal,such a certification may be made in either the juvenile information or the formal certification.united states,app x,cir.furthermore,the terms of fail to support cam position simply requires the certification of a crime of violence and a substantial federal interest.cam contention thus borders on the frivolous,and we will refuse to allow jurisdiction to be defeated by a ministerial act related to the certification requirement of.united states white,cir internal quotation marks omitted 
next,cam contends that the transfer proceedings violated his statutory and constitutional rights.more specifically,he maintains that the transfer proceedings were defective in three ways that he was denied his sixth amendment right to confront witnesses when he was not permitted to question the agent who executed the affidavit that the district court erred in considering cam two statements of april and august made in contravention of the forthwith requirement of and his miranda purposes of the transfer proceeding and that a psychiatric evaluation conducted at the court direction and used in the transfer proceedings violated the fifth amendment.
first of all,cam challenge that he was not allowed to the agent is simply misplaced,in that a transfer proceeding is civil in nature.as such,its purpose is not to incriminate,but to select the proper forum for trial.see united states,cir the determination is not one of guilt or innocence,or even of delinquency or,but rather concerns the manner in which the state elects to proceed against an alleged malefactor.as we have observed,a court assessing a transfer issue is entitled to take the prosecution allegations as true.see united states juvenile,cir.in this situation,cam inability to challenge those allegations by the agent does not contravene the constitution because the trial itself functions as a corrective for any reliance on inaccurate allegations made at the transfer stage.in re sealed case.
next,cam maintains that the alleged delay between his arrest and arraignment contravened his right to be taken forthwith before a magistrate.he claims that,if the prosecution had adhered to the forthwith mandate,he would not have made his august statement or assisted the authorities.in addition,cam asserts that he did not receive the proper miranda warnings,or waive those rights,in connection with either his april statement or his august statement.accordingly,cam contends on appeal that the court erred in considering these statements during the transfer proceeding.
the act does not specify any remedy for a violation of its provisions.the forthwith provision of was designed to ensure that juveniles are accorded priority in arraignment proceedings.see united states,cir.although a short delay might be expected,an unreasonable one designed to obtain appear to contravene.the prosecution bears the burden of demonstrating that it complied with.see united states juvenile male,cir.
importantly,the district court,in making the transfer order,relied on cam statements only with respect to the second factor,the nature of the offense.the court also relied on the united states attorney allegations,which the court was entitled to accept as true,and the other supporting evidence presented to the court.even without cam statements,however,the prosecution allegations and other evidence warranted the court finding that the nature of the offense favored cam transfer.as a result,even if the court somehow erred in considering these statements,no prejudice could have resulted with respect to its entry of the transfer order 
similarly,the psychiatric evaluation of cam conducted at the district court direction and used in connection with the transfer proceeding,did not contravene the fifth amendment once again,any statement obtained from cam during the evaluation was not used to incriminate him.as we have observed,the transfer proceedings were civil in nature and cam fifth amendment rights did not attach in such a setting.see,at the failure to administer miranda warnings to prior to statements did not deprive him of his right against,because the use of the statements at the transfer hearing did not incriminate him.
cam next contends that the act does not authorize the transfer of a juvenile on the basis of a conspiracy offense.for this contention,he relies on decisions suggesting that the government may not prosecute an adult for a conspiracy offense on the sole basis of his juvenile conduct.see united states spoone,cir.the spoone decision fails to support cam contention,however,was first charged as a juvenile.the act was designed to permit the transfer of juveniles to adult prosecution.where the transfer mechanism has been properly invoked,a juvenile charged with a conspiracy offense may therefore be transferred to adult prosecution.see united states thomas,t he act authorizes certain juveniles to be transferred to adult status where they may be tried for conspiracy crimes in adult court.
finally,we turn to cam contention that the district court abused its discretion in entering the transfer order.in that regard,the court concluded,by adopting and incorporating the substantive analysis of the initial transfe
