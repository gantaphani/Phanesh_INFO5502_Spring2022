mother,appeals from the juvenile court dispositional order granting custody of minor to his biological father,father admits he never achieved presumed father status,but nonetheless contends the appeal is moot because the court subsequently removed from his custody upon the filing of a supplemental petition alleging neglect by father.mother also contends the court visitation order,providing that t he department is to create a detailed visitation order for mother,is prejudicially vague.the department of children and family services department filed a letter brief taking no position on mother challenge to the custody order,and not oppos ing a remand for a proper visitation order.we find this appeal is not rendered moot by the court later order removing from his placement with because was a mere biological father,and was not entitled to presumed father status,the order granting him custody was in error.we also agree that the visitation order failed to adequately specify the frequency and duration of mother visits,and reverse and remand for further proceedings.

mother timely appealed.
discussion 
mother appeals the juvenile court dispositional order granting custody of to father,contending that only presumed fathers are entitled to custody,and that father never achieved presumed father status.father admits he never achieved presumed father status,but contends that issue is moot because the court subsequently removed from his custody.mother also contends the court visitation order,providing that t he department is to create a detailed visitation order for mother,is too vague.we find that mother appeal is not moot,because allowing the order to stand may have consequences in later proceedings.we also agree that the visitation order fails to sufficiently establish the frequency and duration of mother visits.accordingly,we reverse.
custody order 
mother challenges the order granting father custody,contending the court did not find that father was presumed father,and that any implied finding is not supported by substantial evidence.father admits the court never found him to be a presumed father,and that he did not qualify for presumed father status,but nonetheless contends the court properly exercised its discretion to place with him as biological relative under section.
an appeal may become moot where subsequent events,including orders by the juvenile court,render it impossible for the reviewing court to grant effective relief.in re albert th,in re jessica th,in re katherine d,in re pablo th,in re dylan th.an issue is not moot if the purported error infects the outcome of subsequent proceedings.in re th.
mother urges that the appeal is not moot because the custody order has collateral consequences which will continue to adversely affect mother in the underlying dependency proceedings,and potentially in future proceedings as well.specifically,she contends the court order resulted in neglect or abuse of while he was in father care.also,mother contends that father paternity status is still at issue,and that he would automatically benefit from presumed father status if the order is allowed to stand.we agree that allowing the court order to stand may have collateral consequences,such as the implied finding that father qualifies for presumed father status,and that mother may be unfairly prejudiced in her efforts to reunify with due to the abuse and neglect suffered while in his father care.therefore,we will reach the merits of the appeal.
in dependency proceedings,fathers are divided into four categories natural or biological,presumed,alleged,and de facto.in re th.the distinction is important because only a presumed father is entitled to custody and reunification services.in re kobe th,in re paul th,in re th.specifically,section provides that w hen a court orders removal of a child pursuant to section,the court shall first determine whether there is a parent of the child,with whom the child was not residing at the time that the events or conditions arose that brought the child within the provisions of section,who desires to assume custody of the child.if that parent requests custody,the court shall place the child with the parent unless it finds that placement with that parent would be detrimental to the safety,protection,or physical or emotional of the child,subd.a.only a presumed father is entitled to custody under section.in re zacharia cal th.
the statutory methods for establishing a presumption of paternity are contained in the family code.the provision applicable here,family code section,subdivision d,provides that a man is presumed to be the natural father of a child if h e receives the child into his home and openly holds out the child as his natural child.moreover,there are some circumstances when a man who has not received the child into his home may be declared a presumed father,under principles of due process and equal protection,when he has been prevented by the mother from physically receiving the child into his home.see adoption of kelsey cal th.
a man who claims entitlement to presumed father status has the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence the facts supporting his entitlement.in re th.in carrying that burden,a biological father must establish that he promptly came forward and demonstrate d a full commitment to his parental responsibilities emotional,financial,and otherwise in re zacharia,supra,cal th at.in determining whether a biological father has demonstrated such a commitment,t he father conduct both before and after the child birth must be considered.once the father knows or reasonably should know of the pregnancy,he must promptly attempt to assume his parental responsibilities as fully as the mother will allow and his circumstances permit.in particular,the father must demonstrate a willingness himself to assume full custody of the child citation.a court should also consider the father public acknowledgement of paternity,payment of pregnancy and birth expenses commensurate with his ability to do so,and prompt legal action to seek custody of the child,at,fn,italics omitted.
here,the only paternity finding appearing in the record is that father is a biological father.father never endeavored to establish his status as a presumed father,and never asked the court to make such a finding.father does not dispute that the court did not find him to be a presumed father,and on appeal,he agrees that such a finding would not have been supported by the evidence.the facts discussed above plainly establish that father is not a presumed father.
father contends,however,that as biological relative,he was entitled to placement of under section.section,subdivision a provides,in any case in which a child is removed from the physical custody of his or her parents pursuant to section,preferential consideration shall be given to a request by a relative of the child for placement of the child with the relative.preferential consideration means that the relative seeking placement shall be the first placement to be considered and investigated,subd.c.for purposes of section,r elative means an adult who is related to the child by blood,adoption,or affinity within the fifth degree of kinship,including stepparents,stepsiblings,and all relatives whose status is preceded by the words great,or grand,or the spouse of any of these persons even if the marriage was terminated by death or dissolution.however,only the following relatives shall be given preferential consideration for the placement of the child an adult who is a grandparent,aunt,uncle,or sibling,subd.c.
although a biological father is technically an adult who is related to the child by blood,adoption,or affinity within the fifth degree of kinship,subd.c,section contemplates the placement of a child with a relative after removal from his parents,subd.a,italics added.moreover,parents are not listed as relatives entitled to preferential placement under section,and it is clear that any preference for placement with a relative is subordinate to placement with a nonoffending parent under section.section requires a child to be placed with a nonoffending parent unless such a placement would be detrimental,whereas section only requires preferential consideration of a relative for placement.see,subd.a if that parent requests custody,the court shall place the child with the parent unless it finds that placement with that parent would be detrimental to the safety,protection,or physical or emotional of the child.italics added,subds.a,c.furthermore,section specifically addresses placement with a parent,and therefore makes clear that section was not intended to address parents.had the legislature intended section to apply to parents,it would have said so.see in re zacharia,supra,cal th at.
even if section applies,it was a clear abuse of discretion to place with father rather than maternal grandmother.father and had no relationship,whereas had grown up in maternal grandmother home,along with his sibling,moreover,maternal grandmother had no criminal or child welfare history,whereas father had a long history of child abuse and criminal behavior.see alicia superior court th,subd.a.
therefore,we conclude the trial court erred in placing with father,and reverse the court dispositional order.
visitation order 
mother contends the trial court june,visitation order failed to ensure that she would receive reasonable visitation,when the court ordered that the department is to create detailed written visitation schedule for mother.the department agrees the court visitation order fails to establish a minimal framework for visitation,and therefore does not oppose remand for a proper visitation order to be fashioned by the juvenile court.father takes no position as to mother challenge to the visitation order.
the court has the sole power to determine whether visitation will occur.in re th,in re th,in re julie th.once visitation is ordered,the court may delegate responsibility for managing details such as the time,place and manner of visits,none of which affect a parent defined right to see his or her child.in re chantal cal th,in re moriah th,in re th.however,the visitation order must give some indication of how often visitation should occur.see in re christopher th,in re moriah,at.a court may not abdicate its discretion to determine whether visitation will occur to a third party.in re,at see also in re rebecca th,the time,place,and manner of visitation may be left to the legal guardian,but leaving the frequency and duration of visits within the legal guardian discretion allows the guardian to decide whether visitation actually will occur.
here,the court visitation order failed to give any indication about the frequency of the visits,effectively giving the department discretion to decide whether visitation would actually occur.accordingly,we remand
