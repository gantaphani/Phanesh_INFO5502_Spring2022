the paternal grandparents were not interested in providing a permanent home for,and me.they were close to retirement age,and the stepgrandmother had had some health issues.they were,however,committed to keeping the three oldest children in their home until an adoptive home could be located.
the department recommended a concurrent plan of adoption for the children as a sibling set.the department recognized that it would be difficult to place the large sibling set and requested the court to authorize listing the children through a national adoption network.a nonrelated extended family member,had contacted the social worker about the possibility of adopting all four children.had been a foster parent for many years and had met,and me.at family gatherings.however,her foster home had been decertified in june,after a child climbed out a window while supposedly taking a nap and had walked a quarter of a mile to a fast food stand.the incident had occurred while had been at work and her then husband had been in charge of the children.the social worker had concerns whether could pass the background check and whether she could care for four active children.

was extremely hyperactive,and never sat still.he had showed some delay in language development and fine motor skills.he also had lengthy tantrums.because of his high energy level,he had to be closely monitored.
the social worker repeated the recommendation that the children be placed for adoption in two separate groups rather than all together because of the children difficult behaviors.
the contested section hearing began in october.the adoption social worker,lavonna downing,testified that the children were adoptable.in forming that opinion,she took into account the children ages,health,willingness to be adopted,and desire to stay with their caretaker.she also considered their behavioral issues,such as neediness,ability to handle the children,and the children responsiveness to.in downing opinion,the children would still be adoptable by someone even if was not available because the department had had inquiries from two different people who knew the children and wanted to adopt them.downing testified that she did not believe should take all four children because,although had very excellent skills with children,she had had great difficulty managing all four of these children at the same time because these children are extremely needy.downing described the children as very loving and sweet but extraordinarily active and needy of attention.she also testified the children shared a sibling bond and that her adoption assessment,prepared months earlier,did not discuss changes in the children behaviors since they had left care.downing did not know that me.and ma.both had been having tantrums or that they masturbated and flirted with men.she did not know that mi.had few friends and was being teased by other children.she also did not know that did not sit still for even a minute and that he was behind in language and fine motor skills.
during a break in her testimony,downing reviewed the department most recent report.she testified that nothing in that report would cause her to change her opinion that the children were adoptable.
the children ongoing social worker,nancy clark,also testified the children were adoptable because three parties had expressed interest.even though the children had difficult behaviors,they were loving.however,clark did not feel an adoption would be successful if all four children were placed together,because no single caretaker could provide care for all the children with their behaviors.clark testified that the children visits with one another were chaotic,but the children loved one another and had a bond.she believed frequent sibling visitation was important because of that bond.she further testified that adoption was in the children best interests,and their need for permanency a bsolutely outweighed the sibling relationship.she testified that,ma.and me.had had four placements,and part of the reason their placement with the paternal grandparents had failed was the children behaviors.had also had four placements,but none of those placements had failed because of his behavior.
lawyer objected that the adoption assessment report and the october addendum were inadequate because they did not properly describe the efforts undertaken to identify prospective adoptive parents and did not sufficiently analyze the likelihood the children would be adopted.the addendum had been prepared by clark,not the adoption social worker,who had not had contact with the children since they were detained on the section petition in july,although their circumstances had greatly changed since then.
the lawyers for,mother,and the children all argued that the sibling bond exception to adoption should apply.counsel for the children noted that at disposition,the juvenile court had found the children were a bonded sibling set.they had been raised in the same home before detention,and after detention they were in placements together or nearby so they had regular contact.she stated her belief that the sibling bond outweighed the benefits of adoption.she also believed the children were adoptable and that the department had failed to make sufficient efforts to find a home for all the children together.
the juvenile court found that the adoptability assessment was incomplete because,among other things,it had not taken into account the greatly changed circumstances since its preparation.the court continued the hearing for days so the department could make further efforts to locate an appropriate adoptive family where all the children could remain together.the court also directed the department to conduct psychological evaluations for the three oldest children.
the department filed an addendum report in december.the social worker requested that the children be listed on web sites to find an adoptive home.the children remained in two separate foster homes.
the social worker reported that had indicated she no longer wished to adopt the two boys because of the excessive amount of time that had elapsed since the children removal and the frustration she felt about the court appearances and leaving beds vacant.later,after first stating she would still consider adopting the boys,stated she had again changed her mind and could not go through with the adoption,but she would support if the children were placed there.still desired to have all four children placed with her.the department again recommended that the children be separated for adoption.
psychological evaluations of the three oldest children were filed with the court.
then five and a half years old,was described as lively and bright.ma.was the dominant twin.as a result of the trauma during her life,she had many reactive attachment disorder symptoms,including chronic anxiety,rage,and intense grief.she had not formed an attachment with a parental figure but had an exclusive attachment to her twin sister.the psychologist recommended that the twins be assisted to gradually tolerate differences in their appearance,school,and social activities so they could develop as individuals.her teacher had recommended that she repeat preschool.the evaluator could not determine whether ma.suffered from adhd or mild brain damage associated with prenatal drug exposure,and the evaluator recommended further observation.me.seemed more immature than ma.she also showed symptoms of reactive attachment disorder,and she had an exclusive relationship with her twin.her teacher had recommended that she repeat preschool.the evaluator stated the twins required the complete attention of a trained and experienced caregiver,and the evaluator also recommended therapy to address issues,including whether me.sexualized behavior resulted from early exposure to adult sexual activity or sexual abuse.
the psychologist described mi.as a very bright,articulate,and perceptive year old,who has been deeply affected by the chronic instability in his young life.he tested in the gifted range on standardized tests.he exhibited symptoms of adhd,and the evaluator noted that the same symptoms could be due to mild brain damage from prenatal drug exposure.the evaluator recommended additional therapy and placement with an understanding and experienced caregiver who could give him full attention.
the department filed addendums to the adoption assessments in march.the boys had been living with since january,and she was then eager to pursue adoption.had been taking steps to address mi.behavioral problems of constantly seeking attention,interrupting adults,and messing with those steps included putting the boys in separate bedrooms and giving mi.the social worker had requested therapy for,but the approval had not yet come through,and the social worker had recommended having him tested for adhd.the social worker stated that mi.appeared very happy and open,and although he said he missed his sisters,he did not appear to be unhappy about living apart from them.mi.was emotionally attached to

as noted,and are sisters.they visit each other often and are both committed to keeping the children in touch.
when the section hearing recommenced,the juvenile court stated it had read the transcript of the prior hearing as well as the reports submitted into evidence.the court held that there was clear and convincing evidence that it was likely the children would be adopted,and the court terminated parental rights.
iii.discussion 
mother contends the juvenile court finding that the children were adoptable was not supported by substantial evidence,because there was no evidence of any other approved homes that were willing to take the children or children with their characteristics,the children had severe behavioral problems,and the children were part of a large sibling set.
