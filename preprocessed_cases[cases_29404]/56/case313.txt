appellant jasmin mother filed this appeal after the juvenile court december,order terminated her parental rights over her infant daughter under welfare and institutions code section mother seeks to revive issues arising out of the court decision to terminate her reunification services at the september,review hearing based on its understanding that mother would be incarcerated for a period that exceeded the maximum reunification time permitted by statute.she contends reasonable reunification services were not provided prior to september,that the caseworker misled the court about when she was likely to be released from prison,and that the court failed to make findings.
mother does not dispute that orders terminating reunification services are ordinarily reviewable solely by way of writ,or that the court provided notice at the september hearing of the writ review requirement.she contends she is entitled to raise issues related to the reunification period in this proceeding because the notice the court provided did not inform her of the deadline to file a notice of intent to seek a writ.in the published portion of the opinion,we conclude that mother received sufficient notice of the writ requirement to preclude her from raising issues pertaining to the september order at this late date.in the unpublished portion,we discuss the issues raised with respect to the september order and conclude none would require reversal in any event.accordingly,we affirm.
