facts and procedural history 
uriel carreno was living in the converted garage of his aunt and uncle home on joan drive in petaluma.on february,he ate lunch with his aunt and then returned to his garage apartment.a friend of carreno came by later that afternoon and found him lying on the floor,not moving.carreno had been shot four times in his side and once in his back and had died of his wounds.a piece of the wood doorjamb was found across the room and a muddy shoeprint was on the door adjacent to the doorknob.
the police found five shell casings of two different colors within three to five feet of carreno body.forensic testing and the position of the casings revealed that they had all been fired from the same weapon while the shooter was inside the room.the coroner recovered five spent bullets from carreno body,all of which had been fired from the same weapon.two of the bullets had silver jackets silvertips and the other three were of the black talon variety.there was no evidence that another firearm had been discharged inside the room during the incident leading to carreno death.
jeffrey gray,a convicted felon,had seen appellant with a beretta during the first part of.appellant had loaded it with different colored bullets and had told gray that some of them were solid points and some were hollow points.appellant had referred to the hollow point bullets as black talons.
on the afternoon that carreno was shot,appellant had called christopher ortele and asked for a ride to petaluma near the kmart so he could pay his cell phone bill.ortele was in the process of installing a car stereo for his friend amber powell,who agreed to drive.powell and ortele picked up appellant,who was with keith kellum,and they all drove from rohnert park to the petaluma kmart,but when powell was about to turn into the parking lot,either appellant or kellum told her to go the other way and directed her to a residential neighborhood near the corner of novak and joan drive the street on which carreno lived.
after powell parked the car,appellant and kellum got out and walked in the direction of joan drive,telling powell to wait for them.when they returned five to minutes later,their demeanor had changed.they got into to car and were very quiet during the ride back.it appeared to powell that appellant was tearing up and kellum was consoling him.
jeffrey gray received a call from appellant that same afternoon and arranged to meet him at a trailer park where gray was visiting a friend.appellant,kellum and appellant brother colby blackwell arrived in colby truck,and gray got into the truck with them.appellant handed gray some solvent and a rag and told him he wanted him to go inside a house or garage and wipe down any fingerprints that might be on the door.they pulled up to a house on joan drive,but saw fire trucks,police cars and an ambulance outside.appellant appeared upset and explained that he had shot a guy they were trying to rob.
the group drove back to appellant house,where appellant told gray what had happened in greater detail.appellant said that he and kellum had gone to petaluma to rob a guy of some money and dope crystal methamphetamine and that kellum had kicked in the door of the garage.appellant claimed that when he went into the garage the guy inside took a shot at him,so he shot back several times.
also on the day of the shooting,appellant called his girlfriend,jacqueline pollard,and asked her to come to his house.he sounded very anxious on the phone.when pollard arrived she found appellant and kellum stripped to their boxer shorts.appellant took her into the bathroom and told her in a frantic manner that he had got a ride to petaluma with some girl he did know and had shot someone dead.appellant told pollard that he and kellum had gone to a house,touched a doorknob,and kicked another door down,and he was afraid there would be fingerprints and a footprint on two separate doors.he claimed that when they entered the room the person inside had fired a shot between his head and kellum,so appellant fired a few shots into his chest.appellant admitted to pollard that he had used his own gun,a semiautomatic that pollard had seen before.he told pollard that he and kellum were going to burn their clothes,and mentioned a pair of shoes and a jacket that would be placed in a backpack along with the gun and some extra bullets.pollard saw a backpack containing loose bullets and shoes in appellant bedroom,and appellant said he was going to bury it.
sometime later,appellant told pollard that he was concerned that too many people knew the gun was in the bag and where it was buried.he drove her into the santa rosa hills and asked her whether she thought he should move it.she told him it might not be a good idea because they had been stopped by the police a number of times in the car they were driving.
on a visit to bryan fishtrom house in march or april,appellant was carrying a dirty bandana that contained a handgun,bullets,and a lot of mud.the bullets were of different colors and some had hollow tips.
in march,jeffrey gray was picked up on a parole violation and told the police what he knew about appellant involvement in uriel carreno murder.in april,after he was released,gray saw appellant and his brother gary blackwell at bryan fishtrom house.appellant and his brother asked gray how he had gotten out of jail,and appellant suggested that they go for a ride together.gray declined.
in may,appellant brother colby blackwell directed police officers to a drum in a rural area.colby moved the drum,revealing a hole in the ground that contained wet clothing,shoes,pieces of a rifle cleaning kit,five rounds of ammunition,and rifle grease.a bore the imprint of a gun and had rust stains consistent with a beretta handgun.
appellant was interviewed by the police and initially denied knowing anything about carreno murder.later,he said that he and kellum had gone to a house to burn a guy for drugs,and that kellum had kicked open the door and shot the person inside several times he told the officers that he knew before they went that kellum had a handgun,that his brother colby had buried some of the evidence,and that he appellant had sold the gun that kellum used in santa rosa.
based on the foregoing evidence,appellant was tried before a jury and convicted of first degree murder with special circumstances murder in the commission of an attempted robbery and a burglary or attempted burglary,burglary of an inhabited dwelling house,and attempted robbery of an inhabited dwelling house.the jury rejected allegations that appellant had personally used intentionally discharged a firearm in the commission of these offenses,causing death or great bodily injury,subd.a,subd.a a g,subd.a,subd.a,subds.b d.keith kellum had originally been charged as a codefendant,but he pled guilty to second degree murder before the jury was sworn.
after the jury returned its verdict,appellant trial counsel filed a sentencing memorandum arguing that under apprendi,supra,the court could not impose an adult sentence without a jury finding regarding appellant age at the time of the offenses.the court rejected this argument and imposed an lwop term on the murder count.it acknowledged that it had the discretion to impose a lesser term of years to life because appellant was under when he committed the murder see,but it declined to exercise that discretion in light of appellant long juvenile court history and the heinous nature of the current offenses.
ii.discussion 
jury finding of appellant age under apprendi 
appellant argues that his lwop sentence is unauthorized because the jury did not make a finding regarding his age at the time of the offenses.we disagree.
the probation report indicates that appellant was born on august,making him years old when the offenses were committed in february of.although minors who commit crimes are generally subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile court,the law provides for a number of exceptions.see,subd.b,subds.a d people cardona th,cardona.
under section,subdivision b,a minor who is years of age or older must be prosecuted as an adult if he or she is alleged to have personally killed the victim during a special circumstance murder or to have committed enumerated forcible sex offenses.section,subdivision d allows the prosecution to directly file specified charges against certain minors in adult court,without a judicial determination that the minor is unfit for treatment under the juvenile law.section,subdivisions b and c provide that a minor years of age or older may be prosecuted as an adult for enumerated offenses if found unfit for treatment under the juvenile law,there being a presumption of unfitness.and section,subdivision a provides that minors accused of other crimes will be treated as juveniles unless they are years of age or older and are demonstrated to be unfit for treatment under the juvenile law.manduley superior court cal th,manduley.
here,the prosecution directly filed charges against appellant in adult court.it relied on section,subdivision d a,which provides,t he district attorney or other appropriate prosecuting officer may file an accusatory pleading against a minor years of age or older in a court of criminal jurisdiction in any case in which any one or more of the following circumstances apply the minor is alleged to have committed an offense that if committed by an adult would be punishable by death or imprisonment in the state prison for life.the criminal complaint and the information both alleged that appellant was a minor who was at least years of age at the time of the commission of the above offenses.
appellant does not dispute the prosecution authority to directly file a murder charge in adult court when the minor is years of age or older and charged with murder.see manduley,supra,cal th at,rejecting various constitutional challenges to provision of,subd.d.nor does he argue that his case should have been handled in juvenile court.rather,he claims that the imposition of an adult sentence violated his sixth amendment right to a jury trial because the jury in his case was never asked to determine whether he was at least years of age when he committed the offenses.appellant relies on the rule set forth in apprendi,in which the united states supreme court held other than the fact of a prior conviction,any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.apprendi,supra,at.
appellant argument appears to go as follows had he been treated as a juvenile and found to have committed the charged offenses,he would have been made a ward of the juvenile court and committed to the division of juvenile facilities for a period lasting up until his birthday.see,subd.b cardona,supra,th at.a juvenile commitment until the age of was,therefore,the statutory maximum commitment under apprendi unless the prosecution proved under section,subdivision d a that he committed an offense which would be punishable by life imprisonment if committed by an adult,and he was years of age or older circumstances that would in turn allow the prosecution to directly file the case in adult court and,consequently,secure adult court punishment.appellant argues that because the jury was never asked to determine his age,it never made a finding on the second element allowing for greater punishment as an adult.we disagree.
apprendi and its progeny,ring arizona,blakely washington,united states booker,cunningham california,are rooted in the historic jury function determining whether the prosecution has proved each element of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt.oregon ice,decision to impose consecutive sentences not subject to apprendi.the supreme court has not extended the apprendi line of decisions beyond the context that supplied the historic grounding for the decisions.at.it is important to recognize that,under the apprendi line of high court decisions,the constitutional requirement of a jury trial and proof beyond a reasonable doubt applies only to a fact that is legally essential to the punishment citation,that is,to any fact that exposes a defendant to a greater potential sentence than is authorized by the jury verdict alone citation.people black cal th.
appellant was charged with and convicted of special circumstance murder,residential burglary,and attempted residential robbery.age was not an element of any of these offenses,rather,the resolution of appellant age merely determine d which branch of the superior court would decide his guilt or innocence.people nguyen d,nguyen see also people marquez cal th,age is not an element of murder under,and is not material to guilt.in light of the murder charge,the district attorney was authorized to directly file this case in adult court without a finding that appellant was unfit to be treated as a juvenile,so long as he was years of age or older at the time of the offenses,subd.d.if appellant had believed the case was not properly before the adult court due to his actual age,it was his duty to object to that forum and to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he did not meet the age criterion for direct filing.see in re harris cal th,harris people level th,nguyen,at.
appellant did not object to being prosecuted in adult court and is now precluded from arguing that the case should have been handled by the juvenile court.harris,supra,cal th at.because his case was heard in adult court,the maximum penalty for apprendi purposes was determined when the jury returned its guilty verdict on the charge of first degree murder with special circumstances.no additional fact finding by the judge was required to impose an adult sentence.
our conclusion that apprendi did not require a jury finding on appellant age is consistent with the holding in cardona,supra,th,in which the court considered a similar issue regarding the right to a jury determination of the facts rendering a juvenile eligible for prosecution as an adult.in cardona,the defendant was charged with committing a number of felony sexual offenses while he was between the ages of and that rendered him at least presumptively unfit to be dealt with under juvenile court law.id.at.the trial court concluded the defendant was unfit for treatment as a juvenile after considering the statutory criteria for fitness under section,subdivision c,which include the degree of criminal sophistication exhibited by the minor.whether the minor can be rehabilitated prior to the expiration of the juvenile court jurisdiction.the minor previous delinquent history.success of previous attempts by the juvenile court to rehabilitate the minor.the circumstances and gravity of the offenses alleged in the petition to have been committed by the minor.relying on apprendi,the defendant argued on appeal that the jury,rather than the trial court,should have determined the issue of fitness,and that his prison sentence of years to life was unauthorized absent such a finding.cardona,at.
the appellate court in cardona rejected the claim.it explained the factual findings involved in a fitness determination are not the functional equivalent of an element of a crime.the sole purpose of the fitness hearing is to determine whether the best interest of the minor and of society will be served by retention in the juvenile court or whether the minor should be tried as an adult.citation citation.a transfer hearing does not directly result in an adjudication of guilt or delinquency citation,and the question of the minor amenability to treatment within the juvenile court system is concerned with the child prospects for rehabilitation,not the degree of his or her criminal culpability citation.a finding that a minor is not amenable to treatment in the juvenile system does not increase the maximum penalty one can receive if punished according to the facts as reflected in the jury verdict alone.citation.moreover,even assuming juveniles have indeed historically been afforded the right to trial by jury on allegations they committed a crime citation,we are aware of no historical practice extending that right to a fitness determination.the constitutional concerns expressed in apprendi and its progeny were satisfied in the present case by the jury finding,beyond a reasonable doubt,of those facts legally essential to the punishment imposed,that appellant committed the offenses.appellant sentence was fully authorized by the jury verdict the statutory provision for judicial factfinding with respect to amenability to treatment in the juvenile court system is not a legislative attempt to remove from the province of the jury the determination of facts that warrant punishment for a specific statutory offense a s apprendi core concern is inapplicable to the issue at hand,so too is the sixth amendment restriction on facts.cardona,supra,th at.
similarly,the facts that subjected appellant to a direct filing in criminal court under section,subdivision d his age and the nature of the charges against him do not implicate apprendi core concern,namely the historic right to a trial by jury on all elements of an offense,which would be jeopardized if a legislature could label facts affecting the length of the authorized sentence for an offense as something other than elements,thereby eliminating the right to a jury trial thereon.cardona,supra,th at.the sixth amendment was not violated by the direct filing of criminal charges in adult court,or by the imposition of an adult sentence without a jury determination of appellant age.
what,then,was the maximum sentence authorized by the verdict the mandatory sentence for an adult defendant convicted of first degree special circumstance murder is lwop when the death penalty has not been sought,subd.a,subd.a.penal code section,subdivision b,provides for a presumptive term of lwop when the defendant was or years old at the time of the offense but allows the court to impose a lesser sentence of years to life in its discretion.people demirdjian th.and a defendant who was age or at the time he or she committed a special circumstance murder would face a maximum sentence of years to life if prosecuted as an adult.ibid.thus,lwop is the statutory maximum sentence for a defendant tried in adult court who is years of age or older and years to life is the maximum sentence for a defendant who is or years of age.ibid.
we do not understand appellant to be arguing that the maximum sentence in his case was limited to years to life absent a finding that he was at least years old at the time he committed the offenses.in any event,we view the fact of a defendant age in this structure for special circumstance murder in a noncapital case lwop for defendants who were age or over,lwop or years to life for defendants who were ages or,and years to life for defendants who were ages or as a circumstance that mitigates punishment,as to which the right to a jury trial under apprendi does not apply.see people retanan th,people cleveland th.because the court determined that appellant was years old at the time of his offense,the maximum sentence for apprendi purposes was lwop.
even if we assume the jury should have determined whether appellant was years of age or older,the failure to obtain such a finding was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.washington recuenco,people sandoval cal th.the charging documents alleged that appellant was over,and his age was uncontested at trial.the probation report indicates that appellant was years old when he committed the charged offenses,and reveals that his active history with the juvenile justice system began in,making it highly unlikely he was still under the age of when he committed the current offenses in.in a pretrial motion to set aside the information under penal code section,the defense asserted that appellant was years old at the time of the alleged offense.during his police interview,appellant essentially admitted that he was.had the issue been submitted to the jury,the verdict would have surely authorized the sentence imposed.sandoval,at.
lwop sentence as cruel and unusual punishment 
appellant contends the imposition of an lwop sentence for murder amounted to cruel and unusual punishment because he was a minor when he committed that offense.he claims that an lwop sentence is categorically prohibited in cases where a murder conviction against a defendant who was under age rests on a theory of aiding and abetting.appellant alternatively argues that an lwop sentence is constitutionally disproportionate to his culpability under the particular facts of his case.we are not persuaded.
appellant relies primarily on graham,in which the united states supreme court held that the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the eighth amendment prohibits an lwop sentence for juvenile offenders who have not committed a homicide.graham,supra.at.because defendants who do not kill,intend to kill or foresee that life will be taken are categorically less deserving of the most serious forms of punishment than are murderers.at,and because juveniles are,by reason of their immaturity,less culpable when compared to adults id.at,the practice of sentencing minors to lwop is unconstitutional in nonhomicide cases id.at.
graham is not controlling here because appellant was convicted of first degree murder with special circumstances the most serious variant of homicide offenses.while we agree that the punishment is very severe,the people of the state of california in enacting penal code section have made a legislative choice that some and year olds,who are tried as adults,and who commit the adult crime of special circumstance murder,are presumptively to be punished with lwop.we are unwilling to hold that such a legislative choice is necessarily too extreme,given the social reality of the many horrendous crimes,committed by increasingly vicious youthful offenders,which undoubtedly spurred the enactment.people guinn th,see also people em th,two consecutive year to life sentences,one for murder and one for a vicarious arming enhancement,did not amount to cruel and unusual punishment where defendant was years old at the time of the offense and was not the actual shooter demirdjian,supra,th at two consecutive terms of years to life was not cruel and unusual punishment for two special circumstance murders committed when the defendant was.
recognizing that graham is limited on its face to nonhomicide cases,appellant argues that its rationale applies with equal force to a juvenile defendant who,albeit convicted of murder,has not personally taken a life.according to appellant,the jury rejection of the firearm enhancement allegations demonstrates that he was convicted as an aider and abettor on a theory.from this,he reasons that he was actually convicted of intentionally aiding and abetting nonhomicide offenses,the residential burglary and attempted residential robbery on which the theory and special circumstances were based and became eligible for life without parole only because someone else fired a fatal shot.
this rather creative description of appellant murder conviction mischaracterizes the implications of the jury verdict.the jury rejection of the firearm allegations may simply reflect a reasonable doubt in the minds of the jurors that appellant specifically used a gun.it does not show the reverse,that the jury specifically found that appellant was an aider and abettor the jury may merely have believed,and most likely did believe,that appellant was guilty of murder as either a personal gun user or an aider and abettor but it may have been uncertain exactly which
