anthony hereafter anthony appeals from the judgment of extended commitment to the california youth authority cya pursuant to welfare and institutions code section et that scheme allows for a extension of a cya commitment if a jury finds that upon discharge,the ward would be physically dangerous to the public because of the ward mental or physical deficiency,disorder,or abnormality.
the jury was instructed,consistent with the constitutional requirements of in re howard cal th,d,howard and people williams cal th,d,williams,that to find anthony physically dangerous within the meaning of section it must find his mental disorder makes it likely,presents a substantial danger,that he will commit future sexually criminal acts.
on appeal,anthony challenges his order of commitment on the grounds the evidence at trial was insufficient to prove he has serious difficulty controlling his dangerous behavior.he also raises constitutional challenges,errors in the pleadings and at the probable cause hearing,and trial court error involving the admission of prejudicial evidence and the insufficiency of the evidence to support the commitment order.
we agree with anthony claim the evidence is insufficient to sustain the charge and shall reverse the commitment order.
in light of this disposition,we requested supplemental briefing on the question whether double jeopardy bars retrial at an extended commitment hearing held pursuant to section.section authorizes t he appellate court to affirm the order of the lower court,or modify it,or reverse it and order the appellant to be discharged.section mandates that if trial is ordered for extended commitment,the defendant is entitled to all rights guaranteed under the federal and state constitutions in criminal proceedings.we read section in the light of the constitutional principle against double jeopardy and find that discharge is the appropriate remedy.
after considering the parties arguments and these provisions,we conclude retrial is barred and shall direct that anthony be discharged from confinement.because this disposition disposes of the matter,we do not reach anthony remaining claims.
factual and procedural background 
original commitment 
anthony was born in november.he was committed to the cya as a ward of the court on june,pursuant to section,subdivision b,based upon his admission he committed an act of lewd and lascivious conduct on a child under the age of,subd.a.additional charges of illegal sex acts with a child under the age of years were dismissed with a harvey waiver anthony entered the cya formal sex offender treatment program at close youth correctional facility on or about october,and remained in the program until institution of the extended commitment proceedings.
cya jurisdiction was set to expire on anthony birthday in november,subd.a.a petition was filed on july,to extend his commitment pursuant to section and a jury trial was held to determine that question.
extended detention hearing 
at the extended detention hearing edh,steven herskovic,a cya staff psychologist who worked with anthony in the sex offender treatment program the program,testified that the wards in the program are divided into therapy groups of about seven and that anthony is a member of one of his groups.herskovic sees his wards once a week in a group session,which is the primary treatment for sex offenders.additionally,the wards attend several different resource groups involving anger and stress management and issues relating to gangs and drug and alcohol abuse.herskovic explained that the primary goal of the program is to prepare the wards so that when they are released from the program,they do not reoffend by committing new sex offenses or any other criminal acts on members of the public.
the program generally takes about months to complete,although some wards take longer and wards who complete the program have a reduced risk of recidivism when compared to wards who do not complete the program.
progress through the program is measured in stages and phases.the stages,of which there are,are the progressive treatment portions of the program.the initial stages stress honesty and.in stages one through three,the wards are oriented into the program,they are required to explore and disclose their entire sexual history,to write victim letters and reverse victim letters to see how they have impacted their victim,and to present these letters to the group and the doctor.in stages four through six,the wards learn about the assault cycle in general and their own assault cycle in particular,including the triggers that affect the various parts of their cycle.in stages seven through nine,the wards learn techniques for intervening into their assault cycle and for relapse prevention.the tenth stage requires that the ward demonstrate leadership by sponsoring new wards and assisting them through the program.by this stage,the ward is expected to be relatively stable and to act as a role model for other wards.anthony was in stage four and was working on the beginning stages of his assault cycle.
the phases of the program reflect a qualitative assessment of the ward progression in the program.the ward placement in a phase is determined from month to month based primarily on his general behavior as well as his participation and performance in treatment and education.phase one is the lowest phase and the ward progress through the phases is adversely affected by rule violations.wards who are performing well in all areas are assigned to phase four,while those who are doing pretty well are assigned to phase three.all privileges are based on the phase attained by the ward,and anthony was in group three 
anthony was in one of herskovic groups.the doctor prepared a report on anthony in which he diagnosed him as having pedophilia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd.he defined pedophilia as a mental disorder involving a person over the age of who has an intense attraction to prepubescent children who are five years younger and the individual has acted on those urges.adhd is a disorder in which the individual has problems with inattentiveness or impulsivity,although anthony had difficulty with both inattentiveness and impulsivity.however,he was taking medication for the adhd,which made him less impulsive.
as part of a committee at cya,herskovic and others determined that anthony required more time to complete the program and that an extension hearing was required.although the doctor did not conduct a formal risk assessment evaluation of anthony,he opined that anthony posed a moderate risk of reoffending upon discharge.we shall discuss herskovic testimony in greater detail in part ii of the discussion.
julian raya,anthony youth counselor,supervised anthony hours a week for about one year.he described anthony as nervous,edgy,emotional,and generally,but a ward who needed to be closely watched.according to raya,anthony also had difficulty telling the truth and fabricated one incident which he later admitted was false.
the jury found anthony is a dangerous person as defined in section of the welfare and institutions code on november,the court extended anthony commitment to november,and ordered him returned to close.anthony appealed the order of extended commitment.
discussion 
detention act 
the extended detention act eda et provides for the extended civil commitment of persons in the custody of the cya.howard,supra,cal th at,d.if the cya determines that the discharge of a person from the control of the department at the time required by specified statutes would be physically dangerous to the public because of the person mental or physical deficiency,disorder,or abnormality,the department shall request the prosecuting attorney to petition the committing court for an order directing that the person remain subject to the control of the authority beyond that time.
the petition must be accompanied by a written statement of the facts upon which the department bases its opinion that discharge from control of the department at the time stated would be physically dangerous to the public.
if the court determines the petition on its face supports a finding of probable cause,the court must order a probable cause hearing,subd.a.upon the trial court finding of probable cause to believe that discharge of the person would be physically dangerous to the public because of his or her mental or physical deficiency,disorder,or abnormality,subd.b,the person is entitled to a jury trial to determine that same question.at the trial,the person is entitled to all rights guaranteed under the federal and state constitutions in criminal proceedings,including a unanimous jury and proof beyond a reasonable doubt.see,subd.b.
if the jury finds the person meets the statutory criteria,he or she may be committed for up to two years.the person may then be recommitted for additional periods following the same procedures outlined ante.ibid.
in howard,supra,cal th,d,the california supreme court held that to preserve the constitutionality of section,it must be read to require proof not only that a person is physically dangerous to the public because of his or her mental deficiency,disorder,or abnormality,but also that the mental deficiency,disorder,or abnormality causes him to have serious difficulty controlling his dangerous behavior.id.at,d,italics added.
sufficiency of the evidence 
anthony contends the evidence is insufficient to support the verdict because it fails to show he has serious difficulty controlling his dangerous behavior,as required by howard,supra,cal th,d.respondent contends substantial evidence supports the jury verdict.we agree with anthony.
in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence in a civil commitment case,we apply the substantial evidence standard of review.people clark th,d.the question to be determined is whether,on the whole record,there is substantial evidence from which a rational trier of fact could have found each essential element beyond a reasonable doubt.people rowland cal th,d,see also jackson virginia,d.we must consider all the evidence in the light most favorable to the people,drawing all inferences the trier could reasonably have made to support the finding.people rayford cal th,d.
substantial evidence is evidence that is reasonable in nature,credible,and of solid value.people johnson cal d.while it is the exclusive province of the jury to determine the credibility of a witness and the truth or falsity of the historical facts people ochoa cal th,d,expert medical opinion evidence that is based upon a guess,surmise or conjecture,rather than relevant,probative facts,can not constitute substantial evidence.lockheed martin superior court cal th,d,place workmen comp.appeals bd.cal d.
substantive due process requires that involuntary civil confinement be limited to those who suffer from a mental illness or abnormality causing volitional impairment,which renders the person dangerous beyond his or her control.howard,supra,cal th at,d,kansas crane,d,crane kansas hendricks,d,hendricks.a finding of dangerousness,standing alone,is ordinarily not a sufficient ground upon which to justify indefinite involuntary commitment.howard,supra,cal th at,d,quoting hendricks,supra,at.at,d at.
the united states supreme court has made it abundantly clear that the distinction between dangerous sexual offenders subject to civil commitment and other dangerous persons who are more properly dealt with through criminal proceedings is constitutionally necessary lest civil commitment become a mechanism for retribution or general deterrence functions properly those of criminal law,not civil commitment.citations.the presence of what the psychiatric profession itself classified as a serious mental disorder helped to make that distinction in hendricks.and a critical distinguishing feature of that serious disorder there consisted of a special and serious lack of ability to control behavior.in recognizing that fact,we did not give to the phrase lack of control a particularly narrow or technical meaning.and we recognize that in cases where lack of control is at issue,inability to control behavior will not be demonstrable with mathematical precision.it is enough to say that there must be proof of serious difficulty in controlling behavior.and this,when viewed in light of such features of the case as the nature of the psychiatric diagnosis,and the severity of the mental abnormality itself,must be sufficient to distinguish the dangerous sexual offender whose serious mental illness,abnormality,or disorder subjects him to civil commitment from the dangerous but typical recidivist convicted in an ordinary criminal case.crane,supra,at.at,d at.
in applying these principles to determine the sufficiency of the evidence,we turn to williams,supra,cal th,d,and howard,supra,cal th,d,for guidance.in williams,the supreme court upheld a civil commitment order under the sexually violent predators act.the court found there was ample evidence to satisfy the requirement of crane,supra,d,that there be proof of serious difficulty in controlling dangerous behavior.the defendant was originally convicted of forcibly raping two women.in the first incident,he dragged the victim to a nearby park.while he was raping her,police officers arrived and had to physically remove him from the victim.id.at,d.two experts testified that he suffered from paraphilia,a serious,incurable mental disorder characterized by intense,obsessive,and repetitive criminal sexual violence.they further testified that because the defendant continued to act out sexually while confined,he demonstrated a marked lack of control over his sexual behavior.his control was further impaired by another mental disorder that increased his impulsivity.the defendant also admitted he had no control.id.at,d.
in howard,supra,cal th,d,a proceeding under section,the court concluded the jury was not properly instructed on the requirement of having serious difficulty controlling dangerous behavior and found the evidence insufficient to render the instructional error harmless.the defendant initial commitment offense was the molestation of a three and boy.during his confinement,the defendant was seen masturbating in his room,had sexual fantasies about getting aggressive with a female correctional officer,and had outbursts of anger,which the defendant indicated he was unable to control.a clinical psychologist diagnosed him with paraphilia,an abnormal mental condition that does not fit into a specific category.the psychologist was hesitant to diagnose him as a pedophile or a sadist although he exhibited some of the traits and qualities of these illnesses.the psychologist opined that defendant posed a physical danger to the community because he continued to act out in a sexual way on the unit.id.at,d.
in finding the instructional error prejudicial,the court found that unlike in williams,supra,cal th,d,t here was no testimony that howard mental abnormality caused him serious difficulty controlling his sexually deviant behavior,the defendant committing offense was one of opportunity his mother was babysitting the sleeping victim rather than compulsion,and his incidents of masturbation were not done in a public setting.howard,supra,cal th at,d.
the evidence presented in this case is even weaker than that presented in howard unlike the underlying offense in williams and like that in howard,the offense leading to anthony commitment was not a crime of compulsion but one of opportunity.the commitment offense involved an female and a second offense,which was dismissed,involved her sister the two offenses occurred in the home of anthony best friend over a period of several months,while the subject was visiting.indeed,h e practically lived there.
there was clear evidence anthony suffers from a mental disorder.herskovic diagnosed anthony mental condition as pedophilia,adhd,and cannabis abuse.he defined pedophilia as having intense attraction and urges towards prepubescent children under by a person five years or more older.however,he did not testify to the extent or degree of anthony disorder,nor did he testify that it was incurable,or that anthony disorder was a repetitive compulsive disorder.
herskovic never prepared a formal risk assessment evaluation of anthony.nevertheless he opined that without supervision,without further treatment i hesitate to be too specific about the level of risk because that something i want to evaluate in more detail,but certainly above low risk,at least medium risk or higher he testified his opinion was primarily based on anthony history of offending and his current level of functioning.i would take into consideration certainly that it an unknown how well he could develop relationships.he admitted to continued fantasy,like an interest in children during incarceration and during his treatment,which would be a great concern,of course.the doctor also found it very significant that anthony had committed numerous sexual offenses over a period of years and had not fully disclosed all of his offenses,but he did not think anthony adhd was a risk factor.however,because herskovic was unaware of the details of those offenses,they do not provide a solid basis to conclude those offenses were compulsive crimes driven by his pedophilia.
the task of preparing a formal risk assessment was assigned to liederman,who at the last minute advised the prosecutor he was unable to testify as scheduled.oddly enough,his conclusions were not introduced into evidence,nor did the prosecution proffer the report itself as evidence.instead,herskovic was asked to review the report and take the stand again,this time testifying about anthony risk of reoffending.he did so,but was unable to recall many of the relevant risk factors bearing on that question he did not testify to the factors relied on by liederman,and after reviewing liederman report,herskovic was still not sure exactly how high a risk anthony posed to the community if released.he merely concluded that anthony posed some risk,moderate at least to the community if released.
this testimony does not constitute substantial evidence that anthony has serious difficulty controlling his behavior.in light of herskovic failure to prepare a formal risk assessment evaluation,his lack of preparation,and his inability to state the risk factors at trial,his reluctance to quantify how high a risk anthony posed without further study strongly suggests his opinion was based as much on guesswork,surmise or conjecture as on relevant probative facts.lockheed martin superior court,supra,cal th at,d.as such,his testimony is not a basis upon which to establish proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
moreover,the doctor opinion fails to satisfy the quantitative requirement that anthony has serious difficulty in controlling his behavior.as stated,he opined that anthony posed some risk,moderate at least.the term moderate is defined as avoiding extremes of behavior,tending towards the mean or average,or not seriously or permanently disabling or incapacitating webster new internat.dict.serious is defined as considerable.id.at.the conclusion that anthony poses a moderate risk of reoffense based upon a limited number of risk factors fails to show he has serious difficulty controlling his behavior.
furthermore,as in howard,there was no testimony anthony mental abnormality caused him serious difficulty controlling his sexually deviant behavior howard,supra,cal th at,d,and unlike in williams and contrary to respondent claim,there was no testimony anthony other mental disorder adhd exacerbated his pedophilia or compelled him to act it out moreover,herskovic opined that the impulsivity caused by the adhd possibly could be controlled with the medication anthony voluntarily took.
herskovic primary consideration in reaching his opinion was the static factor of anthony offense history.as noted,the offenses committed by anthony were crimes of opportunity rather than of compulsion,and standing alone,do not serve to distinguish anthony as a dangerous offender subject to civil commitment from dangerous recidivists who are more properly dealt with through the criminal justice system.crane,supra,at.at,d at.
nor did anthony confinement behavior support a finding of present lack of control.while the doctor considered anthony fantasies,unlike in williams,there was no evidence he acted out on those fantasies in any inappropriate manner during his confinement.although anthony failure to act out while confined may not be relevant to affirmatively establish he had impulse control,at the very least,it leaves an evidentiary gap whether he lacked control.on the other hand,there was evidence he was not a behavior problem,he understood he had a mental illness,he was participating in the program,and was serious about his treatment moreover,anthony statement that he felt he needed additional treatment before he could feel comfortable being released without the risk of reoffending does not necessarily support the conclusion he is dangerous.as herskovic indicated,admitting one needs treatment shows motivation for treatment and is a positive factor.thus,anthony statement may just as easily be an indicator he is on the road to rehabilitation.
nor does anthony failure to fully disclose his offense demonstrate that he has serious difficulty controlling his behavior.according to herskovic,full disclosure is required to progress in the treatment program and bears on the ward honesty,a factor in evaluating a person for dangerousness.however,herskovic also testified that he had not evaluated anthony for that purpose and drew no such conclusion 
while anthony may have a serious difficulty controlling his sexually deviant behavior,the evidence at trial fails to support such a finding in the absence of a good measure of speculation and conjecture.for this reason,we conclude that no rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that anthony had serious difficulty controlling his sexually deviant behavior and shall reverse the order of commitment.
discharge upon reversal 
section provides that t he appellate court may affirm the order of the lower court,or modify it,or reverse it and order the appellant to be discharged.section mandates that the person being tried for extended commitment shall be entitled to all rights guaranteed under the federal and state constitutions in criminal proceedings.reading these two sections together,we hold that,having reversed the commitment order for failure of proof,principles of double jeopardy require that we direct respondent to discharge anthony from civil confinement.
double jeopardy,which is proscribed by both the federal and state constitutions forbids a second trial for the purpose of affording the prosecution another opportunity to supply evidence which it failed to muster in the first proceeding.burks united states,d,fn.omitted benton maryland,d.it applies equally to juvenile offender proceedings.breed jones,d,superseded on other grounds.while this proscription does not bar retrial upon reversal by an appellate court for trial error burks united states,supra,at.at,d at united states tateo,d,it does bar retrial when an appellate court reverses a judgment of conviction for evidentiary insufficiency.burks united states,supra,at.at,d at greene massey,d,applying burks rule to reversal of state court convictions.
double jeopardy does not apply to civil actions.hudson united states,d,hendricks,supra,at.at,d at.because extended commitment proceedings under section et are civil in nature howard,supra,cal th at,d,in re gary cal d,superseded by statute on other grounds,the double jeopardy provisions of the state and federal constitution do not bar such proceedings.hendricks,supra,at.at,d at in re steven th,d double jeopardy does not apply to eda proceeding people francis th,d double jeopardy does not apply to civil commitment proceeding of mentally disordered offender people superior court williams d.double jeopardy does not apply to proceeding to extend civil commitment of defendant previously found not guilty by reason of insanity.
however,section makes all rights guaranteed under the federal and state constitutions in criminal proceedings applicable in a trial for extended commitment held pursuant to section.we find this all rights language includes the prohibition against double jeopardy.
in construing statutory language,our task is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent.citations.we turn first to the words of the statute themselves,recognizing that they generally provide the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.citations.when the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous and thus not reasonably susceptible of more than one meaning,there is no need for construction,and courts should not indulge in it.citations.people gardeley cal th,d.when considering the statutory language,we adhere to the maxim that c ourts should give meaning to every word of a statute if possible,and should avoid a construction making any word surplusage.citation.reno baird cal th,d.
the language of section is clear and unambiguous.the defendant at an eda trial shall be entitled to all rights guaranteed under the federal and state constitutions in criminal proceedings.those rights attach once a trial is ordered pursuant to section the statute does not limit or qualify this guarantee in any way.a holding that those rights do not include double jeopardy burks united states,supra,at.at,d at,would render the word all meaningless.
it is true that double jeopardy does not apply to bar an eda trial in the first instance.in re steven,supra,th at,d.were it otherwise,the eda itself would be rendered meaningless because it only operates upon a person who has been committed as a juvenile offender and is presently in the custody of the cya.however,under the terms of the statute,once the trial is ordered under section,all constitutional rights guaranteed by the state and federal constitutions come into play.
any doubt as to this construction is dispelled by looking to section,which grants the appellate court discretion to order the appellant discharged if it reverses the lower court order of commitment this discretion is consistent with double jeopardy,which does not bar retrial upon reversal of a conviction for trial error burks united states,supra,at.at,d at howard,supra,cal th at,d,but does bar retrial when a conviction is reversed for evidentiary insufficiency.burks united states,supra,at.at,d at.applying the cardinal rule of statutory construction that every statute should be construed with reference to the whole system of law of which it is a part so that all may be harmonized and have effect landrum superior court cal d,we hold that principles of double jeopardy require an appellate court to order the discharge of an appellant from custody pursuant to section upon the reversal of an order of extended commitment for insufficiency of the evidence.
this conclusion is also in accordance with the decision in in re luis th,d luis,where the fifth district court of appeal also considered the meaning of the all rights provision in section.also finding those words clear and unambiguous,the fifth district held that the defendant in an eda trial had the right not to testify against himself.
nevertheless,relying on people henderson d.henderson and people superior court williams,supra,d,respondent and the dissent take the position that double jeopardy remains inapplicable to section proceedings because that section merely requires application of constitutional protections mandated by judicial decisions.we find these cases inapposite because the statutory language construed in them,while similar,is not identical to that used in section.nor do the statutory schemes at issue in henderson and people superior court williams contain a provision similar to section.
in henderson,supra,d,the court considered whether the privilege against was mandated under the terms of former section,subdivision e repealed by stats,ch,that provision provides for an extension hearing for a mentally disordered sex offender mdso.the pertinent statutory language stated that a defendant in an mdso hearing shall be entitled to the rights guaranteed under the federal and state constitutions for criminal proceedings.former,subd.e,italics added.the court concluded that this language only codifies the application of constitutional protections to mdso proceedings mandated by judicial decision citations.it does not extend the protection of the constitutional privileges against to testimonial communications which are not incriminatory.d at.
in people superior court williams,supra,d,the court construed penal code section.that provision governs civil extension hearings of persons found not guilty by reason of insanity.using the same language used in former section,subdivision e,section,subdivision b provides that a person facing extension of an insanity commitment shall be entitled to the rights guaranteed under the federal and state constitutions for criminal proceedings.all proceedings shall be in accordance with applicable constitutional guarantees.italics added.relying on henderson,the court concluded that the constitutional rights guaranteed by penal code section do not include double jeopardy and therefore the appellate court was not barred from reviewing the trial court decision granting nonsuit.the appellate court reasoned that although many constitutional protections relating to criminal proceedings are available in extension proceedings,the application of all such protections is not mandated by section.the statutory language merely codifies the application of constitutional protections to extension hearings mandated by judicial decision.d at.see also people powell th,d relying on people superior court williams,the court held that penal code section does not mandate the right to personally waive jury trial.
unlike the statutory language construed by the courts in henderson and people superior court williams,the statutory language in section guarantees all constitutional rights guaranteed in criminal proceedings.moreover,when section was amended in to include the constitutional rights guarantee,the legislature was not writing on a blank slate.the language in former section,subdivision e had been in effect for over five years and had been construed by henderson three years earlier.
the constitutional rights guarantee was included in former section,subdivision e in when that section was added to the welfare and institutions code.stats,ch.the same language was used in section when it was added to the penal code in.stats,ch.against this statutory background,the legislature amended section by adding the all constitutional rights language.stats,ch.
had the legislature intended to grant the same constitutional rights in section as it granted in former section and penal code section,it would have used the same language.since it did not,instead specifying that the defendant is entitled to all constitutional rights in criminal proceedings,we must give the word all its inclusive commonsense meaning.
as the fifth district in luis,supra,th,d stated,the construction in people superior court williams rendered the statutory declaration of rights surplusage and supplanted the legislative language with a process whereby judges selected which rights would apply.if the legislature did not intend that all rights apply,than the specify which rights applied.finally,that the courts had extended certain rights to commitment proceedings under constitutional principles did not prevent the legislature from providing additional rights to those subjected to the proceedings.luis,supra,th at,d.
in the dissent view,the legislature specified the right to a unanimous jury verdict and proof beyond a reasonable doubt in the last sentence of section,intending to codify people superior court vernal d.vernal,and our construction renders that sentence superfluous.we disagree.
there is nothing in the language of section to suggest the legislature intended those two rights to be the only constitutional rights applicable in a trial under section.indeed,such a construction would render the statute unconstitutional because a defendant in a civil commitment hearing has other constitutional rights,including the right to have the state bear the burden of proof people superior court williams,supra,d at,to be represented by counsel see people tilbury cal d,and to confront and witnesses.people wolozon d.needless to say,none of these rights are specified in section.
nor does vernal,supra,d,stand for the narrow proposition asserted by the dissent.in vernal,the court held that section et was unconstitutional because it authorized extended commitment of a juvenile detainee based on a less than unanimous jury verdict.in so holding,the court stated,t he consequence of the proceeding,involuntary incarceration,triggers the full panoply of due process protections.id.at,fn.omitted,italics added.the court did not list what those protections are.however,in the footnote that follows,the court addressed the standard of proof applicable in such proceedings although the defendant had not raised the issue.because the matter was to be remanded for retrial,the court explained for the guidance of the trial court,that to comply with the due process clauses of the state and federal constitutions,an extended detention under section must be justified by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.id.at,fn.
thus,while vernal held that due process requires a unanimous jury and proof beyond a reasonable doubt in an extended commitment hearing under section et,it did not hold that those two rights are the only ones required.to the contrary,it held that such hearings require the full panoply of due process protections d at,and as we have shown above,those protections include more than the two rights specified in section.
nor does the all constitutional rights requirement in section express an intent to merely codify vernal d.it is clearly broader than the full panoply requirement because the former applies in criminal proceedings while the latter is limited to due process protections.thus,the dissent construction would render the words in criminal proceedings meaningless.if the legislature had intended section to apply only to those constitutional rights required by judicial decision,the full panoply of due process protections,it would have omitted the words in criminal proceedings and would have stated instead t he person shall be entitled to all rights guaranteed under the federal and state constitutions.
the dissent declines to order anthony discharged pursuant to section,reasoning it would be unfair to fault the people for failing to prove an element required for commitment that was not in the statute at the time of trial.this assumes the jury was incorrectly instructed.that is not the case.
to preserve the constitutionality of the statute,the court in howard interpreted the statutory scheme to require proof that the person has serious difficulty controlling his dangerous behavior.howard,supra,cal th at,d.this holding was compelled by hendricks,supra,d and crane,supra,d,because,as the court in howard found,those cases,embody general due process principles regarding civil commitment.cal th at,d.the california supreme court therefore relied on those two cases when it addressed constitutional challenges to other civil commitment schemes.id.at,d,see hubbart superior court cal th,d,williams,supra,cal th at,d.
thus,the people were in no way disadvantaged during the first trial.there was no instructional error and none is asserted.the instruction that was given is a modified version of caljic,which instructs in the language of the statute for committing a sexually violent predator and has been held to satisfy substantive due process under hendricks and crane.hubbart superior court,supra,cal th at,d,williams,supra,cal th at,d.the court in williams found that statutory language inherently embraces and conveys the need for a dangerous mental condition characterized by impairment of behavioral control.williams,supra,at,d.this is accomplished by including the requirements of a diagnosed mental disorder citation affecting the emotional or volitional capacity citation,which predisposes one to commit criminal sexual acts so as to render the person a menace to the health and safety of others citation,such that the person is likely to engage in sexually violent criminal behavior citations.ibid.by defining the likely to reoffend element as an actual risk of violent reoffense which is substantial,serious,and,the jury necessarily understands that the persons ability to control his behavior is seriously and dangerously impaired.no additional instructions or findings are necessary.id.at,d,fn.omitted.the modified version given to the jury in the present case included these elements 
the people were clearly aware of the above mentioned authorities and made every effort to prove anthony dangerousness as required by howard,actually their expert in an effort to elicit testimony to satisfy howard however,for reasons set forth,the evidence failed to support the instruction.
if principles of double jeopardy are not applied when the commitment order is reversed for evidentiary insufficiency,the state could theoretically keep the person confined without ever proving the defendant is unable to control his dangerousness.this possibility raises at least two questions how many opportunities should the state be given to present evidence it failed to muster in the first proceeding and what evidence would be produced.
due process requires that involuntary civil commitment be based upon proof the defendant is presently dangerous beyond his or her control.howard,supra,cal th at,d,crane,supra,at.at,d at.in the absence of such proof,confinement is nothing more than punishment.crane,supra,at.at,d at.the issue of dangerousness is therefore a question that must be answered with respect to a specific period of time,namely upon discharge of the individual.the question on retrial then is not whether the person was dangerous as the state failed to prove at the first trial but whether he is presently dangerous.assuming the person has received treatment during confinement as required by law people feagley cal d,his ability to control his dangerousness may have improved since the first trial.however,if the person confinement is continued and the state is allowed to retry him for his current dangerousness,he will have been held in continued confinement without the state ever having to prove he was dangerous at the time his commitment was set to expire.the state could therefore keep the person confined in an endless cycle of retrial without ever proving dangerousness.
for these reasons,we conclude double jeopardy applies to a trial held pursuant to section and that retrial is barred by section upon reversal of a commitment order for failure of proof.
in the absence of a valid order of further detention made pursuant to the eda,the cya jurisdiction over anthony expired on november,subd.a.we shall therefore order his immediate discharge from confinement.
disposition 
the judgment is reversed.respondent is directed to discharge anthony from confinement.
i concur in parts i and ii of the majority opinion,where the majority concludes anthony commitment was not supported by substantial evidence.i respectfully dissent from part iii of the majority opinion,which concludes that a retrial in this case is barred.
i agree with the majority analysis and conclusion that,ordinarily,double jeopardy would not bar a retrial because this proceeding is a civil proceeding and double jeopardy does not bar a retrial in a civil proceeding.
i respectfully dissent from the majority conclusion that retrial is barred by welfare and institutions code section the majority concludes,the language of section is clear and unambiguous.i respectfully disagree.construed as a whole,i think section is ambiguous and the legislative history indicates the legislature did not intend to impose double jeopardy principles on these civil proceedings.
section states in pertinent part,the person shall be entitled to all rights guaranteed under the federal and state constitutions in criminal proceedings.a unanimous jury verdict shall be required in any jury trial.as to either a court or a jury trial,the standard of the proof shall be that of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.we must read a statute as a whole and attempt to harmonize its elements by considering each clause or section in the context of the overall statutory framework.citation.khajavi feather river anesthesia medical group th,d.t he plain meaning rule does not prohibit a court from determining whether the literal meaning of a statute comports with its purpose or whether such a construction of one provision is consistent with other provisions of the statute.the meaning of a statute may not be determined from a single word or sentence the words must be construed in context,and provisions relating to the same subject matter must be harmonized to the extent possible.citation.literal construction should not prevail if it is contrary to the legislative intent apparent in the statute.the intent prevails over the letter,and the letter will,if possible,be so read as to conform to the spirit of the act.lungren deukmejian cal d.people king cal th,d.
when i read the statutory language as a whole,i conclude the foregoing statutory language is internally confusing.on the one hand,while the statute says a person shall be entitled to all federal and state constitutional rights guaranteed in criminal proceedings,the statute then immediately identifies a unanimous jury has long been required by our state constitution in criminal cases.people superior court thomas cal d.the next sentence identifies another beyond a reasonable has long been guaranteed by the federal constitution in criminal cases.in re winship,d.thus,if the legislature had really intended to confer all constitutional rights available in criminal proceedings,the last two quoted sentences would be surplusage however,it is a venerable maxim of statutory construction that courts should give meaning to every word in a statute and should avoid a construction making any word surplusage.cooley superior court cal th,d,construing sexually violent predators act.
in light of the internal confusion of the three statutory sentences quoted above,i do not find section unambiguous,as does the majority.rather,i think that the statute is sufficiently ambiguous to justify resort to legislative history to try to figure out what the legislature had in mind.see kaufman broad communities,performance plastering,th,d.
the statutory language of section was enacted by assembly bill ab,introduced during the session of the legislature.see stats,ch.
the digest of ab before the assembly criminal law and public safety committee stated in part 
the statute now requires only that of the members of the jury agree by a preponderance of the evidence that the ward is dangerous.court decisions have held that due process requires a unanimous jury verdict beyond a reasonable doubt.this bill codifies these procedural requirements.assem.com.on criminal law and public safety,analysis of assem.bill,supra.
similarly,the analysis of ab that was prepared by the senate staff recited as follows 
existing law provides for extensions of youth authority jurisdiction over a ward if,by reason of mental or physical abnormality,he would be dangerous to the public if released.the statute now requires that of the members of the jury agree by a preponderance of the evidence that the ward is dangerous.an appellate court decision,however,has held that due process and equal protection require a unanimous jury verdict beyond a reasonable doubt.
this bill would codify those procedural requirements and make other technical changes in existing law.
the purpose of this bill is to conform statutory and case law.com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill,supra,as introduced.
the report of the assembly committee on criminal law and public safety is to the same effect purpose.the purpose of the bill is to codify judicially mandated due process safeguards in the statute to insure that extension proceedings are conducted properly.see people superior court vernal d.cya reports that there are about such cases each year.this is a rather rare proceeding and it can not be assumed most prosecutors are familiar with it.therefore,it is important to correct the statutes which currently inaccurately reflect what procedural safeguards are necessary.assem.com.on criminal law and public safety,analysis of assem.bill,supra.
it therefore appears that the purpose of the amendment to section was to require,by statute,those constitutional rights that had been mandated by the decision in people superior court vernal,supra,d.this conclusion is entirely consistent with the holding of this court in people henderson d,which interpreted the meaning of statutory language mandating,the rights guaranteed under the federal and state constitutions for criminal proceedings in proceedings to extend the commitment of mentally disordered sex offenders.henderson,supra,d at.in henderson,we rejected the argument that the foregoing statutory language mandated application of the constitutional privilege against.we said,we do not so read the command of the statute.subdivision e of section codifies the application of constitutional protections to mdso proceedings mandated by judicial decision citation.it does not extend the protection of the constitutional privileges against to testimonial communications which are not incriminatory.henderson,supra,d at.
we generally presume the legislature is aware of appellate court decisions.citations.harris capital growth investors xiv cal d.in this case,the legislature was doubtless aware of our opinion in henderson,supra,d,and the legislative history of the amendment of section demonstrates convincingly that the legislature intended the amended statute to perform a similar task as that performed by the statute at issue in henderson.or,in the words of senate staff,quoted above,the purpose of this bill is to conform statutory and case law.
in sum,i read the disputed statutory language as follows 
the person shall be entitled to all rights guaranteed under the federal and state constitutions in criminal proceedings that have been mandated by people superior court vernal d.one such right is that a unanimous jury verdict shall be required in any jury trial.the other such right is that in either a court or a jury trial,the standard of proof shall be that of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
because no judicial decision has ever mandated that double jeopardy principles apply to this extended detention proceeding,double jeopardy is not required by section,nor by any other law.
in support of its statutory interpretation the majority relies on in re luis th,d.in that case,the court of appeal for the fifth appellate district concluded the words of section are clear and unambiguous.id.at,d.apparently for this reason,the luis court did not consider the legislative history of the amendment of the statute.as i said,i do not find the language of section unambiguous,and i find the legislative history enlightening in the extreme.for that reason,i respectfully disagree with the analysis of in re luis 
the majority also relies upon section,which,according to the majority,confers discretion on the court to discharge the appellant from cya control upon reversal of the judgment.assuming this court has such discretion,i would not exercise it here.
the record shows a lack of substantial evidence that anthony has serious difficulty controlling his behavior.yet that requirement for commitment was not in the statute when anthony was tried.rather,it was later read into the statute by our supreme court in in re howard cal th at page,d.i am not confident the people adduced all available evidence on the issue.in my view,fairness compels a retrial.
anthony also contends retrial is barred by principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel.not so.principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel apply only where there has been a final judgment.people barragan cal th,d.there is no final judgment in this case because it has been reversed.ibid.neither res judicata nor collateral estoppel bars a retrial here.
i would remand to allow the people to retry the extended commitment of anthony see in re michael th,d.
