appellant proclivity to commit sexual offenses continued into his adulthood.he pled guilty to a single count of lewd conduct with a child under and was sentenced to state prison for the three year mitigated term in,subd.a.he was placed on probation in after pleading guilty to annoying or molesting a child under penal code section,subdivision c.in,appellant was again sentenced to prison after his probation in the case was revoked and he pled guilty to a new charge of indecent exposure under penal code section.
before his scheduled release from prison,appellant was screened and evaluated to determine whether he met the criteria for a civil commitment under the svp act.et as part of this process,bph sent a letter to the juvenile court on june,requesting copies of the petition,abstract of judgment and probation officer report in appellant juvenile proceedings.the letter was accompanied by a form petition for disclosure of juvenile court records under section.on july,the juvenile court ordered release of the records to bph without setting the case for a hearing or giving appellant the opportunity to respond.
on july,appellant wrote the juvenile court a letter and objected to the release of the sealed records.he sent a second letter to the court on august,requesting that counsel be appointed and that he be granted relief.this court has construed that second letter as a timely notice of appeal from the order releasing the records,and we will review the order releasing the sealed records as a final judgment in a special proceeding.in re keisha th,d.
discussion 
order releasing sealed records 
appellant argues that the juvenile court exceeded its authority when it provided bph with copies of records that it had previously ordered sealed under section.he contends that once sealed,the records could not be inspected by third persons except in narrow statutorily prescribed circumstances not relevant here.because this case presents a question of statutory construction based on undisputed facts,we independently review the juvenile court ruling.hoschler sacramento city unified school dist.th,d in re jeffrey th,d.
section provides in relevant part a in any case in which a petition has been filed with a juvenile court to commence proceedings to adjudge a person a ward of the court,the person or the county probation officer may,in any case,at any time after the person has reached the age of years,petition the court for sealing of the records,including records of arrest,relating to the person case,in the custody of the juvenile court and probation officer and any other agencies,including law enforcement agencies,and public officials as the petitioner alleges,in his or her petition,to have custody of the records if,after hearing,the court finds that since the termination of jurisdiction or action he or she has not been convicted of a felony or of any misdemeanor involving moral turpitude and that rehabilitation has been attained to the satisfaction of the court,it shall order all records,papers,and exhibits in the person case in the custody of the juvenile court sealed,including the juvenile court record,minute book entries,and entries on dockets,and any other records relating to the case in the custody of the other agencies and officials as are named in the order once the court has ordered the person records sealed,the proceedings in the case shall be deemed never to have occurred the person who is the subject of records sealed pursuant to this section may petition the superior court to permit inspection of the records by persons named in the petition,and the superior court may so order.otherwise,except as provided in subdivision b,the records shall not be open to inspection italics added.the statute goes on to provide two narrow exceptions to the rule that a sealed record is not open to inspection when there is good cause to unseal the records so they can be admitted into evidence in a defamation action,subd.b,and when information about an adjudication has been provided to the department of motor vehicles and is disclosed by that agency to an authorized insurer for the limited purpose of determining insurance eligibility and rates,subd.c.
the language of section,subdivision a is clear and unequivocal unless the defamation exception under subdivision b or the insurance eligibility exception under subdivision c applies,a record that has been sealed may not be disclosed to a third party.parmett superior court d.t he existence of specific exceptions does not imply that others exist.the proper rule of statutory construction is that the statement of limited exceptions excludes others,and therefore the judiciary has no power to add additional exceptions the enumeration of specific exceptions precludes implying others.id.at.
the people argue that the juvenile court had broad and exclusive authority to determine whether and to what extent to grant access to confidential juvenile court records pursuant to section,citing in re elijah th,d and in re keisha,supra,th at page,d.section generally governs access to juvenile court records,stating a rule of confidentiality and providing for a number of exceptions to that rule,including a provision that such records may be inspected by a ny other person who may be designated by court order of the judge of the juvenile court upon filing a petition,subd.a o.but neither section nor the cases cited by the people involve juvenile records that have been sealed by court order pursuant to section.though section gives the juvenile court the discretion to allow third persons to inspect a juvenile court file that has not been sealed,a sealed record not falling within one of the express exceptions of section may only be disclosed with the permission of the juvenile and by order of the juvenile court.navajo express superior court d.
our conclusion that section bars the release of sealed juvenile court records to bph for use in an svp proceeding is reinforced by section,which provides,notwithstanding any other provision of law,the board of prison terms,in order to evaluate the suitability for release of a person before the board,shall be entitled to review juvenile court records which have not been sealed,concerning the person before the board,if those records relate to a case in which the person was found to have committed an offense which brought the person within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court pursuant to section.italics added.by granting access to juvenile records which have not been sealed,the legislature implicitly and necessarily denied the right of access to sealed records.see gikas zolin cal th,d,expressio unius est exclusio alterius,the expression of some things in a statute necessarily means the exclusion of other things not expressed.
the people seek to diminish the significance of section on the basis that it was enacted in,long before the inception of the svp act.a more reasonable inference is that the legislature determined in that only unsealed juvenile court records would be available to the board,and it did not expressly repeal or create an exception to this rule when it enacted the svp
