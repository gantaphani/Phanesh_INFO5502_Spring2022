mother and father appeal from orders asserting dependency jurisdiction over their children,and collectively children,and removing the children from their custody.
in the unpublished portion of this opinion,we will hold that there was insufficient evidence to support jurisdiction based on the mother alleged failure to protect the children against sexual abuse by the father.however,there was sufficient evidence to support jurisdiction based on the mother substance abuse moreover,the juvenile court also found jurisdiction on other grounds,which the parents do not challenge.
in the published portion of this opinion,we will hold that there was sufficient evidence to support the removal of the children from both parents based on domestic violence.we will also hold that,even though the father kentucky conviction for second degree sexual abuse was a misdemeanor under kentucky law,it constituted a violent felony for purposes of the denial of reunification services under california law.
we find no other error.accordingly,we will modify the jurisdictional findings,and we will affirm the jurisdictional and dispositional orders as modified.
factual and procedural backgrounda.detention phase.
the mother and the father have two sons together,and,the older boy,was born in he was five when this dependency was filed,and he is seven now,the younger boy,was born in he was two when this dependency was filed,and he is five now.
the father is the presumed father of however,the mother claimed another man was biological father.that other man denied paternity he was named in the dependency as an alleged father.the father is both the presumed and the biological father of 
in march,san bernardino county children and family services department received a report that the children were being abused.allegedly,the father used drugs,and the mother allowed the children to visit the father,even though he was a registered sex offender.when the department investigated,the mother agreed not to let the father visit the children.because she appeared protective,the investigation was closed.
also in march,the police searched the father home pursuant to a warrant.they found a shotgun hidden between the mattress and box spring of his bed and bullets in a shed.they also found marijuana on a dresser the marijuana was accessible to the children,who were in the home at the time.the father claimed to have a medical marijuana recommendation.eventually,he pleaded nolo contendere to unlawful possession of a firearm and unlawful possession of ammunition charges of child endangerment and failure to register as a sex offender were dropped.he was sentenced to months with applicable credits,he was actually incarcerated for eight months,from march through november.
in december,the department received a hotline report that the children were being abused.allegedly,the mother hit,the mother did not cook for,and the mother had been prescribed prozac but did not take it.
as a result,in february,social workers interviewed the father.the children were in his home at the time 
the father denied that the mother hit the children.however,he confirmed that she did not take her prescription prozac.he said that she had mental health illnesses.
initially,the father also said that the mother did not use drugs.however,he then volunteered that she used methamphetamine and marijuana and was currently staying with her uncle in simi valley to detox.
the father admitted that,in,he had been convicted of a sexual offense in kentucky.however,he denied actually committing the offense.he explained that his had accused him falsely of molesting her then year old daughter.he also admitted prior convictions for possession of ephedrine with the intent to manufacture methamphetamine,possession of a controlled substance,and driving under the influence 
after this interview,the department detained the children and filed dependency petitions as to them.they were placed in a foster home.
a social worker then interviewed the mother.
the mother admitted that she had been prescribed prozac for bipolar disorder but had not taken it for a year because she no longer had medi cal.
the mother also admitted that she used marijuana daily she had started using it when she was.she admitted using methamphetamine in the past but claimed to have stopped in march.
the mother said that she did not know the father was a sex offender until the march investigation.she claimed she did not know that the children were not supposed to have contact with him.when reminded that she had agreed to that in march,she said she thought it was okay for him to have contact with the children because the charges of child endangerment and failure to register as a sex offender had been dropped.
the mother admitted that she and the father had engaged in mutual domestic violence since the most recent incident was in december.she also admitted that the children had been present during the domestic violence.
jurisdictional phase.
the mother first drug test was positive for marijuana.she told a social worker that she used marijuana in lieu of prozac for her bipolar disorder.she indicated that she was going to start taking prozac again because she had located an inexpensive source.just two days before making this statement,however,she had obtained a physician recommendation for medical marijuana.
the father first drug test was invalid due to signs that he had attempt ed to flush the system.he admitted using marijuana occasional ly but agreed to quit.
the social worker made an effort to locate records relating to the father sexual offense.the kentucky court case file could not be found the records may have been destroyed in the ordinary course of business.however,the social worker was able to locate copies of some relevant records.
according to the criminal complaint,the father placed his finger in and stroked the vaginal area of a year old girl.the victim pants and panties were pulled down.
according to other records,the father was charged with first degree sexual abuse.this was later amended to sexual abuse solicitation.the father was ultimately convicted of second degree sexual abuse,former.we take judicial notice that this statute,as relevant here,provided 
a person is guilty of sexual abuse in the second degree when 
b he subjects another person who is less than fourteen years old to sexual contact.
sexual abuse in the second degree is a class a misdemeanor.
sexual contact was defined as any touching of the sexual or other intimate parts of a person done for the purpose of gratifying the sexual desire of either party,former,subd.
the father was sentenced to days in jail and days of probation.according to him,he was not required to register as a sex offender in kentucky.however,he was registered as a sex offender in california,based on the kentucky conviction.
once again,the father denied actually committing the offense.he explained that his girlfriend year old daughter was playing outside and got a burr in her genital area and he helped her remove it.a neighbor witnessed this and told the mom the girlfriend wanted to leave him any way sic and took this information and ran with it.he pleaded guilty just to get out of jail.
denied any sexual abuse.was too young to be interviewed.
the mother took four drug tests three in april and one in may.the first was positive the second was negative but had a suspicious specimen temperature the third was positive and the fourth was negative.
the father also took four drug tests,all negative.
in the report,the department recommended that the children be removed and that both parents be given reunification services.prior to the hearing,however,as a result of mediation,the department and the parents agreed that the children should be placed with the mother on a family maintenance plan.minors counsel did not agree with this and requested a contested hearing.
after a further mediation session,the department and the father agreed that the father should receive reunification services.again,minors counsel did not agree with this.
c.the hearing.
in june,at the hearing,all of the social worker reports were admitted into evidence.in addition,there was the following oral testimony.
the mother adult daughter testified that she had lived with both the mother and the father for about a year and a half,between the ages of and.during this time,she never saw any inappropriate behavior by the father.
the mother testified that,when the children were detained,she was staying with her uncle,but she denied that she was there to detox.she had used methamphetamine between the ages of and,stopping when she was pregnant with her daughter she had used it again between the ages of and about,stopping when she met the father.
the mother denied using any marijuana since the children were detained.she explained that she had had positive drug tests because it takes up to three months to get out of your system.she was taking prozac and lorazepam for her bipolar disorder.she was under treatment by both a psychiatrist and a general practitioner.
the mother testified that she did not believe the father had been convicted of a sexual offense,because he was not required to register in kentucky.however,she promised to follow any court orders limiting his contact with the children.
the father testified that he and the mother shared custody of the children we worked out an agreement that i would have them three days a week,she would have them four,and at various times that would alter where i would have them four days,she would have them three.
he denied any domestic violence.
he reiterated that his kentucky conviction arose out of the removal of burrs from his girlfriend daughter panties,at the child request.he denied removing her panties or touching her vagina.
according to the father,he had been advised that,under kentucky law,because he was not the girl biological father,he was supposed to be touching her whatsoever.based on that understanding,he pleaded guilty.
the juvenile court sustained the following allegations as to both children 
b the mother failed to protect the child in that her substance abuse issues severely impact her ability to provide for the well being of the child,which places the child at a significant and substantial risk of harm and or neglect.
b the mother has unresolved mental health needs which severely impact her ability to provide for the well being of the child,which places the child at a significant and substantial risk of harm and or neglect.
b the mother failed to protect the child in that she intentionally left the child in the care of the father knowing that he has a history of sexually offending minors sic,history of violent assaultive behavior,history of anger management issues,history of drug deals,all of which place the child at a significant and substantial risk o f harm death.
b the mother engages in acts of domestic violence with the father while in the presence of the child,which places the child at a significant and substantial risk of harm and or abuse.
in addition,it sustained the following allegations solely as to 
b the father failed to protect the child in that his substance abuse issues severely impact his ability to provide for the well being of the child,which places the child at a significant and substantial risk of harm and or neglect.
b the father failed to protect the child in that he engages in acts of domestic violence with the mother while in the presence of the child,which places the child at a significant and substantial risk of harm and or abuse.
the juvenile court therefore found jurisdiction based on failure to protect.welf,subd.b.it formally removed the children from the parents custody.it ordered reunification services for the mother however,it denied reunification services for the father,on two grounds that he had been convicted of a violent felony welf,subd.b and that he was required to register under the adam walsh child protection and safety act of,subd.b.
refusal to allow the mother to substitute retained counsel 
the mother contends that the juvenile court erred by refusing to allow her to substitute privately retained counsel before the hearing.
additional factual and procedural background.
at a pretrial settlement conference,attorney guy bovee appeared and stated that he intended to substitute in for mother and father 
counsel for the department objected that there was a conflict of interest in representing both parents.
the father indicated that he did not believe there was any conflict t he mother and i are both on board as far as the same page.i mean,we both want the same thing.
after a lunch break,bovee argued that he should be allowed to represent both parents because the most that we have at this point is possibly a potential conflict i do think we have an actual conflict at this point.
the trial court asked bovee if he had the parents written consent to any conflict of interest.he answered,i believe i included that in a document that i had signed.it not before the court.
the trial court also asked bovee if he had had a conversation with both parents.he confirmed that he had and that there has been an exchange of confidential information.he added,i could still represent mother provided that father consented to it.
the trial court then ruled that it would not allow bovee to represent the mother.
although the right to be represented by retained counsel in civil actions is not expressly enumerated in the federal or state constitution,our cases have long recognized that the constitutional due process guarantee does embrace such a right.citations.roa lodi medical group,cal d.but the right to representation is not unlimited and must be considered and balanced with any possible detriment to other parties and the efficient administration of justice.citation.forrest department of corporations th,disapproved on unrelated grounds in shalant girardi cal th,fn.
likewise,a criminal defendant who is not indigent has the right to retained counsel.chandler fretag.again,however,this right is not absolute.the right to such counsel must be carefully weighed against other values of substantial importance,such as that seeking to ensure orderly and expeditious judicial administration,with a view toward an accommodation reasonable under the facts of the particular case.citation.people courts cal d.a trial court can override a criminal defendant right to decide how to defend himself if it will result in significant prejudice to the defendant or in a disruption of the orderly processes of justice unreasonable under the circumstances of the particular case.citation.people ortiz cal d.
while we recognize that courts should exercise their power to remove defense counsel with great circumspection citations,they nevertheless retain the obligation to supervise the performance of defense counsel to ensure that adequate representation is provided.citations.thus,a trial judge may remove defense counsel despite the objections of the defendant and his attorney if a serious conflict of interest arises during the trial proceedings resulting in an obviously deficient performance.then the court power and duty to ensure fairness and preserve the credibility of its judgments extends to recusal even when an informed defendant,for whatever reason,is cooperating in counsel tactics.citation.people mckenzie cal d.
we review the trial court ruling for abuse of discretion.see people panah cal th.
rule c of the rules of professional conduct rule c provides 
a member shall not,without the informed written consent of each client 
accept representation of more than one client in a matter in which the interests of the clients potentially conflict or 
accept or continue representation of more than one client in a matter in which the interests of the clients actually conflict 
under california law,the mere consultation with a prospective client may create a disqualifying conflict of interest for a lawyer,especially where confidential information was disclosed.in re tevis cir.the fiduciary relationship existing between lawyer and client extends to preliminary consultations by a prospective client with a view to retention of the lawyer,although actual employment does not result.citation.people ex rel.of corporations speedee oil change systems,cal th.the primary concern is whether and to what extent the attorney acquired confidential information.citation.id.at.an attorney represents a client for purposes of a conflict of interest analysis when the attorney knowingly obtains material confidential information from the client and renders legal advice or services as a result.citations.ibid.
here,bovee conceded that he had obtained confidential information from both parents.moreover,he had agreed to represent both of them,and he even attempted to substitute in for both of them.manifestly,he had already accepted the representation of both parents,in violation of rule c.
moreover,as bovee also all but conceded,there was at least a potential conflict of interest between the parents.there is always a potential conflict between the interests of parents in a dependency case,even though at the outset their interests appear to be congruent.although it is theoretically possible to represent both parents with the informed written consent of both,most practitioners agree that an attorney should never represent both parents.cal.juvenile dependency practice representing parents.thus,i n a dependency case,each parent generally has separate counsel.in re celine cal th.
basically,the mother whole argument is that bovee still could have represented her because the father was willing to waive any conflict.it is not at all clear that the father was willing to do so.he indicated that he wanted bovee to represent both him and the mother.this does not mean,however,that he would have consented to bovee representing just the mother,which would have meant,if necessary,opposing him.
in any event,under rule c,any waiver would have had to be both informed and written.bovee never produced a written waiver.he vaguely suggested that one existed,but he admitted that the document was not before the court.
even assuming a written waiver existed,there was no evidence that it was informed.informed consent would require full disclosures as to the risks of the representation,the potential conflicts involved,and the alternatives available citations.sharp next entertainment th.there was no evidence that such disclosures had been made to the father.
the mother complains that the trial court found that a conflict existed without determining whether father would waive this rather conveniently ignores the applicable burden of proof.once there was prima facie evidence that bovee had accepted a prohibited representation,the burden of showing a waiver fell squarely on the mother.tritek telecom,superior court th,once a party establishes that a privilege applies,the burden shifts to the party opposing the privilege to demonstrate that there was an express or implied waiver.she failed to carry this burden.
we therefore conclude that the trial court did not err by ruling that bovee was disqualified from representing the mother.
jurisdictional findingsa.justiciability.
the mother contends that there was insufficient evidence to support jurisdiction based on either her alleged substance abuse or her alleged failure to protect the children against sexual abuse by the father.
the juvenile court,however,also found jurisdiction based on the mother unresolved mental health needs,failure to protect the children in light of the father history of violent assaultive behavior,history of anger management issues,and history of drug deals,and participation in domestic violence.the mother does not dispute the sufficiency of the evidence to support these findings.minors counsel therefore argues that her contention is not justiciable.capitalization altered.
in general,w hen a dependency petition alleges multiple grounds for its assertion that a minor comes within the dependency court jurisdiction,a reviewing court can affirm the juvenile court finding of jurisdiction over the minor if any one of the statutory bases for jurisdiction that are enumerated in the petition is supported by substantial evidence.in such a case,the reviewing court need not consider whether any or all of the other alleged statutory grounds for jurisdiction are supported by the evidence.citation.in re cal th.
however,there are exceptions to this rule w e generally will exercise our discretion and reach the merits of a challenge to any jurisdictional finding when the finding serves as the basis for dispositional orders that are also challenged on appeal citation could be prejudicial to the appellant or could potentially impact the current or future dependency proceedings citations or could have other consequences for the appellant,beyond jurisdiction citation.in re drake th.
here,the challenged jurisdictional findings did,in fact,serve as the basis for the dispositional orders,which the mother is also challenging.in explaining its dispositional orders,the juvenile court specifically cited the mother continued use of marijuana and her lack of insight with regard to the father sexual offense conviction.similarly,in defending the dispositional order on appeal,the department argues,among other things,that the mother continued use of marijuana and her refusal to believe that the father was a sex offender amounted to evidence of a substantial risk.neither the court nor the department has ever claimed that the other jurisdictional allegations presented any continuing risk requiring removal.
the jurisdictional findings are prima facie evidence the minor can not safely remain in the home.citations.in re th.here,if we were to refuse to consider the sufficiency of the evidence to support jurisdiction based on substance abuse or on failure to protect against sexual abuse,we would still have to consider the sufficiency of the evidence to support removal on these grounds.accordingly,the mother challenge is justiciable in this case.
under welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b,the juvenile court has jurisdiction based on failure to protect when the child has suffered,or there is a substantial risk that the child will suffer,serious physical harm or illness,as a result of the failure or inability of his or her parent or guardian to adequately supervise or protect the child,or the willful or negligent failure of the child parent or guardian to adequately supervise or protect the child from the conduct of the custodian with whom the child has been left,or by the willful or negligent failure of the parent or guardian to provide the child with adequate food,clothing,shelter,or medical treatment,or by the inability of the parent or guardian to provide regular care for the child due to the parent or guardian mental illness,developmental disability,or substance abuse.the child shall continue to be a dependent child pursuant to this subdivision only so long as is necessary to protect the child from risk of suffering serious physical harm or illness.italics added.
s ection does not require that a child actually be abused or neglected before the juvenile court can assume jurisdiction.the subdivisions at issue here require only a substantial risk that the child will be abused or neglected.the legislatively declared purpose of these provisions is to provide maximum safety and protection for children who are currently being physically,sexually,or emotionally abused,being neglected,or being exploited,and to ensure the safety,protection,and physical and emotional of children who are at risk of that harm.citation.the court need not wait until a child is seriously abused or injured to assume jurisdiction and take the steps necessary to protect the child.citation.in re,supra,cal th at.
the basic question under section is whether circumstances at the time of the hearing subject the minor to the defined risk of harm.citation.in re marquis th,italics added.nevertheless,i n determining whether the child is in present need of the juvenile court protection,the court may consider past events.citation.in re petra d.a parent past conduct is a good predictor of future behavior.citation.in re,supra,th at.
in reviewing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jurisdictional findings and disposition,we determine if substantial evidence,contradicted or uncontradicted,supports them.in making this determination,we draw all reasonable inferences from the evidence to support the findings and orders of the dependency court we review the record in the light most favorable to the court determinations and we note that issues of fact and credibility are the province of the trial court.citation.we do not reweigh the evidence or exercise independent judgment,but merely determine if there are sufficient facts to support the findings of the trial court.citations.citation.in re,supra,cal th at.
jurisdiction based on the mother substance abuse.
there was ample evidence that the mother had a habit of marijuana use.she admitted that she had used marijuana since she was she also admitted that she was using it when the dependency was filed.according to the father,she left the children with him so she could detox.her very first drug test was positive for marijuana.
the mother argues that there was no evidence that her marijuana use placed the children at risk.however,in cases involving children of such tender years that the absence of adequate supervision and care poses an inherent risk to their physical health and safety,a finding of substance abuse is prima facie evidence of the inability of a parent or guardian to provide regular care resulting in a substantial risk of physical harm.in re drake,supra,th at.here,both children were of tender years toddlers,not yet in school,who required constant care and attention.
the mother also argues that her marijuana use did not constitute substance abuse.she relies on drake,which held that a finding of substance abuse for purposes of section,subdivision b,must be based on evidence sufficient to show that the parent or guardian at issue had been diagnosed as having a current substance abuse problem by a medical professional or establish that the parent or guardian at issue has a current substance abuse problem as defined in the dsm iv tr.the full definition of substance abuse found in the dsm iv tr describes the condition as a maladaptive pattern of substance use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress,as manifested by one or more of the following,occurring within a month period recurrent substance use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work,school,or home,repeated absences or poor work performance related to substance use absences,suspensions,or expulsions from school neglect of children or household recurrent substance use in situations in which it is physically hazardous,driving an automobile or operating a machine when impaired by substance use recurrent legal problems,arrests for disorderly conduct and continued substance use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of the substance,arguments with spouse about consequences of intoxication,physical fights.citation.in re drake,supra,th at.
we may assume,without deciding,that drake is good law on this point.even if so,there was substantial evidence that the mother conduct fell within drake definition of substance abuse,in that her recurrent substance use result ed in a failure to fulfill major role obligations according to the father,when the dependency was filed,the mother had left the children with him so she could detox.the mother argues that there was no evidence to support the father claim,but there did not have to be.t he testimony of a single witness is sufficient to uphold a judgment.citation.in re lana th.
the mother argues that her positive test results were not substantial evidence that she was actually using marijuana during the dependency.she cites her own testimony that marijuana can remain in the body for up to three months.however,the juvenile court was not required to believe this in the absence of any expert testimony,it was a reasonable inference that a positive drug test indicated recent drug use.
indeed,the juvenile court specifically found that the mother testimony on this point was not credible a lthough there was no testing about that,i think the court can glean from reasonable inferences and common sense as well that she is a slender woman,and i do find it credible that it will take three months to get it out of her system.
the mother calls this reasoning speculation,and complains that it finds no support in the record.the juvenile court judge,however,evidently knew that thc metabolites are,so that detection time can be affected by body weight.cary,the marijuana detection window,drug court,available at,as of.even jurors are entitled to use their experience in evaluating and interpreting th e evidence.people steele cal th,see also people yeoman cal th,jurors did not commit misconduct by relying on personal experiences related to drugs t he effect of drugs,while certainly a proper subject of expert testimony,has become a subject of common knowledge among laypersons.jurors views of the evidence are necessarily informed by their life experiences,including their education and professional work.in re malone cal th.a fortiori,a judge,when acting as trier of fact,can rely on his or her general knowledge.
we therefore conclude that the finding of jurisdiction based on the mother substance abuse was supported by substantial evidence.
jurisdiction based on the mother failure to protect against sexual abuse by the father.
the mother mounts a attack on the finding of jurisdiction based on failure to protect against sexual abuse.first,she argues that there was insufficient evidence that the father actually committed a sexual offense.second,she argues that the commission of the sexual offense was insufficient evidence of a current substantial risk of physical harm.
the father guilty plea constituted an admission that he was guilty as charged.people howard cal th,see also oiye fox th.although it was hearsay,hearsay in a social worker report is both admissible and competent evidence on which to base a finding of jurisdiction pursuant to section.in re malinda cal d.moreover,it was admissible against both parents,even under standard hearsay principles,as a prior inconsistent statement,see also people hawthorne cal th,fn.prior inconsistent statements are admissible to prove their substance as well as to impeach the declarant.finally,in closing argument,the father counsel conceded that a sexual offense occurred as found by the kentucky court thus,there was substantial evidence that the father did actually commit a sexual offense against a minor.
we do agree with the mother,however,that the commission of this sexual offense was insufficient evidence of current risk,for several reasons.
first,the victim was female,whereas and are male.recently,in in re,supra,cal th,the california supreme court held that a father severe and prolonged sexual abuse of his own female child showed a substantial risk that he would sexually abuse her male siblings,so as to support jurisdiction based on abuse of a sibling under welfare and institutions code section,subdivision j.in re,supra,at.in the course of doing so,however,it noted the breadth of this particular subdivision the provision accords the trial court greater latitude to exercise jurisdiction as to a child whose sibling has been found to have been abused than the court would have in the absence of that circumstance.citation.id.at.it stated,the more severe the type of sibling abuse,the lower the required probability of the child experiencing such abuse to conclude the child is at a substantial risk of abuse or neglect under section.if the sibling abuse is relatively minor,the court might reasonably find insubstantial a risk the child will be similarly abused but as the abuse becomes more serious,it becomes more necessary to protect the child from even a relatively low probability of that abuse.id.at.also relevant to the totality of the circumstances surrounding the sibling abuse is the violation of trust shown by sexually abusing one child while the other children were living in the same home and could easily have learned of or even interrupted the abuse.id.at.it cautioned,w e are not holding that the juvenile court is compelled,as a matter of law,to assume jurisdiction over all the children whenever one child is sexually abused.id.at.it concluded,the serious and prolonged nature of father sexual abuse of his daughter under these circumstances supports the juvenile court finding that the risk of abuse was substantial as to all the children.id.at.
the facts on which the supreme court relied in finding substantial evidence of risk in are conspicuously absent here.first,and most obviously,the victim in was a sibling.thus,there was evidence that that father would molest his own children moreover,as the court noted,the molestation occurred in the home in which the other children were living and thus constituted a violation of trust as to them,as well as to the victim.that was not the case here.
in addition,here,the father sexual offense,although vile,was not serious,severe,or prolonged,when compared to other child sexual offenses.we may accept the statement of facts in the kentucky criminal complaint.the father argues that it was hearsay and unauthenticated.the mother argues that it is not supported by any witness statement s,and therefore it is not evidence it is merely an allegation.however,neither parent objected to it below i t is settled law that incompetent testimony,such as hearsay or conclusion,if received without objection takes on the attributes of competent proof when considered upon the question of sufficiency of the evidence to support a finding.citations.citation.in re th.this evidence,however,showed a event.no threats,force,or violence was involved.the father used a finger,not his penis.there was no evidence of penetration,only that his finger was in her vaginal area.
the sexual offense was remote it had occurred almost years before the children were removed.there was no evidence that the father had committed any other sexual offenses in the meantime.to the contrary,there was affirmative evidence that he had not molested the mother older daughter when she lived with him.was questioned,and he denied any molestation.
finally,it is significant that this case involves not subdivision j,but subdivision b of welfare and institutions code section.subdivision j can be satisfied by substantial risks of several kinds,including a substantial risk of sexual abuse.by contrast,subdivision b specifically requires a substantial risk of serious physical harm or illness the father sexual offense did not involve any risk of physical harm to the victim in that case.a fortiori,it afforded no evidence of a risk of physical harm to or 
for the sake of completeness,we consider the effect of welfare and institutions code section,subdivision d.that subdivision provides where the court finds that a parent has been previously convicted of an act in another state that would constitute sexual abuse as defined in section of the penal code if committed in this state,that finding shall be prima facie evidence in any proceeding that the subject minor is a person described by subdivision a,b,c,or d of section and is at substantial risk of abuse or neglect.the prima facie evidence constitutes a presumption affecting the burden of producing evidence.
sexual abuse,as defined in penal code section,includes t he intentional touching of the genitals or intimate parts including the breasts,genital area,groin,inner thighs,and buttocks of a child for purposes of sexual arousal or gratification,subd.a.thus,the presumption in welfare and institutions code section,subdivision d did apply here.
the presumption,however,is what has been called an exploding presumption,rossetto pabst brewing,cir,it only survives until there is rebuttal evidence submitted.in re esmeralda th.here,the parents did introduce rebuttal evidence.hence,the presumption has no effect.
we therefore conclude that the finding of jurisdiction based on the mother failure to protect against sexual abuse by the father was not supported by substantial evidence.
dispositional findings 
both parents contend that there was insufficient evidence to support the removal of the children from their custody.
before the court may order a child physically removed from his or her parent custody,it must find,by clear and convincing evidence,the child would be at substantial risk of harm if returned home and there are no reasonable means by which the child can be protected without removal.citations.the jurisdictional findings are prima facie evidence the minor can not safely remain in the home.citations.the parent need not be dangerous and the minor need not have been actually harmed before removal is appropriate.the focus of the statute is on averting harm to the child.citation.in re,supra,th at.
we review the court dispositional findings for substantial evidence.citations.in re,supra,th at.both parents stress the fact that the burden of proof in the lower court is clear and convincing evidence.but t he clear and convincing standard is for the edification and guidance of the juvenile court.it is not a standard for appellate review.citation.the sufficiency of evidence to establish a given fact,where the law requires proof of the fact to be clear and convincing,is primarily a question for the trial court to determine,and if there is substantial evidence to support its conclusion,the determination is not open to review on appeal.citations.citation.thus,on appeal from a judgment required to be based upon clear and convincing evidence,the clear and convincing test disappears and the usual rule of conflicting evidence is applied,giving full effect to the respondent evidence,however slight,and disregarding the appellant evidence,however strong.citation.citation.in re th.
removal from the mother based on substance abuse.
we disregard the jurisdictional finding based on the mother failure to protect against sexual abuse as we have already held see part,ante,it was not supported by substantial evidence.however,this leaves jurisdictional findings based on the mother substance abuse,unresolved mental health needs,domestic violence,and failure to protect against the father history of violent assaultive behavior,history of anger management issues,history of drug deals 
we can sustain the removal from the mother based on her substance abuse alone.she argues that she was not still using marijuana at the time of the dispositional hearing.as already discussed,however,her positive drug tests were substantial evidence that she was still using marijuana.admittedly,her last positive test was in late april she did not have any positive tests in may,and the dispositional hearing was in early june.the juvenile court,however,could reasonably conclude that a single month of abstinence was insufficient to eliminate the risk to the children.r elapses are all too common for a recovering drug user.it is the nature of addiction that one must be clean for a long period to show real reform.citation.in re cliffton th.
the mother argues that ongoing drug testing constituted a reasonable means of protecting the children.however,there was evidence that she was continuing to use drugs despite.also,there was evidence that she was noncompliant with reunification services.she was supposed to start parenting classes,but she had not done so in the social worker opinion,she had the attitude that the kids are wrongly detained.they are going to go back to her so she is not going to start these things.thus,the juvenile court could reasonably find that there were no reasonable means of protecting the children short of removal.
removal from both parents based on domestic violence.
domestic violence afforded cause to remove the children from both parents.the mother admitted incidents of mutual domestic violence going back to.the mother argues that it was no longer a concern,because she was not living with the father.however,she admitted that the most recent incident was in december,when they were already not living together.meanwhile,in the social worker opinion,the mother was dependent on the father.there was still a relationship between them they had various needs for each other.thus,again,the juvenile court could reasonably find that removal was necessary.
the father relies on in re basilio th,which held that two incidents of domestic violence between the parents afforded insufficient evidence to support removal,because neither incident directly affected either minor physically id.at.
the law,however,has changed significantly since basilio was decided.at that time,the relevant subdivision of welfare and institutions code section allowed removal only if there was a substantial danger to the physical health of the minor welf,former,subd.b,stats,ch.since then,however,the subdivision has been amended stats,ch,stats,ch,so that it now allows removal if there is a substantial danger to the physical health,safety,protection,or physical or emotional of the minor welf,subd.c,italics added.ongoing domestic violence,committed by both parents,in the presence of the children,from through,is substantial evidence of a substantial danger to the children emotional,if not their physical.
the father right,as a nonoffending parent,to custody of 
as mentioned earlier,the petition regarding did not include any allegations as to the father.the father therefore argues that,with respect to,he was a nonoffending parent and,as such,entitled to custody under welfare and institutions code section.
welfare and institutions code section,subdivision a,provides when a court orders removal of a child,the court shall first determine whether there is a parent of the child,with whom the child was not residing at the time that the events or conditions arose that brought the child within the provisions of section,who desires to assume custody of the child.if that parent requests custody,the court shall place the child with the parent unless it finds that placement with that parent would be detrimental to the safety,protection,or physical or emotional of the child.
preliminarily,the father forfeited this contention by failing to raise it below.failure to object to noncompliance with section in the lower court results in forfeiture.citation.in re th,fourth,div.two accord,in re john th,contra,in re abram th,in re th.the father trial counsel never argued that the father was entitled to custody,under welfare and institutions code section or otherwise she merely argued that he was entitled to reunification services.
separately and alternatively,the juvenile court could and did find that was residing with the father,which would mean that welfare and institutions code section,subdivision a did not apply.in re,supra,th at the parent must be both nonoffending and noncustodial in order to be entitled for consideration under section.the father testified that he and the mother shared custody of the children,who lived with him three or four days a week.in closing argument,the father counsel affirmatively asserted that there was an informal split custody arrangement.the juvenile court specifically found that c ontinuance in the father home would be detrimental.
finally and again,separately and alternatively the claimed error was harmless.as noted,the juvenile court found that continuance in the father home would be detrimental.however,it also specifically found that placement with the parent would be detrimental this can not be construed as limited to the man who was the alleged father of,because the juvenile court also made the same finding with respect to rather,it appears that,in light of the uncertainty in the record as to where the children were residing,the juvenile court hedged its bets by making alternative findings.in any event,given its finding that should be removed from the father custody,the juvenile court necessarily would also have found that it was detrimental to place with the father.
the denial of reunification services to the father 
the father contends that the juvenile court reasons for denying him reunification services were not supported by substantial evidence.
as discussed,the father had been convicted of second degree sexual abuse under kentucky law.although this was a misdemeanor,it was equivalent to the california felony of a lewd and lascivious act with a child under,subd.a.
under welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b subdivision b,a parent is not entitled to reunification services when the court finds,by clear and convincing evidence,t hat the parent has been convicted of a violent felony,as defined in subdivision c of section of the penal code.
penal code section provides enhancements for prior prison terms.if the defendant is convicted of a violent felony,and if the defendant served a prior prison term for a violent felony,it provides subject to exceptions not relevant here for a enhancement,subd.a.if either the current offense or the prior offense was not a violent felony,it provides for a enhancement,subd.b.
accordingly,penal code section,subdivision c subdivision c defines violent felony.that definition includes a l ewd or lascivious act as defined in subdivision a or b of section,subd.c.
penal code section,subdivision f subdivision f,however,also provides,a prior conviction of a particular felony shall include a conviction in another jurisdiction for an offense which includes all of the elements of the particular felony as defined under california law if the defendant served one year or more in prison for the offense in the other jurisdiction.italics added.
the father therefore argues that a foreign prior is not a violent felony within the meaning of subdivision b unless the parent served a year or more in prison on the conviction.in his case,the kentucky offense was a misdemeanor,former,subd,and he served only days in jail.
however,while subdivision b specifically refers to and borrows subdivision c,it does not mention subdivision f.and this makes sense.for purposes of a prior prison term enhancement,what matters is the actual service of a felony term.by contrast,for purposes of the denial of reunification services,what matters is the underlying criminal conduct the punishment imposed is irrelevant.significantly,other statutes that are similarly triggered by particular california felonies are also triggered by any foreign crime that has the same elements,without regard to the punishment imposed,subd.d,subd.b,subd.e,subd.d,subd.c.
it could be argued that,if subdivision b borrows only subdivision c and not subdivision f,then it does not apply to foreign convictions at all.for the following reasons,however,we conclude that subdivision c,all by itself,includes both california and foreign convictions.
in defining violent felonies,subdivision c takes a mix of different approaches.in some instances,it simply specifies a felony.for example,subdivision c lists m urder or voluntary manslaughter subdivision c lists a ny robbery.presumably these would include both and foreign convictions.people perry d,defining petty theft with a prior,applies where prior theft conviction was.
in other instances,it specifies a felony as defined in a certain penal code section.for example,in this case,we are dealing with subdivision c,which lists a l ewd or lascivious act as defined in subdivision a or b of section.although the question is more subtle,this appears to include both and foreign convictions a lewd act committed is still a lewd act as defined by california law,even though not punishable under california law.
in still other instances,however,subdivision c specifies a felony in violation of a certain penal code section.for example,subdivision c lists a rson,in violation of subdivision a or b of section subdivision c lists c ontinuous sexual abuse of a child,in violation of section.this is ambiguous.it could be strictly construed to require that the prior must have been committed within california territorial jurisdiction see,et,so as to violate the cited statute.alternatively,however,it could be more broadly construed to require that the conduct underlying the prior would have violated the cited statute,if committed in california.
it would be absurd to suppose that the legislature intended these minor differences in wording to make a substantive difference with regard to the effect of a foreign prior.it must be remembered that subdivision c,when originally drafted,did not need to be very precise in specifying its territorial reach,because subdivision f went on to provide that a prior conviction of a particular felony shall include a conviction in another jurisdiction f
