welfare and institutions code section provides for extended detention of a ward of the california youth authority cya,by way of a civil commitment extending beyond the date of his cya discharge.at the time of the proceedings below,the statute authorized such a commitment if the ward would be physically dangerous to the public because of his mental or physical deficiency,disorder,or abnormality the juvenile court ordered such an extended detention of defendant,lemanuel defendant contends that welfare and institutions code section is unconstitutional,that there was insufficient evidence to support the extended detention,and that other errors infected the proceedings.
we disagree with defendant various contentions and affirm.in the published portion of this opinion,we hold that welfare and institutions code section does not violate due process under the leading cases defining the findings necessary for constitutionally valid civil commitments.
procedural background facts 
we must set forth in some detail the procedural background of this case.with regard to factual determinations of the juvenile court from the evidence before it,we adhere to the applicable standards of appellate review.we must view the facts in the light most favorable to the juvenile court determinations,and presume in support of those determinations the existence of every fact which the juvenile court could reasonably find from the evidence.see people barnes cal d,barnes people neufer th,d neufer.
procedural background 
in april of,the juvenile court sustained an allegation that defendant,then,committed sodomy on a person under,a felony,subd.b.defendant admitted that he had sodomized his cousin.
in march of,the court sustained an allegation that defendant made a false crime report,a misdemeanor,subd.a.in april of,after defendant committed a probation violation,the court committed him to cya for a maximum term of three years two months.we affirmed the cya commitment.in re lemanuel,nonpub.opn.
on march,the people filed an amended petition for extended detention of a dangerous person,pursuant to welfare and institutions code section using the language of the statute as it then read,the petition alleged that defendant,if discharged from cya,would be physically dangerous to the public because of his mental deficiency,disorder,or abnormality the petition was supported by a letter from the youthful offender parole board,which indicated that defendant had been diagnosed with several mental disorders and was clearly behaviorally disturbed.
on april,the juvenile court found probable cause to extend defendant detention,and set the matter for jury trial on the petition.on september,a jury sustained the allegations of the section petition.the juvenile court imposed an extended civil commitment of two years.
we affirmed the commitment extension.in re lemanuel june,nonpub.opn.we noted that defendant family background was dysfunctional and included physical abuse,violence,sexual abuse,mental illness,incarceration and drug addiction,supra,at.we further noted that defendant had been sexually molested by family members when he was eight years old,and had himself engaged in sexually inappropriate behavior from an early age,supra,at.defendant had been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder,mixed receptive language disorder,and conduct disorder involving violence towards others,fire setting and other behaviors,supra,at.
on may,the people filed another section petition to further extend the civil commitment.again,using the language of the statute,the petition alleged that defendant,if discharged from cya,would be physically dangerous to the public because of his mental deficiency,disorder,or abnormality 
the new section petition was supported by a letter from the director of cya,setting forth the numerous diagnoses of defendant made by an examining psychiatrist,herbert leiderman.the diagnoses included reactive attachment disorder of early,conduct disorder,and pedophilia.the director recommended an additional extension to allow defendant time to complete the necessary psychiatric treatment 
on may,the juvenile court appointed deputy public defender pamela boskin to represent defendant a probable cause hearing on the petition was set for june.on that date,the hearing was continued to june at boskin request.boskin had just met defendant and needed more documents,and thus was not fully prepared 
on june the probable cause hearing was continued to july.on that date,the hearing was continued to july,again at boskin request.
on july,leiderman failed to appear for the probable cause hearing.the court dismissed the section petition without prejudice to refiling.
the people refiled the section petition on august.the petition made the same allegations as its predecessor and was supported by the same cya letter.
on august,boskin filed a motion to dismiss the refiled petition,arguing that defendant due process rights were violated by the extended delay in initiating the section proceedings.
on august,the juvenile court held a probable cause hearing on the new petition.at the outset of that hearing,the court agreed to postpone ruling on the motion to dismiss to give the people time to file opposition.
leiderman testified at the probable cause hearing.the juvenile court found probable cause that if defendant was discharged from cya he would be physically dangerous to the public because of a mental disorder,multiple disorders or abnormality within the meaning of section.the court continued the matter to september for trial setting.
the people filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss on august.on september,the juvenile court heard argument on the motion and set a trial date of september.
on september,the court denied the motion to dismiss,ruling that there have been sufficient grounds for the stating that this is a relatively close question.the court continued the matter to september for a readiness conference.on that date the court set trial for december.
on december the court continued trial to january,
on january,defendant filed a motion to dismiss the refiled petition.relying on kansas hendricks,d hendricks and kansas crane,d crane,defendant argued that section violated due process because it did not require proof that a committed person mental disorder causes a lack of control which renders a person a physical danger to others.defendant also argued the statute violated equal protection because it made it easier to civilly commit a juvenile offender than an adult offender committed as a sexually violent predator svp or a mentally disordered offender mdo.
the people opposed the motion to dismiss.the matter went to trial before the court ruled on the motion.
b.the trial on the section petition 
on january,defendant waived his right to a jury trial on the petition.the matter was tried to the court,with the testimony of cya psychologist marcia asgarian and with a stipulation that the court could rely on the transcript of leiderman testimony from the probable cause hearing.
asgarian worked with defendant in a cya group home from the late fall of until may.the program was designed to help the rehabilitation of sex offenders its primary emphasis was on group psychotherapy.defendant was initially motivated and participated in therapy for eight months.he discussed his original sodomy offense and his victim with asgarian.
but after eight months defendant stopped participating,and would shut down in group counseling or not come to the sessions at all.in november,defendant confronted another group member about that member lack of treatment,and told the member that would reoffend if he did receive appropriate treatment.
asgarian opined that during the treatment period from the late fall of to may,defendant did not make significant progress in his treatment.he started off good,but then he deteriorated and refused to participate.he made several derogatory comments about being in cya,and not wanting to be there.
leiderman was a professor of psychiatry at stanford medical school with an from harvard.he had done consulting work for cya for years.he had conducted to evaluations under section.he conducted such an evaluation of defendant in january.defendant did not consider himself a sex offender.he had a documented history of inappropriate sexual activity,but incorrectly regarded most of it as consensual.
leiderman concluded that defendant suffered from reactive attachment disorder,meaning he has difficulty in forming social relationships and sees individuals as objects rather than as sentient human beings.leiderman agreed that because of this mental disorder,defendant would be unable to control his behavior without treatment and thus be a danger to the community.
on,leiderman testified that defendant also suffered from pedophilia,and was attracted to individuals who are mentally weaker,less able to defend themselves than himself,and he especially attracted to that because he more comfortable.leiderman believed defendant was an adventitious predator in many ways.the doctor also believed defendant suffered from a conduct disorder 
at the conclusion of trial,the court continued the matter to january for closing arguments and a ruling on the motion to dismiss.
on january,the juvenile court denied the motion to dismiss.indicating its familiarity with hendricks and crane,the court found section constitutional.
the court then granted the petition i do find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant will be a physical danger to the public by virtue of a mental deficiency,disorder,or abnormality,and although i do believe the statute requires it,i would also find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant has a serious difficulty in controlling his behavior within the meaning of crane 
the court imposed an extended civil commitment for an additional two years.
ii.discussion 
defendant contends that section is unconstitutional because it violates his right to due process of law.he makes two other constitutional challenges to the statute he argues that it violates equal protection,and that it is impermissibly penal rather than civil.he then contends the evidence is insufficient.finally,he argues that three other errors infected the proceedings.
due process 
defendant correctly observes that at the time of the proceedings below,an extended detention under section required only a finding that,as the text of the statute sets forth,a person would be physically dangerous to the public because of his mental deficiency,disorder,or abnormality we will call this finding,mental disorder dangerousness,finding.
defendant argues the statute violates due process because it must explicitly require two additional findings what we will call finding,that the mental deficiency,disorder,or abnormality causes the person to have serious difficulty in controlling his dangerous behavior and what we will call finding,that this inability to control behavior results in a serious and risk that the person will reoffend.
we disagree.due process requires finding and finding,but not finding.finding is set forth in the text of the statute and was made in this case.finding has been read into section by our supreme court in re howard cal th,d,howard and that finding was made by the court below.finding is not a separate finding at all,but is subsumed under,or is an alternative way of expressing,the finding of dangerousness.finding defines or elaborates on the meaning of dangerousness to the public,but is not a separate element that must be found.that finding is necessarily included in finding,a mental disorder resulting in physical dangerousness.thus,the juvenile court made the necessary two findings.accordingly,we see no due process violation.
in howard,the supreme court reviewed a court of appeal ruling that finding,mental disorder dangerousness,was insufficient to support a civil thus section,that on its face required only finding,violated due process.howard,supra,cal th at,d.the issue in howard was whether section was unconstitutional because it did not expressly require finding,whether the person mental disorder causes serious difficulty in controlling his dangerous behavior.howard,supra,at,d.
to resolve this issue,the supreme court analyzed the two seminal decisions of the united states supreme court involving civil commitments of svp hendricks and crane.it also analyzed two of its own decisions under the california svp law et in which the california supreme court had applied and interpreted hendricks and superior court cal th,d,hubbart and people williams cal th,d,williams.it is settled that the constitutional principles of these state and federal svp cases apply equally to all civil commitment schemes,including section citation.in re michael th,d michael see howard,supra,cal th at,d.
hendricks,decided in,established that due process requires more than a finding of dangerousness,standing alone for an involuntary civil commitment.hendricks,supra,at.the court noted that it had sustained civil commitment statutes when they have coupled proof of dangerousness with the proof of some additional factor,such as mental illness or mental abnormality.citations.ibid.
hendricks upheld the kansas svp law because it required a showing of not only dangerousness,but also of a mental disorder linked to a difficulty of controlling dangerous behavior.hendricks,supra,at.see howard,supra,cal th at,d.the civil commitment law thus satisfied due process because hendricks admitted lack of volitional control,coupled with a prediction of future dangerousness,adequately distinguishes hendricks from other dangerous persons who are perhaps more properly dealt with exclusively through criminal proceedings.hendricks,supra,at.
in hubbart,decided in,the california supreme court upheld the california svp law.that law allows for a civil commitment of a sex offender if certain conditions are met,including that the person has a diagnosed mental disorder that makes the person a danger to the health and safety of others in that it is likely that he or she will engage in sexually violent criminal behavior,subd.a.a d iagnosed mental disorder includes a congenital or acquired condition affecting the emotional or volitional capacity that predisposes the person to the commission of criminal sexual acts in a degree constituting the person a menace to the health and safety of others,subd.c.howard,supra,cal th at,d.
hubbart relied on hendricks to uphold the law against a due process challenge.the court reasoned that the california svp law required a finding of a mental disorder resulting in,finding and that the svp law linked that finding to a finding that the mental disorder caused the inability to control dangerous sexual behavior,finding.hubbart,supra,cal th at,d,see howard,supra,cal th at,d.the california svp law establishes the requisite connection between impaired volitional control and the danger posed to the public.hubbart,supra,at,d.
in crane,decided in,the united states supreme court revisited the kansas svp law and held that due process does not require a total lack of volitional control it is enough to say that there must be proof of serious difficulty in controlling behavior.crane,supra,at.this difficulty of volitional control,when viewed in light of such features of the case as the nature of the psychiatric diagnosis,and the severity of the mental abnormality itself,must be sufficient to distinguish the dangerous sexual offender whose serious mental illness,abnormality,or disorder subjects him to civil commitment from the dangerous but typical recidivist convicted in an ordinary criminal case.citations.ibid.
in williams,decided in,the california supreme court interpreted crane as,in essence,requiring both finding and finding in crane the united states supreme court held that the safeguards of personal liberty embodied in the due process guaranty of the federal constitution prohibit the involuntary confinement of persons on the basis that they are dangerously disordered without proof that they have serious difficulty in controlling their dangerous behavior.citation.williams,supra,cal th at,d,italics added see id.at,d,howard,supra,cal th at,d.the two italicized phrases constitute finding and finding,respectively.elsewhere,williams noted that under hendricks and crane a constitutional civil commitment scheme must link future da
