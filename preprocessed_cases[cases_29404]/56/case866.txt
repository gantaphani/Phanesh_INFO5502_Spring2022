juvenile delinquency laws permit a juvenile court to retain jurisdiction over a ward until he or she reaches the age of or,in some circumstances,the age of.welf,subds.a b further section references are to the welfare and institutions code.
charles appellant,still a ward of the juvenile court at the age of based upon his delinquent conduct,violated terms of his probation.probation was reinstated on the condition that he serve a period of confinement.on appeal,he contends that the juvenile court lacked authority to detain him in an adult facility pending the hearing on whether he violated probation,and after finding that he did violate terms of his probation,the court lacked authority to sanction him with further confinement in the adult facility.
although the appeal is now moot because appellant has served his term of confinement and his probation has been terminated,he asks us to rule on the merits because the issues are of continuing public concern and are likely to recur.see in re christina th,d.for guidance of the juvenile court,we shall address the merits of appellant claims of error and then dismiss the appeal as moot.see daly superior court cal d,people west coast shows,d.
we conclude that when a ward of the juvenile court who is years of age or older violates probation,the juvenile delinquency laws allow the ward to be detained in,and ultimately confined in,an adult detention facility as punishment for the violation of probation.as we will explain,when the juvenile court has retained jurisdiction over a ward who is or older and who is alleged to have violated terms of his or her probation,the ward may not be directly detained in a local adult detention facility pending the probation revocation hearing.and if found to have violated probation,the ward may not be directly committed to a period of confinement in the adult facility.however,section authorizes the juvenile court to order the ward detained in a juvenile facility and then,upon recommendation of the probation officer,delivered to a local adult detention facility until the probation revocation hearing.likewise,if the ward is found to have violated probation,sections and authorize the court to order the ward to be confined in a juvenile facility and then,upon recommendation of the probation officer,immediately delivered to a local adult facility to serve the period of confinement.in reaching these conclusions,we disagree in part with the holding in in re kenny th,d.
factual and procedural background 
at the age of,appellant admitted committing vandalism and battery.he was adjudged a ward of the juvenile court and was placed on probation.over the next five years,appellant repeatedly violated the terms of his probation by committing new crimes,by failing to keep in contact with his probation officer,and by testing positive for drugs.each time,he was continued on probation and various placements were tried.
when appellant was years old and still on probation,his probation officer filed a pleading alleging that appellant violated terms of his probation by testing positive for methamphetamine and marijuana,and by failing to keep in contact with the probation officer.appellant was taken into custody and,because he was over the age of,the probation department obtained a juvenile court order placing him in the lassen county adult facility county jail pending the detention hearing.at the detention hearing,the juvenile court found a prima facie showing was made that appellant had violated his probation.the court further found that returning appellant to his home pending the probation violation hearing would be contrary to his welfare.hence,the court ordered the detention to continue in the county jail.
appellant ultimately admitted the two allegations that he had violated terms of his probation.finding appellant should not be rewarded for his misconduct by simply having jurisdiction terminated due to his age,the court continued him as a ward and ordered him to serve a period of confinement in an authorized facility,with the understanding that,once the time was served,jurisdiction over appellant would be terminated.
discussion 
appellant contends that the juvenile court had no authority to grant the probation department motion to detain him in a local adult facility and that,after finding appellant violated probation,the court exceeded its jurisdiction by imposing a period of confinement with the understanding that he would serve his time in a local adult facility.we disagree.
when a minor is found to be a ward of the juvenile court,the court may retain jurisdiction over the person until he or she turns years old,subd.a,or years old if the person has been committed to the california youth authority for a crime listed in subdivision b,paragraph of subdivision d,or subdivision e of section,subd.b.
consequently,as we will explain,if a ward is placed on probation and then violates its terms after the ward turns,the juvenile court may have jurisdiction to detain the ward and to impose an appropriate sanction,including punishment in the form of confinement.here,appellant was still a ward of the court at the age of when he was detained and then committed for a period of confinement for violating the terms of his probation.
the authority to detain the appellant in a local adult detention facility derives from section,which states notwithstanding any other provision of law,in any case in which a minor who is detained in or committed to a county institution established for the purpose of housing juveniles attains the age of prior to or during the period of detention or confinement he or she may be allowed to come or remain in contact with those juveniles until the age of,at which time he or she,upon the recommendation of the probation officer,shall be delivered to the custody of the sheriff for the remainder of the time he or she remains in custody,unless the juvenile court orders continued detention in a juvenile facility.the person shall be advised of his or her ability to petition the court for continued detention in a juvenile facility at the time of his or her attainment of the age of.notwithstanding any other provision of law,the sheriff may allow such a person to come into and remain in contact with other adults in the county jail or in any other county correctional facility in which he or she is housed.italics added shall is mandatory and may is permissive see also.
the authority to punish appellant for violating terms of his probation derives from section,which states in pertinent part that m inors under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court as a consequence of delinquent conduct may receive punishment that is consistent with the rehabilitative objectives of this chapter,subd.b.as used in subdivision b,punishment means the imposition of sanctions permissible sanctions may include the following payment of a fine by the minor.rendering of compulsory service without compensation performed for the benefit of the community by the minor.limitations on the minor liberty imposed as a condition of probation or parole.commitment of the minor to a local detention or treatment facility,such as a juvenile hall,camp,or ranch.commitment of the minor to the department of the youth authority.punishment,for the purposes of this chapter,does not include retribution,subd.e.
although these statutes refer only to a minor or m inors,the application of rules of statutory construction leads to the conclusion that sections and apply to a person who was declared a ward of the juvenile court while a minor,who became an adult upon turning,but remained under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court,subds.a b,and who violated juvenile court probation after becoming an adult.
