jodie smook filed this action pursuant to,individually and behalf of all other persons similarly situated,alleging,among other things,that the policy of the minnehaha,south dakota,county juvenile detention center jdc to strip search minors without probable cause was unconstitutional.the complaint sought damages and injunctive relief.after granting smook motion for class certification,the district court denied the defendants motions for summary judgment on the search claims,and granted the plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment on those claims.defendants jim banbury and todd cheever,directors of the jdc,appeal the district court denial of qualified immunity,and minnehaha county also appeals the court denial of its motion for summary judgment.we reverse and remand.
smook complaint alleged that on august,when she was years old,she and three minor friends were arrested by the sioux falls city police department after for violating local curfew laws.all four juveniles were transported to the jdc.smook alleged that as part of the admission process at the detention center,she and each of her friends were taken into a bathroom and strip searched by jdc personnel.complaint,doc,at.in her complaint,smook asserted that the institution search policy or practice was a violation of her right against unreasonable search and seizure under the fourth and fourteenth amendments.
the district court certified two classes of plaintiffs who 
when they were under the age of eighteen years,were charged with minor offenses from november,to a date to be set by the court or were charged with offenses from april,to a date to be set by the court,and were,pursuant to jdc policy,strip searched at the minnehaha county juvenile detention center.
doc.one class was defined as individuals in this category seeking injunctive relief the other encompassed individuals seeking compensatory and punitive damages.the court further defined minor offenses to include petty theft,liquor violations,being a runaway,and curfew violations,and defined offenses to include a litany of other specific offenses,such as truancy,tobacco,contempt of court,disturbance of school,and damage to public and private property 
according to the written admission policy in effect at the time of smook arrest in,when juveniles arrived at the jdc for admission,staff members were to take them to an intake area,to ask them to remove their personal items,and then to conduct an interview while an admission form was filled out.a photograph was to be taken,and the juvenile was to be given a wristband identification bracelet.the policy then called for the juvenile to take a shower,during which time a detention officer was to conduct a visual inspection of the person body and a manual search of the person clothes,including pockets and linings.the policy dictated that searches should only be conducted by members of the same sex and that t he juvenile is not touched throughout this procedure.appellees app.at.
it is undisputed,however,that when smook was admitted to the jdc,she was not required to take a shower or to disrobe completely.rather,she was required to remove her outer clothing so that it could be searched,but she remained clothed in her undergarments in a private room with a female staff member.one female jdc official testified that she did not recall ever asking a juvenile to remove her undergarments,because you can pretty much see what there when they in undergarments.appellants app.at.banbury testified to his belief that some staff were performing searches as described in the written policy,while others were not.appellees app.at.
in september,the jdc admissions policy was revised.one revision provides that when juveniles are arrested on minor charges or detained as children in need of supervision,the detention officials shall attempt for two hours to contact a parent,and if the parent agrees to pick up the minor,then the minor may not be searched or admitted to the secure area of the facility.in addition,the jdc modified the shower area by installing a screen that shields from view all but the head,neck,and lower leg area of a showering youth body.in response to a state law passed in,which provides that n o person under the age of eighteen detained solely for a curfew violation may be,codified laws,the jdc also modified its policy to disallow strip searches of such juveniles,unless the detention officer first fills out a probable cause form indicating why the search is warranted.
after discovery,the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment,arguing that strip searches of juveniles who were admitted to the facility was a reasonable administrative procedure,and further asserting that even if the searches were not constitutional,the defendant directors of the jdc were entitled to qualified immunity.the plaintiffs also filed a motion for summary judgment on their fourth amendment claim,arguing that the undisputed facts established that the policy of all juveniles without individualized suspicion was a violation of clearly established constitutional law.
the district court denied the defendants motions for summary judgment.the court concluded that the jdc written search policy in effect in august was unconstitutional and that the subsequent changes to the policy did not cure the constitutional defects.mem.op.and order,doc,at.the court also concluded that the search of smook in august violated her constitutional rights.id.at.the court further held that banbury and cheever were not entitled to qualified immunity because it was clearly established for several years prior to the time of the alleged violations that the fourth amendment prohibited the kinds of searches of which plaintiff and the class complain.id.at.
the district court then granted partial summary judgment for the plaintiffs on the fourth amendment claim.the court identified three remaining issues relating to these claims what type of injunctive relief is appropriate in this case what amount of monetary damages are appropriate and how should the class members damages be determined what should the ending date be for membership in the first two classes certified by the court.id.at.
after the district court entered its order,the defendants filed a motion to reconsider based on a decision of the court of appeals for the second circuit,connecticut,cir,which was filed shortly before the district court granted partial summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs.the court in held that the disrobing and visual inspection of two juveniles upon their admission to a detention facility was not a violation of the fourth amendment.id.at.the defendants here argued that the decision supported the constitutionality of the jdc policy,and at least demonstrated that the institution search policy did not violate clearly established rights in.defs.mot.for,doc,at.on reconsideration,however,the district court reiterated its holding that the searches violated the constitutional rights of the minors,and that the law was clearly established prior to the searches at issue.mem.op.and order,doc,at add.at.
we begin with the damages claim of the named plaintiff and class representative,jodie smook.the district court concluded that the search of smook upon initial admission to the jdc,which required her to remove her outer clothing but not her undergarments,was unreasonable under the fourth amendment.the individual appellants,banbury and cheever,contend that the search was reasonable and,alternatively,that even if the search was unreasonable,the law was not clearly established on that point as of august.
the fourth amendment proscribes unreasonable searches,and t he test of reasonableness requires a balancing of the need for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the search entails.bell wolfish,d.a search unsupported by probable cause may be reasonable when special needs,beyond the normal need for law enforcement,make the warrant and requirement impracticable.bd.of educ.earls,d internal quotations omitted.to determine whether a special needs situation justifies a search without individualized suspicion,a court must undertake a balancing of the intrusion against the promotion of legitimate governmental interests.id.at.
the most apposite precedent is the second circuit recent opinion in connecticut,where the court applied the foregoing principles to a strip search of juveniles upon initial admission to a detention facility.judge newman opinion for the panel acknowledged that the circuits uniformly have held that adults held for minor offenses may not be strip searched without reasonable suspicion that they possess contraband.at see jones edwards,cir.the second circuit concluded,however,that s trip searches of children pose the reasonableness inquiry in a context where both the interests supporting and opposing such searches appear to be greater than with searches of adults confined for minor offenses,at.the state has a greater interest in conducting such a search,because w here the state is exercising some legitimate custodial authority over children,its responsibility to act in the place of parents in loco parentis obliges it to take special care to protect those in its charge,and that protection must be concerned with dangers from others and harm.id.the juvenile interest in privacy is greater than an adult,the court thought,because the adverse psychological effect of a strip search is likely to be more severe upon a child than an adult,especially a child who has been the victim of sexual abuse.id.
after finding no prior appellate decision concerning the reasonableness of strip searches of juveniles in lawful state custody,the second circuit tallied the state legitimate interests in performing such searches the state has an enhanced responsibility to take reasonable action to protect children from hazards resulting from the presence of contraband where children are confined a strip search serves the protective function of locating and removing concealed items that could be used for or even suicide and a strip search may disclose evidence of abuse that occurred in the home,and awareness of such abuse can assist juvenile authorities in structuring an appropriate plan of care.id.at.then assessing the risks to the of the juveniles and institutional safety from not conducting the searches as compared to the risks to the psychological health of the children from performing the searches,the court held that strip searches upon initial admission do not violate fourth amendment standards.id.at.a dissenting judge concluded that the strip searches were unconstitutional because the state had failed to demonstrate a close and substantial relationship of the invasive strip searches to a legitimate governmental need.id.at sotomayor,dissenting.
smook constitutional claim is not as strong as that of the juveniles in,because she was not subjected to a full strip search.she was taken to a private restroom by a female staff person,who explained that she would search smook clothes for drugs,drug paraphernalia,and weapons.the staff person directed smook to remove her shorts,and sandals,and then turned the clothes,pulled the pockets,and looked through the sandals to ensure that they did not have a false bottom.appellants app.at.smook remained attired in her undergarments,which she testified placed her at the same level of undress as if she were at the beach in a swimsuit.id.at.the staff person touched smook to look under her arms,between her toes,and through her hair and scalp.id.at.after searching the clothing,the staff member returned the clothes to smook and allowed her to get dressed.id.
we conclude that this search was reasonable within the meaning of the fourth amendment.the legitimate interests of the state,surveyed by the second circuit in,were present in this case and weigh in favor of reasonableness.the search,while intrusive to a degree,presented a lesser invasion of privacy than a full strip search.it has been observed that strip searches requiring a person to disrobe completely have a uniquely invasive and upsetting nature,at sotomayor,dissenting,and the decision of jdc officials to perform a less intrusive search distinguishes this incident from the close constitutional issue presented in.we do not gainsay that requiring a minor disrobe to her undergarments,even in a private room with only one staff member of the same sex,may still be a stressful and disturbing experience.but even the dissenting opinion in did not question that a juvenile detention facility could justify a search of some as a frisk search or a thorough search of all of a detainee clothing and possessions,id.at,and there are obvious practical difficulties in conducting a thorough search of a detainee clothing while the detainee is wearing them.in light of the state legitimate responsibility to act in loco parentis with respect to juveniles in lawful state custody,we conclude that after weighing the special needs for the search against the invasion of personal rights involved,the balance tips in favor of reasonableness.we thus conclude that banbury and cheever did not violate smook constitutional rights.
our decision in doe little rock school district,cir,does not dictate a different conclusion.in that case,our court held that a practice of subjecting secondary public school students to random,suspicionless searches of their persons and belongings by school officials was unconstitutional.as part of the analysis,we observed that the fruits of the searches at issue here are apparently regularly turned over to law enforcement officials and are used in criminal proceedings against students whose contraband is discovered.id.at.we concluded that r ather than acting in loco parentis,with the goal of promoting the students welfare,the government officials conducting the searches are in large part playing a law enforcement role with the goal of ferreting out crime and collecting evidence to be used in prosecuting students.id.
smook points out that the jdc policy at issue here provides that the law enforcement officer admitting a juvenile to the facility should stay at the jdc until the completion of the search,that any contraband found on a juvenile is to be taken by the police officer,and that it is the officer decision regarding further charges.appellees app.at.smook argues that because the searches may produce evidence that an officer could refer to a prosecutor in support of potential criminal charges,the analysis in doe compels a finding that the searches are unreasonable.the doe decision,however,should not be read to establish that a suspicionless search based on special needs is per se unconstitutional whenever the fruits of the searches may potentially be used in criminal proceedings.in that case,we inferred from the available evidence that the officials conducting searches acted with the goal of ferreting out crime and collecting evidence,rather than with the goal of promoting the students welfare.at.
we do not draw the same inference from the evidence here.officers already are permitted to search juvenile arrestees for evidence as an incident of the arrest,even for a minor offense,see atwater city of lago vista,d id.at,dissenting,and the goals of law enforcement to gather evidence are thus largely satisfied prior to admission at the jdc.we are not persuaded that the jdc profession of concern for the welfare of juveniles admitted to the facility is merely a pretextual explanation for searches that are in large part designed to gather evidence for criminal prosecutions.as outlined above and in the decision in,a residential facility like the jdc has sound reasons to act in loco parentis,and the incidental possibility that evidence might be discovered and referred to a criminal prosecutor no example of which is disclosed in this record is insufficient to render the search of smook unreasonable.
because minnehaha county appeal regarding liability for the search of smook is inextricably intertwined with the appeal of the individual defendants,see avalos city of glenwood,cir kincade city of blue springs,cir,we have jurisdiction to consider the county appeal on that point.for the reasons discussed,we likewise conclude that,assuming there was a direct causal link between the search of smook and the municipal policy,see city of cant
