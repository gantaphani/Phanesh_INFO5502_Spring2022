luis arnoldo alvarez figueroa and hilda guerra de alvarez petitioners are a married couple who concede that they are removable aliens.they petition this court to review the board of immigration appeals bia denial of their application for cancellation of removal.petitioners contend that the immigration judge ij applied improper legal standards in determining whether petitioners had demonstrated that their removal would result in a sufficient hardship to their two.petitioners also argue that their petition should be granted and the ij opinion vacated because the ij opinion is indiscernible.the government,on the other hand,argues that we lack jurisdiction to hear petitioners challenge because petitioners seek review of a discretionary determination,which this court lacks jurisdiction to review,and because petitioners failed to exhaust their administrative remedies with the bia.for the reasons discussed below,we hold that petitioners exhausted their challenges,that we have jurisdiction to hear their legal challenges,and that the ij committed legal error.thus,we grant the petition and remand the case to the bia for further proceedings.
jurisdiction 
petitioners invoke this court jurisdiction pursuant to a d.the government argues that we lack jurisdiction pursuant to a b i.because jurisdiction is disputed,we consider the jurisdictional question in part,infra.we,of course,have jurisdiction to determine our own jurisdiction.see sareang ye ins,cir.
ii.factual and procedural background 
petitioners,husband and wife,are the parents of three,the eldest child,louis and natalie.the latter two are united states citizens.petitioners and claudia are aliens from jalisco,mexico.
in july,petitioners filed an application for asylum and withholding of removal with the and naturalization service ins.shortly after filing that application,petitioners received from the ins a notice to appear charging that they were subject to removal from the united states.petitioners then filed an application for cancellation of removal and adjustment of status.
removal proceedings began in september.at the initial hearing,petitioners conceded removability,and the ij designated mexico as the country of removal.the next hearing was held in february before immigration judge wendell hollis ij.at that hearing,petitioners withdrew their application for asylum and pursued only cancellation of removal and adjustment of status pursuant to the immigration and nationality act ina b,b.in the alternative,petitioners asked for a grant of voluntary departure pursuant to ina b,a.
in order to show that they were eligible for cancellation of removal,petitioners had to demonstrate that they had been physically present in the united states for a continuous period of not less than ten years immediately preceding the date of their application they have been persons of good moral character during that period they had not been convicted of certain offenses and removal would result in an exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to their.see b.
in support of that showing,petitioners testified and provided other evidence that they had been physically present in the united states for a continuous period of not less than ten years,that they were persons of good moral character,and that they have never been convicted of a crime.petitioners also testified that in the event of their removal,they would take their children to mexico.the ij,in his oral opinion,found them credible,that they met the continual presence requirement,that they were of good moral character,and that they had not been convicted of a crime.
to demonstrate that their removal would result in an exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to their two,lesleigh franklin,a clinical psychologist,testified to the effect a move to mexico would have on louis,the.louis had been diagnosed with depression and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd,for which he was treated with medication.louis school in the united states accommodated louis with special education resources.franklin testified that louis needed support beyond medication in order for him to maintain his academic grade level,that louis needed services which may not be provided in mexico,and that moving to mexico would create enormous emotional problems for louis.frank ephram lopez,a physician and specialist in pediatrics,reported that in light of louis conditions,it would not be medically advisable to move louis to an environment in which medical treatment and academic support is inferior or nonexistent.
petitioners also presented evidence that natalie,the,lacked spanish language skills,and that she had an eye condition which may develop into something worse in her adult years,although the only treatment called for at that time was eyeglasses and future eye examinations.
the ij,in his oral opinion,concluded that petitioners had failed to demonstrate the necessary hardship,stating that,in order to prevail,petitioners would have to demonstrate that the hardship would be unconscionable.the opinion is,in part,nonsensical.see,ij opinion at the first observation is i can not believe that congress intended that immigration judges should look upon a child that is perfect with no health for we all know that every child has medical disorders and be it colds,infections,flu,allergies.in part,it is also incoherent.see,ij opinion at but more importantly,this court in trying to filter the indiscernible educational information through the indiscernible of the legal analysis of exceptional and extremely unusual hardship,believes that this case falls short.
petitioners appealed the ij decision to the bia,and the bia adopted and affirmed the ij decision,citing its decision in in re burbano,bia.petitioners then filed a timely petition for review.
iii.standard of review 
where the bia expresses no disagreement with any part of the ij decision,but instead cites in re burbano,as it did here,the bia adopts the ij decision in its entirety.see abebe gonzales,cir en banc.a burbano affirmance signifies that the bia has conducted an independent review of the record and has determined that its conclusions are the same as those articulated by the ij.see id.at.in such a case,we review the ij decision as if it were the decision of the bia.see id.at.and,we review legal questions addressed by the ij de novo.see unuakhaulu gonzales,cir.
iv.analysis 
petitioners first contend that the ij erred by applying the wrong legal standard in requiring petitioners to show that the hardship suffered by their would be unconscionable a standard expressly rejected in the bia precedential opinions,and by considering only the hardship currently suffered by the children due to their medical conditions without considering the hardship the children would suffer in the event that their parents were removed.they contend that the ij opinion should be vacated and remanded for this reason.petitioners also contend that this court should grant the petition,vacate the ij opinion,and remand to the bia on the separate ground that the ij decision is indiscernible.
the government moved to dismiss this case for want of jurisdiction,but a motions panel of this court denied that motion without prejudice to the argument being renewed before the merits panel.thus,the government once again argues that we lack jurisdiction over this petition on the ground that petitioners seek review of a discretionary decision.the government further argues that we lack jurisdiction because petitioners failed to exhaust their legal challenges with the bia.we first consider the jurisdictional questions,then address petitioners legal challenges on the merits.
jurisdiction 
exhaustion 
as a threshold matter,the government argues that even if we have jurisdiction as a general matter to review a petitioner challenge based upon the ij legal errors,we nevertheless lack jurisdiction in this case because petitioners failed to exhaust their legal challenges before the bia 
the government of course is correct that we can consider petitioners challenges only if those issues were raised before the bia.see kaganovich gonzales,cir.that is,we have jurisdiction to review a final order of removal and the issues raised in a petition for review only if the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.d.because the policy underlying the exhaustion requirement is to give an administrative agency the opportunity to resolve a controversy or correct its own errors before judicial intervention,zara ashcroft,cir,we do not employ the exhaustion doctrine in a formalistic manner,but rather inquire into whether the issue was before the bia such that it had the opportunity to correct its error.the exhaustion doctrine requires that the petitioner put the bia on notice as to the specific issues so that the bia has an opportunity to pass on th ose issue s.zhang ashcroft,cir per curiam.that is why a general challenge to the ij decision will not satisfy the exhaustion requirement,zara,at however,a petitioner need not elaborate on the argument in their brief,see kaganovich,at.the issue need not even be raised at all in the brief,if it is raised in the notice of appeal.ladha ins,cir.so long as the issue was raised before the bia,the exhaustion requirement is satisfied.kaganovich,at zhang,at.o ur precedent requires nothing more.kaganovich,at quoting zhang,at.
here,the issue of whether the ij applied the wrong legal standard was presented to the bia,and the bia had the opportunity to correct its error.the ij announced in his decision that i n order to establish exceptional and extremely unusual hardship,an applicant for cancellation of removal must demonstrate that a spouse,parent,or child would suffer hardship that is substantially beyond that which would ordinarily be expected to result from the alien deportation and that such hardship would be unconscionable.ij opinion at emphasis added.petitioners then stated in their notice of appeal that d enial of respondent application for cancellation of removal violated the statute and the regulations and that there are also other errors of fact and law made by the immigration judge in decision,which will be described in the brief that will be submitted with this appeal upon receipt of the transcript.in their brief to the bia,as the government acknowledges,petitioners stated that the exceptional and extremely unusual hardship standard did not require them to demonstrate that the hardship was unconscionable.the government argues that this was not enough to exhaust this issue because petitioners did not put forward a developed argument.this,of course,is not our standard petitioners need not argue anything so long as the issue is presented to the bia.kaganovich,at.
it clear that the issue of the ij erroneous statement of the law was presented to the bia.because the bia had a full opportunity to resolve the controversy or correct its own errors before judicial intervention,petitioners challenges to the ij errors of law were exhausted.ladha,at emphasis added see also mukasey,cir as we recognized in abebe,when the bia cites burbano in its decision,all issues presented before the ij are deemed to have been presented to the bia.where,as here,the agency was aware of the problem,where it did apply its expertise,where it did exercise its discretion,it is decidedly unfair to us to refuse to review that decision see ins,cir emphasis in original quoting ins,cir kozinski,dissenting in part.
petitioners have exhausted their administrative remedies.
jurisdiction over legal challenges 
next,the government argues that we should dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction because petitioners challenge is nothing more than a challenge to the bia discretionary determination that petitioners failed to establish their eligibility for cancellation of removal because they did not demonstrate that their removal to mexico would cause an exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to their qualifying relatives.petitioners,on the other hand,argue that we do have jurisdiction because they are not challenging the ij discretionary determinations,but instead are challenging the ij decision on the ground that the ij applied the wrong legal standards.
under,we have jurisdiction to review final orders of the bia which call for a petitioner removal.see chuyon yon hong mukasey,cir.we lack jurisdiction,however,to review the bia discretionary determination that an alien failed to prove that her removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to the alien spouse,parent,or child,who is a citizen of the united states or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.see gonzales,cir citing a b i.
notwithstanding the provision of a b i,the real id act of restored judicial review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review filed with a court of appeals.see,div,a a iii,stat,codified at a d the plain language of the real id act grants jurisdiction to appellate courts to review questions of law presented in petitions for review of final orders of removal,even those pertaining to otherwise discretionary determinations.afridi gonzales,cir.we have construed a d to provide jurisdiction for challenges to the agency interpretation and application of b d exceptional and extremely unusual hardship standard based upon international law,see gonzales,cir holding that we had jurisdiction to consider whether the bia interpretation of the exceptional and extremely unusual hardship standard violated international law,and constitutional law,see,at holding that we had jurisdiction to consider whether the agency application of the exceptional and extremely unusual hardship standard violated the petitioner constitutional right to due process ashcroft,cir whether the bia interpretation of the hardship standard violates due process is not a judgment regarding the granting of cancellation of removal relief.rather,it presents a question of statutory construction.
on the other hand,we have construed a b i and a d to preclude review of a challenge based upon the application of the law to the facts of the particular case,even when that challenge is cloaked as a legal challenge.see,at concluding that the petitioner argument that the ij violated her right to due process by misapplying the facts of her case to applicable law was nothing more than an argument that the ij abused his discretion,a matter over which we have no jurisdiction.
here,petitioners do not argue that the ij made a legal error by misapplying the facts of their case to the applicable law rather,they argue that the ij made legal errors in understanding the meaning of exceptional and extremely unusual hardship.while our circuit has not directly addressed whether we have jurisdiction over challenges based on the ij employment of an improper legal standard when construing the meaning of exceptional and extremely unusual hardship,the seventh circuit has 
neither the ij nor the board thought that his mother hardship would be exceptional and extremely unusual,the statutory standard for cancellation of removal based on hardship to an alien immediate relative.b.we lack jurisdiction to review petitioner contention that the agency should have exercised discretion in his favor.
the real id act of,however,creates an exception for constitutional contentions and other pure issues of law.petitioner does advance an argument that meet s this description that the immigration judge made a legal error in understanding the meaning of exceptional and extremely unusual hardship.
mireles gonzales,cir statutory citation omitted.the seventh circuit then concluded that it had jurisdiction to hear the petitioner challenge,but ultimately decided that the ij in that case used the right legal standard.id.at.
in addition,we have concluded in other contexts that we have jurisdiction to consider whether the bia failed to apply the proper legal standard even when the underlying decision was a discretionary one.for example,we have held that we have jurisdiction to consider whether the bia failed to apply the correct legal standard in determining whether the petitioner specific crime was a particularly serious crime,even though whether a crime is particularly serious is a discretionary determination which we lack jurisdiction to review.see afridi,at
