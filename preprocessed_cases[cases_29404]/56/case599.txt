ii.discussion 
legal framework 
penal code section provides a conviction can not be had upon the testimony of an accomplice unless it be corroborated by such other evidence as shall tend to connect the defendant with the commission of the offense and the corroboration is not sufficient if it merely shows the commission of the offense or the circumstances thereof.this cautionary rule has its roots in the fact that experience has shown that the evidence of an accomplice should be viewed with care,caution and suspicion because it comes from a tainted source and is often given in the hope or expectation of leniency or immunity.people wallin cal d.a coperpetrator has a natural incentive to shift blame to the accused in hopes of minimizing his or her own culpability.people tobias cal th,d,people lewis th,d.this may be especially true where the accomplice is a minor,as a minor may be under great parental or social pressure to testify and blame certain conduct on the accused.in re miguel cal d.additionally,accomplice testimony frequently is cloaked with plausibility because the accomplice has knowledge of the facts of the crime and can weave a convincing story.people tewksbury cal d.indeed with the enactment of penal code section,accomplice testimony has been legislatively determined never to be sufficiently trustworthy to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt unless corroborated.people tewksbury,supra,at.
notwithstanding the acclaim that the accomplice corroboration rule has received in our caselaw,as well as the significant benefit afforded a criminal defendant by virtue of its application in a given case,nearly years ago our supreme court refused to apply the rule to juvenile adjudications.mitchell,supra,cal d.the court initially,and mechanically,held that penal code section did not pertain to juvenile adjudications because a finding of wardship does not constitute a conviction within the meaning of the statute mitchell,supra,at.in other words,the legislature choice of the word conviction demonstrated an intent to create two classes of subjected to conviction in criminal court who would benefit from the rule,and juveniles subjected to wardship adjudication in juvenile court,who would not.
additionally,the court rejected the minor equal protection challenge,framing the issue as whether the state could require a lesser quality of it distinguished from the required degree of juvenile proceedings.mitchell,supra,cal d at.employing the rational basis test,the supreme court reasoned that disparate treatment with respect to the quality of evidence in adult and juvenile settings was reasonably related to the rehabilitative purpose served by the juvenile court.specifically,it posited that the legislature could consider that judicial intervention to rehabilitate an impressionable youth may outweigh the policy against the use of uncorroborated testimony.id.at.also persuasive was the assumption that a judge sitting as trier of fact would be more likely than a jury to accord accomplice testimony its appropriate weight.id.at.finally,the court also observed i t must be acknowledged that a person convicted of a serious crime is generally exposed to a greater and more onerous term of confinement than a juvenile ward charged with the same misconduct.id.at.the dissenting opinion emphasized that because a minor guilt must be established beyond a reasonable doubt,the purpose and intent expressed in penal code section applied equally to juvenile proceedings.mitchell,supra,at,dis.opn.of bird.
