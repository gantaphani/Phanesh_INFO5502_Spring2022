tommy appeals,contending the victim restitution order should be reversed because the settlement payment by cardenas insurer to the victim,which fully compensated her for her economic losses,was made on tommy behalf the release of liability signed by the victim fulfilled any requirement that tommy pay restitution and thus restitution was barred as the insurer payment to the victim fully offset tommy direct victim restitution obligation.
for reasons we shall discuss,we decide in our central holding that because the settlement payment by cardenas insurer to the victim is a payment from a source that is completely distinct and independent from tommy,it does not constitute restitution directly from tommy within the meaning of section a,and thus does not relieve him of his victim restitution obligation under that statute.accordingly,we affirm the restitution order.
