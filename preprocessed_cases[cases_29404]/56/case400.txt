mother marcela appeals from orders of the juvenile court terminating dependency jurisdiction and ordering visitation with her minor daughters who had been adjudged dependent minors under welfare and institutions code section in the published portion of this decision,we conclude that the oral visitation order,which conflicts with the form final judgment,is controlling and is not an improper delegation of authority to determine the circumstances of visitation.in the unpublished portion,we affirm the order terminating dependency jurisdiction because the conditions justifying dependency jurisdiction no longer exist.
factual and procedural summary 
mother,marcela,and father,wilbur,divorced in.their family law case was still open in.they had two daughters,and daphne,who were and years old respectively in september.the family court had awarded full custody of the children to mother with visitation to father.mother attempted suicide on march,and was involuntarily hospitalized as a danger to herself and others,and because she was gravely disabled.father stayed with the children at mother apartment until she was discharged on march,and resumed living with the children.
the minors lived with mother until august when mother asked father to take the girls because she wanted them to live with him due to stress she was experiencing.in early september,mother sought to have the children returned to her under the previous family law order.the children wanted to remain with father and mother agreed.but two days later,mother sought police assistance to have the children returned to her.the children were adamant that they were afraid of their mother because of her prior suicide attempt and hysterical behavior.a children social worker and police officers went to father home and interviewed father,his girlfriend,and the children.the minors told the social worker that while they loved their mother,they did not feel safe with her because of problems including mother severe mood swings and yelling.both told the social worker that they wanted to live with father.
in an interview with the social worker,mother reported a history of domestic violence inflicted by father during their marriage.she said she suffered from depression and anxiety and had been hospitalized and medicated for these conditions,although she had discontinued the medication.mother regretted attempting suicide in the presence of the minors and said she was doing much better.she attributed her mood swings and yelling at the minors to problems in getting the girls to take care of their chores at home and because wanted to date.mother believed the minors preferred to live with father because he did not require them to abide by rules and gave them expensive gifts.she denied asking father to take custody of the girls.
the department of children and family services the department filed a petition alleging the children came within section because mother mental and emotional condition and the history of domestic violence endangered the children physical and emotional health and safety.the children were placed in protective custody and released to the custody of father.an amended petition was sustained,the children were declared dependents under section,and the department was ordered to provide family reunification services for mother and family maintenance services for father.counseling was ordered for the children,with conjoint counseling with mother when the children therapist deemed it appropriate.mother was ordered to have individual counseling.upon written documentation that father previously had completed domestic violence and parenting classes,the court ordered that he need not complete other programs.mother was to be provided monitored visitation in a therapeutic setting and did not object to this order.
on february,counsel for mother raised an issue regarding visitation and individual counseling for the minors as a walk on.she said that the minors only had individual counseling twice in the preceding period,and requested that their counseling occur on a weekly basis.in addition,mother had not been allowed to visit the children more than once.counsel for all parties,including mother,agreed to have two more visits between mother and the children in a therapeutic setting,followed by monitored weekly visits.
a hearing pursuant to section was held on june.the social worker reported that mother had completed individual therapy sessions.the children had four individual counseling sessions between november and january,which stopped when they began conjoint counseling with mother.father provided proof that he had completed a session program in.the social worker confirmed that mother had three visits with the children in february,april and may.mother had to cancel some visits because of her work schedule and the children also cancelled visits as they remained resistant to visits with mother.on may,the children told the social worker they wanted to live with father.
the department recommended that jurisdiction over the children be terminated,that the matter be stayed pending receipt of a family law court order granting father sole physical custody,and joint legal custody to mother and father.the department explained that the basis for these recommendations was that the relationship between mother and the children remained frustrating and in conflict despite mother compliance with orders and case plans.father had demonstrated the ability to meet the needs of the children.the contested hearing was continued at mother request.
the interim review report prepared for the july,section hearing stated that the last conjoint therapy session between mother and the children was held on may.the therapist reported that no further sessions were scheduled since the girls continued to express a great deal of anger toward mother because of her suicide attempt,issues with trust,and feelings of abandonment and rejection.was more open to rebuilding a relationship with mother,but daphne avoided even eye contact with mother.both girls expressed resentment and anger toward mother fiancé.the department repeated its recommendations from the previous report,including termination of dependency jurisdiction.
at the july,hearing,counsel for father asked the court to terminate jurisdiction and award him sole legal and physical custody of the children.counsel cited mother refusal to allow to participate in a school trip to china despite a court order that she sign the passport application.counsel for mother asked that the case remain open,arguing that mother was in full compliance.she argued that mother had little visitation with the children and that few conjoint therapy sessions had been held.mother was concerned that she was not notified that the girls had changed schools and about father immigration status.in the event the court decided to terminate dependency jurisdiction,mother asked for joint legal custody.
counsel for the children agreed with the department recommendations.she asked the court to award father both sole physical and legal custody based in part on mother failure to facilitate trip to china,which had to cancel.counsel for the children asserted that mother had taken the children off her dental insurance policy without notice to anyone,requiring father to assume the cost of orthodontia for daphne.in addition,the children attorney contended that mother had added her fiancé as an emergency contact at the children school without permission or notice to anyone.counsel anticipated that other problems would arise requiring a single parent to have legal custody,for example,plan to apply for a driver learner permit,which requires the signatures of both parents.the department reiterated its recommendations.counsel for mother argued that the father and the department had not complied with the orders for conjoint therapy or visitation,which were essential parts of the reunification plan.
the juvenile court found that conditions no longer existed that necessitated dependency jurisdiction.the court found that there was little or no way that these parents can make decisions together.and,as a result,i am ordering sole legal and physical custody to the father with monitored visits for the mother.the parents were to determine supervised visitation.the parents were to decide on the monitor,and if unable to do so,father would choose.an exit order incorporating these rulings was entered and transmitted to the family law court pursuant to section.mother timely appeal followed.
discussion 
mother appears to argue that dependency jurisdiction should have been continued because she did not receive adequate reunification services and because the reunification plan for father was unreasonable.we discuss the latter argument first.
mother argues it was not reasonable to allow father to satisfy the court order for domestic violence classes by submitting proof of his prior completion of relevant programs.father provided proof of completion of the program and was not required to complete additional programs in this matter.in her opening brief,mother says earlier domestic violence restraining orders were issued against father in july and in july.the july restraining order is in the record.but the other restraining order cited by mother is dated july.as counsel for the department points out,mother failed to challenge the court order allowing father to use his program to satisfy his plan in this matter.the rule is that failure to challenge a ruling in the juvenile court forfeits the issue on appeal unless the court of appeal exercises its discretion to entertain the challenge.in re cal th.since this issue does not involve an important issue of law,we exercise our discretion not to entertain it.ibid.
mother primary argument is that she was not given the visitation ordered by the court on february.she contends the visitation did not occur because the minors had not received individual counseling,having received only two sessions in the preceding period.at that point,the court ordered the next two visits to be with a therapist and set a progress hearing to ensure compliance with its orders.mother argues the department failed to implement the court orders that the minors receive counseling intended to prepare them for visitation with her.
mother emphasizes the importance of visitation to reunification.she claims that here the visitation plan was designed to fail to achieve reunification because she was given only one month of limited visitation during the period the court was monitoring visits to ensure they occurred.she contends that while the few visits she had were awkward because she had not seen the minors for six months,they were not detrimental to the children.she cites reports by the minors therapist that mother behavior was stable and nonthreatening and suggesting that the girls have an opportunity to spend more time with mother to experience her emotional stability.mother contends that the department had a duty to provide reunification services even though the department and juvenile court agreed that the conditions that had necessitated the court intervention no longer existed.
the department takes the position that because the children were never removed from parental custody,the reasonableness of reunification services was not at issue and the only question before the juvenile court was whether continued supervision was necessary.
section applies where,as here,a child is placed under court supervision pursuant to section but is not removed from the physical custody of one or more parents.periodic review hearings are to be scheduled at six month intervals and the social worker is to report on progress made in eliminating the conditions requiring court supervision.the court shall terminate its jurisdiction unless the social worker or his or her department establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that the conditions still exist which would justify initial assumption of jurisdiction under section,or that those conditions are likely to exist if supervision is withdrawn,subd.c.failure of a parent to participate regularly in treatment shall constitute prima facie evidence that the conditions which justified initial assumption of jurisdiction still exist and that continued supervision is necessary.ibid.if dependency jurisdiction is continued,the court must order continued services and set a further review hearing pursuant to section to be held within six months.citation.this review process is repeated until the court terminates jurisdiction.citations.bridget superior court th,fn.omitted.
there is a split of authority as to the proper scope of the court inquiry at a hearing under section.the department cites in re janee th,a case in which the court of appeal concluded that the court erred in proceeding under section because the minors were not placed with a parent when first detained.id.at contra bridget superior court,supra,th at.in in re elaine d,the court of appeal held that section limits the court inquiry to whether the conditions for continuing supervision exist.id.at.
we conclude the better approach was outlined in in re roger th roger.the court declined to follow in re elaine,supra,d.instead,it held we think,however,when making an order to be transferred to the family court,the juvenile court has the power to hear evidence relevant to that order under section,which the elaine court did not discuss.when the juvenile court terminates its jurisdiction over a dependent child,section authorizes it to make custody and visitation orders that will be transferred to an existing family court file and remain in effect until modified or terminated by the superior court.as section gives the juvenile court power to fashion termination orders,it makes no sense to interpret section to preclude the court from considering evidence relevant to that task.to the extent elaine implies that a trial court can not receive evidence concerning visitation under section,we decline to follow it.in re roger,supra,at,fn.omitted see also in re michael th,adopting approach of roger.
there is ample support for the juvenile court conclusion that dependency jurisdiction should be terminated under section.the minors were thriving in father custody.dependency proceedings were instituted because of concern that the children were not safe in mother custody in light of her attempted suicide and mental and emotional issues.through the dependency proceeding mother received individual counseling and her mental and emotional state improved.mother cites father uncooperative behavior at times regarding the schedule for the children therapy as a basis for continued dependency jurisdiction.on this record,the trial court properly concluded that the conditions which justified initial assumption of jurisdiction no longer existed.under section termination of dependency jurisdiction was mandatory under these circumstances.bridget superior court,supra,th at.
once the juvenile court determined that termination of jurisdiction was required,there is no provision for continued reunification services.while there was evidence that visitation between mother and the children was hampered by the children anger toward their mother and resistance to meeting with her,upon termination of jurisdiction,the court could only make visitation and custody orders as explained in in re roger,supra,th.it has done so in this case.we find no basis for reversal in mother challenge to the reunification services provided.
mother also argues the juvenile court improperly delegated visitation to the parents in its exit order.father argues the issue was not preserved by mother because she failed to challenge the order in the dependency court.the department takes no position on the issue,but directs our attention to in re th,a case also cited by counsel for father.
when a juvenile court terminates its jurisdiction over a dependent child,it is empowered to make exit orders regarding custody and visitation,subd.c,in re kenneth,th.such orders become part of any family court proceeding concerning the same child and will remain in effect u
