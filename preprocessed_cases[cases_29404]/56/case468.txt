factual and procedural background 
the o children were detained,along with their three,in june as a result of the alleged physical and sexual abuse of the court sustained findings under section,subdivision a serious physical harm,subdivision b failure to protect,subdivision d sexual abuse and subdivision g no provision for support.under subdivision a,the court found that mother used a safety pin and a knife to scrape ink marks,which mother believed to be tattoos,from the skin on wrist and leg and had on prior occasions inappropriately and excessively physically disciplined by pulling her hair and striking her face.under subdivision d,the court found that carlos made sexual comments and gestures toward his,causing the child to feel sexually threatened,including fondling her legs and vaginal area over her clothing.
in two findings that pertained to appellant,the court found under section,subdivisions b and g,that appellant failed to provide the children with the necessities of life including food,clothing,shelter and medical care.
after detention,the o children were placed in a series of foster homes.dcfs investigated mother relatives for placement.a maternal aunt who volunteered to accept custody had a prior history with dcfs,which rendered her unacceptable.other maternal relatives who volunteered to assume custody required waivers for various reasons accordingly,the children remained in foster care 
in multiple interviews,mother informed the caseworker that appellant was the father of the o children and that he was living in mexico after spending time in missouri.the caseworker located appellant in mexico.he confirmed that he was the children father.appellant reported that he and mother had never been married and that they broke off their relationship when she became involved with carlos.appellant claimed that while living in missouri he had sent mother money a couple of times.appellant told the caseworker he was interested in getting custody of the children.the caseworker spoke with a maternal aunt mother sister who said that appellant went to missouri for reasons when was in and that when appellant was ready for his family to follow,mother informed him she had become involved with carlos.reported that she had last spoken with her dad,referring to appellant,approximately three years previously.reported that appellant stopped calling a long time ago,and that the family had had no contact with him in years.said he spoke with his dad,referring to appellant,when he was turned in the year and wished to speak with him again.dcfs obtained the birth certificates for the children,which identified appellant as their father.
prior to the detention hearing on june,mother filled out a paternity questionnaire under penalty of perjury.it stated that appellant had not signed papers establishing paternity at the hospital and had never been married to mother.however,according to the questionnaire,mother and appellant were living together at the time of the children birth and appellant held himself out as the children father and accepted the children openly in his home.at the hearing,mother was questioned by the court and confirmed that all three of the o children had lived with appellant from their births until the couple separated in.she stated that appellant last had telephonic contact with the children sometime around.the court found true that appellant had held himself out as the children father and openly accepted the children into his home,but deferred a finding on his status as a presumed father.
on july,the court appointed counsel to represent appellant.the court instructed counsel to attempt to contact appellant and ordered dcfs to initiate a referral for appellant with dif desarrollo integral de la familia,a mexican social services agency and to facilitate telephone calls between appellant and the children.dcfs contacted the mexican consulate,requesting that dif conduct a home visit and assess the suitability of appellant home 
at the hearing on august,appellant counsel reported that a employee in her office had talked with appellant over the telephone.appellant had said during that conversation that he lived with mother and the children until,when he went to missouri to accept a position as a restaurant manager.appellant anticipated the family would eventually reunite in missouri.according to counsel,between and,appellant sent mother approximately per month to support the children.the court ruled that this information was inadmissible and admonished counsel for failing to obtain a sworn statement from appellant.counsel requested a continuance to obtain an affidavit,which the court denied.
after considering the evidence in the reports and the information provided by mother,the court found that appellant had held himself out as the children father and openly accepted them into his home for one year with respect to the youngest,three years with respect to the middle child,and four years with respect to the oldest.the court noted that although appellant name appeared on their birth certificates,his name could have been put there without his consent.relying on in re th,d for the proposition that even if someone has held himself out as the father,and openly accepted the children into his home,his presumed father status could fall away,the court ruled that appellant was an alleged father only,because he had not had contact with the children or provided financial support for many years.
despite having ruled that appellant was not a presumed father,the court made jurisdictional findings that pertained to appellant and,during the dispositional phase of the hearing,provided reunification services.the court ordered appellant to drug test,enroll in parenting classes,and visit or contact the children in order to form a relationship.counsel for appellant asked on his behalf that the children be released to appellant brothers,who were residing in missouri.the court ordered dcfs to initiate the icpc process interstate compact on placement of children to determine whether the children could be placed with these parties.see,et.
discussion 
presumed father status 
in dependency proceedings,fathers are divided into four or biological,presumed,alleged,and de facto.in re,supra,th at,d.a biological father is one whose paternity is established,but who does not qualify as a presumed father.in re kobe th,d.an alleged father is a man who may be the father,but has not yet established himself as either a biological father or a presumed father.in re kobe,supra,at,d.
the distinction is important because only a presumed father is entitled to custody or a reunification plan.in re kobe,supra,th at,d in re paul th,d in re th,d.an alleged father is not entitled even to appointed counsel,except for the purpose of establishing presumed fatherhood.in re kobe,supra,at,d in re paul,supra,th at,d.indeed,it is generally said that an alleged father rights are limited to an opportunity to appear and assert a position and attempt to change his paternity status in re kobe,supra,th at,d accord,in re paul,supra,th at,d in re,supra,th at,d.
the various statutory methods for establishing a presumption of paternity are contained in the family code.see,child of wife cohabiting with husband who is not impotent or sterile conclusively presumed to be child of the marriage paternity established where man identified by mother as natural father executes voluntary declaration of paternity at hospital where child is born,subd.a presumption arises where man is married to mother and child is born during marriage or within days afterward,subd.b presumption arises where man attempted to marry mother prior to child birth,but marriage is or could be declared invalid,subd.c presumption arises where man attempted to marry mother after child birth and is named on birth certificate with his consent or voluntarily undertakes legal support obligation.the provision applicable here,family code section,subdivision d d,provides that a man is presumed to be the natural father of a child or children if h e receives the child into his home and openly holds out the child as his natural child.
a man who claims entitlement to presumed father status has the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence the facts supporting his entitlement.in re th,d.although more than one individual may fulfill the statutory criteria that give rise to a presumption of paternity,there can be only one presumed father.in re jesusa cal th,d.the section d presumption,once it arises,may be rebutted in an appropriate action only by clear and convincing evidence,subd.a a.here,the trial court found that appellant had established the presumption under section d,but that it had been rebutted.the issue is whether appellant failure to care for or to provide financial support to his children warrants rebuttal of the presumption of paternity that arises under section d.
section a provides that the presumptions arising under family code section,including the presumption of section d,may be rebutted in an appropriate action.the supreme court has repeatedly stated that section a should not be applied to rebut a presumption of fatherhood arising under section d where the result would be to leave children with fewer than two parents.in in re nicholas cal th,d,for example,the man seeking presumed father status had taken care of the child a old boy and his mother for five years,but was not the biological father.cal th at,d.respondent contended the lack of a biological connection rebutted the section d presumption.the supreme court disagreed section a provides that a presumption under section that a man is the natural father of a child is a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of proof and may be rebutted in an appropriate action only by clear and convincing evidence.italics added by supreme court.when it used the limiting phrase an appropriate action,the legislature was unlikely to have had in mind an action like action in which no other man claims parental rights to the child,an action in which rebuttal of the section d presumption will render the child fatherless.rather,we believe the legislature had in mind an action in which another candidate is vying for parental rights and seeks to rebut a section d presumption in order to perfect his claim,or in which a court decides that the legal rights and obligations of parenthood should devolve upon an unwilling candidate.cal th at,d.
the supreme court repeated the admonition against applying section a to rebut a presumption of parenthood arising under section d where the result would be to leave a child with fewer than two parents in elisa superior court cal th,d.there,a woman whose children were born during a committed lesbian relationship and treated by her partner as the partner children for many years sought child support after the relationship ended.the former partner clearly met the standard for presumed parenthood under section d.in determining whether the presumption should be given effect,the court explained in establishing a system for a voluntary declaration of paternity in section,the legislature declared there is a compelling state interest in establishing paternity for all children.establishing paternity is the first step toward a child support award,which,in turn,provides children with equal rights and access to benefits,including,but not limited to,social security,health insurance,survivors benefits,military benefits,and inheritance rights.by recognizing the value of determining paternity,the legislature implicitly recognized the value of having two parents,rather than one,as a source of both emotional and financial support,especially when the obligation to support the child would otherwise fall to the public.cal th at,d.accordingly,the case before it was not an appropriate action in which to rebut the presumption of section d.cal th at,d,see also librers black th,d w henever possible,a child should have the benefit of two parents to support and nurture him or her.
neither nicholas nor elisa involved a father who discontinued contact with the children and provided no financial support after the mother remarried.however,we believe the supreme court admonition that courts should not render children fatherless by too easily finding cause to rebut the d presumption is equally applicable in the present,rather commonplace situation.appellant,mother and the o children all recognized appellant as the children father.his name is on their birth certificates.he acknowledged the children at birth and supported them for several years.refusing to grant presumed father status to a man such as appellant,where no other parental figure is available to fill the gap,would serve only to punish the children by depriving them of a second parent.in addition,it would for all practical purposes deprive them of a connection with their father family and the opportunity of finding a home with one of the father relatives,should the mother attempt at reunification fall short 
respondent cites no authority for the proposition that abandonment combined with failure to support is a basis for rebutting the section d presumption,and our research has uncovered none a biological father failure to maintain a relationship with the children or to provide support is a relevant factor to be considered in the context of resolving the competing claims of two different men,both of whom can establish a presumption of fatherhood under the provisions of the family code,subd.b see,in re jesusa,supra,cal th at,d.that situation is governed by family code section,subdivision b,which provides if two or more presumptions arise under family code section that conflict with each other,the presumption which on the facts is founded on the weightier considerations of policy and logic controls.in choosing between competing claims of presumed fatherhood,juvenile courts are obliged to weigh all relevant factors in determining which presumption was founded on weightier considerations,including whether the biological father had continued to be involved in the children lives or had effectively abandoned them at an early age.in re jesusa,supra,cal th at,d.however,family code section,subdivision b has no applicability here.no man other than appellant has sought fatherhood status with respect to the o children.the only other man who has had a significant relationship with the stepfather demonstrated no interest in their.the children,for their part,have expressed their disinclination to maintain a relationship with carlos.accordingly,affirming the juvenile court ruling would effectively leave the children fatherless.
implicitly recognizing the lack of support for the court ruling that the section d presumption had been rebutted,respondent attacks the juvenile court finding that the section d presumption arose under the evidence presented.respondent cites two adoption cases,adoption of kelsey cal th,d,and adoption of th,d,for the proposition that a court should consider multiple factors before making a finding under section d,including the alleged father payment of pregnancy and birth expenses commensurate with his ability to do so,and prompt legal action to seek custody of the child.
both kelsey and involved biological fathers who were unable to establish a presumption of fatherhood under any statutory provision because their attempts at contact and custody were stymied by the mothers,who preferred to free the children for adoption.see adoption of kelsey,supra,cal th at,d,a
