melissa is a woman with severe developmental disabilities.she needs assistance in all of her activities of daily living,and will need it for the rest of her life.this appeal concerns the juvenile court decision to terminate dependency jurisdiction and leave melissa placement in her group home.mother,contends the court erred when it dismissed dependency jurisdiction that the evidence does not show a risk of detriment to melissa if she were returned to mother care and that lack of compliance with the indian child welfare act icwa,or the act requires reversal.we conclude the court properly dismissed dependency jurisdiction and allowed melissa to remain in her group home,and that mother challenge to the risk of detriment finding is moot.we also conclude that reversal and remand to require the juvenile court to comply with icwa would be futile because melissa has reached the age of majority and,therefore,is not an indian child within the meaning of the act.we therefore affirm the juvenile court orders.
background 
prior dependencies 
melissa was born in june with a congenital chromosomal anomaly that has severely retarded her development her medical problems included cerebral palsy,limited mobility,mental retardation and a cleft palate.
mother inability to care for her daughter first resulted in intervention by the alameda county social services agency the agency in october.after a period of time in the care of her maternal grandmother,the trial court returned melissa to mother custody and retained jurisdiction.the dependency case was dismissed in november.although melissa was developmentally delayed and had not yet begun to walk,she appeared to be healthy and thriving.
the second dependency case was initiated in january,after police found cocaine and drug paraphernalia in mother home.the home was filthy and her children were undernourished and suffering from neglect.both children were placed in a regional center of the east bay regional center community care facility.
mother suffers from an organic mental disorder and mild mental retardation,and has a lengthy history of substance abuse.her initial compliance with drug treatment programs and drug testing was sporadic.but by december,her case manager believed mother was clean and sober.
after the children appeared to deteriorate while in mother care for overnight visits,it was recommended that she needed supervision and assistance in child rearing.in december,the agency recommended that the children be returned to mother with extensive family maintenance services.mother completed her reunification plan in spirit as well as in form and attended outpatient drug treatment and therapy even after it was no longer required.the dependency case was dismissed in may,when the agency reported that mother parenting skills were excellent and the risk to the children was substantially reduced.
the april detention 
the case before this court began when melissa was years old,and mother was arrested for driving a stolen car.police found melissa and her brother in a trailer towed by the car mother was driving.melissa was and unable to walk or stand for long periods of time.
the detention report recounted melissa long history of abuse and neglect.in november,melissa maternal grandmother reported that mother and the children had moved in with her and that mother left the children with her for weeks at a time without providing money or food for their care.she said melissa could neither walk,speak nor use the toilet by herself.melissa maternal aunt reported that she kicked mother out of her home several months earlier because mother was using drugs and her boyfriend was a drug dealer.the aunt said mother did not take good care of the children.
although melissa maternal grandmother had cared for melissa for much of her life,she was too ill to do so when this case began.melissa was placed in a group home and when she arrived she appeared to have been grossly neglected.melissa did not communicate at all.she slept during the day and was up all night.she cried for no reason and sat with her hands behind her back all day.the home staff was required to help with her activities of daily living,including bathing,toileting,dressing and eating.although she was able to walk,she would not get up unless prompted and tired easily.she also would persistently bite her hands and wrists.melissa seemed to lack stimulation at home.her school attendance was sporadic,and she had not gone to school for almost a year before this dependency.
family members reported that mother had a substance abuse problem,but she denied that she used drugs.she said she was arrested because she bought a stolen car from a friend.she lived in maternal grandmother trailer,and said she could not enroll melissa in school because her name was not on grandmother lease.
the juvenile court sustained jurisdiction under welfare and institutions code section,subdivisions b and g,and ordered the agency to provide mother with reunification services.
october review 
the review report recommended that melissa remain a dependent of the juvenile court.mother enrolled in a transitional treatment program when she was released from jail in april,but she left the program after several weeks without completing it.she had not cooperated with drug or alcohol testing and was homeless.during this period she falsely reported to melissa school,social workers and police that melissa had been kidnapped.mother cooperated in setting up regular visitation with melissa,but her disruptive behavior limited those supervised visits.
melissa showed significant improvement.she was doing well in her high school transitional program.her behavior decreased and she was learning how to eat solid foods.the group home operator said there would be a high degree of risk to melissa if she were to reunify with her mother.
although mother was given notice of the review hearing,she did not appear.the court found that mother had made partial progress toward alleviating the causes for melissa placement and ordered continued reunification services.
by march,mother had complied with her case plan to the best of her ability.she was enrolled in an outpatient treatment program,cooperating with drug testing,receiving therapy,and attending parenting classes.but several of her drug test results were positive for cocaine and methamphetamine.mother told her social worker she had located housing,but could not remember the address.she consistently visited with melissa each month and cooperated with the social worker and group home staff.visits appeared to be going well.her supervising case manager said mother was a wonderful person,but that her somewhat condescending behavior and ongoing unresolved mental health concerns and addiction continue to present concerns regarding mother ability to provide appropriate care to a child with special needs.
melissa had improved physically and emotionally over the previous months.the agency still believed that returning melissa to mother care would place her at risk.the court found that mother had made no progress,continued melissa as a dependent child of the court,and extended reunification services for six more months.
september review 
melissa turned in june.in august,the agency sought a continuance of the review in order to arrange an appropriate transition plan for melissa.mother wanted melissa returned to her custody.mother was still enrolled in her outpatient treatment program and had worked closely with her counselor on the issues leading to melissa removal.she had obtained housing at the paradise trailer court in san leandro attended substance abuse sessions,parenting classes and therapy visited monthly with melissa and made herself available to work with the regional center as it relates to services for her daughter.mother drug tests were negative,but the agency had not yet received test results for june and july.
