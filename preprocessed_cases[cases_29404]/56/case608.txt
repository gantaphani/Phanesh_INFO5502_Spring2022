applicable law 
section,subdivision c,provides in part if the minor is removed from the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian as the result of an order of wardship made pursuant to section,the order shall specify that the minor may not be held in physical confinement for a period in excess of the maximum term of imprisonment which could be imposed upon an adult convicted of the offense or offenses which brought or continued the minor under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.as used in this section and in section,maximum term of imprisonment means the longest of the three time periods set forth in paragraph of subdivision a of section of the penal code,but without the need to follow the provisions of subdivision b of section of the penal code or to consider time for good behavior or participation pursuant to sections,and of the penal code,plus enhancements which must be proven if pled.if the court elects to aggregate the period of physical confinement on multiple counts or multiple petitions,including previously sustained petitions adjudging the minor a ward within section,the maximum term of imprisonment shall be the aggregate term of imprisonment specified in subdivision a of section of the penal code,which includes any additional term imposed pursuant to section,or of the penal code,and section of the health and safety code.if the charged offense is a misdemeanor or a felony not included within the scope of section of the penal code,the maximum term of imprisonment is the longest term of imprisonment prescribed by law.rule b of the california rules of court provides if the youth is declared a ward under section and ordered removed from the physical custody of a parent or guardian,the court must specify and note in the minutes the maximum period of confinement under section.
penal code section section,subdivision a,directs the principal term shall consist of the greatest term of imprisonment imposed by the court for any of the crimes,including any term imposed for applicable specific enhancements.the subordinate term for each consecutive offense shall consist of of the middle term of imprisonment prescribed for each other felony conviction for which a consecutive term of imprisonment is imposed,and shall include of the term imposed for any specific enhancements applicable to those subordinate offenses.
section,subdivision c formerly subdivision b provides a ward committed to the division of juvenile facilities may not be held in physical confinement for a period of time in excess of the maximum period of imprisonment that could be imposed upon an adult convicted of the offense or offenses that brought or continued the minor under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.a ward committed to the division of juvenile facilities also may not be held in physical confinement for a period of time in excess of the maximum term of physical confinement set by the court based upon the facts and circumstances of the matter or matters that brought or continued the ward under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court,which may not exceed the maximum period of adult confinement as determined pursuant to this section.stats,ch.before its recent amendment,the section referred to the department of the youth authority rather than to the division of juvenile facilities.stats,ch,pp,operative september.

since,courts have held that this provision requires a juvenile court,when committing a minor to the cya now division of juvenile facilities to explicitly exercise its discretion to set a maximum term of physical confinement based on the facts and circumstances of the case,which term can not exceed the maximum period of imprisonment that could be imposed on an adult convicted of the same offense.see in re carlos th,d in re sean th,d.where the record has shown that a juvenile court did not believe it had any discretion with respect to the maximum term of confinement under a cya commitment,appellate courts have remanded the matter to the juvenile court with directions to exercise its discretion in setting appellant maximum term of confinement,pursuant to section,subdivision b.see in re carlos,supra,th at,d in re sean,supra,th at,d.
in re jacob th,d,a minor committed to the california youth authority contended that the court failed to exercise its recently conferred discretion pursuant to section,subdivision b now subdivision c to set a maximum term of physical confinement less than the adult maximum term of imprisonment.id.at,d.although the appellate court in in re jacob recognized the general presumption that trial courts are aware of and follow applicable law,which derives in part from the presumption of evidence code section that official duty has been regularly performed people stowell cal th,d,and recognized the general rule that a reviewing court can not presume error from a silent record see denham superior court cal d,an order is presumed correct,all intendments are indulged in to support it on matters as to which the record is silent,and error must be affirmatively shown,it nevertheless held that where the juvenile court sets the maximum term of physical confinement at cya at the maximum term of an adult confinement,the record must show the court did so after considering the particular facts and circumstances of the matter before it.in re jacob,supra,th at,d.
the appellate court in in re jacob stated w hile the statute does not require a recitation of the facts and circumstances upon which the trial court depends,or a discussion of their relative weight,the record must reflect the court has considered those facts and circumstances in setting its maximum term of physical confinement even though that term may turn out to be the same as would have been imposed on an adult for the same offenses.th at,d.the appellate court remanded the matter to the juvenile court with directions to set a maximum term of physical confinement based upon the facts and circumstances of the case and to complete judicial council form in its entirety and forward a copy of the completed form to cya.id.at,d.
california rules of court,rule former rule a requires a court to complete commitment to the california department of corrections and rehabilitation,division of juvenile justice form if it orders the youth committed to the california department of corrections and rehabilitation,division of juvenile justice djj.there is a place on the standardized form for specifying the term for each offense and for stating the maximum period of confinement in years and months.
no oral pronouncement of maximum period of confinement required 
appellant contends that section,subdivision c,and rule b required the juvenile court to orally pronounce the maximum period of confinement on the record.although neither the statutory provision nor court rule expressly mandates such an oral pronouncement,appellant nevertheless reasons that an oral pronouncement is required because the superior court must orally pronounce whether an offense committed by a minor was a felony or a misdemeanor and must orally pronounce a judgment of conviction in adult criminal cases.he urges us to remand the matter to the juvenile court for an oral pronouncement of the maximum period of confinement.

we see nothing in the language of section,subdivision c,requiring an oral pronouncement.it states that the order shall specify.the comparisons to section and adult sentencing law are not persuasive because there are differences in the applicable statutory language.
section,unlike section,explicitly requires a declaration.section states if the minor is found to have committed an offense which would in the case of an adult be punishable alternatively as a felony or a misdemeanor,the court shall declare the offense to be a misdemeanor or felony.italics added.in in re manzy cal th,d,based upon the plain statutory language and its prior decisions,the california supreme court determined that section required an express oral declaration and it rejected the argument the lower court imposition of a maximum period of confinement constituted an implied declaration under section id.at,d.
the supreme court stated in manzy,supra,cal th,d,what is not at issue is what the juvenile court must do.the language of the provision is unambiguous.it requires an explicit declaration by the juvenile court whether an offense would be a felony or misdemeanor in the case of an adult.webster new internat.dict.ed at defining declare as to make known publicly,formally,or explicitly to state emphatically it noted that it had already decided in in re kenneth cal d,that neither the pleading,the minute order,nor the setting of a period of physical confinement may substitute for a declaration by the juvenile court as to whether an offense is a misdemeanor or felony.in re kenneth,supra,cal d at.id.at,d.as noted above,section,subdivision c,does not use the word declare.
the language of rule a and rule a,which implements section,is also different than the language of rule b,which concerns the maximum period of confinement within the meaning of section.rule a states at the disposition hearing if the court has not previously considered whether any offense is a misdemeanor or felony,the court must do so at this time and state its
