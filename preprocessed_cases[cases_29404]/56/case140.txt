errol,a juvenile and a member of the fort peck tribe,appeals his delinquency adjudication and sentence for burglarizing the bureau of indian affairs bia facilities management building on the fort peck indian reservation.we hold that the criminal statute under which he was indian major crimes act mca codified at does not give jurisdiction to the federal government to prosecute him,nor does it accord the district court jurisdiction to adjudge him delinquent.accordingly,we vacate errol delinquency adjudication and dismiss the information against him.
background 
on june,the facilities manager for the bia buildings on the fort peck indian reservation discovered that his office had been broken into and that a brown pickup truck,a cell phone,and a radio had been taken.a fort peck tribal investigator subsequently interrogated errol,who was then sixteen years old,about the crime.errol confessed that he was involved with two other boys in committing the burglary.
on may,errol was charged with committing an act of juvenile,that he did knowingly and unlawfully enter an occupied structure,that is the bia facilities management building,in poplar,montana,with the intent to commit an offense therein,theft,which would have been a crime in violation of and and,if committed by an adult.the government also filed a certification pursuant to,stating that the state of montana did not have jurisdiction over the crime and that the crime involved a substantial federal interest.on june,defense counsel filed a number of pretrial motions,raising a variety of issues including a challenge to the district court jurisdiction the district court denied these motions without a hearing.
at the conclusion of a bench trial held on september,the district court orally adjudged errol a juvenile delinquent for having committed the.the district court then sentenced errol to two years probation and six months incarceration as a condition of that probation.he now appeals.
we have jurisdiction to decide this appeal under.

iii.discussion 
pursuant to,juvenile delinquency is defined as the violation of a law of the united states committed by a person prior to his eighteenth birthday which would have been a crime if committed by an adult.furthermore,under the mca,a,in order to confer jurisdiction on the federal courts for burglaries and other major crimes committed by indians on reservation land,the alleged offense must be commit ted against the person or property of another indian or other person.we hold that because this case involved the burglary of a government because the government is not a person within the meaning of a errol offense did not constitute a violation of a law of the united states as charged under the mca,and the district court,therefore,lacked the requisite jurisdiction to try him 
in the case united states belgarde,d,the district court confronted a similar situation involving a montana department of family services building located on an indian reservation that had been burglarized by an indian.the government charged the defendant under the mca.the district court granted defendant motion to dismiss the indictment,on jurisdictional grounds,finding that the victim of the alleged offense was not an indian or other person under.the government moved for reconsideration.id.at.in its motion,the government argued that jurisdiction was proper because other federal criminal statutes define the word person to include entities other than individuals,specifically,government agencies.id.citing c,a,a and.
for reasons we find persuasive,the district court rejected the government argument.the district court observed,first,that none of the statutes cited by the government include within their definition of person any government agencies,instead listing,inter alia,corporations,partnerships,and trusts.id.the court also noted that addresses the situation where,as here,a federal statute is silent with respect to the meaning of person,and mandates that unless the context indicates otherwise,the term include s individuals,corporations,companies,associations,firms,partnerships,societies,and joint stock companies,as well as individuals a list that does not include government agencies.id.at.finally,the court discussed the statute legislative history and concluded that there is nothing in the legislative history of section,or its purpose,that suggests the word person includes government agencies.id.quoting.accordingly,the district court denied the government motion to reconsider,and affirmed its ruling that the mca did not provide jurisdiction for the prosecution of the crime before it.
like the belgarde court,we can find no relevant decisional or statutory authority to support the proposition that a government agency falls within the definition of person as used in.nor can we find anything in the legislative history of to suggest that congress intended the term person to be construed in a more expansive manner than its ordinary usage and meaning requires.we therefore find the reasoning of belgarde highly persuasive.
as the supreme court recently explained,in vermont agency of natural res.united states,d,there is a longstanding interpretive presumption that person does not include the sovereign the presumption is,of course,not a hard and fast rule of exclusion,but it may be disregarded only upon some affirmative showing of statutory intent to the contrary.internal quotation marks omitted see also united states united mine workers.in common usage,that term persons does not include the sovereign,and statutes employing it will ordinarily not be construed to do so.united states cooper.in the context of the sherman act,rejecting the argument that person be read to include the federal government,noting that t he more natural inference,we think,is that the meaning of the word was in both uses limited to what are usually known as natural and artificial persons,that is,individuals and corporations.but see georgia evans.interpreting person to include states and distinguishing cooper on the ground that legislative intent was to permit states to bring suit under the sherman act.here,evidence of legislative intent to include government agencies within the term other persons is nonexistent,and,although it is possible that congress intended person to be construed broadly under,such speculation can not by itself suffice to overcome this longstanding presumption 
in the criminal context,we are all the more reluctant to extend federal jurisdiction beyond the plain meaning of the statutory language under the rule of lenity.as the court stated in tanner united states,d if the legislative history fail s to clarify the statutory language our rule of lenity would compel us to construe the statute in favor of petitioners,as criminal defendants in these cases.id.at.quoting dixson united states,d.hence,even if we were to determine that the meaning of the term person as used in was ambiguous,the rule of lenity precludes our finding jurisdiction over the defendant in this case.
we are also mindful that the standard principles of statutory construction do not have their usual force in cases involving indian law.eeoc karuk tribe hous,cir quoting montana blackfeet tribe of indians,d.because of the unique trust relationship between the united states and indian tribes,ambiguous provisions in both treaty and matters should be construed liberally in favor of the indians.county of oneida oneida indian nation,d see also white mountain apache tribe bracker,d finding a mbiguities in federal law have been construed generously in order to comport with traditional notions of sovereignty and with the federal policy of encouraging tribal independence karuk,at applying the canon to statutory interpretation american indian law.because the mca constitutes an incursion into the tribal sovereignty of indian tribes,justified by the guardianship powers of congress,see united states kagama.upholding constitutionality of the mca,as an exercise of congressional power commensurate with its duty of protection of a race once powerful see also david getches,charles wilkinson,robert williams,federal indian law ed,ambiguous provisions in the mca must be interpreted in favor of the tribes.because,as discussed further below,the general crimes act gca,grants the federal government concurrent criminal jurisdiction with the tribes,while the mca grants exclusive jurisdiction to the federal government,as between those two statutes the latter represents a greater diminishment of tribal autonomy and ought not to be expanded by courts where such expansion is not demanded by the language of,what is here,an ambiguous statute.this canon of construction,therefore,directs that we limit the word person to its plain meaning.
in holding that federal jurisdiction does not extend to crimes against government entities under the mca,we do not mean to suggest that a loophole exists in the panoply of federal criminal statutes governing indian country.to the contrary,we believe,first,that the government could have charged errol under the gca which,by extending the assimilative crimes act aca codified at to indian territory,would have rendered him criminally liable for a like offense and a like punishment under state,presumably,for burglaries committed against public facilities second,and perhaps more easily,the federal government could have prosecuted the defendant under,which prohibits the theft of government property.this federal law of general,applicability,applies to all persons,both indian and,both within and outside of indian country.united states young,cir holding that,assaulting a federal officer g,possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and c,use of a firearm during a crime of violence,are all federal laws of general applicability under which the federal government may prosecute indians for commission of these crimes in indian country.see also united states begay,cir holding that federal laws of general applicability may be used to prosecute indians for crimes committed in indian country,specifically,inter alia,conspiracy united states johnson,cir noting exception to exclusive tribal jurisdiction for federal laws of general applicability see also american indian law.thus it is clear,under our own precedent,that the federal government could have prosecuted the defendant under,the federal statute prohibiting theft of government property.
in this case,however,we conclude the government simply charged errol under the wrong statute.
iv.conclusion 
at virtually every level of plain meaning of the statutory language the longstanding interpretive canon presuming that person does not include the government the lack of contrary evidence from the legislative history or other indicators of congressional intent the rule of lenity and the canon of indian law are compelled to conclude that the district court lacked jurisdiction under the mca to convict errol of the offense for which he was charged.we accordingly vacate errol delinquency adjudication and remand to the district court with instructions to dismiss the information.
vacated and remanded with instructions to dismiss.
i respectfully disagree with the majority reading of the word person under,the major crimes act.contrary to the majority,i believe that,for the fourteen crimes enumerated under the major crimes act,congress intended that they be charged under the mca rather than the general crimes act regardless of the identity of the victim.therefore,by excluding a government agency from the list of possible victims of burglary,the majority creates a loophole in the statutes governing federal criminal jurisdiction over indians in indian country.
congress enacted the mca in response to the supreme court holding in ex parte crow dog,which held that a murder of an indian by an indian could not be prosecuted by the federal government under the general crimes act and that this crime was only punishable via the limited remedies of the tribe.the outcome in crow dog was compelled by the limited scope of jurisdiction over crimes in indian country at that time,under the general crimes act gca.the gca provided for jurisdiction over general federal enclave crimes in indian country however,it contained two important exceptions to that grant of jurisdiction these crimes,when committed against an indian by another indian,could not be prosecuted by the federal government,and if the tribe had already prosecuted and punished someone for a potential gca crime,the federal government could not subsequently prosecute that individual.see.as crow dog illustrated,these exceptions led to some grave crimes falling through the cracks of the statutes,prompting public outcry.congress responded with the major crimes act,by giving the united states jurisdiction over crimes committed by an indian against an indian,when they were of a serious nature.see keeble united states,d quoting statement of sponsor of the act if an indian commits a crime against an indian on an indian reservation there is now no law to punish the offense except,as i have said,the law of the tribe,which is just no law at all.to do so,congress chose seven crimes subsequently amended to fourteen that were sufficiently severe so as to warrant further intrusion into indian sovereignty and their criminal jurisdiction,and gave the united states jurisdiction over these crimes.see also united states maloney,cir listing the offenses added by amendment to the act.
the most logical manner in which congress could have achieved this goal would have been to merely state that,for those major crimes,the exception contained within the general crimes act does not apply and therefore,indians who commit those crimes against other indians may be prosecuted by the federal government.however,congress chose a different path with the major crimes act,which states that it gives jurisdiction over a ny indian who commits against the person or property of another indian or other person any of the following offenses and then goes on to enumerate those offenses emphasis added.the wording indian or other person indicates more than just the erasure of that exception in the general crimes act,by withdrawing the entire universe of those fourteen crimes from the ambit of the general crimes act.
in henry united states,cir,we addressed the question of what to do with the potential overlap created by the wording of the major crimes act,specifically whether or not an enumerated crime rape in the mca should be prosecuted under the mca,when committed against a.previously,a rape of a by an indian would have been punishable under the general crimes act,but now with the enumeration of these crimes in the mca,there seemed to be two possible statutes under which to charge the crime.the government chose to prosecute under the general crimes act,and we found this to be the incorrect choice.see henry,at.we held instead that the crime of rape an enumerated crime in the mca committed by an indian against a victim on an indian reservation should be prosecuted under section,the major crimes act,rather than section,the general crimes act.henry,at t he indictment made erroneous reference to.
our reasoning in henry is particularly relevant to the interpretation of the word person here.we explained that,for the enumerated crimes in the mca,the other person language can not be disregarded as not being a congressional remedy for the lacunae created by the crow dog decision.just as congress found it desirable to find a remedy for the ousting of federal jurisdiction over crimes committed by one indian against another,it applied the same remedy for the ousting of federal jurisdiction over crimes committed by an indian against any other person.id.at.as felix cohen explained in his handbook of federal indian law,the addition of the added language or other person created duplication between the act and the indian country crimes act in cases where an indian is accused of one of the offenses listed in the major crimes act against a victim.since the major crimes act is more specific and was enacted later,and since the indian country crimes act otherwise known as the general crimes act provides,exce
