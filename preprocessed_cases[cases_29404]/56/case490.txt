factual and procedural background 
shanna is jason and kathryn mother,and jamal was shanna boyfriend.on february,shanna called,believing jamal had attempted to drown jason in the bathtub.shanna walked into the bathroom and saw jamal over jason and jason eyelids were blue and he was lethargic,and she heard jamal say that what you get for breaking my cigarettes.italics omitted.when police arrived,they noted a strong marijuana odor,and thus they requested a toxicology screen for the children.they also arrested jamal for domestic violence based on shanna report that he had hit her two to three weeks earlier.he remained incarcerated throughout the proceedings.
jason tested negative for drugs,but the examining doctor found a bruise on his left thigh consistent with nonaccidental injury.the san diego county health and human services agency the agency removed the children from the home and filed dependency petitions on their behalves.jason petition alleged he had been exposed to violent confrontations in which jamal punched shanna in the head several times,giving her a black eye,and jason was found with injuries consistent with abuse or neglect.shanna named jamal as kathryn father and willie as jason father.
shanna told the social worker she had used marijuana and crystal methamphetamine,but she voluntarily joined narcotics anonymous and had been clean for four months.she admitted,however,the recent use of alcohol.shanna sister nina advised the social worker that jamal had abused shanna other times.shanna would make jamal leave the house,but she would always let him return.the social worker later learned shanna tested positive for methamphetamine when she gave birth to kathryn a few months earlier.
willie reported to the social worker that he loves his son and he wants what is best for jason and he believes his son should be with his mother.he said he is not in a position to be his son caregiver but if the mother does not get him back right away he would like for jason to be with his aunt nina.willie used very affectionate words when describing jason and stated the mother told him that jason was his son when jason was little.he stated in the beginning jason did not look like him but now he does however,he would still like to take a paternity to know for sure if he is jason father.
jamal signed a paternity declaration that stated shanna told him he is jason father.willie signed a paternity declaration that stated the same thing.willie declaration also stated he had neither lived with nor supported jason,he did not agree to have his name on the birth certificate and he was unsure of whether he was the father.the court appointed an attorney for him and ordered genetic testing.the test established willie paternity,and on june,the court entered a judgment of paternity.at the jurisdiction and disposition hearing,the court declared the children dependents and placed them in a relative care,and ordered reunification services for shanna.
at a june,hearing,the court authorized reunification services for willie.he did not attend the hearing but his attorney advised the court he was opposed to participating in any services.the attorney stated willie told him,i not in a position to request custody today.i not working and i just not in a position to physically take custody.the court advised the attorney that if willie did not participate in services,it could hinder any later attempt to obtain custody.
willie telephoned the social worker on september,and stated he felt no need to participate in counseling,a parenting class or substance abuse education or treatment,as outlined in his case plan.he stated that he would like placement,but that he had done services several years back with another child,and he felt that the agency was using his past against him,and setting up obstacles for him.on september the social worker called him,and he reported he was in dallas,texas looking for a job.he did not mention jason or any plans to reunify with or care for him.on october the social worker spoke with willie again and he was still in dallas.he had heard the agency was considering placing both jason and kathryn with jamal family,and he objected to that possibility insofar as jason was concerned.willie told the social worker he was interested in placement,and she reminded him about the a gency expectations for services,and that it had questions as to why he did not request placement early on.willie responded that before he knew jason was his son he did not want to get attached to the child,and then learn that it was not his,because that would be too devastating.willie said he would participate in services if it would result in jason placement with him.however,he never did so.
in an october,report for the review hearing,the agency recommended the termination of reunification services and the scheduling of a permanency planning hearing under section.shanna was not in compliance with any component of her reunification plan and willie remained in dallas.the agency learned willie was charged with a drug offense in,he completed a drug treatment program in,and it appears he is a registered gang member until.
the court continued the review hearing to december.it also ordered shanna to enroll in sarms.
on november,sometime after moving back to san diego,willie called the social worker and requested a visit with jason.the agency provided him with supervised visits.
the court again continued the review hearing.in december the agency filed a supplemental petition under section,explaining the children placement with a relative was no longer appropriate because shanna had taken the children from the relative home.the agency placed the children in foster care.
in a december report,the agency noted shanna was not in compliance with her case plan.the report advised that willie continues to deny the protective issues regarding the mother.he feels the mother is a good mom and he does not understand why he would be expected to protect the child from the mother.he states the a gency is victimizing the mother for reaching out for help.he was offered services,but declined them,saying he has done services before with his daughter,and he does not need to do them now.
on june,a combined hearing was held on the section petition and review.shanna did not attend and her whereabouts were unknown.willie attorney explained he was absent because he had a new job.the attorney advised the court that willie had changed his position and is now asking for custody of his son.willie sought a continuance but the court denied it,commenting that he sat on the sideline the entire time here.he never formally requested custody.he is not engaged in services the court explained it was willie burden to show changed circumstances i f he can show evidence he is ready,willing,and able and it in the best interest of this child to be placed with him today,the child can be placed with him today,but that his burden.
the social worker,stefanie blue,testified she had reviewed the visitation logs but had not observed visits between willie and jason.the logs indicated willie had consistently visited jason since about the second week in december and the visits were favorable.willie acted appropriately,he was attentive and showed interaction with jason,he looked out for jason and he brought toys and food for jason.jason greeted willie with a smile and a hug,called willie daddy and spontaneously told willie,i love you.blue had no information that willie lacked parenting skills,and said,i think the basic parenting skills are adequate.
blue believed it was not in jason best interest to be placed with willie.she was primarily concerned that willie and shanna continued to have contact,and shanna was not participating in any services.shanna was seen dropping willie off for visits with jason,and she reported that she had been out drinking with willie and he was in the car with her when she was arrested for driving under the influence.blue had explained to willie many times about the risk of jason exposure to shanna,and willie had gone back and forth from saying he wants the child with the mother to why ca he be with me then,and then just declaring his mother the best placement,so he wavered back and forth.the last time blue spoke with willie on the matter,he felt the kids should be with their mother.blue was also concerned that he declined services and felt they were unnecessary,he did not seek placement from the beginning of the proceedings,and he was a registered gang member but he was not forthcoming about his personal life.further,he left town and returned to town without notifying her.
the court sustained the allegations of the section petition and continued jason as a dependent.the court found that return of jason to shanna would create a substantial risk of detriment to his physical and emotional.the court determined by clear and convincing evidence there was no change in circumstances or that it would be in jason best interest to be placed with willie,adding that he had over a year to try to get custody,and his preference would be to give jason to the mom so he can continue to have a nice,visitation and kind of play the nice dad,but that is not what being a father is about.
in its assessment report the agency,through social worker jessica schmidt,explained jason and kathryn are adorable siblings who are adoptable due to their young age,engaging personalities,ability to form attachments,and overall minimal level of care required to meet their needs.their caretaker was committed to adopting them,and there were other approved families in san diego county willing to adopt siblings like jason and kathryn.the report states that jason enjoys seeing willie and enjoys his time with willie.however,jason does depart easily from willie after visits and jason also does not look to willie to meet his daily needs.
at the november,permanency planning hearing,schmidt testified she had observed five visits between willie and jason.jason called willie daddy and was happy to see willie.when visits were over jason usually says and sometimes he gives a hug and a kiss,and sometimes he okay just to wave at the door.after one visit jason clung to schmidt and did not want to go to willie to tell him goodbye.overall,jason separates fairly easily and is okay emotionally when he departs.schmidt agreed willie usually behaved appropriately with jason,and he was gentle and caring toward his son.once when jason threw a tantrum,however,willie pointed to his belt,and he said this is for you jason,and the monitor had to intervene at that time and say that he can only use as appropriate discipline.
the court found it likely the children will be adopted,and determined none of the exceptions to adoption is applicable.the court terminated parental rights and chose adoption as the preferred permanent plan.
discussion 
ifinding of unfitness 
willie contends he is a father within the meaning of kelsey,supra,cal th,d,and the court violated his due process rights by terminating his parental rights without ever making an express finding of unfitness.alternatively,he contends that if he does not qualify as a kelsey father,the court could not terminate his rights as a mere biological father absent a finding of unfitness we disagree with both points.
under california dependency law,presumed fathers have greater rights than mere biological fathers.in re zacharia cal th,d,zacharia.for instance,only a presumed,not a mere biological,father is a parent entitled to receive reunification services.id.at,d.
a man is a presumed father if he meets the criteria of family code section.under that statute,a man who has neither legally married nor attempted to legally marry the mother of his child can not become a presumed father unless he both receives the child into his home and openly holds out the child as his natural child.adoption of michael cal th,d,zacharia,supra,cal th at,d,parental rights are generally conferred on a man not merely based on biology but on the father connection to the mother child through marriage or attempted marriage or his commitment to the child citation omitted,subd.d.a biological or natural father is one whose biological paternity has been established,but who has not achieved presumed father status as defined in family code section.zacharia,supra,at,fn,d.
willie is not a presumed father within the meaning of family code section,and he does not argue otherwise.rather,he claims for the first time on appeal that he is a father within the meaning of kelsey,supra,cal th,d.he forfeited appellate review of the issue,however,by not raising it at the juvenile court.a party seeking status as a father under kelsey must be clear he wants to be so declared.in re elijah th,d.in any event,even without forfeiture his claim lacks merit 
to qualify as a kelsey father,a biological father must show he promptly stepped forward to assume full parental responsibilities for the child,including a financial,emotional or other commitment,the child mother thwarted his efforts to assume his parental responsibilities and he demonstrated a willingness to assume full custody of the child.kelsey,supra,cal th at,d,adoption of michael supra,cal th at,d.
willie asserts he is a kelsey father because he was much more than a sperm donor.he cites a notation in records from children hospital and health center from jason examination on february,that shanna reported willie saw jason a lot,and every day from august through december.willie reported he often will meet shanna and jason at a park,but he had not seen jason for a month.further,willie hoped jason could be placed with shanna sister.willie said he is really set up to take jason because he has a roommate and the aunt has kids with toys,willie was only willing to take jason if staying with the aunt is not possible.
willie points to no evidence suggesting shanna or anyone else precluded him from establishing himself as a presumed father.further,he points to no evidence he promptly stepped forward to assume any parental responsibilities,let alone full parental responsibilities.he does not,for instance,assert he ever provided any financial support for jason.he admitted in his paternity questionnaire that shanna told him he was jason father but he doubted that because jason did not initially look like him.even when his paternity was established willie refused reunification services and did not seek custody.rather,he wanted jason placed with shanna or her sister.willie did not ask the court for custody until june,approximately a year after his paternity was established.under the circumstances he has not suffered a substantive due process violation by not being declared a father under kelsey criteria.in re elijah,supra,th at,d.
willie only status was that of a biological father.a biological father desire to establish a personal relationship with a child,without more,is not a fundamental liberty interest protected by the due process clause.citation.in re christopher th,d,italics omitted.parental rights do not spring from the biological connection between parent and child.they require relationships more enduring.citation,quoting lehr robertson,d.
in the termination of parental rights area the mere biological father does not fare as well as the kelsey father since it appears clear that his parental rights may be terminated based solely upon the child best interest and without any requirement for a finding of detriment or unfitness.seiser kumli,cal.juvenile courts practice and procedure c,citing kelsey,supra,cal th at,d,if an unwed father promptly comes forward and demonstrates a full commitment to his parental,financial,and fed
