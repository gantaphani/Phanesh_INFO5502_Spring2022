in this juvenile dependency proceeding,brothers and dependents appeal a june postdisposition order continuing reunification services for their parents.dependents were detained from their mother home in april.shortly thereafter,dependents were placed with their father at his residence.in september,dependents were detained for a second time pursuant to a welfare institutions code section supplemental petition parents received reunification services following this second detention.at a review hearing held in june,dependents contended their parents had already received more than two years of child welfare services,which exceeds the months of services statutorily authorized by section.it was therefore inappropriate,according to dependents,for the court to conduct a review in june pursuant to section,subdivision e,and to continue reunification services at that time.dependents argue in the alternative there is insufficient evidence to support the court finding of a substantial probability that dependents may be returned to parents within the six months following the june hearing,subd.e.
we affirm.the trial court properly interpreted the relevant dependency statutes in finding parents were entitled to additional reunification services at the june hearing.section time limits for reunification services start to run when a child is removed from all parental custody at the disposition hearing.the clock does not start running when the child is placed with a noncustodial parent pursuant to section.there is also sufficient evidence supporting the court finding of a substantial probability dependents may be returned to the care of their parents by the review.
as a result of allegations of abuse by mother boyfriend and a failure to protect by mother,orange county social services agency ssa first took age six at the time and age at the time into protective custody in april.the court held a detention hearing on april,at which time the court continued the detention of dependents,authorized ssa to release dependents to a parent,relative,or suitable adult,and ordered reunification services to commence as soon as possible.mother appeared at the april hearing father had not yet been located.by may,father had been located,ssa had referred mother and father to various programs,and mother had commenced a child abuse treatment program.
on may,ssa released dependents into their father custody.on may,the court conducted a jurisdictional and dispositional hearing at which it declared and dependent children under section,subdivision d at this hearing,the court agreed to a stipulated case plan in which father received family maintenance services and mother received an enhancement plan.at least some of the services actually participated in by mother,however,were ordered by the criminal court and not by the dependency court.following the disposition,the court provided notice of and conducted two separate reviews,which ssa designated as section hearings.
in september,ssa detained dependents and filed a section supplemental petition alleging father had engaged in misconduct.in october,ssa placed dependents with their grandmother.on november,the court conducted a jurisdictional and dispositional hearing on the amended petition,and approved a proposed order signed by all parties,including dependents,which provided reunification services for the family and set the matter for a review the following spring.
at the june review,conducted pursuant to section,subdivision e,the court continued reunification services for dependents parents,and set a section,subdivision f,permanency hearing for october counsel for dependents objected,claiming the matter should be set for a section hearing because parents had already received services beyond those authorized by section,subdivision a.the court rejected this argument,explaining enhancement and maintenance services previously received by dependents parents did not constitute reunification services.in essence,the court found section did not apply during the period of the dependency in which dependents were placed with their father and their mother did not receive reunification services.the court also found a substantial probability dependents may be returned to their parents by the permanency review,and therefore continued the case to the review and declined to set a section hearing.
discussion 
dependents argue the court abused its discretion by allowing reunification services to continue in this matter.relying primarily on in re th,d,dependents contend parents had already received child welfare services in excess of those allowed by section,subdivision a,by the june hearing we begin our analysis of the issue with a review of the statutes applicable to this action.
placement of dependent child with previously noncustodial parent 
at the may jurisdictional and dispositional hearing,dependents were ordered removed from the physical custody of their mother.when the court removes a dependent child from the physical custody of his or her parent pursuant to section,subdivision c,it must first determine whether there is a parent of the child,with whom the child was not residing at the time that the events or conditions arose that brought the child within the provisions of section,who desires to assume custody of the child,subd.a.here,the court followed this statutory mandate and awarded custody of dependents to father.
services for parents with custody of dependent children 
if,as in this case,a child is placed with a previously noncustodial parent at the dispositional hearing,the court may,among other things,o rder that the parent assume custody subject to the supervision of the juvenile court.in that case the court may order that reunification services be provided to the parent or guardian from whom the child is being removed,or the court may order that services be provided solely to the parent who is assuming physical custody in order to allow that parent to retain later custody without court supervision,or that services be provided to both parents,in which case the court shall determine,at review hearings held pursuant to section,which parent,if either,shall have custody of the child,subd.b.
the court here did not provide reunification services for mother following the placement with father in may,but did impose supervision of father custody,provide family maintenance services to father,and provide enhancement services to mother.there is no statutory time limit on the provision of family maintenance services if the court believes the objectives of the service plan are being met.bridget superior court th,d see.
if the child has not been removed from the physical custody of his or her parent,the court must schedule a review hearing pursuant to section to be held within six months of the date of the declaration of dependency and every six months thereafter.bridget superior court,supra,th at,d see seiser kumli,cal.juvenile courts practice and procedure ed.the court held two review hearings between may and november,which were designated by ssa as section review hearings.
entitlement to services under section 
section,subdivision a,currently provides in relevant part whenever a child is removed from a parent or guardian custody,the juvenile court shall order the social worker to provide child welfare services to the child and the child mother and statutorily presumed father or guardians.child welfare services are presumptively provided for months from the date the child entered foster care with regard to children over the age of three on the date of initial removal from the physical custody of his or her parent,subd.a.the presumptive rule for children under the age of three on the date of initial removal is that services shall not exceed a period of six months from the date the child entered foster care,subd.a see in re christina th,d.the court may combine a sibling group that includes at least one child less than three years old at the time of his or her initial removal.in such cases,the court applies the shortened child welfare services presumption to all members of the sibling group,subd.a.notwithstanding the section,subdivision a,presumptive allowable periods of services,services may be extended up to a maximum time period not to exceed months after the date the child was originally removed from physical custody of his or her parent or guardian,subd.a,subds.e,f,g.
section,subdivision a,refers throughout its nine dense paragraphs almost exclusively to broadly described services,mentioning child welfare services,services,and treatment programs.however,the last paragraph of section,subdivision a,states except in cases where,pursuant to subdivision b,the court does not order reunification services,the court shall inform the parent or parents of section and shall specify that the parent or parents parental rights may be terminated.italics added.r eunification services are activities designed to provide foster care services to prevent or remedy neglect,abuse,or exploitation,when the child can not safely remain at home,and needs temporary foster care,while services are provided to reunite the family,subd.h,italics added.
the remainder of section speaks exclusively in terms of reunification services,subd.b r eunification services need not be provided to a parent in specified circumstances,subd.c describing process and evidentiary standards to be utilized for determining whether to award or deny reunification services at dispositional hearing,subd.d providing reunification services for parent whose whereabouts were unknown at disposition but who subsequently appears to assert rights,subd.e reunification services for incarcerated or institutionalized parents,subd.f explaining court should consider setting a section hearing if parent is denied reunification services pursuant to selected subparts of subdivision b unless the other parent is being provided reunification services pursuant to subdivision a,subd.g procedure after setting a section hearing does not discuss any services,subd.h standards for whether reunification services will benefit the child pursuant to paragraphs and of subdivision b,subd.i requiring court to read into the record subdivision b factual findings related to reunification services.
interaction of sections and 
in re erika th,d erika,in holding a previously custodial parent was not entitled to reunification services under section in a dependency case in which the minors were placed with their previously noncustodial father pursuant to section,described the interaction between sections and section and section were simultaneously enacted in.stats,ch.section contains general rules governing the provision of reunification services to parents of minors removed from parental custody.reunification services are mandated under section,subdivision a except where a parent is unavailable,mentally disabled or has been extremely abusive towards a child.like section,section,subdivision a also pertains to the provision of reunification services.in contrast to the general applicability of section,section,subdivision a applies only when the minor is removed from the custody of one parent,pursuant to section,and placed in the custody of the parent under the supervision of the juvenile court.erika,at,d.
under these limited circumstances,section,subdivision a invests the juvenile court with discretion as to the provision of reunification services to the parents because section was part of the same legislative act as section,subdivision a,it can not be interpreted as rendering nugatory the provisions of section,subdivision a.seen as parts of a single legislative scheme,the only rational intent which can be ascribed to the legislature is the intent to enforce a different set of rules regarding the provision of reunification services in those cases where custody of a minor is shifted from one parent to another parent.erika,supra,th at,d.although these statutes have been revised since,erika still persuasively describes the intended purpose and interaction of the two statutes as they exist now.
applicability of section time limits when child placed with parent 
it is uncontested that the parents have used up at least some of their entitlement to a potential months of section child welfare services the disputed issue is when the months began.dependents claim the clock on the limitation period for services began to run in april,when the minors were detained and taken into protective custody.the parents claim the time limitations set in section began only following ssa section amended petition and dependents removal from their father custody,and any services received before november were not section reunification services.
t he words the legislature chooses are the best expression of its intent and we are bound by their plain meaning.in re silvia th,d.however,a review of the statutory test does not provide a clear answer to the question presented in this case.section does not explicitly disclaim or affirm its applicability when the court has awarded services pursuant to section.it purports to apply whenever a child is removed from a parent or guardian custody and its time limits begin after a child enters foster care,subd.a,services shall not exceed a period of or months from the date the child entered foster care.do section time limits apply even if a child is placed in the custody of a parent at the dispositional hearing 
erika,supra,th,d suggests two separate statutory tracks exist one applies when a child is placed with a parent,another applies when a child is placed with someone other than a parent.erika,at,d.but erika did not directly address whether the time limits set forth in section run while services are provided pursuant to section,in the event dependents are later removed from parental custody pursuant to an amended petition as occurred in this case.as the parties correctly explain in their briefs,three cases bear on this particular question carolyn superior court th,d carolyn in re joel th,d joel and,supra,th,d 
in carolyn,children were removed from their mother custody in april and returned to her custody in november.carolyn,supra,th at,d.the county filed a section supplemental petition in july,at which time the children were removed from their mother custody for a second time.ibid.thus,at the time of the dispositional hearing following this second removal,the carolyn mother had received eight months of reunification services between april and november and months of family maintenance services following the return of the children to her custody in november.id.at,d.the carolyn mother advocated under a prior but similar version of section for a parent entitlement to an additional months and potentially up to months of reunification services whenever a minor is removed from a parent or guardian custody carolyn,at,d.
the carolyn court affirmed the trial court denial of additional section reunification services to the mother.carolyn,supra,th at,d.the carolyn court primarily relied on the following language in section as enacted at the time physical custody of the minor by the parents or guardians during the period shall not serve to interrupt the running of the period.carolyn,at,d.thus,the court reasoned,section obviously limits the section mandate for services to the point in time which begins when the court initially orders a child removed from parental custody pursuant to section.carolyn,at,d,italics added.the court further observed it considered reunification services and maintenance services to be part of the continuum of child welfare services,with similar goals and methods.id.at,d.however,the court explicitly declined to address the procedure a court should follow if a parent has received exclusively maintenance services,in other words,in the event a section petition triggers the first time in a given case that a court removes a dependent child from parental custody.id.at,fn,d.
in joel,supra,th,d,five children were detained from the mother in october.the court authorized a trial placement in the mother home before the dispositional hearing in january,and this placement continued after the disposition joel,supra,th at,d.the joel mother received welfare services counseling and drug testing from october through early.id.at,d.pursuant to a supplemental petition,the joel trial court removed all five children in february because the mother had ceased drug testing and had allowed her boyfriend accused of molesting the children into her home.id.at,d.the trial court subsequently denied the mother request for reunification services,finding months of services already had been provided and also finding the facts did not justify any further extension of services.id.at,d.
joel,supra,th,d,reversed this outcome when a dependency is declared,the juvenile court must order child welfare services be provided to the parents whether or not the child remains in the parent home,subd.a,subd.b and must review the status of the case every six months.however,if the child remains in the parent custody,at each review,the court determines only whether the dependency should be terminated or whether further supervision is necessary.citations.unlike the situation in which the child is removed from the home and services are statutorily limited to months,subd.a,nothing in the statutes or rules limits the time period for court supervision and services when the child remains in the home citations.if supervision is no longer required,the court simply terminates the dependency.otherwise,the state may continue to provide supportive services and supervision to parents until the dependent minors reach their majority.id.at,d,fn.omitted.the joel court concluded that when the juvenile court removes a minor from parental custody for the first time by a section supplemental petition,section,subdivision a,requires the court to order reunification services except in the circumstances specified in subdivision b of that section.id.at,d.
in,supra,th,d,an child was detained in january when both his parents were arrested for possession of crack cocaine and narcotics paraphernalia.id.at,d.following his detention,the child was immediately placed with his grandparents with parental visitation.later that month at the dispositional hearing,the court placed the child with his mother under a family maintenance plan and provided reunification services to father.ibid.pursuant to a section petition,in july the court modified its order to place the child with the father and mother,due to the father successful completion of treatment programs,at,d.in february,the court found true the allegations of a section supplemental petition a new incident of drug abuse by parents,removed the child from the parents custody for the second time,and ordered the initiation of reunification services,at,d.in october,the trial court held what it characterized to be a review and continued services for an additional six months.id.at,d.the child appealed.
the court,following carolyn,supra,th,d,reversed the opinion does not mention joel,supra,th,d.according to,both parents had already received approximately months of services by the time of the october hearing,and the court therefore could not extend services further absent a finding of exceptional circumstances which were not present there,supra,th at,d.the court acknowledged carolyn declined to rule on a hypothetical case in which a child was never actually removed from a parent custody until a subsequent section petition,at,d.the court explained that,in the case before it,father had lost custody for approximately six months,and mother had lost custody between the original detention and the dispositional hearing later in the month.id.at,d.thus,the court rejected the argument that the maximum period of section services did not begin to run until the february removal of the child,at,d.
in sum carolyn stands for the proposition that once the section clock begins,it continues to run despite a placement of the child with a parent during the dependency.carolyn,supra,th at,d but see rosa superior court th,d section clock is reset when original dependency is dismissed and new section petition is filed.joel holds that if the child is never removed from the physical custody of the custodial parent pursuant to section,subdivision c,and instead received services pursuant to section,the section clock does not start at least until an amended petition results in a removal of custody.joel,supra,th at,d see also erika,supra,th at,d suggesting section is inapplicable to circumstance in which child is placed with noncustodial parent pursuant to section.finally,holds that the clock begins for both parents if the child is detained from their custody at the onset of the dependency action,regardless of whether the court grants one parent custody at the disposition under a family maintenance plan pursuant to section in,supra,th at,d.
application of section to dependents in this action 
having considered the cases discussed above,the trial court provided the following explanation for its ruling on the issue before us t he petition did come into the court system with a detention in april of.at the disposition,the court adopted the case plan and recommendation of the agency,which was to have the child returned to father.i t was a family maintenance case plan to father,with an enhancement to mother.mother at this time was not offered reunification services.it was not contemplated that she would be reunifying with the child the expectation of a time line for her to complete services,facing ultimate termination of parental rights under an advisement,was not in place.and she was,therefore,not subject to the time line that is in place for services for children that are not in the home.
mother did some services along the way prior to the subsequent petition being filed,but those were because she was court ordered to do them under the threat of incarceration.so those were done,but those were not services that were ordered by this court.they were in connection with her criminal court case i think there were some things that she did with respect to this case under the enhancement,but they were minimal in that the bulk of her activity was as a result of her criminal orders that she was required to comply with.the subsequent petition did result in a detention,as the first did,but it also resulted in a family reunification case plan and the court believes that now that we are in reunification,the time line is not over.t here is time for mother to work on the case plan that she has now,her reunification case plan.
we agree with the trial court conclusion.although there are ambiguities in the relevant statutes and case law,we think a section placement with a noncustodial parent should be treated in the same manner as a section placement with a custodial parent.in either case,the time limits for services set forth in section do not apply if dependents are not removed from the custody of both parents at the dispositional hearing.joel,supra,th at,d erika,supra,th at,d.in this case,section did not become relevant until the amended petition resulted in the removal of dependents from the custody of both parents in november.moreover,the mother in this case never received reunification services until after dependents were removed from father custody.had section,subdivision a,applied at the may dispositional hearing,mother would have been entitled to reunification services absent findings made pursuant to section,subdivision b.see erika,at,d.the court did not engage in a section analysis at the may dispositional hearing.
carolyn,supra,th,d is inapplicable.because the time limits provided in section,subdivision a never began,father custody of dependents can not be considered an interruption of the running of the period,supra,th,d can be distinguished on its facts the father did receive reunification services,thereby,according to the analysis in the case,triggering the section time limitations at the beginning of the dependency see also in re jesse th,d applying sections and to circumstance in which child was removed from custody of mother after she stabbed father mother received reunification services for six months while child was in custody of father.
to the extent our decision conflicts with the rationale of,we disagree with quoting carolyn,frames the legal question by stating reunification efforts should resume if the parent has received less than months of child welfare services citatio
