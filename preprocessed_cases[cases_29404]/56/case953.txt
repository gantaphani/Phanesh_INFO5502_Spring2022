applicable law 
our supreme court has recently summarized the statutory procedures governing our analysis.a ny individual less than years of age who violates the criminal law comes within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court,which may adjudge such an individual a ward of the court,subd.a.a minor accused of a crime is subject to the juvenile court system,rather than the criminal court system,unless the minor is determined to be unfit for treatment under the juvenile court law or is accused of certain serious crimes.for example,when a petition is filed alleging that a minor years of age or older has violated the criminal law and should be adjudged a ward of the juvenile court,the minor generally is subject to the juvenile court law unless the court concludes,upon the motion of the prosecutor and after an investigation and report by a probation officer,that the minor would not be amenable to the care,treatment,and training program available through the facilities of the juvenile court,subd.a.in assessing the minor fitness for treatment under the juvenile court law,the court considers the minor degree of criminal sophistication,whether the minor can be rehabilitated prior to the expiration of the juvenile court jurisdiction,the minor previous delinquent history,the success of previous attempts by the juvenile court to rehabilitate the minor,and the circumstances and gravity of the alleged offense.ibid.
a minor years of age or older who is alleged to have committed one of the serious crimes specified in section,subdivision b such as murder,robbery,or assault with a firearm is presumed not to be a fit and proper subject for treatment under the juvenile court law,subds.b c.at the juvenile court hearing to determine the question of fitness for treatment,a minor accused of such a crime has the burden of rebutting this presumption of unfitness by a preponderance of the evidence.cal.rules of court,rule a.if a minor is declared not to be a fit and proper subject for treatment under the juvenile court law in accordance with the foregoing statutes,the district attorney may file an accusatory pleading against the minor in a court of criminal jurisdiction,and the case then proceeds according to the laws applicable to a criminal proceeding,subd.a.manduley,supra,cal th,d,fn.omitted.
for specified crimes committed by minors years of age or older,including those alleged here,the juvenile court law also affords the prosecutor the discretion to file directly in criminal court,subd.d.here,however,the prosecutor elected to proceed initially in juvenile court.therefore,under the legislative scheme,the determination whether marcus was unfit was a judicial function.manduley,supra,cal th,d,edsel superior court d.

ii.the record 
it is undisputed that in the late morning hours of january,maurice davis,a year old groundskeeper for the san francisco housing authority,was shot and killed.he suffered a gunshot wound to the back and another to the thigh.six shots were fired.by that afternoon marcus was in custody.
in a interview lasting over three hours,two san francisco police department homicide inspectors questioned marcus.this interrogation commenced over three hours after he was placed in custody at the outset,marcus was advised of his miranda miranda arizona,d rights,but never stated that he waived them.throughout most of the taped interrogation,he denied involvement in the murder.eventually,he told the police that he shot a gun once,while the victim was running away.he gave the gun to a companion and ran away,hearing more shots as he fled.he insisted his shot did not hit the victim.no physical evidence that marcus shot or touched a gun appears in this record.
in a juvenile court petition filed january,marcus was charged with murder and an enhancement for personal use of a firearm,subd.a,subd.a committed when he was years old.the offenses are among those listed in section,subdivision b and trigger the presumption of unfitness.the same day,the district attorney filed a motion to set a fitness hearing to determine whether marcus should be prosecuted in a criminal court,subd.c.
