background 
was born in september,at weeks gestation,to amy and robert,amy husband.spent her first two weeks in the naval medical center neonatal intensive care unit because she was experiencing problems involving respiratory distress,apnea,feeding,and growing.was again placed in the neonatal intensive care unit six days after her discharge because she had an apparent life threatening event when she grunted,stopped breathing and turned red.medical personnel determined that the cause of this event was decreased temperature due to inadequate swaddling.had a well baby visit on october and was reported to be healthy and developing normally.
in early november,amy took to the naval medical center where she was diagnosed as having an ear infection.a day or two later,amy took to pomerado hospital where was prescribed amoxicillin.when began vomiting later at home,amy took her back to pomerado hospital.at the hospital,medical personnel observed bruises on body.more bruises appeared on body while she was at the hospital,wherever pressure was applied.doctors became concerned that might have a blood disorder.
on november,was transported by ambulance to rady children hospital where an emergency room doctor examined her.she had linear bruises on her thighs and a small linear bruise on her right upper arm and left shoulder.was discharged because no more bruising occurred and bleeding studies were normal.later that day,however,vomited again.amy and robert took her back to rady children hospital.
at rady children hospital,physician cynthia kuelbs questioned whether pomerado hospital personnel had checked entire body for bruising.kuelbs believed that the bruising on shoulder may have been an inflicted injury.kuelbs acknowledged that she did not have complete records from the naval medical center or pomerado hospital and was at a loss to explain the bruises which appeared at pomerado hospital.she believed that the bruise on forearm might have been caused by a blood draw,and that what appeared to be bruises in groin area might actually be a rash.kuelbs was concerned because was not tracking objects with her eyes.
scans of head revealed both new and old subdural hemorrhages,but skeletal surveys and retinal examinations were negative.both a radiologist and kuelbs expressed concern that the hemorrhages were caused by nonaccidental trauma.however,a neurosurgery resident was concerned that symptoms might have been the result of a bleeding disorder.rady children hospital began an extensive work up for a bleeding problem.a metabolic screen was ordered to rule out an underlying metabolic problem.in addition,a further ophthalmologic evaluation was planned,and a hematological evaluation was scheduled for december.
on november,a hospital hold was placed on on november,she was detained in a foster home.on november,the san diego county health and human services agency the agency filed a dependency petition pursuant to welfare and institutions code section,subdivision a the petition alleged that on or about november,was discovered to have a detrimental and traumatic condition,consisting of old and new subdural hemorrhages,which condition would not ordinarily be sustained except as a result of the unreasonable acts of the child mother father.
both robert and amy appeared at the november,detention hearing.the court appointed counsel and set a jurisdictional hearing for december.on december,the court granted the joint request of robert and amy attorneys that a vial of blood be drawn from for independent testing.the court set a settlement conference for january,and a trial for february.on january,both counsel asked for a continuance of the trial.the court granted the request,citing the pending results of further medical testing that kuelbs had ordered,and amy counsel need for further investigation.the court continued the trial to march and set a settlement conference for february.
on february,kuelbs reported that metabolic test results obtained in late january were not completely normal and that the results did not explain symptoms.kuelbs stated that the tests showed that it was unlikely that had a condition called glutaric acidemia,a genetic metabolic disorder,but recommended an evaluation by the metabolics team.kuelbs believed that once the evaluation was complete,she would be able to say whether something other than trauma could have caused subdural hemorrhages.
on february,the court continued the trial to april and set a further settlement conference for april,citing the fact that the metabolic evaluation would probably not occur until april,and that robert attorney needed time to provide the test results to her expert before trial.the court gave the agency discretion to detain with amy,with the concurrence of counsel.
on april,had an appointment with a metabolic specialist,who took blood and urine samples.the purpose of the testing was to determine whether had glutaric acidemia.results from the urine test were expected in two weeks,and results from the blood test were expected in six weeks.next medical appointment was set for june.
on april,robert attorney filed a motion to stay the proceedings pursuant to the scra.a copy of a letter from the navy dated march was attached to the motion.the letter stated only that robert would be deployed in iraq from march until november.the letter did not set forth all of the information that the scra requires see fn,post.
on april,the court ordered detained with amy.because the test results were still not available,the court continued the trial to may.the court noted that there could well be a motion to continue on may if robert counsel obtains certain documentation from the military with respect to robert deployment.amy counsel noted that may was the date and stated that the test results would probably not be available until june.the court acknowledged this and said,w e are going to have to set it for may and just address those issues on that particular date.
on may,the manager of the genetics laboratory orally reported to the social worker that test results were inconclusive.the manager said that further testing was needed to rule out glutaric acidemia.
on may,the agency filed a report that contained the results of april metabolic panel.amy counsel asked for an opportunity to forward the results to her expert.robert counsel filed a letter from the navy dated april that set forth all of the information required by the scra,asked that the letter be deemed an attachment to her earlier motion,and requested that the proceedings be stayed.robert counsel argued that robert would be prejudiced if he were not present to testify and to hear the additional evidence.counsel also requested a continuance,noting that the two experts she had contacted would not look at medical records until they had the additional test results that were contained in the report the agency had just filed.
the court concluded that whether to stay the proceedings pursuant to the scra was discretionary.citing the time constraints that apply in juvenile dependency cases,the court declined to stay the proceedings.the court also denied robert counsel request for a continuance,citing section,subdivision b,and proceeded with the hearing.the court sustained the objections of amy and robert attorneys to the agency report that had been filed that day,but received other reports and heard testimony from the social worker.robert counsel argued that the medical information was inconclusive and asked the court to dismiss the
