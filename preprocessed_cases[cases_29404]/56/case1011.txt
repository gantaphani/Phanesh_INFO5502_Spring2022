pursuant to supreme court rule a a,the state attorney of cook county filed a motion with this court for leave to file a complaint seeking a writ of mandamus.we allowed the state to file the complaint.the state seeks an order compelling the honorable terrence sharkey,judge of the circuit court of cook county respondent,to set for trial within days a delinquency petition against,a minor.the question before us is whether the state can utilize the provisions of the juvenile court act of ilcs west to force a minor to go to trial within days.
background 
in the state brought three felony delinquency petitions against the minor,in the juvenile division of the circuit court of cook county.the charges were aggravated unlawful use of a weapon,burglary,and attempted first degree murder.the state elected first to proceed on the charge of attempted murder.however,in february,the circuit court granted the state petition for discretionary transfer see ilcs west of that charge to the criminal division,where it remains pending the juvenile court delinquency petition was subsequently.
in april,the state attempted to elect on the minor unlawful use of a weapon charge and force that case to proceed to trial.respondent,the judge before whom this motion was brought,denied the motion,expressing concern regarding the fairness of requiring the minor to prepare for two cases at once.respondent noted that the code of criminal procedure provides that the court may upon the written motion of either party or upon the court own motion order a continuance if he finds that the interests of justice so require.ilcs d west.respondent found that a continuance was appropriate and in the interests of justice,and held that the state could not unilaterally invoke the provision of the juvenile court act ilcs west,forcing the case to trial within days over the objection of the minor.
as previously noted,the state instituted this original mandamus action to request that this court enter an order compelling respondent to set the case for trial within days.see a.const,art.vi,a.respondent has not filed a brief before this court,but the minor has filed a brief opposing the state mandamus request.
this court has discretionary original jurisdiction in mandamus actions.const,art.vi,a.mandamus is an extraordinary remedy appropriate to enforce as a matter of public right the performance of official duties by a public officer where no exercise of discretion on his part is involved.people ex rel.birkett jorgensen,quoting madden cronson.mandamus will lie only when the movant shows a clear,affirmative right to relief,a clear duty of the public officer to act,and clear authority in the public officer to comply with the writ,not when the act in question concerns an exercise of an official discretion.people madej,quoting lewis spagnolo.further,w here the writ would compel the performance of a judicial act by a lower court in pending litigation this court must necessarily consider not only whether the petitioner has shown a clear violation by the judge of a duty imposed by law but also whether issuance of the writ will be effective.people ex rel.carey scotillo.
the state argues that section of the juvenile court act clearly and unambiguously gives the state the right to unilaterally demand trial.the minor contends that this construction is erroneous and the state is improperly attempting to compel respondent to rule in the state favor in a scheduling matter,traditionally well within a judge discretion.
because the instant case involves a matter of statutory construction,our review is de novo.see,people ramirez.our aim is to ascertain and give effect to the true intent of the legislature,the best evidence of which is the language used in the statute itself.where the plain language of the statute clearly reveals the legislature intent,that intent must prevail,and no resort to other interpretive aids is necessary.however,although statutory language ought to be given its plain and ordinary meaning,we construe statutes as a whole,with each provision construed in connection with every other section.people v.a parcel of property commonly known as north street,decatur,macon county,illinois,quoting paris feder.
the state argues that this case is quite simple.subsection of section of the juvenile court act provides that a trial must be held within days of a written demand for such hearing made by any party ilcs west the state is a party therefore a trial must be held within days of a written demand by the state.this argument is facially compelling.however,the minor provides a host of reasons for concluding that the answer is not nearly as as the state suggests,which we ultimately find persuasive.
first,the minor argues that we must consider subsection in context,looking to section in its entirety,as well as the juvenile court act generally.for instance,the minor points out that subsection of section provides that nothing in this section prevents the minor or the minor parents,guardian or legal custodian from exercising their respective rights to waive the time limits set forth in this section.ilcs west.how,the minor asks,can the state purported unilateral right to demand trial within days be reconciled with the clear provision that a minor can not be prevented from exercising his right to waive the time limits 
the state responds that the language of subsection actually cuts in favor of the state,because it reveals that in the juvenile court act the legislature specifies the particular parties who have a right when it chooses to do so,suggesting that the legislature truly meant any party,including the state,when it used that term in subsection.this argument fails to come to grips with the heart of the conflict between subsection and the state proffered construction of subsection,however.the problem is that subsection gives the minor and his parents,guardians,or legal custodians an absolute and unqualified right to waive the time limits referred to in the article.this is impossible to reconcile with the state having a unilateral right to enforce the time limits.
in a similar vein,subsection of section provides that t he period in which a trial shall be held is tolled by i delay occasioned by the minor.any such delay shall temporarily suspend,for the time of the delay,the period within which a trial must be held.ilcs west.why would the legislature give the state a unilateral right to demand trial within days but allow the minor to toll that clock through his unilateral delay and if the minor delay did not toll the clock,we would run up against subsection of section,which provides the remedy for failure to bring the minor to trial within the specified time limits when no such trial is held within the time required by subsections and of this section,the court shall,upon motion by any party,dismiss the petition with prejudice.ilcs west.
moreover,subsection of section sets out the time limits for dealing with the situation when there are multiple delinquency petitions pending and the minor simultaneously demands trial on more than one of the there is no provision for what to do if the state were to demand trial on multiple charges.ilcs west.it would seem illogical for the legislature to have provided for one eventuality but not the other,if the legislature truly intended to grant the state an equal ability to demand trial.
the minor also notes that in numerous other provisions of the juvenile court act the terms party,parties and any party are used without including the state.for instance,section of the juvenile court act is entitled rights of parties to proceedings but the text of that statute refers primarily to parties opposing the state,the minor who is the subject of the proceeding and his parents,guardian,legal custodian or responsible relative who are parties respondent.moreover,that same statute also provides that the court shall appoint the public defender or such other counsel as may be required to represent any party financially unable to employ counsel.ilcs west.to accept the state argument in the instant any party clearly and unambiguously always includes the seem to compel the unreasonable conclusion that section would entitle the state to representation by the public defender if it could prove itself indigent.the minor also directs our attention to subsection of section,which requires the circuit court to advise the parties of their right to appeal in the event of an adjudication of wardship ilcs west a situation in which only parties opposing the state would be interested in taking an appeal.see also ilcs c west discussing notice requirements in the context of multiple parties.
moreover,as the minor also points out,section of the juvenile court act provides that in delinquency proceedings minors shall have all the procedural rights of adults in criminal proceedings,unless specifically precluded by laws that enhance the protection of such minors.ilcs west.but adults in criminal proceedings are not subject to the state utilizing the act to force them to trial over their a defendant can start the clock ticking by demanding trial in a criminal case.see ilcs west.additionally,as respondent noted in ruling on the motion,criminal defendants have the right to continuances when the interests of justice so require see ilcs d west.this right would seem to be contravention of section of the juvenile court the state had the unilateral right to force a delinquency petition to trial in days.
additionally,and finally,the minor observes that this case involves the circuit court control over its own docket,a context particularly unsuited to mandamus relief.see will calvert fire insurance,d denying request for mandamus when trial court held a case in abeyance pending the outcome of another case and noting different standards for mandamus relief and simple appeals.
the state argues that our appellate court has already held that a s with the code of criminal procedure,the juvenile court act period begins to run when either party makes a formal demand for trial.in re,d.we do not find this statement convincing.first,this was dictum,because in the court was evaluating the efficacy of a trial demand by the juvenile,not the state.second,the court was proceeding from a faulty premise because,as previously noted,the code of criminal procedure does not permit the state to start the clock ticking,only a defendant.see ilcs west.we find this precedent of no assistance in evaluating the issues before us.
the state also argues that the legislative history of the statute makes clear that the legislature intent in establishing the provision was to eliminate case backlogs,specifically in cook county.we need not here recount the history on which the state relies,because even assuming arguendo that the state reading is correct,it says nothing about whether the state has the ability to force an individual case to trial.if there is a reason for one case not to go to trial,the state can focus its resources on preparing for trial in the numerous cases in which the minors do demand trial.
this is not a case about the state ability to elect which case to proceed on first when there are multiple delinquency petitions pending against the same juvenile.all we are concerned with here is whether the provisions of the juvenile court act give the state the ability to force a particular juvenile court proceeding to trial within a specific time against the minor wishes.more specifically,given that this is a mandamus action,the question is whether the state has shown a clear,affirmative right madej,at,quoting lewis,at,to force a delinquency petition to trial against a minor wishes,because of a clear violation by the judge of a duty imposed by law scotillo,at,where no exercise of discretion on his part is involved jorgensen,at,quoting madden,at.the answer must be in the negative,given the wealth of reasons outlined above for concluding that the any party language in section is not intended to include the state.to adopt the state construction would conflict with other subsections of section as well as other portions of the juvenile court act.indeed,the facial conflict with subsection of section nothing in this section prevents the minor or the minor parents,guardian or legal custodian from exercising their respective rights to waive the time limits set forth in this section ilcs west might well alone suffice to derail the state mandamus petition.we are not required to turn a blind eye to a statute or a statutory scheme and construe a single subsection in isolation.when section is viewed in context,it is clear that the term any party was not intended to include the state.
conclusion 
for the reasons above stated,we conclude that the state request for a writ of mandamus must be denied.this case involves a circuit court control over its own docket,a matter traditionally considered to be well within its discretionary control,and the state has not shown clear entitlement to the relief it requests.
writ denied.
i agree that mandamus will not lie in this case.i write separately because i would reach that conclusion for a reason different from the one expressed by the majority.
unlike my colleagues,i believe that subsection of section of the juvenile court act of ilcs west does confer upon the state the right to make a demand.here,as in all cases of statutory construction,our objective is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the legislature.the most reliable indicator of legislative intent is the language of the statute.in re.subsection of section expressly provides 
when a petition has been filed alleging that the minor is a delinquent,a trial must be held within days of a written demand for such hearing made by any party,except that when the state,without success,has exercised due diligence to obtain evidence material to the case and there are reasonable grounds to believe that the evidence may be obtained at a later date,the court may,upon motion by the state,continue the trial for not more than additional days.emphasis added.ilcs west.
although the word any has a diversity of meanings depending on the context in which it is used,its primary definition is one indifferently out of more than two or one or more indiscriminately from all those of a kind.webster third new international dictionary.consistent with this definition,it is synonymous with either,every or all.black law dictionary ed.
in proceedings such as this to adjudicate whether a minor is delinquent,the state is the petitioner.ilcs west.as such,it is unquestionably a party.because the clear and unambiguous language of section of the juvenile court act expressly permits any party to file a demand,and because any means one indifferently out of more than two or one or more indiscriminately from all those of a kind and is synonymous with either,every,or all,it necessarily follows that the state is among those parties entitled to file a written trial demand under the law.
the majority rejects this conclusion,holding that any party actually means any party except the state.such a construction is untenable.where,as here,a legislative enactment is clear and unambiguous,a court is not at liberty to depart from the plain language and meaning of the statute by reading into it exceptions,limitations or conditions that the legislature did not express.kraft,edgar.
where the general assembly intended to distinguish different categories of parties or differentiate the state from other parties to a proceeding governed by the juvenile court act,it did so.for example,in contrast to section,section of the act ilcs west,dealing with waiver of objections to venue,is addressed not to any party,but to a party respondent.section of the act ilcs west,governing rights of parties to proceedings,refers to the minor who is the subject of the proceeding and his parents,guardian,legal custodian or responsible relative who are parties respondent.section ilcs west speaks of the minor respondent while section ilcs west,pertaining to motions for continuances in connection with sentencing lists the state attorney,a parent,guardian,legal custodian,or counsel.other instances of differentiation between types of parties are common.see,ilcs,west.
that the legislature distinguished between parties when it intended to is nowhere more evident than in section itsel
