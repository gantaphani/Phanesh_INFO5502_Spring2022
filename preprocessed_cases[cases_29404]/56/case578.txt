discussion 
and its subdivisions 
section,subdivision d provides any person who is convicted of a public offense punishable as a felony or a misdemeanor,which is committed for the benefit of,at the direction of or in association with,any criminal street gang with the specific intent to promote,further,or assist in any criminal conduct by gang members,shall be punished by imprisonment in the county jail not to exceed one year,or by imprisonment in the state prison for one,two,or three years,provided that any person sentenced to imprisonment in the county jail shall be imprisoned for a period not to exceed one year,but not less than days,and shall not be eligible for release upon completion of sentence,parole,or any other basis,until he or she has served days.if the court grants probation or suspends the execution of sentence imposed upon the defendant,it shall require as a condition thereof that the defendant serve days in a county jail.this section is an alternate penalty provision,which prescribes an added penalty to be imposed when the offense is committed under specified circumstances.people bright cal th,d.
section,subdivision d was passed by the electorate as part of proposition.robert superior court,supra,cal th at,d.in interpreting a statute enacted by means of a voter initiative,we turn first to the language of the statute,giving the words their ordinary meaning.id.at,d.we construe the statutory language in the context of the statute as a whole and the overall statutory scheme in light of the electorate intent.ibid.if the language of the statute is ambiguous,we refer to other indicia of the voters intent,particularly the analyses and arguments contained in the official ballot pamphlet.citation.citation.ibid.
we first analyze section and its subdivisions.although we find significant support in the statutes and case law for a conclusion that section,subdivision d applies to juveniles,a reasonable argument can also be made that it does not.
analogy of section,subdivision d to section 
defendant relies on in re joseph cal d,in which the california supreme court held section which requires a defendant to obtain a certificate of probable cause before appealing a judgment under certain circumstances does not apply in juvenile court proceedings.in reaching its conclusion,the supreme court relied,in part,on the language of section,which refers to defendants who stand convicted upon a guilty or nolo contendre plea.in re joseph,supra,cal d at.because adjudications of juvenile wrongdoing are not criminal convictions,and because juveniles admit the allegations of a petition rather than pleading guilty,the court concluded section did not apply to juveniles.in re joseph,supra,cal d at.like section,section,subdivision d speaks in terms of a conviction,which might indicate it applies only to adult,not to juvenile,defendants.
section,subdivisions a and b 
although section,subdivision b also speaks only in terms of a conviction,and section,subdivision a does not refer to juvenile adjudications,both subdivisions a and b of section apply to juveniles and adults.in re jose th,d see,subd.h addressing payment of costs if a juvenile is committed to the division of juvenile facilities after being convicted under,subd.a or b.
analogy of section,subdivision d to other statutes using the terminology of adult proceedings 
in in re jovan cal th,d,which was cited and relied on by the juvenile court here,our supreme court considered whether section,an enhancement provision which increases the period of imprisonment for a felony if it is committed while the offender is free on bail or on his or her own recognizance,applies in juvenile court proceedings.section refers only to convictions,not to juvenile adjudications.the court nevertheless concluded,section is applicable in the juvenile context.in re jovan,supra,cal th at,d.
welfare and institutions code section,subdivision c provides that the maximum period in which a juvenile ward of the court may be held in physical confinement is the same as the maximum term of imprisonment that could be imposed on an adult offender for the same offense.the court in in re jovan concluded,welfare and institutions code section obviously intends that,for purposes of calculating a juvenile ward maximum confinement or commitment,the determinate sentencing act enhancement scheme should be applied fully except insofar as the focus of a particular enhancement is manifestly at odds with the principles of juvenile law.in re jovan,supra,cal th at,d.
although in re jovan addresses sentencing enhancements rather than alternate penalty provisions,its analysis supports application of section,subdivision d to juveniles because it concludes statutes referring only to convictions can be applicable to juveniles as well as to adults.
by contrast,in in re derrick cal th,d,our supreme court considered the applicability of the former statute requiring registration by sex offenders to juveniles.former section,subdivision a a required registration as a sex offender by persons convicted of numerous enumerated crimes,including sexual battery former section,subdivision d required registration as a sex offender by persons who had been committed to the custody of the department of the youth authority after having been adjudicated a ward of the juvenile court if they had committed certain enumerated sex crimes sexual battery is not one of the enumerated crimes.former,subd.d.former section,subdivision a e required registration by a ny person ordered by any court to regist
