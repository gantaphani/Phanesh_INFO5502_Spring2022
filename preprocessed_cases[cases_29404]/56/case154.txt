background 
julianna barber turned fifteen on september.under colorado law at that time,any minor age fifteen who was enrolled in an approved driver education course could apply for a minor driving instruction permit.b amended.julianna obtained her minor permit on october.to qualify for a driver license,persons under the age of eighteen were required to hold a permit for at least twelve months,complete fifty hours of supervised driving,and be at least sixteen years old.see.a.therefore,the earliest date upon which julianna was eligible to apply for a driver license was october.after meeting all of colorado requirements,julianna obtained her driver license on november.
under the colorado statute,a driver under the age of sixteen could practice driving only under the supervision of the parent,stepparent,or guardian who cosigned the application for the minor instruction permit if such parent,stepparent,or guardian holds a valid driver license.b amended.we note that,on its face,the statute does not address what type of guardianship is required under the guardian option.when a minor reached the age of sixteen,those restrictions eased to allow supervision by a licensed driver,years of age or over.a.thus,julianna was required by statute to drive under the supervision of a parent,stepparent,or guardian until she reached age sixteen on september.because julianna mother,marcia barber,suffers from retinitis pigmentosa and is blind,she can not hold a driver license.therefore,under the statute,she could not supervise julianna driving during the period october,through september.in addition,julianna father does not have a driver license,does not have custody of julianna,and does not live in colorado.
upon learning of the supervision requirement from julianna driving school instructors,marcia barber called her local dmv office,asked for a reasonable accommodation,that julianna be allowed to practice with another licensed driver,such as her grandfather,and was referred to steve tool,then senior director of the colorado dmv.in mid to late october or early november,marcia barber and steve tool communicated about the barbers situation,and he began an investigation.tool requested an informal opinion from the state attorney general office concerning whether a grandparent may act as a guardian to supervise julianna driving.in a letter to marcia barber dated november,tool reported that the state attorney general office had informed him that the dmv could not permit julianna grandfather to supervise her driving,unless he was a legally appointed guardian.the letter went on to define guardian as a person lawfully invested with the power,and charged with the duty,of taking care of the person and managing the property and rights of another person,who,for some peculiarity of status,or defect of age,understanding,or,is considered incapable of administering his own affairs.tool further indicated in his letter that legislators had an interest in amending the statute at that time.
on december,marcia barber sent tool a letter thanking him for his assistance and reiterating her request for an exception to the guardian requirement due to her disability.in that letter,she cited to the americans with disabilities act ada and requested a reasonable modification to the guardian requirement that would allow her to ride in the car with julianna and a licensed driver age or older.see dep t of justice,title ii technical assistance manual,last visited,a public entity must reasonably modify its policies,practices,or procedures to avoid discrimination.as a result,tool communicated with robert dodd of the state attorney general office,and subsequently informed marcia barber that her request could not be granted due to the statute.
marcia barber then called colorado attorney general john suthers in january.suthers testified that during the call he indicated that the legislature needed to address the statute,and that in the he thought the problem could be solved with a limited delegation of authority.marcia barber testified that she did not recall suthers discussing any solution that did not involve assigning parental rights.although the testimony conflicts on whether a limited guardianship was discussed,we will assume,consistent with marcia barber version of the call,that it was not,even though this is not a material fact given our disposition.however,during her deposition,marcia barber made it clear that she did not consider any form of guardianship a reasonable accommodation,and she voiced that sentiment in clear and unmistakable terms.
on january,marcia barber wrote to suthers thanking him for his time,expressing her dissatisfaction with the suggestion that another person might be a more suitable guardian,even temporarily,attaching an excerpt from the ada that discusses the reasonable modification requirement,and reiterating her request for a reasonable modification to the statute that would permit julianna to practice her driving.then,on january,marcia barber wrote again to suthers and also to dodd,indicating that she had filed a title ii ada complaint with the department of justice,and once more requesting that the state simply provide reasonable modification under the statute,a llowing my daughter to drive with a such as an uncle or grandfather at the present time.suthers did not respond to these letters.
finally,on february,attorney chris m√©ndez of the legal center for people with disabilities and older people wrote to dodd on marcia barber behalf,requesting a reasonable modification to allow an adult family member to supervise julianna driving.dodd responded on february,indicating that the requested accommodation could not be made and that it was critical that minor drivers be under the direct and immediate supervision of someone with full parental authority.in closing,dodd indicated that the pending legislative amendment to the statute might provide marcia barber with satisfactory relief.
on may,the statute was amended to allow a grandparent with power of attorney who holds a valid driver license to supervise drivers under the age of sixteen.b.finally,effective july,the statute was further amended to allow the appointment of an alternate permit supervisor who holds a valid colorado driver license and is years or older.b.in the interim,on august,the dmv allowed marcia barber to sign a designation,granting julianna grandfather permission to supervise julianna driving until she turned sixteen.the designation form indicated that,by signing it,marcia barber was in no way relinquishing any parental rights.
according to her driving logs,julianna practiced six hours of driving with her driving school in october and november of six hours of driving with a driving instructor who donated his time in may,june,july,and early august of and the remainder of her required fifty hours with her grandfather and a family friend in august,september,october,and november of.as discussed,while the earliest date upon which julianna was eligible for a colorado driver license was october,she was granted her license on november,after meeting the dmv requirements.the barbers argue that their injury arises not from the brief delay in julianna being issued her license,but rather from the fact that,because of the statute,julianna was deprived of the full year of supervised driving experience that is the goal of the colorado statute.see.b.
the barbers filed their second amended complaint against the dmv on january,alleging violations of the ada and the rehabilitation act.the statutory amendments rendered these allegations moot,save for the matter of the barbers entitlement to compensatory damages under of the rehabilitation act.barber,wl,at.on may,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the dmv on that issue.id.the barbers moved for reconsideration,which the district court denied.barber,wl,at.this appeal followed.

applicable statutory language 
section of the rehabilitation act provides 
no otherwise qualified individual with a disability shall,solely by reason of her or his disability,be excluded from the participation in,be denied the benefits of,or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance or under any program or activity conducted by any executive agency or by the united states postal service.
a.the provision includes in its definition of a program or activity the operations of any department,agency,special purpose district,or other instrumentality of a state or of a local government.b a.to establish a prima facie claim under,a plaintiff must demonstrate that plaintiff is handicapped under the act she is otherwise qualified to participate in the program the program receives federal financial assistance and the program discriminates against plaintiff.hollonbeck olympic,cir citing powers mjb acquisition,cir.
to recover compensatory damages under,a plaintiff must establish that the agency discrimination was intentional.powers,at indicating that compensatory damages are available only upon a showing of intentional discrimination see davoll webb,cir discussing same.intentional discrimination does not require a showing of personal ill will or animosity toward the disabled person rather,intentional discrimination can be inferred from a defendant deliberate indifference to the strong likelihood that pursuit of its questioned policies will likely result in a violation of federally protected rights.powers,at see also duvall county of kitsap,cir deliberate indifference requires both knowledge that a harm to a federally protected right is substantially likely,and a failure to act upon that likelihood.the parties do not dispute that the dmv falls within the ambit of the act,and we assume without deciding that marcia barber is an otherwise qualified individual with a disability therefore,the central issue remaining is whether the dmv intentionally discriminated against the barbers when it denied marcia barber requested accommodation.
ii.analysis 
the barbers claim that they introduced sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the dmv acted with deliberate indifference to marcia barber federally protected rights under when the dmv had knowledge of potential harm to those rights and failed to act on it.the facts in this unusual case require us to disagree.
the supreme court has recognized that is intended to ensure that an otherwise qualified handicapped individual is provided with meaningful access to the benefit that the grantee offers t o assure meaningful access,reasonable accommodations in the grantee program or benefit may have to be made.alexander choate,d see also mark lemahieu,cir.the test for deliberate indifference in the context of intentional discrimination comprises two prongs knowledge that a harm to a federally protected right is substantially likely,and a failure to act upon that likelihood.duvall,at see powers,at see also city of canton,ohio harris,d discussing the deliberate indifference standard in the context of a claim.
turning to the level of intent required to satisfy the failure to act prong of the deliberate indifference test,a 
failure to act is a result of conduct that is more than negligent,and involves an element of deliberateness.under the second element,a public entity does not act by proffering just any accommodation it must consider the particular individual need when conducting its investigation into what accommodations are reasonable.
lovell chandler,cir quoting duvall,at internal citations omitted.while we do not dispute the dmv had knowledge that marcia barber requested accommodation,the summary judgment evidence,even in the light most favorable to the barbers,simply would not support a finding that the dmv failed to act in response to that knowledge.
two cases from our sister circuits are illustrative.in ferguson city of phoenix,cir,the ninth circuit affirmed a district court grant of summary judgment where users of the city telecommunication device tdd emergency service alleged intentional discrimination.there,the plaintiffs claimed that the city failed to respond to their complaints that the tdd service was faulty however,the court affirmed the district court conclusions that the city internal in response to sporadic complaints followed by diligent effort by the city to upgrade its service did not amount to deliberate indifference.id.at.
in another case,the fifth circuit affirmed a district court denial of judgment as a matter of law,finding that a arrestee produced sufficient evidence to uphold a jury verdict in his favor under the ada and the rehabilitation act.victoria county,cir.in that case,a police officer,despite having knowledge of the arrestee disability,administered sobriety tests with verbal instructions,interrogated him at length,and administered miranda warnings without any accommodations to ensure the arrestee understood those proceedings.id.at.such a blatant disregard of the arrestee disability was held to support a finding of deliberate indifference.id.at.
the unusual facts of this case indicate that the dmv did not act with deliberate indifference.first,the dmv offered marcia barber the option of some form of guardianship,which was an eminently reasonable solution already included in the colorado statute.according to marcia barber,tool,then senior director of the dmv,seemed genuinely concerned and very sympathetic about the situation.initially,tool consulted the state attorney general office in an effort to find a legally acceptable resolution to the issue.although the state attorney general office would not permit julianna grandfather to supervise her driving without some recognition of the statute legal requirements,it did offer her the opportunity to permit him to do so with a guardianship colorado attorney general john suthers testified that he further confirmed the option of creating some type of legal guardianship to enable julianna to practice her driving,indicating,over marcia barber objections to guardianship,that he thought the dmv could find a way to allow the grandfather to supervise julianna driving under the statute he thought a limited guardianship might be appropriate and he did not think anyone was asking her to surrender any parental rights.
second,in as early as november,the dmv was aware that the statute was progressing toward amendment.ordinarily,we would not view the fact of statutory amendment via the legislative process as evidence of action on the part of an accommodating institution.however,it is clear here that the dmv was aware that amendment was coming swiftly.the speed and diligence with which senior state officials sought to amend the statute figures prominently in our view of the case.in fact,the colorado legislature acted about as quickly as a legislature can act.under these unusual circumstances,we do not view the dmv as having acted with deliberate indifference.however,we stress that our holding in no way supports the view that state officials should be permitted to refuse an accommodation in favor of the more usual,lengthier legislative process.
we recognize that the accommodation proposed by barber was very close to the one ultimately accepted by colorado through legislative amendment.the fact that it was objectively reasonable,however,does not carry the day given another objectively reasonable alternative was available colorado law already provided a right to a limited guardianship.although marcia barber does not recall discussing the possibility of a limited guardianship with suthers,her deposition testimony clearly indicates that she was not willing to pursue the matter 
w hat i was asking for was a reasonable accommodation.guardianship was guardianship.i thought that was an unreasonable requirement.that not a reasonable accommodation.that unreasonable.
it a legal requirement would be imposed on me because of my disability that would not be imposed on any other ablebodied person.it called my parenting abilities into question.it required me to give up responsibility.i was looking to give up my parenting role.
in fact,marcia barber later indicated that she did see why she should have been required to explore anything,referring to accommodations other than the one she requested that might have satisfied the statute.that suthers chose not to respond to marcia barber letters for her requested accommodation,which had already been discussed and foreclosed,does not merit a finding of deliberate indifference.
essentially,barber believed that only her suggested accommodation was reasonable,a guardianship would require her to give up her parenting role,and a guardianship called her parenting ability into question.in contrast to barber position,both parties have an obligation to proceed in a reasonably interactive manner to ascertain a reasonable accommodation.smith midland brake,cir.here,it is clear that marcia barber had no intention of engaging in the interactive process with the dmv unless it would yield to her requested accommodation.surely,in this process barber had an obligation to explore the possibility of a guardianship with the dmv,or at least not to refuse to consider the option outright.
however,as marcia barber made clear in her deposition,she was unwilling to accept any form of guardianship.in doing so,she foreclosed her ability to show that the interactive process would have led to a reasonable accommodation.prior cases establish that a disabled plaintiff alleging that an employer failed to properly engage in the interactive process must also establish that the interactive process would have likely produced a reasonable accommodation.for example,in frazier simmons,this court held that a claimant alleging that his employer failed adequately to partake of the interactive process required by the ada will lose on summary judgment if he fails to show that a reasonable accommodation was possible,and that the interactive process would have led to an accommodation,cir quoting smith midland brake,a div.of echlin,cir en banc see also donahue consol.rail,cir addressing a rehabilitation act claim,and holding that if,after a full opportunity for discovery,the summary judgment record is insufficient to establish the existence of an appropriate position into which the plaintiff could have been transferred,summary judgment must be granted in favor of the if it also appears that the defendant failed to engage in good faith in the interactive process.in this case,marcia barber testimony that she would not have accepted a limited guardianship as a reasonable accommodation suggests that,even if the dmv had participated in the interactive process and offered her a limited guardianship,she would have refused the offer.to bring a rehabilitation act claim based on the dmv failure to participate in the interactive process,the barbers must demonstrate that they could have been reasonably accommodated but for the dmv lack of good faith.taylor phoenixville sch,cir.the barbers have failed to demonstrate that the dmv participation in the interactive process would have resulted in a reasonable accommodation.
furthermore,the supreme court has indicated,in the context of the ada,that congress has not defined reasonable as simply meaning the same as effective,and that demand for an effective accommodation could prove unreasonable because of its impact.airways,barnett,d see also dilley supervalu,cir stating that an accommodation will ordinarily be deemed unreasonable if it directly conflicts with a collectively seniority system reed lepage bakeries,cir w hat plaintiff must show further is that her requested accommodation is reasonable.and consistent with its usage throughout the law,the concept of reasonableness constrains the plaintiff in what she can demand from the defendant.to uphold the barbers claim for compensatory damages,we would necessarily need to hold that an institution rejection of any requested accommodation,even when other reasonable options that are more acceptable to the institution are available,results per se in deliberate indifference.the mere fact that the dmv did not accept marcia barber suggested resolution does not establish a deliberate indifference to her situation or her rights.
in a related argument,the barbers claim that the district court erred in concluding that the dmv could not have discriminated because it was adhering to a state statute when denying her requested accommodation.in making this claim,the barbers specifically point to the following language in the district court order 
an accommodation that would have required defendants to willfully ignore or violate the law is per se not reasonable.plaintiffs frustration with the limited legal options available to them short of amendment of the statute is insufficient to sustain their burden of showing that defendants were deliberately indifferent to their federally protected rights.
barber,wl,at.essentially,the barbers claim that the dmv disregarded its duties under in adhering to the colorado licensing statute,thus triggering a conflict with the supremacy clause.
it is well established that congress has the power to preempt state law.crosby foreign trade council,d.a state statute must yield when it conflicts with a federal statute,as in the case where the challenged state statute stands as an o
