attorney general of the state of new hampshire,peter heed,acting in his official capacity attorney general,appeals the district court order declaring unconstitutional and enjoining the enforcement of the parental notification prior to abortion act the act,laws,codified at.ann.rsa.
background 
in june,the new hampshire legislature passed an act requiring parental notification before abortions may be performed on unemancipated minors,which states that 
no abortion shall be performed upon an unemancipated minor or upon a female for whom a guardian or conservator has been appointed pursuant to rsa because of a finding of incompetency,until at least hours after written notice of the pending abortion has been delivered in the manner specified in paragraphs ii and iii.
rsa,paragraph ii specifies that written notice shall be addressed to the parent at the usual place of abode of the parent and delivered personally to the parent by the physician or an agent.rsa,ii.paragraph iii allows for notification by certified mail with return receipt requested and with restricted delivery to the addressee.rsa,iii.
the notice requirement is waived if 
a the attending abortion provider certifies in the pregnant minor medical record that the abortion is necessary to prevent the minor death and there is insufficient time to provide required notice or 
b the person or persons who are entitled to notice certify in writing that they have been notified.
if a minor does not want her parent or guardian notified,she may request a state judge,after a hearing,to authorize an abortion provider to perform the abortion if said judge determines that the pregnant minor is mature and capable of giving informed consent to the proposed abortion,or if the judge determines that the performance of an abortion upon her without notification of her parent,guardian,or conservator would be in her best interests.rsa,ii.in these proceedings,the pregnant minor may act on her own behalf or be appointed a guardian ad litem,and she must also be advised that she has a right to request counsel.rsa,ii a.the court proceedings shall be confidential and shall be given such precedence over other pending matters so that the court may reach a decision promptly and without delay so as to serve the best interest of the pregnant minor.rsa,ii b.specifically,i n no case shall the court fail to rule within calendar days from the time the petition is filed.rsa,ii b.the judge must also make in writing specific factual findings and legal conclusions,and order a record of the evidence to be maintained.rsa,ii b.
if the minor petition is denied,an expedited confidential appeal shall be available,and the appellate court must rule within seven calendar days of the docketing of the appeal.access to the trial and appellate courts for the purposes of these petitions shall be afforded such a pregnant minor hours a day,days a week.rsa,ii c.
violation of the act can result in criminal penalties and civil liability 
performance of an abortion in violation of this subdivision shall be a misdemeanor and shall be grounds for a civil action by a person wrongfully denied notification.a person shall not be held liable under this section if the person establishes by written evidence that the person relied upon evidence sufficient to convince a careful and prudent person that the representations of the pregnant minor regarding information necessary to comply with this section are bona fide and true,or if the person has attempted by reasonable diligence to deliver notice,but has been unable to do so.
rsa.the act was to take effect on december.laws.
on november,planned parenthood of northern new england,concord feminist health center of portsmouth,feminist health center of portsmouth,and wayne goldner,plaintiffs filed a complaint under,seeking a declaratory judgment that the act is unconstitutional and a preliminary injunction to prevent its enforcement once it became effective the district court merged the preliminary and permanent injunction proceedings and,on december,issued an order holding the act unconstitutional and permanently enjoining its enforcement.
the district court found unconstitutional both the lack of an explicit exception to protect the health of the pregnant minor,and the narrowness of the act exception for abortions necessary to prevent the minor death.having found the act fatally flawed in these respects,the district court declined to rule on the constitutionality of the act failure to provide specific protections for the confidentiality of a minor seeking a judicial waiver.
the attorney general,acting in his official capacity,appeals.
ii.analysis 
we review the district court decision regarding the constitutionality of a statute de novo.united states lewko,cir.
the attorney general argues that in deciding whether the act is facially invalid we should apply the no set of circumstances standard set forth in united states salerno,d this standard requires plaintiffs challenging a state law as facially invalid to show that no set of circumstances exists under which the act would be valid.id.at.the attorney general argument rests on the premise that the salerno standard is applicable to the act despite the agreement of a plurality of justices in planned parenthood of southeastern casey,d,that a law which has the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus places an unconstitutional undue burden on the exercise of her right to choose abortion.a majority of the casey court applied that standard to determine that an abortion regulation is facially invalid if in a large fraction of cases in which the regulation is relevant,it will operate as a substantial obstacle to a woman choice to undergo an abortion,thus imposing an undue burden.id.at.per justices,kennedy,and souter,joined by justices stevens and blackmun.the court has since confirmed that a law designed to further the state interest in fetal life which imposes an undue burden on the woman decision before fetal viability is unconstitutional.stenberg carhart,d quoting casey,at.see also id.at.declaring nebraska ban on partial birth abortion unconstitutional under undue burden standard.
despite the supreme court clear application of the undue burden standard in casey and stenberg,it has never explicitly addressed the standard tension with salerno.in the instant case,while recognizing that this court has yet to address the issue,the district court followed the majority of circuits that apply the casey and stenberg standard to legislation regulating abortion.the attorney general notes that the supreme court applied the salerno standard in the abortion context prior to casey,see,ohio akron ctr.for reprod.health,d,and urges us to follow the fifth circuit decision in barnes moore,cir,that casey does not displace salerno no set of circumstances test for facial challenges to abortion regulation.see also causeway med.suite ieyoub,cir declining to reverse barnes.the overwhelming majority of circuits to address this issue,however,have disagreed with the fifth circuit see,planned parenthood of cent.farmer,cir holding undue burden standard,instead of salerno standard,applies in abortion context after casey planned parenthood of lawall,cir noting inconsistency between casey and salerno,and following great weight of circuit authority holding that casey has overruled salerno in the context of facial challenges to abortion statutes,amended on denial of reh g,cir women med.voinovich,cir holding that casey effectively overruled salerno,cert.denied,d jane bangerter,cir observing that supreme court applied undue burden test instead of salerno test in casey,rendering undue burden the proper test after casey,cert.denied sub,leavitt jane,d planned parenthood,sioux falls clinic miller,cir opting to follow what the supreme court actually than what it failed to apply the test,cert.denied sub,janklow planned parenthood,d a woman.side women clinic newman,cir reconciling conflict between salerno,and,by construing no set of circumstances language as a suggestion that gives way to stenberg holding that undue burden test applies,cert.denied,d.we agree with these six circuit courts that the undue burden as a standard of general application by the casey plurality,casey,at,and twice applied to abortion regulations by a majority of the court,id.at.stenberg,at.salerno in the context of abortion regulation.
complementing the general undue burden standard,the supreme court has also identified a specific and independent constitutional requirement that an abortion regulation must contain an exception for the preservation of a pregnant woman health.see stenberg,at.identifying two independent reasons for striking down a nebraska regulation first,that it lacks a health exception,and second,that it imposes an undue burden on a woman ability to choose abortion.the origin of the health requirement can be traced to roe,which held that the state,in promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life,may regulate abortion after fetal viability except where necessary,in appropriate medical judgment,for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.roe wade,d emphasis added,reaff casey,at.plurality opinion.later,the majority in casey observed that,had the medical emergency exception to pennsylvania abortion them a parental consent immediate abortion despite some significant health risks,it would have been unconstitutional since the essential holding of roe forbids a state to interfere with a woman choice to undergo an abortion if continuing her pregnancy would constitute a threat to her health.casey,at.finally,in stenberg,at,the supreme court clarified that the law requires a health exception in order to validate even a postviability abortion regulation,and it at a minimum requires the same in respect to previability regulations,at.thus,a statute regulating abortion must contain a health exception in order to survive constitutional challenge.similarly,roe requires that abortion regulations contain an adequate death exception to permit abortion when it is necessary to save the life of a pregnant woman.roe,at.
the instant case thus presents three questions whether new hampshire act contains an adequate health exception,whether it contains an adequate death exception,and whether it places an undue burden on unemancipated minors who wish to obtain an abortion.a state decision to require parental notification for minors seeking an abortion is not constitutionally infirm per se.see lambert wicklund,d upholding parental notification statute against constitutional challenge to judicial bypass procedure.the district court determined,however,that the new hampshire act lack of a health exception and overly narrow death exception render it unconstitutional.appellees argue that the act also creates an undue burden by failing to adequately ensure the confidentiality of judicial bypass procedures.
health exception 
the attorney general and amici suggest that parental notification laws are shielded from the health exception requirement reiterated in stenberg on account of the interests they aim to protect parental notification laws are enacted not only in furtherance of the state interest in the potentiality of human life,roe,at,but also in the interest of protecting minors from undertaking the risks of abortion without the advice and support of a parent.in considering an abortion regulation based on interests other than the one identified in roe,however,the supreme court has determined that it can not see how the differences could make any difference to the application of the health requirement.stenberg,at.see also casey,at.a statute which,while furthering the interest in potential life or some other valid state interest,has the effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman choice can not be considered a permissible means of serving its legitimate ends.emphasis added plurality opinion.the constitution requires a health exception even when the state interest in regulation is compelling.see roe,at.see also stenberg,at.a state may promote but not endanger a woman health when it regulates the methods of abortion.thus,regardless of the interests served by new hampshire parental notice statute,it does not escape the constitution requirement of a health exception.
the attorney general and amici also argue that our decision should be controlled by hodgson minnesota,d,in which the supreme court upheld a parental notification statute that contained no health exception.however,as noted by the district court,the hodgson court did not consider a challenge to that statute lack of a health exception and even if it had,the subsequent decisions in casey and stenberg would nevertheless require a health exception in the instant case.the additional cases cited by the attorney general and amici as examples of parental notification or consent statutes upheld without a health exception are all similarly distinguishable.only three times since roe has the supreme court addressed a clear challenge to an abortion regulation lack of a health exception.in all three,the court has indicated that an exception must be provided when the restriction would place a woman health at risk.see stenberg,at.requiring health exception for abortion ban casey,at.reading medical emergency exception to include threat to health thornburgh am.coll.of obstetricians and gynecologists,d finding statute requiring presence of second physician for abortion facially invalid for lack of medical emergency exception,overruled on other grounds,casey,at.
since stenberg,at least two circuit courts have applied the health exception requirement to parental notice or consent laws.in planned parenthood of the rocky mountains services,owens,cir,the tenth circuit held that,because circumstances existed in which a pregnancy complication could seriously threaten a pregnant minor health,a colorado parental notification law similar to the new hampshire act was facially invalid for lack of a health exception.similarly,the ninth circuit recently struck down an idaho parental consent statute,finding that a health exception is as requisite in statutory or regulatory provisions affecting only minors access to abortion as it is in regulations concerning adult women.planned parenthood of idaho,wasden,cir finding idaho statute health exception overly narrow.we agree,and therefore affirm the district court holding that the new hampshire act is constitutionally invalid in the absence of a health exception.
acknowledging that the act contains no explicit health exception,the attorney general argues that other provisions of new hampshire law provide a functional equivalent.none of the proffered statutes,however,is adequate.rsa precludes civil liability for health professionals who render emergency medical care without consent,but it does not preclude criminal liability.rsa,vii b permits physicians and their assistants to use force in providing emergency medical care when no one competent to consent to such care is available.while rsa,vii b may preclude criminal liability for assault,it would not insulate a physician from criminal liability for violating the act notification provisions.see rsa providing that violation of the act notice requirement is a misdemeanor.moreover,the proffered statutes insulate medical personnel from civil liability or assault charges that arise from giving treatment without consent they do not provide such protection when the legal action arises from giving treatment to a consenting minor without first providing hours notice to her parent.
for the first time,in this appeal,the attorney general also cites rsa,i,which codifies the competing harms defense to criminal liability for those who violate the law in order to avoid harm that outweigh s,according to ordinary standards of reasonableness,the harm sought to be prevented by the criminal provision.although this provision has the potential to protect against criminal liability under the act,it can not preclude civil liability.moreover,the provision would leave providers uncertain whether,in any given circumstance,providing an abortion in violation of the act would meet the ordinary standards of reasonableness.
even if these statutes could be cobbled together to preclude all civil and criminal liability for medical personnel who violate the act notice requirements in order to preserve a minor health,we would not view them as equivalent to the constitutionally required health exception.the basic canons of statutory construction in new hampshire require us to look first to a statute plain meaning,and when it is clear and unambiguous,to apply the statute as written.see,appeal of astro spectacular.the act clearly states that n o abortion shall be performed upon an unemancipated minor until at least hours after written notice to a parent.rsa.three explicit exceptions to this rule are provided when abortion is necessary to prevent the minor death when a parent certifies in writing that he or she has been notified and when a court grants a judicial bypass.rsa,i,ii.the new hampshire legislature intent that abortions not in compliance with the act notification provisions be prohibited in all but these three circumstances is clear.see joseph hosp.of nashua rizzo,espousing expressio unius standard of statutory construction.the statutory provisions cited by the attorney general can not be read to supercede this intent.see petition of dunlap,when a conflict exists between two statutes,the later statute will control,especially when the later statute deals with a subject in a specific way and the earlier enactment treats the subject in a general fashion.quoting bd.of selectmen planning.
finally,the attorney general argues that the act judicial bypass mechanism allows prompt authorization of a abortion without notice.the act provides that such proceedings shall be given such precedence over other pending matters so that the court may reach a decision promptly and without delay,provides minors,access to the courts,and provides for expedited appeal.rsa,ii b c.however,the act allows courts seven calendar days in which to rule on minors petitions,and another seven calendar days on appeal.delays of up to two weeks can therefore occur,during which time a minor health may be adversely affected.even when the courts act as expeditiously as possible,those minors who need an immediate abortion to protect their health are at risk.due to this delay,the act bypass provision does not stand in for the constitutionally required health exception.see thornburgh,at.finding statute facially invalid for failing to provide health exception to delay caused by awaiting presence of second physician.
the new hampshire act contains no explicit health exception,and no health exception is implied by other provisions of new hampshire law or by the act judicial bypass procedure.thus,the act is facially unconstitutional.
death exception 
just as it requires a health exception,the constitution also requires an exception to abortion restrictions when the life of a pregnant woman is in danger.stenberg,at.t he governing standard requires an exception where it is necessary,in appropriate medical judgment for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.quoting casey,at.accordingly,the new hampshire act waives its parental notice requirement when a physician can certify that abortion is necessary to prevent the minor death and there is insufficient time to provide the required notice.rsa,i a.appellees argue that this death exception is unconstitutionally narrow because it is not possible for a physician to determine with any certainty whether death will occur before the notice provisions could be complied with it does not allow for circumstances in which abortion is the best,but not the only,option for saving a minor life and it does not permit abortion providers to rely on their own good faith judgment about whether an abortion is necessary.the attorney general does not refute these charges,but responds that the act is sufficiently specific to give notice of prohibited conduct,and that a scienter requirement can be read into the act from new hampshire law.
a minimum of hours is necessary for compliance with the act notification requirement.rsa,wayne goldner,a named plaintiff in this case,provided unopposed testimony that physicians can not predict with adequate precision what course medical complications will take,and thus can not always determine whether death will occur within this time window.consequently,the time component of the act death exception forces physicians either to gamble with their patients lives in hopes of complying with the notice requirement before a minor death becomes inevitable,or to risk criminal and civil liability by providing an abortion without parental notice.see declaration of wayne goldner,at t he act will force me to choose between following the law and letting my patient condition deteriorate,possibly past the point of being able to save her life at all,and alternatively providing appropriate medical care to my patient and risking criminal prosecution and being sued by her parents.the threat of such sanctions will have a profound chilling effect on the willingness of physicians to perform abortions when a minor life is at risk.colautti,at.thus,the act death exception is drawn too narrowly to protect minors in need of a abortion.
the attorney general apparently concedes that an abortion provider must be able to rely on his or her good faith medical judgment in determining whether her patient life is in danger.see colautti,at.we need not now decide whether,under a properly drafted statute,a finding of bad faith or some other type of scienter would be required before a physician could be held criminally responsible for an erroneous determination of viability.we reaffirm,however,that the determination of whether a particular fetus is viable is,and must be,a matter for the judgment of the responsible attending physician.the attorney general argues that rsa,i,which states that a person is guilty of a misdemeanor only if he acts purposely,knowingly,recklessly or negligently,as the law may require,with respect to each element of the offense,can be read together with the act to provide the necessary scienter requirement.according to the supreme court of new hampshire,w here a specific mental state is not provided for the offense,rsa,i a requires proof of a culpable mental state which is appropriate in light of the nature of the offense and the policy considerations for punishing the conduct in question.state bergen,determining requisite mental state for indecent exposure.it is not clear,however,which of the four scienter requirements would be imposed in this circumstance.the definition of negligence imposes an objective reasonableness standard,see rsa,ii d,thus,a physician who acts on a good faith belief that abortion is necessary to save a patient life could nonetheless face criminal or civil liability if a judge or jury later found that the physician assessment was unreasonable.see voinovich,at in this area of medical necessity where there is such disagreement,it is unlikely that the prosecution could not find a physician willing to testify that the physician did not act reasonably.
as the district court held,we can not construe the act to preclude liability for good faith judgments unless such a construction is reasonable and readily apparent.heed,d at quoting stenberg,at.the act gives no indication that the negligence standard set out in rsa,i should not be applied.thus,a physician can not know whether his or her determination that a minor life is at risk will be judged according to a standard,knowingly that respects her medical assessment,or by an objective standard negligently that would leave the physician judgment open to post hoc second guessing.the resulting uncertainty would,again,impermissibly chill physicians willingness and ability to provide lifesaving abortions.see voinovich,at finding medical emergency exception unconstitutionally vague because physicians can not know the standard under which their conduct will ultimately be judged.as goldner explained,the act forces doctors to think about criminal prosecution at a time when we need to be concentrating on doing what is best for our patients,thus creating unnecessary risk to patients health and lives.declaration of wayne goldner,at.that risk constitutes an u
