the offense 
the victim delivered pizzas for a pizzeria.on the night of the robbery,a young male voice placed a telephone order for two pizzas to be delivered to west merle court.
when the victim arrived with the pizzas at west merle court,appellant was standing at the front of the driveway.he informed the victim that the house he was looking for was in the back and accompanied the victim down the driveway.at the rear of the driveway,appellant pointed what appeared to be a shiny silver semiautomatic handgun at the victim head,demanded his money,and ordered him to drop everything.the victim dropped the pizzas on the driveway and gave appellant his money.appellant told the victim to leave.just as the victim got to his car,appellant demanded his cell phone.the victim threw the phone to appellant and drove back to the pizzeria.
before the victim arrived back at the pizzeria,the same caller who had placed the order telephoned the pizzeria again to say his order had not yet been delivered.the receptionist told him she would try to contact the deliveryman.she never did so because two minutes after she took the call saying the pizzas had not yet been delivered,the victim entered the pizzeria and said he had just had a gun shoved in his face.he and the receptionist contacted the police.upon their arrival at the pizzeria,the police instructed the receptionist to telephone the number from which the order had been placed and say she was sending a free pizza.the receptionist spoke to the same caller who had placed the order.he directed her to have the pizza delivered to west merle court instead of west merle court.

discussion 
substantial evidence a bb gun is a dangerous weapon 
appellant does not challenge the robbery finding,nor does he now claim that he did not use a bb gun during the commission of the robbery.he contends there is insufficient evidence to support the finding that the particular bb gun he used was a deadly or dangerous weapon,within the meaning of section,subdivision b.
when a defendant claims insufficient evidence to support a finding,the appellate court must review the whole record in the light most favorable to the judgment below to determine whether it discloses substantial is,evidence which is reasonable,credible,and of solid that a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.people johnson cal d.we presume the existence of every fact the trier of fact could reasonably deduce from the evidence.people lewis cal d.the same standard of review applies to claims of insufficient evidence by a juvenile criminal defendant.see in re jerry th,d.
section,subdivision b,states,in pertinent part any person who personally uses a deadly or dangerous weapon in the commission of a felony shall be punished by an additional and consecutive term of imprisonment in the state prison for one year the statute does not define deadly or dangerous weapon.to find a section,subdivision b allegation true,the fact finder must conclude that the defendant himself intentionally displayed an instrument capable of inflicting great bodily injury or death in a menacing manner during the crime.people wims cal th,d.
cases have historically recognized a pellet gun as a dangerous weapon in the context of penal statutes in which proof that the perpetrator was armed with a dangerous weapon is an element of the crime.under former section,for example,conviction of first degree robbery required the robbery to be perpetrated by a person armed with a dangerous or deadly weapon people sherman d.affirmed a conviction of first degree robbery,rejecting the defendant argument that no evidence was presented that the pellet gun used in the robbery,which the victim had described as resembling a german luger,constituted a deadly weapon.t he evidence shows,and defendant conceded,that the gun was a dangerous weapon the words dangerous or deadly are used disjunctively.thus,it is not necessary to show that the weapon is deadly so long as it can be shown that it is dangerous.citation.citation.any gun,even a short one,may be a dangerous weapon within the meaning of the statute since it is capable of being used as a bludgeon a metal gun the size and shape of the pellet gun used in the robbery,which has the appearance of a luger,is sufficient to constitute a dangerous weapon within the meaning of former section.sherman,supra,at,citations omitted.
in people burns d,the defendant was charged in the accusatory pleading with an arming enhancement under former section.the jury found the defendant guilty of first degree robbery but found he was not armed with a deadly weapon in the commission of the offense,as required to prove the section enhancement.burns,supra,at,italics added.burns concluded there was no inconsistency in the verdict.at the time defendant was arrested a pellet gun was found in the car.the victim identified this gun as the robbery weapon.accordingly,under the state of the evidence the jury could conclude that this gun was used in the robbery and that it was a dangerous weapon.proof that the robber was armed with a gun that could be a dangerous weapon would support a conviction of robbery of the first degree.this is true even though it would not establish that he was armed with a deadly weapon.id.at.
in people graham cal d,the defendant kicked the robbery victim,and the issue was whether a shoe was a dangerous weapon within the meaning of former section.citing people raleigh people raleigh,graham distinguished between two classes of dangerous or deadly weapons for purposes of the statute.there are,first,those instrumentalities which are weapons in the strict sense of the word,and,second,those instrumentalities which are not weapons in the strict sense of the word,but which may be used as such.the instrumentalities falling in the first class,such as guns,dirks and blackjacks,which are weapons in the strict sense of the word and are dangerous or deadly to others in the ordinary use for which they are designed,may be said as a matter of law to be dangerous or deadly weapons.this is true as the ordinary use for which they are designed establishes their character as such.the instrumentalities falling into the second class,such as ordinary razors,hatpins,canes,hammers,hatchets and other sharp or heavy objects,which are not weapons in the strict sense of the word and are not dangerous or deadly to others in the ordinary use for which they are designed,may not be said as a matter of law to be dangerous or deadly weapons.when it appears,however,that an instrumentality other than one falling within the first class is capable of being used in a dangerous or deadly manner,and it may be fairly inferred
