since march,courts across the country have attempted to apply the united states supreme court landmark decision in crawford washington,d crawford in thousands of cases potentially implicating the sixth amendment right of confrontation.case that may fairly be characterized as a revolutionary decision in the law of evidence people pantoja th,d held that an testimonial statement of an absent witness is admissible at trial only where the declarant is unavailable,and only where the defendant has had a prior opportunity to.crawford,supra,at,fn.omitted.the late chief justice rehnquist lamented prophetically that the court decision casts a mantle of uncertainty over future federal and state criminal trials id.at.conc.opn.of rehnquist,and that the majority reluctance to define testimonial left federal and state prosecutors temporarily without answers as to what types of statements would be deemed testimonial under the new rule announced in crawford.id.at.
appellate courts have utilized a number of different tests and criteria to define testimonial in addressing claims that the admission of an unavailable witness hearsay statement violated a defendant constitutional right of confrontation.we are required here to determine whether a robbery victim account of the crime given to the police in the field immediately following the commission of the crime was a testimonial statement.

testimony of lisa dallmann 
on the afternoon of march while she was in her marina apartment,lisa dallmann heard a woman screaming.after dallmann went outside,she saw a young woman running after a man.the woman screamed,help me,help me.stop him.stop him.someone stop him.please help me.the man who was running from the young woman had something in his left hand that had a strap dallmann testified that it looked like a purse.dallmann went back to her apartment and called.
ii.testimony of aaron martinez 
aaron martinez was stopped at a traffic signal at reservation road and del monte in marina.he heard screaming and yelling and backed up his truck to investigate the commotion.martinez saw the minor running down a path with a purse.he observed that the minor was being chased by a woman who was screaming for help,trying to get her purse back.
martinez turned his truck around to the direction the minor was headed and honked the horn to scare him.he positioned the truck in front of the minor,got out of his truck,and told the minor to stop.the minor stopped on the path,tried to change direction,and dropped the purse.martinez gave the purse to the woman and continued to pursue the minor the minor crossed the street and stopped running.martinez told the minor repeatedly to get on the ground martinez and another man stood by the minor after he got on the ground until the police arrived a short time afterward.
iii.testimony of sergeant jeffrey carr 
direct testimony 
jeffrey carr is a patrol sergeant with the marina department of public safety.on the afternoon of march,he was dispatched to the vicinity of reservation road in marina.sergeant carr was responding initially to a suspicious circumstance involving a woman being chased by a male,which was later upgraded while they were in route to a robbery that just occurred.
when sergeant carr arrived on the scene,there were already two public safety officers officer bechtel and lieutenant melendy present,and t here were also two or three other people standing around the person that was on the ground.sergeant carr initially was diverted to a woman yelling at him over a fence from an apartment complex.because the woman was very agitated and animated,he thought initially that she might be involved,a victim.after learning that the woman was instead a witness,a reporting party who had seen part of the incident,he asked her to stand by.
sergeant carr approached the person on the ground.as the two other officers were handcuffing the minor,sergeant carr overheard the civilian males in the group say that the minor had robbed someone 
sergeant carr then contacted the victim,barbara durward,who was located about to feet from the group and was leaning against a retaining wall adjacent to the sidewalk.she was dressed casually but she seemed a little disheveled.when sergeant carr first contacted her,she was extremely excited and agitated she was visibly upset and shaken.her purse lay on the ground next to her during the interview.
testimony describing the statement of the victim 
over the minor repeated hearsay objections sergeant carr offered testimony as to what durward told him when he interviewed her in the field.durward identified herself and complained of pain in the back of her head and middle of her back.she stated during the altercation she had been struck in the back of the head and that after she went down to the ground,she believe d she was kicked in the center of the back.
durward told sergeant carr that while walking in the brush at wetlands park,she heard a noise behind her.she then saw a young hispanic male standing behind her.the male said something like,do you want to have some fun durward responded in the negative and tried to hurry away from him.the male then struck her on the back of the head with what felt like the flat of his hand,which caused her to fall to her knees.durward then felt a sharp blow to the center of her back that felt as if the male had kicked her this caused her to fall on her stomach.durward felt her purse and her nap sack sic being tugged on.the male tried to pull them away from her.durward said that she turned onto her back and tried to kick the male as he was attempting to wrest the bags from her.the male yanked on the purse and she finally lost the grasp of the straps and then he turned and ran away with the bags.durward chased after the male,and she was screaming to anybody that could hear her,stop,call the police.
as the police were handcuffing him,durward identified the minor as the male who had robbed her.sergeant carr testified that o nce we got to that point of worrying about how much everything was worth,durward said that she estimated the value of the purse and contents to be about.
procedural background 
on march,the monterey county district attorney filed a petition under welfare and institutions code section with the juvenile court,alleging that the minor,on or about march,committed a felony,namely,robbery violation of,after a jurisdictional hearing on the petition,the court found the allegation true on april.the court thereafter committed the minor to the california youth authority for a period of five years.the minor filed timely a notice of appeal.
discussion 
claimed violation of confrontation righta.contentions of the parties 
the minor contends that the court committed prejudicial error by permitting sergeant carr to testify to the substance of durward statement given to him.he claims that admission of the evidence was improper because it violated the guarantee under the sixth amendment of the united states constitution that i n all criminal prosecutions,the accused shall enjoy the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him.the minor argues that,even if it was a spontaneous declaration under evidence code section and thus an exception to the hearsay rule the victim statement was inadmissible under crawford,supra,d,because it was a testimonial statement of an unavailable witness and the minor had no opportunity to the witness 
the attorney general makes two essential points in response to the minor claim of error.the focus of the response is that the minor forfeited his appellate claim of crawford error by failing to object below on confrontation grounds to the admission of the victim statement.second,the attorney general argues briefly that,in any event,the court properly allowed the victim statement because it was a spontaneous statement that was nontestimonial.
we first summarize the holding in crawford,supra,d.next we address whether the minor forfeited any appellate challenge that he was deprived of his constitutional right of confrontation.rejecting the attorney general forfeiture argument,we review the supreme court discussion of the meaning of the term testimonial in the context of the admission of statements and the application of the sixth amendment right of confrontation.lastly,we determine whether there was crawford error here and whether any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.
crawford washington 
in crawford,the supreme court was called upon to reexamine the admissibility of an absent witness statements under the sixth amendment confrontation clause.under the high court prior decision in ohio roberts,d roberts,the test for admissibility was as follows a n unavailable witness statement may be admitted so long as it has adequate indicia of,falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception or bears particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.citation.crawford,supra,at,quoting roberts,supra,at.
in people pirwani th,d,we described crawford factual and procedural context t he defendant was charged with assault but claimed.the police interrogated both the defendant and his wife,sylvia.sylvia statement subtly undermined her husband defense.at trial,sylvia did not testify because the defendant invoked the state marital privilege.crawford,supra,at.the prosecution then offered her taped statement to police as a statement against her penal interest.the defendant objected on confrontation clause grounds,but the washington state trial court found the statements trustworthy and admissible under ohio roberts after state court appeals that ultimately resulted in affirmance of the judgment,t he united states supreme court granted certiorari to determine whether the state use of sylvia statement violated the confrontation clause.crawford,supra,at.
the supreme court repudiated the roberts test,concluding that it allows a jury to hear evidence,untested by the adversary process,based on a mere judicial determination of reliability.it thus replaces the constitutionally prescribed method of assessing reliability with a wholly foreign one.crawford,supra,at.instead,the high court held that,in keeping with the understanding of the framers of our nation constitution,t estimonial statements of witnesses absent from trial may be admitted only where the declarant is unavailable,and only where the defendant has had a prior opportunity to.id.at,fn.omitted.
potential forfeiture of constitutional challenge 
the attorney general argues that the minor forfeited his crawford challenge by failing to raise that objection below.the attorney general asserts that the minor objected to durward statement solely on hearsay grounds and that this objection was insufficient to preserve the minor claim of crawford error.
the relevant statute governing the preservation of evidentiary objections for appeal provides a verdict or finding shall not be set aside,nor shall the judgment or decision based thereon be reversed,by reason of the erroneous admission of evidence unless a there appears of record an objection to or a motion to exclude or to strike the evidence that was timely made and so stated as to make clear the specific ground of the objection or motion and b the reviewing court is of the opinion that the admitted evidence should have been excluded on the ground stated and that the error or errors complained of resulted in a miscarriage of justice.thus,questions relating to the admissibility of evidence will not be reviewed on appeal in the absence of a specific and timely objection in the trial court on the ground sought to be urged on appeal.citation.citation.people seijas cal th,d.
were we to look no further than that portion of the reporter transcript concerning sergeant carr testimony,we would agree with the attorney general position that the minor forfeited his constitutional challenge.during testimony describing durward statement,the minor repeated hearsay objections not object to the evidence on confrontation grounds.but during closing argument that immediately followed sergeant carr testimony,the minor counsel twice stated that she had had no opportunity to the victim.the court disregarded the objection and noted that the victim statement had been admitted as a spontaneous statement under evidence code section we find these statements during closing argument to have been sufficient to preserve the minor crawford challenge.
as our high court explained last november,the requirement of a specific trial objection to preserve a matter for appeal is necessary in criminal cases because a contrary rule would deprive the people of the opportunity to cure the defect at trial and would permit the defendant to gamble on an acquittal at his trial secure in the knowledge that a conviction would be reversed on appeal.citation.a specifically grounded objection to a defined body of evidence allows the trial judge to consider excluding the evidence or limiting its admission to avoid possible prejudice.it also allows the proponent of the evidence to lay additional foundation,modify the offer of proof,or take other steps designed to minimize the prospect of reversal.citation.thus,the requirement of a specific objection serves important purposes.but,to further these purposes,the requirement must be interpreted reasonably,not formalistically.evidence code section does not exalt form over substance.citation.people partida cal th,d.
in this instance,the minor made the specific objection that the admission of durward statement deprived him of his confrontation right.his only failing was that his objection occurred after albeit moments after the evidence was admitted in making the objection that he was deprived of the right to the victim,the minor did so in such a way as to alert the trial court to the nature of the anticipated evidence and the basis on which exclusion was sought.people williams cal d.the minor objection fairly inform ed the trial court,as well as the party offering the evidence,of the specific reason for excluding the evidence,thereby allowing the party offering the evidence the opportunity to respond appropriately and the court the ability to make a fully informed ruling.people partida,supra,cal th at,d,see also people scott cal d,objection in criminal case will be deemed preserved if,despite inadequate phrasing,the record shows that the court understood the issue presented.
it would indeed exalt form over would be contrary to the purpose of the specific objection rule under evidence code section we to conclude that the minor forfeited his constitutional challenge simply because he made it during the trial,but moments late.we decline to apply the forfeiture doctrine so formalistically we hold here that the minor preserved his constitutional challenge 
meaning of testimonial under crawford 
as discussed in part i section b,ante,crawford held that an testimonial statement by an unavailable witness is inadmissible unless the defendant had a previous opportunity to that witness.the supreme court declined to spell out a comprehensive definition of testimonial.crawford,supra,at,fn.omitted see also people roldan cal th,fn,d,after crawford,the precise contours of the category of testimonial statements remain unclear.but it did provide some guidance.
the court explained that the principal evil at which the confrontation clause was directed was the mode of criminal procedure,and particularly its use of ex parte examinations as evidence against the accused.it was these practices that english law assertion of a right to confrontation was meant to prohibit and that the rhetoric decried.the sixth amendment must be interpreted with this focus in mind.crawford,supra,at.the court thus concluded that w hatever else the term testimonial covers,it applies at a minimum to prior testimony at a preliminary hearing,before a grand jury,or at a former trial and to police interrogations.these are the modern practices with closest kinship to the abuses at which the confrontation clause was directed.id.at.see also id.at.statements obtained by police in the course of interrogations are also testimonial under even a narrow standard.
in addition to offering these four examples of testimonial statements,the crawford court provided three illustrations of non testimonial statements business records crawford,supra,at.but see people mitchell th,d business records may be testimonial if produced with an eye toward trial statements in furtherance of a conspiracy crawford,supra,at.and casual remark s to acquaintance s id.at.as to the third example,the court contrasted two seemingly polar opposite statements an accuser who makes a formal statement to government officers bears testimony in a sense that a person who makes a casual remark to an acquaintance does not.see also ibid,overheard remark bears little resemblance to the abuses the confrontation clause targeted.
the supreme giving four examples of testimonial statements and three others that are decidedly three proposed formulations for identifying a testimonial statement various formulations of this core class of testimonial statements exist ex parte testimony or its functional is,material such as affidavits,custodial examinations,prior testimony that the defendant was unable to,or similar pretrial statements that declarants would reasonably expect to be used prosecutorially,brief for petitioner extrajudicial statements contained in formalized testimonial materials,such as affidavits,depositions,prior testimony,or confessions,white illinois,d thomas,joined by scalia,concurring in part and concurring in judgment and statements that were made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial,brief for national association of criminal defense lawyers et as amici curiae.these formulations all share a common nucleus and then define the confrontation clause coverage at various levels of abstraction around it.crawford,supra,at.
courts disagree on whether the identification of these formulations in crawford represented the supreme court adoption of them as categories of testimonial statements.some courts have read crawford as holding that any statement falling within any of the three descriptions is indisputably testimonial.see people morgan th,d referring to crawford formulations as definitions people corella th,d corella crawford states that a testimonial hearsay statement includes each of the three formulations people cervantes th,d formulations represent illustrations of statements that could be considered testimonial.
but other courts have concluded that the formulations in crawford are something less than standards for determining if a statement is testimonial.see people taulton th,d nothing in crawford compels the conclusion that,by quoting a statement from a brief,the court intended to adopt its language as the test for determining whether a statement is testimonial people rincon th,d crawford formulations are some suggestive,guidelines.absent a contrary pronouncement from the supreme court,we conclude that the three formulations are proposed standards for determining whether a statement is testimonial.see cromer cir,crawford court found no need to choose among various proposed formulations for defining the core of testimonial statements kirst,does crawford provide a stable foundation for confrontation doctrine brooklyn.we believe that these formulations as well as,potentially,others are subject to further consideration by our nation highest court when it has occasion to define more specifically those statements that are testimonial under its holding in crawford 
application of crawford 
in assessing the minor contention that he was deprived of his constitutional right of confrontation we must decide whether,under crawford,durward statement was testimonial.as a starting point,we note that the statement was not any of the three forms of statements that the supreme court declared to be clearly nontestimonial it was not a business record crawford,supra,at,a statement in furtherance of a conspiracy ibid,or a casual remark to an acquaintance id.at.likewise,at least three of the four kinds of statements that crawford held were clearly testimonial are not applicable here durward statement was clearly not prior testimony at a preliminary hearing,before a grand jury,or at a former trial.id.at.
but the answer is less clear as to crawford fourth example of testimonial statements police interrogations.crawford,supra,at.like the term testimonial,the court did not define interrogation.but it stated that it use d the term interrogation in its colloquial,rather than any technical legal,sense.citation.just as various definitions of testimonial exist,one can imagine various definitions of interrogation,and we need not select among them in this case.the witness recorded statement,knowingly given in response to structured police questioning,qualifies under any conceivable definition.crawford,supra,at,fn.
thus,in determining whether the victim statement was testimonial,we decide whether it was the product of police interrogation.in doing so,we identify and discuss the factors here that potentially support and potentially rebut a finding that the statement was the product of police interrogation.in the context of such inquiry,we also examine whether it was objectively reasonable for durward to have anticipated that her statement would be made available for future prosecution.
factors suggesting statement was the product of police interrogation 
some aspects of durward statement suggest that it was the product of police interrogation and thus testimonial.crawford,supra,at.sergeant carr himself testified that he obtained the victim statement he also used the term interview to describe his contact with her.apart from the officer characterization of the encounter,that durward gave her statement to sergeant carr while he was investigating a crime is suggestive of an interrogation.see black law dict.ed,investigatory interrogation.routine,nonaccusatory questioning by the police of a person who is not in custody.the fact that a statement was given to a police officer by a crime victim later unavailable for trial is obviously a significant circumstance potentially triggering a right of confrontation.and,as we have noted,interrogation must be construed in its colloquial sense crawford,supra,at,fn.in making this observation,the supreme court cited rhode island innis,d innis,a case in which interrogation,in another context,was construed broadly 
but we seriously doubt that the fact that the person to whom the statement was made was a peace officer is,of itself,sufficient to constitute a police interrogation.see people morgan,supra,th,d brief statement by caller who did not know he was speaking to police officer held not testimonial state parks,review granted,n ot every encounter will be an interrogation.statements made by witnesses to police so the police may secure their own or the witnesses safety,render emergency aid,or protect the security of a crime scene may not be testimonial.we can envision many instances in which statements to the police may be nontestimonial,such as those that are very preliminary in nature and in which the focus has nothing to do with building a criminal case.for example,a witness report of a suspicious noise that prompts a police investigation that ultimately results in the conclusion that a crime was committed would in all likelihood be nontestimonial.people newland,brief,informal remark to an officer conducting a field investigation by person who did not witness crime not testimonial.the same may be true where a witness provides more detail to a peace officer during a nascent investigation when law enforcement is still attempting to determine whether a crime has occurred and,if so,the identities of the perpetrator and any victims.hammon state,supra.
the level of detail given by the witness may suggest a purpose that might render the statement the product of police interrogation and thus testimonial.see crawford,supra,at,fn.involvement of government officers in the production of testimony with an eye toward trial presents unique potential for prosecutorial abuse.likewise,the status of the investigation and whether the witness statement was volunteered or solicited are relevant considerations in determining whether the resulting statement was the product of an interrogation.see,people west d,victim statement to police at hospital held testimonial,where the defendant already in custody,police already knew of his involvement in crime,and questioning conducted for the purpose of further investigating the defendant involvement and to gather evidence for use in a criminal prosecution.
here,when sergeant carr approached the witness,the following facts were already clear to the police a crime had occurred the crime involved a theft durward was the victim and the minor was the perpetrator indeed,two officers had arrested the minor by the time sergeant carr spoke with durward.and the information that sergeant carr elicited from durward was far more detailed than one would expect of a preliminary investigation durward gave sergeant carr information that was significantly detailed,including the specific nature of her injuries and how they were inflicted a detailed account of her encounter with the minor,what he and she said,and a account of how the robbery took place a description of what she did after the minor had successfully wrested her purse away from her an identification of the minor as the perpetrator and an estimate of the value of her purse and its contents.the status of the investigation at the time,the nature and extent of the inquiry,and the contents of the witness account all indicate that the statement here was the product of police interrogation 
factors militating against finding of interrogation 
we recognize that other factors might suggest,at first glance,a contrary conclusion,that durward statement was not the product of police interrogation and therefore nontestimonial.the statement was given informally in a public setting,rather than in a police station.it thus differed from sylvia crawford recorded statement,knowingly given in response to structured police questioning crawford,supra,at,fn.after she and her husband were placed in custody.and it was not tape recorded one might expect that a witness statement would be memorialized where the peace officer anticipated its possible use at trial some courts have emphasized the lack of formality of the witness statement in reaching the conclusion that it was nontestimonial under crawford.see people morgan,supra,th at,d informal statement made in an unstructured setting does not resemble the police interrogation of concern in crawford corella,supra,th at,d under crawford,police interrogation requires a relatively formal investigation where a trial is contemplated statements bore no indicia common to the official and formal quality of the various statements deemed testimonial by crawford.
we agree that the formality or informality of the statement,whether it was recorded,and the extent to which the statement was made in response to structured questioning,are relevant factors to consider in determining whether a statement is testimonial.to the extent,however,that corella or other authorities suggest that structured police questioning is the sine qua non of police interrogation under crawford,we disagree.crawford did not so hold.the court concluded that sylvia recorded statement,knowingly given in response to structured police questioning,qualifies under any conceivable definition of interrogation.crawford,supra,at,fn.it plainly did not make structured questioning or the recordation of the statement necessary elements to a finding that a witness statement was the product of interrogation.crawford,supra,at.holding that fact that witness statement to police officer is unsworn does not render it nontestimonial.
it would be neither consistent with crawford nor prudent to make formality or structured questioning prerequisites of interrogation.placing undue emphasis on either the formality under which the witness statement was taken or the structured nature of the questioning could cause anomalous and arbitrary results.the same statement at the same juncture of a police investigation might be treated in completely different fashions a statement taken informally or in an unstructured setting,in the field and unrecorded would be considered nontestimonial,while the same statement,if taken formally,recorded in a police station,would be regarded as testimonial.surely the right of confrontation is not based on such a tenuous footing.see holland,supra,brooklyn.at absence of terribly formal circumstances surrounding a statement should not become a superficial talisman for nontestimonial hearsay rulings.aside from a defendant constitutional rights being decided on the arbitrary bases of a statement formality or the extent to which questioning was structured,this would produce inconsistencies in determining whether a statement is testimonial under the confrontation clause similar to the ones decried in crawford,namely,the unpredictable and inconsistent application of roberts test of the reliability of hearsay statements.crawford,supra,at.see also friedman,confrontation the search for basic principles geo,broadening definition to include statements other than formal ones as testimonial is necessary to ensure that the adjudicative system does not effectively invite witnesses to testify in informal ways that avoid confrontation.
two other factors suggest the possibility that durward statement was nontestimonial.it was obtained moments after the crime and shortly after sergeant carr arrived at the scene.and,significantly,durward gave her statement while she was still very excited and upset as a result,the court found that the witness statement constituted a spontaneous statement,an exception to the hearsay rule under evidence code section the minor does not challenge this conclusion,and there was a substantial basis for the trial court finding that the victim statement was a spontaneous statement.see people brown cal th,d,statement of witness to shooting to witness held spontaneous despite passage of time of two and hours people farmer,supra,at,statements by wounded victim to police dispatcher and to police officer at scene held spontaneous despite fact that victim responded to questioning.
we do not doubt that there are many instances in which a witness spontaneous statement is nontestimonial.see,people rincon,supra,th,d spontaneous statement by codefendant to witness nontestimonial people butler th,d spontaneous statements by witness to crime made to coworkers nontestimonial.and,depending on the circumstances,a witness spontaneous statement made to governmental authorities,such as statements during a call,may be nontestimonial.see,corella,supra,th,d people coleman,anonymous caller statement was for the purpose of urgently seeking police intervention see also people mitchell,supra,th at,d general discussion concerning split of authority as to whether statements from calls are testimonial.but some courts have suggested that the fact that a statement is given spontaneously may,of itself,preclude a finding that it is testimonial.see people rincon,supra,th at,d corella,supra,th at,d it is difficult to identify any circumstances under which an,spontaneous statement would be testimonial.
crawford contained no such holding and,in fact,suggested a contrary view in a footnote.see crawford,supra,at,fn.we respectfully disagree with the suggestion in corella,supra,th at,d followed in people rincon,supra,th at,d,that a witness statement that constitutes a spontaneous statement under evidence code section can not be testimonial.indeed,an arbitrary rule declaring that a statement that is spontaneous is per se nontestimonial would,we believe,be antithetical to crawford underpinnings.roberts held an unavailable witness statement was admissible if it bore adequate indicia of reliability,either because it was founded on a firmly rooted hearsay exception or because it bore particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.roberts,supra,at.crawford rejected the roberts test insofar as it concerned testimonial statements,holding that admission of such statements was in derogation of a defendant right of confrontation.crawford,supra,at.a conclusion that a spontaneous statement is always nontestimonial would essentially carve out an exception to crawford holding that the fact that a statement satisfies a state hearsay exception does not permit its automatic admission without an analysis of whether it is a testimonial statement implicating a right of confrontation.
we conclude that the factors that superficially suggest that the durward statement was not the product of police interrogation and thus nontestimonial are insufficient when evaluated in light of the circumstances that point to the statement being the result of interrogation and therefore testimonial.implicit in this conclusion is that durward statement was both a spontaneous statement and one that was the product of police interrogation.
whether it would have been reasonable to anticipate that durward statement would be available for later use at trial 
as discussed see pt.i,sect.d,ante,the court in crawford identified three proposed formulations of statements that are testimonial.while the court did not specifically adopt any of these formulations,some courts have utilized the third crawford formulation statements made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial crawford,supra,at.as a test for determining whether a witness statement is testimonial.see,people rincon,supra,th at,d people cervantes,supra,th at,d cromer,supra,at saget cir.we therefore use this as a definition of a class of statements that are as guidance for our analysis.
here,the police had already determined that a crime had been committed by the minor,knew that durward was the victim,and had already arrested the minor.sergeant carr approached durward,and she described in significant detail how the crime had occurred,the manner in which she had sustained injuries,and the value of the property stolen.given these circumstances,we readily conclude that durward statement was made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.crawford,supra,at.
conclusion 
the determination of whether a statement is the product of police interrogation and thus testimonial,in our view,does not rest upon one feature,such as whether the statement occurred in a formal setting,was the product of structured questioning,or constituted a spontaneous statement.instead,the resolution of whether a statement was the product of police interrogation requires a inquiry into a variety of circumstances.see state wright,state parks,supra,at.these factors include the time at which the statement was given in relationship to the crime the status of the police investigation at the time the statement was given,including the extent of police knowledge concerning the occurrence of a crime,potential suspects,and potential victims whether the crime scene has been secured the identity of the person hearing the statement,whether that person was a governmental authority whether the declarant volunteered the statement or whether the person hearing the statement solicited it the declarant purpose for speaking and his or her mental state at the time the location where the statement was given whether the statement was recorded,and if so,by what means the level of detail provided by the declarant and whether all or part of the statement was in response to questioning.
based upon a consideration of all of the circumstances presented here,we conclude that durward statement was the product of police interrogation and therefore testimonial.this result is consistent with crawford teachings that a determination of whether a statement is testimonial or whether a police interview of a witness is an interrogation can not be made by arbitrary or narrow applications of those terms.rather,all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the witness statement must be considered.
durward was apparently unavailable to testify at trial and it is undisputed that the minor had no opportunity to her.therefore,it necessarily follows under crawford that the introduction of durward statement deprived the minor of his constitutional right to confrontation 
whether crawford error was prejudicial 
having determined that the admission of durward statement violated the minor confrontation rights,we must still decide whether this error requires reversal.our supreme court has held that error under crawford is evaluated under the chapman standard chapman california,d,namely,admission of the statements would require reversal unless we found beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury verdict would have been the same absent any error.citations.people harrison cal th,d,see also people song th,d.under the chapman standard,an error is harmless only when,beyond a reasonable doubt,it did not contribute to the verdict.people williams cal th,d.
the matters in durward statement as we was little or no evidence supporting the elements of robbery under penal code section there was no direct testimony that the minor took the purse when it was in the possession of durward from her person or immediate presence.see also people torres th,d.similarly,there was no direct evidence that the property was taken by the minor against durward will,accomplished by means of force or fear,see also people wright th,d.
there was,however,some evidence that circumstantially supported a finding that the minor took the purse from durward possession.dallmann and martinez both testified that they saw the minor holding a purse and that he was being chased by a woman who was screaming.and martinez testified that the woman chasing the minor was screaming for help,trying to get her purse back.but this same gave some circumstantial support for the conclusion that the minor took the purse from durward not support the by means of force or fear element of robbery.the eyewitness testimony provided circumstantial evidence of a theft it did not establish that the minor took the purse by means of force or fear required under penal code section.
after conducting the requisite thorough review of the record people bolden cal th,d,we can not conclude that the error in admitting durward statement was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.given the limited evidence supporting the robbery element that the purse was in fact taken from durward person or immediate presence,and given the absence of evidence that the taking was accomplished by means of force or fear,it can not be said that the erroneous admission of durward statement did not contribute to the jurisdictional finding.accordingly,since the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt,we will reverse the judgment.
ii.claimed sentencing error 
the minor contends that the trial court abused its discretion in sentencing the minor,based upon the court allegedly erroneous understanding of the law.he argues that the court failed to exercise any discretion under welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b in determining whether to set the maximum confinement time or some lesser term of confinement.
because we have concluded that the judgment must be reversed,we do not address the merits of this claimed sentencing error.see hiser bell helicopter textron th,d appellate courts generally decline to decide questions not necessary to the decision.
disposition 
the judgment is reversed.
all further date references are to the year unless otherwise specified.
the prosecution called only three witnesses the minor called none.as we discuss,post,the impact upon the outcome of the jurisdictional hearing of the victim statement that was improperly introduced is critical to our determination of whether the error was pre
