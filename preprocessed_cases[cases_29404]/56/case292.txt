appellant juan,father the father of minor jonathan,appeals from an order of the juvenile dependency court denying father welfare and institutions code section petition seeking custody of jonathan,or in the alternative,family reunification services.before this court,father argues that the court erred in failing to assess his request for custody pursuant to section.father claims that although he was not present at the disposition hearing,he is a,noncustodial parent and thus he was entitled to have the minor placed with him unless the department of children and family services the department proved that placement with father would be detrimental to jonathan father complains that rather than applying the detriment standard under section,the court erroneously applied the section best interest standard to his request.in any event,father asserts that he was entitled to reunification services.as we shall explain,any harm resulting from the failure to apply section to father request for custody did not result in prejudice.at the time the court considered father custody request,jonathan had left his placement and his whereabouts was unknown.as a result,the court could not make any accurate determination of detriment because jonathan condition was not known.this notwithstanding,we conclude that the court erred in denying father reunification services.the whereabouts of the jonathan did not determine father legal entitlement to reunification services.the court should have required to department to evaluate whether there were any available services that could be provided to father notwithstanding jonathan absence from the proceedings.the court failure to require that assessment requires reversal of the court order denying the section petition.accordingly,this matter is remanded for further proceedings.
factual and procedural background 
jonathan became the subject of dependency proceedings in,when it was reported that jonathan mother,maria mother and her companion,victor had engaged in acts of domestic violence in front of jonathan and his toddler destiny the department filed a petition pursuant to section,subdivisions a and b with respect to jonathan,then years old,and destiny the petition alleged that victor repeatedly struck the mother face with his fists on february,causing her to be injured,and resulting in his arrest.it was further alleged that mother had engaged in a violent altercation and slapped another male companion,and the children were at risk of physical harm and danger as a result of the domestic violence between mother and her male companions 
none of the children parents were present at the detention hearing on august.the whereabouts of the children and mother were unknown at that time.the detention report indicated that father had been deported to mexico in and that his whereabouts was unknown.the court issued protective custody warrants for the children,along with an arrest warrant for mother.the court entered detention orders for jonathan with respect to both mother and father.
on september,a resolution conference was conducted.by september,mother and the children had been located,and jonathan was present during the proceedings jonathan counsel requested a continuance to investigate the case,and he reported a maternal grandmother might be available to care for the children.the court continued the matter for a contested adjudication,recalled the outstanding warrants for mother and the children,and ordered a supplemental report from the department about potential relative placement.father whereabouts remained unknown the court found notice to father was proper based on a due diligence search.
mother informed the department that from the mid until,jonathan had been residing with father under the terms of a family law custody order.the order provided joint legal custody to mother and father parents,with primary physical custody to father.under the terms of the custody agreement,mother was entitled to have custody of jonathan from monday through friday during jonathan summer vacation.in,father sent jonathan to visit mother during his summer break.during jonathan visit with mother,father was deported and that as a result jonathan had remained in mother care.
according to the report,the department had been unable to locate father.the department due diligence report reflected the social worker had discovered approximately possible addresses for father,and letters had been sent to all of them on september,the same day the due diligence report was signed.the department recommended family reunification services for mother and victor,but none for father.
the court conducted the adjudication and disposition hearing on october.none of the parents appeared at the hearing,and father whereabouts remained unknown.the court found the children to be described by section,subdivisions a and b.the court declared the children dependents of the juvenile court and removed them from the custody of mother and victor for suitable placement.family reunification services and visitation were ordered only for mother and victor no reunification services were ordered for father because his whereabouts was unknown at the time.jonathan could not be placed with maternal grandmother because her home had not been approved for his placement.therefore,the court ordered the department to continue to use its best efforts to place the children with any appropriate relative.the court scheduled a review hearing for april.
the department status review report revealed that jonathan had been in several placements since the inception of the dependency case,and had experienced problems following rules in his foster homes.in early february,jonathan foster parents gave the department a notice to have him moved.in response,on february,the social worker conducted a team decision meeting tdm.during the meeting,the social worker asked jonathan to provide relative information for his paternal relatives,including father contact information.jonathan reported father was then living in chicago,and had previously been deported,but had returned illegally to the united states.jonathan provided father telephone number.a safety plan was developed for jonathan the social worker agreed to contact father,but did not immediately do so.
the review report also indicated that jonathan had left school and had been absent from his foster home for hours without permission.jonathan was removed from his foster care placement and jonathan was placed into a group home on march.
thereafter,on march,jonathan group home case manager notified the social worker that jonathan had taken all of his belongings and left the group home with two male companions.jonathan was subsequently involved in a car accident with five other minors.he was admitted to the hospital for treatment.his injuries required surgery on his pelvis.on march,jonathan left the hospital on crutches while he was waiting to be discharged 
on march,the social worker contacted father for the first time.father reported that on march,jonathan had called father from the hospital using a friend cell phone.jonathan told father that he was doing well and his friends were visiting him at the hospital.jonathan apparently told father he was planning to leave the hospital because he did not want to return to the group home.father told the social worker that he tried to dissuade jonathan from leaving the hospital.father said that he had not heard from jonathan since then and told the social worker he would try to call the cell phone number of jonathan friend.
father also provided the social worker with his background and history.he reported that he had been deported to mexico over a year earlier,but returned to the illegally about three months later,and was residing in chicago with his partner and their two young children.father had kept in contact with mother by telephone after his deportation.mother told father jonathan was well.during this time,jonathan also reported to father he was doing well,and father had no idea about what was transpiring in mother home or that mother was involved in dependency proceedings with the children.father told the social worker he was willing to return to california to care for jonathan and he was concerned about his.although father was concerned about traveling to california in light of his immigration status and work obligations,he told the social worker he would attend the hearing scheduled for a review hearing on april.
in the report,the department recommended that the court terminate family reunification services for mother.no recommendation was made with respect to father and jonathan,and no proposed case plan was provided.
on march,the department notified the dependency court that jonathan whereabouts was unknown and he had left his placement.the court issued a protective custody warrant,and ordered the department to provide a full report about jonathan whereabouts during his awol period,once he was located.
six month review proceedings 
on april,the court conducted the review hearing.father appeared at the hearing.the court appointed father legal counsel.father filed a statement regarding parentage,reflecting he was married to mother in he signed a voluntary declaration of paternity when jonathan was born and a court judgment of parentage had been entered in orange county superior court case.the dependency court declared father the presumed father of jonathan.father orally requested that jonathan be placed with him based on the prior custody arrangement.
the court initially indicated its intent to order reunification services for father since it was previously no services because of whereabouts unknown,and we know where he is now,i do see grounds for not giving him services for reunification with jonathan.the department lawyer responded that providing services to father was only required if he,basically,shows up or is found within those six months.in department counsel opinion,the time period had passed and therefore,father would be required to file a section petition to obtain services.the court instructed father attorney to file a section petition.the court also told father,i ca give jonathan back to you.he is not in our care anymore.he was in the hospital for an operation,and he left without anybody permission.so if you do know where he is,we do know where he is.we are trying to find him.mother requested that the proceedings be set for a contested hearing the court scheduled a hearing on the matter for may.
section proceedings.
on april,father filed a section petition,requesting a change in the court prior order of october,that he receive no reunification services.the petition further stated the father only recently received notice of the juvenile dependency case concerning his child and he had previously been given primary physical custody of jonathan by the orange county superior court.father petition requested care and custody of his child upon the child being located as he is currently awol from placement with family maintenance services and other appropriate services.alternatively,family reunification services.father alleged he and jonathan had maintained telephone contact and had a strong bond therefore,granting the request would be in jonathan best interests and ensure he was placed with a stable parent in a safe and nurturing home.
the department prepared a report on father section petition.the report indicated that jonathan whereabouts remained unknown.father met with the social worker after the hearing on april and reported he did not know where jonathan was located,but jonathan called him periodically from private numbers.father requested custody of jonathan when he was located.father stated he could care for jonathan since he had never had a problem in the past with jonathan listening to him.the report stated that mother had informed the social worker she had no objection to jonathan residing with father.
on may,father spoke again to the social worker.he again requested custody.father reported he had sent jonathan to visit mother in the summer of,and was deported shortly thereafter.father denied being deported as a result of any criminal activity and reported he had never done anything bad in his life.his only failure was that he was undocumented,but he had a home in chicago and wanted to care for jonathan.
the report included further information about father contact with jonathan on march,when jonathan was in the hospital.jonathan was upset and told the social worker that he did not want to return to foster care.the social worker told him she would look into the possibility of returning him to father.jonathan reported he would like to return to father care,but he did not want to move to chicago,and would rather stay in california.the social worker allowed jonathan to use her cell phone to call father.father was appropriate during the call.the report also clarified that father requested custody of jonathan when the social worker called him again on march,the social worker confirmed jonathan had provided father phone number in,but no contact with father occurred before,at which time father express his desire to have jonathan placed in his care.
the social worker noted it is unclear why neither mother nor child informed the father of child detention from mother in august or why mother and child kept father information from dcfs until mid february.it is clear,however,that upon father learning of his son situation father immediately requested the child be released to his care.father has demonstrated his commitment and desire to provide jonathan with a stable home environment by maintaining contact with dcfs and attending the last court hearing on even though it was a hardship for him to travel from chicago to california.
the department indicated that it had been unable to live scan father in order to verify he had no criminal record,and the department was unable to verify he had a safe and stable home.attachments to the report,however,reflect the social worker performed a criminal records search on father based on his name through the division of criminal justice information service in sacramento,and the results reflected father had no criminal record.the department recommended that the court deny father section petition but order an evaluation under the interstate compact on the placement of children icpc to assess his home so when jonathan was found,a recommendation could be made to release him to father.
on may,the court conducted the hearing on father section petition,along with mother contested review hearing,were conducted father remained in chicago he was represented by his appointed counsel.the court advised father counsel it was inclined to go along with the recommendation to deny the and do the requested evaluation under the icpc on father home in chicago.the court stated,i do have jonathan.i not in a position to hand jonathan over to a father.and i ca make a best interest finding if i do have him in custody so i can find best interest.father counsel argued the court could make an order that as soon as jonathan was located he could be placed with father because father was,presumed,father and previously had custody of jonathan under the terms of a family law order.the court stated it could either deny the petition without prejudice and let father refile it when jonathan was located,or just trail it until we find jonathan.father counsel responded,we could do that.
the department counsel argued that neither prong of the section test had been met because in his view,father was a federal fugitive who had entered the country illegally,and that was the only change in his circumstances.the department counsel further argued that no icpc could be conducted,since that would basically,be having the court perpetuate father violation of federal law being in this country by helping somebody who is currently in this country illegally with this he urged the court to flat out deny this as neither prong is met.
jonathan attorney requested that the court at least grant this father family reunification services,stating,i do think the court has power not to offer father fr at this point.he a presumed father.he.and he showed up within the initial period.the reason he was denied family reunification services to begin with was because he was whereabouts unknown.so i think the court must offer him fr.i think he is entitled under the law to fr,because he did show up during the six months,first initial review period between the disposition and the e.
department counsel again objected on the basis that father was in the country illegally and also claimed that father did not show up within six months from the date of detention,which would have been february.jonathan lawyer responded that father immigration status was irrelevant to the question of father entitlement to reunification services.he further argued that he was legally entitled to services irrespective of whether it is in the best interest of jonathan 
the court concluded,i do see that there grounds for offering fr to a father who is.i do see that there grounds for trying to reunify somebody with a child that i have no custody over.the april of father is denied without prejudice.when we find jonathan,we talk about reunifying with father if that appropriate.i not going to order an on father at this time.
the court then addressed the review hearing under section,subdivision e for jonathan and destiny with respect to mother,and continued family reunification services for her,based on the department revised recommendation.
father filed a timely notice of appeal 
discussion 
before this court father argues that the dependency court committed a number of errors in denying his request for custody of jonathan and his alternative request for reunification services.we address these matters in turn.
father custody request 
father asserts that the court erred in failing to review his custody request under section,rather than section.father complains that when he appeared for the first time at the review hearing and requested custody of jonathan,the court should have considered that request under section custody request by noncustodial parent,and immediately placed jonathan in his custody unless the department proved by clear and convincing evidence that placement with father would be detrimental to the safety,protection or physical or emotional of jonathan 
father claims that rather than apply section,the court erroneously required father to file his request for custody pursuant to section.in addition,father complains that in considering his subsequently filed petition,the court erred in focusing solely on the best interest standard under section.father contends that his use of a section petition did not excuse the court from evaluating father custody request under the section.legal standard.he points out that no detriment finding has ever been made against him in this case to justify depriving him a,presumed father of custody of his child.
preliminarily,the department argues that father forfeited his complaint that the court erred in failing to apply section to his custody request.the department highlights the fact that at the section hearing,when the court suggested that it could deny the section petition without prejudice and father could it when jonathan was located or it could trail the matter until jonathan was found,father counsel responded we could do that.thus,the department argues that father counsel response to the court warrants the application of the forfeiture rule.
we do not agree.father argument on appeal is that section applied to his request for custody as a matter of law.thus,the issue of whether section applies when a,parent requests custody of a minor is,on this record,a legal question,which we exercise our discretion to address.see in re abram th,finding father did not forfeit appellate review of whether the juvenile court failed to apply or comply with section because the arguments raised by father were primarily issues of law.
in addition,it appears that father filed the section petition because,following the department counsel suggestion,that was the only means through which the court indicated that it would consider the request for custody father did not file the petition based on any acknowledgement that section actually governed the request for custody.finally,the comments of father counsel reflect that he was acquiescing to the court suggestion as two different ways the court could resolve the section petition in light of jonathan absence from the proceedings.his comments do not reflect an agreement that section was inapplicable to his request.in fact,no one not the parties nor the court addressed the possible application of section at any of the hearings.in our view,father vague response can not be fairly interpreted as forfeiting any error with respect to the court failure to apply section.we,thus,turn our attention to the application of section.
section establishes the procedures a court must follow for placing a dependent child following removal from the custodial parent pursuant to section.in re th,in re marquis th.when a juvenile dependency court orders removal of a minor under section,the court first must determine whether there is a parent who wants to assume custody who was not residing with the minor at the time the events that brought the minor within the provisions of section occurred,subd.a.if that parent requests custody,the court shall place the child with the parent unless it finds that placement with that parent would be detrimental to the safety,protection,or physical or emotional of the child,subd.a.the juvenile court must make the detriment finding by clear and convincing evidence.in re isayah th.subdivision c of section requires the juvenile court to make a finding either in writing or on the record of the basis for its determination,subd.c.
this appeal presents the question of whether section applies to a request for custody by a,parent made after the dispositional phase of the dependency proceedings.more specifically we are asked to decide whether the department has the burden under section to prove that it would be detrimental to place the child with the parent who appears for the first time within six months after the disposition hearing and requests custody of the minor.
on its face,the language of section,subdivision a implies that the finding of detriment standard and the department attendant burden to prove detriment only apply when the court initially orders removal from the custodial parent at the disposition hearing when a court orders removal of a child pursuant to section,the court shall first determine whether there is a parent of the child,with whom the child was not residing at the time that the events or conditions arose that brought the child within the provisions of section,who desires to assume custody of the child,subd.a.in in re zacharia cal th,the supreme court examined the language of section,subdivision a,and concluded nothing in this statute suggests that custody must be immediately awarded to a noncustodial parent regardless of when in the dependency process the parent comes forward.rather,its language suggests that the statute is applicable only at the time the child is first removed from the custodial parent or guardian home.our interpretation is reinforced by the absence of a similar provision requiring return of the child to a noncustodial parent in the statutes governing the,and month review hearings.see also in re th,section is designed to apply at the disposition phase of the dependency proceeding,when the court first elects to remove the child from the custody of the custodial parent.
this notwithstanding,a few courts have applied the detriment standard in section to requests for custody made by a parent after the disposition phase of the dependency proceedings.for example,division three of this court,in in re suhey th,acknowledged in re zacharia as articulating the general rule,but nonetheless concluded that at the review hearing when the father first appeared in the proceedings the dcfs had the burden under section to prove that placing the child in the custody of her father would be detrimental.the appellate court grounded its decision on the dcfs admission that it had failed to give adequate notice of the proceedings to the child father.id.at.likewise in in re janee th,our colleagues in division eight of this district concluded that e ven though section,by its terms,applies when the court first takes jurisdiction of a child,its procedures can be invoked at the and month review hearings as occurred here.cal.rules of court,rule c h.finally,in in re,the court also recognized that section would not in the course of an ordinary dependency proceeding apply at a section hearing,but concluded that the dependency court could not terminate the rights of a parent without making a finding of detriment that placing the child in the mother custody would be detrimental to the child.in re,supra,th at.
father case is distinct from the decisions in suhey,janee and unlike in suhey,the department did not concede that it failed to provide notice to father of the dependency proceedings.also,unlike the decision,the dependency court here did not terminate his parental rights to jonathan finally,we note that in janee,the legal issue was distinct from the matter before this court.in janee the court was asked to decide the application of the procedures in section,subdivision b to a review hearing,not,as here,whether the detriment standard in section,subdivision a applied at a review hearing.thus,father case is not factually similar to those published cases that represent exceptions to the general rule articulated in zacharia,that section,subdivision a applies only when the child is first removed from the custodial parent home.
this notwithstanding,this matter is also distinguishable from zacharia unlike the father in zacharia,here,father established his parentage during the family law case that preceded the dependency proceedings,had primary physical custody of jonathan and resided with jonathan for a number of years prior to the filing of the dependency petition.in addition,father had contact with the department and requested custody of jonathan when he first learned of the proceedings within six months after the disposition hearing.thereafter,father appeared at the review hearing and sought custody and requested services.
we acknowledge that section,subdivision a appears to have limited application beyond the disposition phase of the proceedings.yet it is of great concern that a parent who has cooperated with the court and the department throughout the proceedings,who immediately and repeatedly requested custody,who appeared in the proceedings as soon as he learned of them,and has been deprived of custody without any court ever finding that placement with him would be detrimental to the minor.here,father only failing was that he did not appear apparently through no fault of his own earlier in the proceedings.indeed,we are concerned about the adequacy of the department efforts to find father and provide him with notice of the proceedings earlier in the case.the department due diligence declaration for the disposition proceedings,signed september,indicated that father was mailed notice of the proceedings at a number addresses on september,and concluded that no response had been received by september.furthermore,although jonathan provided the social worker with contact information for father on february,the department did not make any effort to contact father until after jonathan had left his placement.the possibility that the department unsatisfactory efforts to locate father and apprise him of the dependency case earlier in the proceedings resulted in father delayed appearance in the matter can not be ignored.
equally troubling is the department trial counsel repeated references to father immigration status during the proceedings in the dependency court.it is not clear on this record the degree to which the juvenile court was influenced by department counsel argument on this issue,or whether father legal status played any role in the court process.the law is clear,however,that father citizenship status is not a legally relevant consideration in these matters.see,subd.e providing that the parent immigration status is not considered in determination of whether to place a child with a parent under section,subdivision a.it is also clear that the department counsel improper comments infected the proceedings,distracting the court and parties from the relevant matters at hand,namely,father request for custody reunification services.
if father had attended the disposition hearing and had father requested custody at that time,he would have been entitled to it absent a showing by the department of detriment to jonathan p.a nonoffending parent has a constitutionally protected interest in assuming physical custody,as well as a statutory right to do so,in the absence of clear and convincing evidence that the parent choices will be detrimental to the safety,protection,or physical or emotional of the child.in re isayah,supra,th at.here,however,father was required to demonstrate that placing jonathan with him served jonathan best interest.the detriment standard and the best interest standard are not legal equivalents.in general,under the detriment standard,it is not the parent burden to show that she is capable of caring for her child.instead,the party who is opposing placement has the burden to show by clear and convincing evidence that the child will be harmed if the parent is given custody.in contrast,under the section best interest standard,the parent seeking to modify the placement order shoulders the burden to prove both a change in circumstances and that the modification would be in the best interest of the minor.
in view of the totality circumstances of this case,in our view the dependency court should not have required father to prove his entitlement to custody pursuant to section.instead,the court should have analyzed the request under section,subdivision a.
in any event,although the dependency court in this case applied the wrong legal standard,we also conclude the error was harmless.jonathan was absent from his placement in april and may and his whereabouts was unknown at the time.his condition and his could not be fully and properly assessed in his absence.in our view,neither an assessment of best interest or detriment can be made based solely on father circumstances.it was not possible to conduct an evaluation of whether it would be detrimental to jonathan to place him with father without jonathan participation in the process.thus,even had the court applied section,the court could not have resolved the issue of detriment and could not have placed jonathan with father at that time.
in view of the foregoing,the juvenile dependency court did not commit prejudicial error in denying father request for custody 
father request for reunification services 
on appeal father also argues that the dependency court erred in denying his alternative request for reunification services.he claims that he had a right to such services pursuant to statute.father is correct.
section and its various subdivisions govern the provision of reunification services.as a general rule,the juvenile court must provide reunification services when it removes a child from parental custody,subd.a.however,there are exceptions namely,the circumstances described in section,subdivisions b through.in this case,the juvenile court denied father reunification services under subdivision b which provides that reunification services need not be provided to a parent when the court finds,by clear and convincing evidence t hat the whereabouts of the parent is unknown.
if the juvenile court denies a parent reunification services under section,subdivisions b through,the juvenile court is authorized under section,subdivision f to set a section hearing,subd.f.however,if the sole basis of denial of services is the unknown whereabouts of the parent under section,subdivision b,the juvenile court must set a review hearing.cal.rules of court,rule h.the underlying intent is to provide a parent whose whereabouts are initially unknown but who desires reunification an opportunity to reunify if the parent whereabouts become known within a reasonable period.this intent is made apparent in section,subdivision d which provides if reunification services are not ordered pursuant to paragraph of subdivision b and the whereabouts of a parent become known within six months of the placement o
