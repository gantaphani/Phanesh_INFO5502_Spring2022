background 
alex,who is now years old,has been a ward of the juvenile court since march.his wardship was initially based on his admissions that,at the age of,he committed second degree burglary,first degree burglary,lewd conduct with a minor,subd.a and oral copulation with a minor,subd.b.he also admitted giving away dexedrine health,subd.a.in,he was committed to the james boys ranch,but he escaped from the ranch and later refused to return to the ranch.alex had performed poorly at the ranch.alex admitted escape allegations and was then placed in a private institution.he performed poorly at this institution too.in february,alex absconded from the private institution.
while he was on the lam,alex committed misdemeanor petty theft,two misdemeanor batteries,subd.a and first degree burglary.he was arrested in april,and he admitted the theft and battery allegations in may.alex contested the burglary allegation.at the contested jurisdictional hearing,the juvenile court found the burglary allegation true.alex performed poorly in juvenile hall while the contested jurisdictional and dispositional hearings were pending.in october,alex was committed to the cya.
alex performed poorly at the cya.his efforts were marginal in the cya programs to which he was assigned.he had difficulty interacting with both peers and staff.alex was the subject of numerous level behavior reports and level behavior reports with the last level report occurring on december.he also received two level behavior reports,with the last one occurring on october,and these level reports resulted in three months of time being added to his parole consideration date.alex was on a waiting list for a sex offender counseling program.
in august,this court reversed the juvenile court order and remanded the matter for reconsideration of the jurisdictional finding on the burglary allegation.on remand,the juvenile court again found the burglary allegation true.it scheduled a contested dispositional hearing.alex was returned to juvenile hall from the cya in january,and he behaved well in juvenile hall between then and the may conclusion of the dispositional hearing.he received no negative behavior reports during that period.alex was referred to all available cya alternative placements,and they all rejected him due to his prior sex offenses and escapes.the juvenile court was unwilling to consider a general placement given alex history.
alex trial counsel conceded that a cya commitment was appropriate.however,he asked the court to either dismiss the sex offense counts that alex had admitted in or to make the cya commitment solely on the burglary count in order to avoid alex being required to register as a sex offender.
the court made it clear that it would be committing alex to the cya.the court acknowledged that it had the authority to dismiss the sex offense counts under either or under,but it declined to do so because i do think it appropriate and the interest of justice would not be best served by doing so.i think it inappropriate to dismiss something of a serious nature that occurred,that was admitted.
although the court wanted to find a way to avoid alex having to register as a sex offender,the court stated i do think that i have that jurisdiction or authority.i think that under the totality of the circumstances of this particular case,given the age of the,the,of the ward at the time of the sex offense and given the fact that there has been no subsequent sexual misconduct,i think to require him to register as a result of something that happened when he was thirteen,for the rest of his life,is cruel and unusual punishment.i almost sure if i make an order the youth authority may not require him to register,that going to be null and void.
alex trial counsel asked the court officer what he believes the max time to be in this case.the court officer replied thirteen years,ten months.alex trial counsel asserted that this figure was incorrect because it included the time for the sex offenses,and the prosecutor had asserted that alex was only being committed for the current theft,battery and burglary counts.the court replied that under there agg reg ation.it went on to say i without jurisdiction or authority to do as you request.if i had that discretion i might engage both counsel in additional discussions and i might have exercised that discretion.i believe i do not have discretion.the court officer,not the court,thereafter stated that alex maximum period of confinement was years and months.alex filed a timely notice of appeal.
ii.discussion 
aggregation and sex offender registration 
alex asserts that the juvenile court failed to exercise its discretion to commit him to the cya solely on the current allegations rather than aggregating all of the previously sustained petitions.he argues that a cya commitment solely on offenses would not have resulted in his being required to register as a sex offender under penal code section.
any person who,on or after january,is discharged or paroled from the department of the youth authority to the custody of which he or she was committed after having been adjudicated a ward of the juvenile court pursuant to section of the welfare and institutions code because of the commission or attempted commission of any offense described in paragraph which includes penal code section offenses and penal code section,subdivision b offenses shall be subject to registration under the procedures of this section,subd.d,emphasis added.
the attorney general focuses on the word after in subdivision d and posits that a person who is committed to the cya for an offense other than a sex offense is nevertheless required to register as a sex offender so long as the cya commitment occurred after a previous sex offense adjudication.while this is not an implausible interpretation of the isolated language of this subdivision,we are convinced that it is not the appropriate reading of this language.
as in any case involving statutory interpretation,our fundamental task here is to determine the legislature intent so as to effectuate the law purpose.we begin by examining the statute words,giving them a plain and commonsense meaning.we do not,however,consider the statutory language in isolation.rather,we look to the entire substance of the statute in order to determine the scope and purpose of the provision that is,we construe the words in question in context,keeping in mind the nature and obvious purpose of the statute we must harmonize the various parts of a statutory enactment by considering the particular clause or section in the context of the statutory framework as a whole.people murphy cal th,d,internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
when we examine penal code section as a whole and harmonize its various provisions,it is clear that subdivision d was intended to apply only to persons who were committed to the cya because of a sex offense.penal code section,subdivision a provides the main listing of those who are subject to lifelong sex offender registration.subdivision a b requires registration by any person released,discharged,or paroled from a penal institution where he or she was confined because of the commission or attempted commission of a specified sex offense.subdivision d,which is the companion to subdivision d,provides any person who is discharged or paroled from a facility in another state that is equivalent to the department of the youth authority,to the custody of which he or she was committed because of a specified sex offense shall be subject to registration under the procedures of this section,subd.d,emphasis added.
