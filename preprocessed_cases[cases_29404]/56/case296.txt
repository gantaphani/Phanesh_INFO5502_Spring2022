appellants contend,and respondent el dorado county department of human services department agrees,that the juvenile court findings are not supported by substantial evidence and that the juvenile court abused its discretion in ordering a permanent plan of foster care for the minors.on review,it appears the court relied on facts and circumstances that were not relevant to the issues before it.this resulted in findings and orders not supported by relevant evidence and an abuse of discretion in ordering foster care.accordingly,we shall reverse and,based on the statutory limitations and the relevant evidence in the record,direct the juvenile court to terminate parental rights.the previously granted stay is vacated.
factual and procedural background 
in september,the department filed petitions on and month old.the petitions alleged the parents failed to participate in voluntary family maintenance offered in february.both parents suffered from serious mental health issues but neither was in treatment and both were periodically unable to care for the minors.further,father had a history of substance abuse and mother medical and physical issues limited her ability to care for the minors.the department recommended family maintenance services.the family also included a half sibling who is a special needs child with cognitive delays.in october,the court sustained the petitions and adopted the department recommended disposition of family maintenance.
six months later,in april,the department filed section petitions to remove and from parental custody.the parents had left one or both of the minors in the bathtub unsupervised several times,and in one instance,the older half sibling had tried to drown by this time,the parents had been offered services for more than one year but showed no change in parenting behavior and blamed the half sibling for the emergency removal because he had disclosed the lack of parental supervision that led to the bathtub incident and other dangerous situations.the court ordered the minors detained.
the combined report stated that was moved from the foster placement she shared with due to her aggressive behavior toward him.the social worker identified the parents ongoing problems of untreated mental health issues and their limited parenting skills when dealing with toddlers despite the voluntary and services.the report recommended further reunification services.an addendum report indicated the parents were beginning to make progress since the minors removal and recommended extended visits to transition the minors home after an assessment of parental compliance with services.the court adopted this recommended disposition in may.
the parents failed to reunify and,in december,the court terminated services and set a section hearing.the court ordered supervised visitation to occur two times a month for a total of two hours per month for mother and a minimum of once a month for two hours and a maximum of two times a month for four hours for father.the social worker was given discretion to increase mother visitation.
the april report for the section hearing stated the minors were healthy and developmentally on target.the parents had maintained regular contact until the beginning of february when mother could not travel due to her pregnancy.thereafter,the parents had a single visit in march.the minors had been placed in the same home since november and enjoyed a close relationship with each other and the foster parents.the department recommended termination of parental rights with adoption as the permanent plan because the minors needed permanence and stability.
the new baby was born in april and was placed in the same foster home as and.the parents visits with the baby were separate from visits with the two older minors.
mother and father each filed a section petition for modification in april seeking to reinstate services.mother alleged circumstances were changed because she had continued in therapy,was making progress and the home was appropriate.father alleged circumstances were changed because they were receiving services for the new baby and continued services for the half sibling,he was making progress in counseling,visits were going well,he was testing clean and was active in couples counseling.a therapist letter attached to mother petition indicated the parents had improved their ability to interact and accept accountability for their emotions and behaviors.father cited testimony from the new infant detention hearing to support the claims of substantial progress and change of attitude.
the department filed an informational report in response to parents petitions for modification.the report stated the social worker attempted to observe the parents visit with the infant minor but the apartment was dark and no one was present.father insisted they had been home and had not violated visit rules.on april,the social worker received a drug test for the father that was positive for morphine on a sample taken april.father said it was impossible that he had a positive test result but explained it might be due to eating five poppy seed bagels on april.when confronted with the date the sample was taken,father said he ate the poppy seeds on the date of the test.the toxicologist confirmed that a morphine test could be affected by eating five poppy seed muffins.the social worker commented that the parents were poor historians and it was hard to assess their progress.
an addendum report in september stated both minors adored their baby sister.was excited to tell the adoptions worker she had a new baby sister.played with the baby and sometimes kissed her.the report said the parents had two visits a month for two hours each.the foster agency records showed no visits at the agency in january because the parents did not call to schedule any.visits at the agency were to begin in february but did not occur due to mother pregnancy.there was a visit at court in may the parents did not request a visit in june.the parents arranged a visit for july,but had transportation problems and cancelled the visit.the parents visited at the foster agency office on july.there was one visit in but,while the minors were transported for a second visit in late august,the parents failed to attend.the visit supervisor reported that the minors appeared happy to see the parents although had some issues in visits.overall,the visits were appropriate and transitions were unremarkable unless mother was emotional.the foster mother described the minors behavior after visits as like any other day.the department concluded the minors were highly adoptable and recommended termination of parental rights and a permanent plan of adoption to provide the stability and security they needed.
the combined sections and hearing commenced in october.mother testified the older half sibling was placed in a foster home and was unlikely to return home.mother also testified about her continued progress in services provided to her for reunification with the baby who was born in april.mother said the minors were happy to see her and father at visits.she described a typical visit which included watching movies,cuddling,eating snacks,playing and roughhousing.she believed the minors were bonded to the parents based on their behavior in visits.mother testified the minors talked about the baby at visits and played with a doll as if it were the baby.mother believed the minors share a sibling relationship with the baby.mother provided confused and somewhat inconsistent testimony about the frequency of the parents visits after termination of services.she stated there was one visit in december but in they had no visits in january,february,march or april,one near the end of may,two in june,july,august and september and one in october.mother acknowledged she missed one visit in september.she also recalled that the minors may have been brought to their home in december and january but did not see them from the march visit until may.
the environmental alternatives foster agency ea social worker testified the parents were entitled to two visits a month.ea records showed the parents attended one visit from january to march,none in april,one of two in may,none in june,one of two in july,none in august,two in september and one in october.the records also showed three visits between march and august when the minors were transported for a visit but the parents did not come.on,the ea social worker agreed it was possible there was one visit in march.pictures on the mother phone showed a visit at their home that month so ea would not have a record of it.the ea social worker had supervised more than five visits after services were terminated.when supervising at the agency office,the ea social worker would sit outside the visit room where she could hear what was going on and periodically visually check the visit.she never heard either minor talk about the baby or ask why the baby was not included in visits.she testified that,if the family is not eating or watching a movie,visits became somewhat chaotic with little or no attempt at redirection by the parents.the ea social worker stated that the parents themselves would engage in the boisterous behavior and support it.she said that previous visits in the parents home were marked by the minors tantrums and parents difficulties in getting them to engage in any activity.there was some improvement once all visits were at the ea office but the parents still were unable to redirect the minors into an activity when the minors behavior escalated.however,the parents did attempt to engage the minors in activities and had some success.in her foster home visits,the ea social worker had not heard the minors ask about their parents.she had observed go up to the baby sometimes and kiss her,but generally did not notice the baby was there.the minors were more interested in their own activities than playing with the baby.based on the interactions in the home and lack of inquiry when the baby was not present,the ea social worker opined that removal of the baby would not detrimentally affect the minors.
the social worker assigned to the case during reunification testified there was one visit in january and one in february of.while he had seen changes in the parents since services were terminated in the minors case,he would not change the recommendation to terminate parental rights because the minors deserved permanency.he had no concerns that termination of parental rights would disrupt any significant sibling or parental bond.
the foster mother testified the minors had been in her home about a year.the minors call their sister baby or baby sister they do not use her name.they often do not know when she is gone visiting the parents and do not react when she returns.the foster mother testified there was a time,when the baby was visiting the parents,noticed the foster mother had not gone upstairs at dinnertime to feed the baby and asked the foster mother if she was going to do so.on another occasion,saw the foster mother in the room where she usually rocked the baby to sleep and whispered,shhh.baby sleeping,but did not realize the baby was not there,but was again visiting the parents.the foster mother said she also rocked on occasion and he comes in the room when she rocking the baby because he knows he can share the time.the foster mother stated that did not interact much with the baby or play with her,while engaged with the baby more.she did not believe it would be detrimental to the minors if the baby were moved to a different home.the foster mother testified the baby does not recognize her siblings and was happy when anyone got in her face and played with her.
the adoption worker testified she had observed the siblings interaction in the foster home.she would not change her recommendation to terminate parental rights as to and based on those observations because,due to their age and development,severing the sibling relationship with the baby would not be detrimental to them.she acknowledged there was always some detriment in severing relationships but that the benefit of permanency was important to a child and had to be weighed.the adoption worker further testified that neither minor has a concept of the sibling bond as that term is used in court and,while might miss the baby if the baby were removed and be aware at some level that the baby has needs,neither minor would be traumatized by the baby absence due to their ages and development.
in argument,the parties agreed the minors were likely to be adopted.the department and minors counsel argued the evidence did not support a finding of either the parental beneficial relationship or the sibling exceptions to the preference for adoption.the parents argued the evidence supported both exceptions.
the court issued a written decision finding the minors were likely to be adopted.the court further found that,for their age,the minors had developed a close,caring relationship with the baby,the bond was significant,and that severing the bond would be detrimental to the minors.in reaching this conclusion,the juvenile court twice emphasized that the parents ongoing efforts to reunify with the baby were most critical to the analysis and were a critical fact or in the consideration of the current situation.the court ordered a plan of foster care for the present time and set a renewed section hearing in six months.as noted,we granted the minors application to stay proceedings until further notice of this court.
discussion 
foster care for the present time 
the minors contend the court exceeded its jurisdiction in selecting foster care for the present time and setting a renewed section hearing.
a superior court convened as and exercising the special powers of a juvenile court is vested with jurisdiction to make only those limited determinations authorized by the legislative grant of those special powers.in re lisa cal d,in re kaylee th,in re jody d.further,the scope of the juvenile court discretion always resides in the particular law being applied,in the legal principles governing the subject of the action action that transgresses the confines of the applicable principles of law is outside the scope of discretion and we call such action an abuse of discretion.c ity of sacramento drew d,in re baby girl th.
the purpose of the section hearing is to select a permanent plan for the child after reunification efforts have failed or been refused,subd.b in re marilyn cal th,marilyn h.the alternatives available to the juvenile court at the section hearing are limited to those set forth in the statute and,in order of preference,currently include termination of parental rights and placement for adoption tribal customary adoption legal guardianship with a relative with whom the child is residing make findings that termination of parental rights would not be detrimental to the child and there is a probability of adoption but the child is difficult to place,identify adoption as the goal,and continue the case to identify adoptive parents appoint a nonrelative legal guardian and,finally,order the child be placed in foster care subject to periodic review,subd.b.
here,the court did not exercise its discretion to select among these alternatives.the court found the minors were likely to be adopted,but that adoption would be detrimental based upon the sibling exception,selected foster care as an alternative,and set a selection and implementation hearing.this combination of alternatives was not available to the court as a possible selection under the governing statute.having found the minors were likely to be adopted but that there was a compelling reason for determining that termination of parental rights would be detrimental because termination would substantially interfere with a sibling bond,the court was limited,in this case,to choosing between nonrelative legal guardianship and foster care with periodic review,subd.b.
when the department sought elucidation of the court order,the court explained
