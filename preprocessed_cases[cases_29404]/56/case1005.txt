the question presented in this case is whether the circuit court exceeded its lawful authority when it vacated a juvenile delinquency finding over months after the date the minor pled guilty and was sentenced for the offense.we must also consider whether mandamus relief would now be appropriate to compel the court to reinstate the delinquency finding.
the state filed a petition for adjudication of wardship pursuant to section of the juvenile court act of act ilcs west,alleging that,a minor,was delinquent because he committed the offense of unauthorized possession or storage of a weapon ilcs west.the circuit court accepted the minor guilty plea and sentenced him to months of probation and other conditions.nearly one year later,cook county circuit court judge paul stralka granted the minor motion to vacate the delinquency finding.the state filed a motion with this court for leave to file a petition for a writ of mandamus or prohibition,arguing that the judge order granting the motion to vacate exceeded his lawful authority.we allowed the state motion.see.
background 
was a with no prior criminal record at the time he was arrested by the berwyn police on may,for possessing a folding knife with a blade at his school,morton west high school.the police report of the incident indicates that a student matching description was observed carrying a knife.a police detective was called to the scene,and he asked if he had anything on him that he was not supposed to have.responded,yes,look in my right pants pocket.the detective then recovered a knife from told police that he had not brought the item to school for any particular reason other than that he simply liked to carry it.
on may,the state filed a petition for adjudication of wardship in connection with the crime,charging with unauthorized possession or storage of a class a misdemeanor ilcs west.the state and the minor entered into plea negotiations,and agreed to plead guilty in exchange for the state recommendation that he be sentenced to one year of probation and hours of community service.
at the guilty plea hearing on june,defense counsel filed a motion requesting that the guilty plea be vacated upon successful completion of probation.the state told the court that it opposed the motion to vacate,but that it would stand by the offer it made to defense counsel.defense counsel responded that he too would stand by the agreement,but that the minor wanted to have the opportunity to have the adjudication erased from his record.the court then stated that it would accept the plea agreement and sentence the minor to one year of probation,days of community service and order him to participate in the and programs.finally,the court stated that it would enter and continue the motion to vacate the delinquency adjudication over the state objection.the court set a status date for june.
on june,a hearing on the motion to vacate was held before judge stralka.probation officer informed the court that the minor had successfully completed community service and the and programs.the probation officer further reported that the minor had taken his test,was working full time and had not caused any problems.
the state objected to vacating the delinquency finding,emphasizing the seriousness of the charge and also noting that a full year had not passed since the probation order was entered.judge stralka granted the motion to vacate the delinquency finding.he also ordered that probation be terminated and the case closed.
the cook county state attorney filed a motion in this court for leave to file a petition for a writ of mandamus or prohibition see a,arguing that the order granting the motion to vacate was unlawful.this court granted the motion,and the parties filed briefs before this court.a special assistant attorney general was appointed to represent judge stralka,who is a nominal party to the proceeding under supreme court rule c c.
a writ of mandamus may be awarded if the petitioner establishes a clear legal right to relief,a clear duty of the public official to act,and a clear authority in the public official to comply with the writ,as well as the lack of other adequate remedies.people ex rel.madigan snyder.although mandamus generally provides affirmative rather than prohibitory relief people ex rel.waller mckoski,it can be used to compel the undoing of an act noyola board of education of the city of chicago.
similarly,a writ of prohibition may be used to prevent a judge from acting where he has no jurisdiction to act or to prevent a judicial act which is beyond the scope of a judge legitimate jurisdictional authority.people ex rel.foreman nash,quoting daley hett.there are four requirements that must be met before a writ of prohibition may be issued the action to be prohibited must be judicial or in nature the jurisdiction of the tribunal against which the writ issues must be inferior to that of the issuing court the action prohibited must be outside the tribunal jurisdiction or,if within its jurisdiction,beyond its legitimate authority and the petitioner must be without any other adequate remedy.zaabel konetski.we have also held that relief may be awarded when the issues involved are of great importance to the administration of justice even if all the normal criteria for its issuance are not satisfied.people ex rel.carey white.
we believe that the points raised by the parties correspond most closely with the question of whether a writ of prohibition is appropriate under the circumstances.the key inquiry here,then,is whether the action taken by judge stralka in vacating the lawfully entered delinquency finding almost one year after it was entered based on the minor subsequent good behavior was either outside of the court jurisdiction,or beyond the judge legitimate authority.the state contends that the judge action exceeded his lawful authority because it runs contrary to a number of legal principles,including this court rules on how guilty pleas may be vacated,the important statutory distinctions between court supervision and probation,the exclusive authority of the governor to grant clemency,and the comprehensive legislative scheme for the expungement and sealing of delinquency findings.
and judge stralka respond by arguing that the action taken was within the judge authority because the juvenile court act confers broad discretion and equitable powers upon juvenile court judges to provide an individualized assessment of juvenile offenders and to fashion orders that promote rehabilitation.
we begin our analysis with an overview of the relevant provisions of the act.section of the act provides that law enforcement is to forward information to the state attorney whenever law enforcement has knowledge that a crime has been committed by a minor.ilcs west.the act further provides that the state attorney may file a delinquency prosecution against a minor,alleging that the minor is delinquent and praying that he be made a ward of the court.ilcs west.the state attorney is then given full discretion to prosecute if he or she has probable cause to believe that the minor has committed a crime.ilcs west.
delinquency proceedings based on a petition filed by the state attorney are separated into three judicial determinations or findings phase,an adjudicatory phase and a dispositional phase.the first phase involves a trial and a determination of guilt.see ilcs through west.the two later phases occur at a sentencing hearing and involve a determination of wardship and a sentencing disposition.see ilcs through west.
once a petition is filed alleging that a minor is delinquent,a trial must be held within days of a written demand made by any party.ilcs west.b efore proceeding to adjudication,or after hearing the evidence at the trial,the court may enter an order for supervision for certain offenses if the minor admits or stipulates to the facts supporting the petition and if the state attorney does not object to supervision.ilcs west.if the court grants supervision,the case is continued for a period of time that may not exceed two years.ilcs west.the court may,as a condition of supervision,require that the minor comply with a host of conditions that includes,but is not limited to,the following the minor not violate any criminal statute the minor work or pursue a course of study or vocational training the minor attend school the minor perform some reasonable public or community service.ilcs west.the court is authorized to terminate supervision at any time if warranted by the conduct of the minor and the ends of justice.ilcs west.
the act clearly provides that if court supervision is not an option because of the state attorney objection,the cause must proceed through to the conclusion of the findings stage.ilcs west.once the cause proceeds to trial,the statute charges that the court shall consider the question whether the minor is delinquent.ilcs a west.the reasonable doubt standard of proof and the rules of evidence in criminal cases are applicable at the trial.ilcs a west.the trial court may also accept a plea of guilty before or during trial.upon acceptance of the plea,the court shall determine the factual basis for the plea.ilcs a west.the court must also make and note in the minutes of proceedings a finding of whether or not the minor is guilty.ilcs west.
the second stage is where the court decides whether or not to adjudicate the minor a ward of the court.if the court has found that the minor is guilty,it shall set a time for a sentencing hearing to be conducted under section of the act.ilcs west.section requires the court to conduct a sentencing hearing to determine whether it is in the best interests of the minor and the public that the minor be made a ward of the court.ilcs west.
if the trial court determines that the minor is to be made a ward of the court,the court shall determine at the third stage the proper disposition best serving the interests of the minor and the public.ilcs west.the possible sentencing dispositions under the act include probation,conditional discharge,placement in legal custody or guardianship,or commitment to the department of corrections,juvenile division.ilcs west.the court may terminate probation at any time if warranted by the conduct of the minor and the ends of justice,provided,however,that the period of probation for a minor found guilty of first degree murder,a class x felony,or a forcible felony shall be at least five years.ilcs west.unless the sentencing order so provides,it does not operate to close proceedings on the pending petition,but is subject to modification until final closing and discharge of the proceedings.ilcs west.whenever the court finds that the best interests of the minor and the public no longer require the wardship of the court,the court shall order the wardship terminated and all proceedings under the act respecting that minor finally closed and discharged.ilcs west.except for one limited exception,the wardship and proceedings automatically terminate when the minor attains the age of and all proceedings are finally closed and discharged.ilcs west.
where,as here,the circuit court power to act is controlled by statute,the court must proceed within the strictures of the statute,and may not take any action that exceeds its statutory authority.in re jaime.moreover,a court exercising jurisdiction over a minor pursuant to the provisions of the act is not at liberty to reject or embellish its statutory authority even if there is a perceived need or desirability for such action.in re jaime,at.
from the foregoing overview of the act,we believe that it is clear that a trial judge has no discretion to vacate a finding of delinquency under the circumstances of the present case.the act gives the state attorney discretion to prosecute violations of the criminal law in juvenile court and further gives him or her the right to proceed to trial and reject court supervision.placing the minor on probation and later vacating the delinquency finding,as was done here,is tantamount to granting supervision,and it essentially circumvents the state right to reject supervision.
the legislature has expressly provided that probation is an appropriate sentencing option for a minor who is found guilty ilcs a west,but supervision is only available before proceeding to adjudication and if the state attorney consents ilcs west.see also in re,only those minors found delinquent may be placed on probation,but supervision may issue without any finding of delinquency.upon completion of trial,the court must consider whether or not the minor is guilty,and it has no discretion not to make that determination in the absence of the state consent to supervision.similarly,the court must determine the factual basis for a guilty plea and enter a finding of delinquency if it accepts the plea,as it did in this case.nothing in the act gives the trial court the authority to avoid these determinations or to vacate them later due to the subsequent good behavior of the minor and his completion of the sentence imposed.
judge stralka argues that what was done in the present case differs from court supervision because the minor was held accountable for his crime.but we fail to see how the minor was held any more accountable for his crime than if court supervision had been imposed.the same level of accountability exists in both situations.with supervision,the same conditions that were imposed in the present case could have been imposed,and if a minor violated the conditions he could have been found delinquent or if he satisfied the conditions he could have avoided the finding.in both situations,the minor ends up in the same place.and again,the action taken here essentially collapses the distinction between supervision and probation.the statute simply does not give the court the authority to decide,in the face of an objection by the state,that even though a juvenile is guilty of a crime,the nature of the conduct does not warrant prosecution or a finding of guilt.nor does it allow the court to later vacate a finding of guilt upon completion of the sentence.instead,the statute gives the court discretion to decide whether or not to adjudicate the minor a ward of the court and the proper sentence to be imposed,if any.
and judge stralka argue that section of the act gives the court authority to vacate a delinquency finding at any time until the proceedings are finally closed and discharged.but this interpretation misreads the statute.it is true that the juvenile court judge retains jurisdiction over the wardship and sentencing aspects of the case until the minor reaches the age of or the judge enters a final order closing the case and discharging the minor.ilcs,west.but this does not specifically authorize the undoing of a delinquency finding.instead,the continuing jurisdiction of the juvenile court is designed to promote rehabilitation by allowing the court to monitor the juvenile and to modify the dispositional order as necessary.see ilcs c,h,west.the act does not give any authority to vacate the delinquency finding itself.section clearly and unambiguously allows for the modification of the sentencing order,not the delinquency finding.it provides that unless the sentencing order expressly so provides,it does not operate to close proceedings on the pending petition,but is subject to modification until final closing and discharge of the proceedings under section.emphases added.ilcs west.
the action taken here also runs afoul of a number of other established legal principles,including the way final sentencing orders are normally treated.a finding of guilt and a finding of delinquency are the same in a juvenile delinquency case in re,and that finding coupled with the disposition is a final and appealable judgment under the act see in re,in re,in re,at.even though the sentencing disposition creates the final and appealable order,the sentencing disposition itself is subject to modification in the trial court until final closing and discharge of the minor,which only automatically occurs when the minor reaches years of age.see in re,at.nothing in the act or the case law of this state,however,gives the delinquency finding the same status so that it too can be modified at any time.instead,juvenile court judges are restricted to considering timely motions to withdraw guilty pleas pursuant to supreme court rule d d.see in re.the trial court is also authorized to grant section petitions in juvenile delinquency matters.see in re william,ilcs west.but such relief from a final judgment can not be based on evidence that did not exist at the time of the judgment,such as defendant good behavior after conviction.people ex rel.carey rosin.
and judge stralka argue that even if section of the act does not confer authority to vacate a delinquency finding,such authority exists based on the broad discretion afforded by the act to rehabilitate minors and to provide an individualized assessment.we disagree.
while rehabilitation of the minor remains one of the chief goals of the act in re rodney,this goal must be reconciled with the overriding concerns of protecting the public and holding juvenile offenders accountable for violations of the law in re jaime,at,people taylor.this court recently reiterated this precept by stating that 
the juvenile court act was radically altered when the general assembly amended the act with public act,effective january.taylor,at,citing ilcs ann.et.the amendatory changes renumbered the sections and largely rewrote article v of the act to provide more accountability for the criminal acts of juveniles.taylor,at.the amendments provided a new purpose and policy section,which begins it is the intent of the general assembly to promote a juvenile justice system capable of dealing with the problem of juvenile delinquency,a system that will protect the community,impose accountability for violations of law and equip juvenile offenders with competencies to live responsibly and productively.ilcs west.this policy statement represents a fundamental shift from the singular goal of rehabilitation to include the overriding concerns of protecting the public and holding juvenile offenders accountable for violations of the law.taylor,at,in re.in re jaime,at.
specifically,the purpose and policy section of article v declares the following to be important purposes to effectuate the intent of the legislature 
a to protect citizens from juvenile crime.
b to hold each juvenile offender directly accountable for his or her acts.
c to provide an individualized assessment of each alleged and adjudicated delinquent juvenile,in order to rehabilitate and to prevent further delinquent behavior through the development of competency in the juvenile offender.as used in this section,competency means the development of educational,vocational,social,emotional and basic life skills which enable a minor to mature into a productive member of society.ilcs a,b,c west.
our analysis of a statute is governed by a consideration of the legislature objective in enacting it.in re jaime,at.here,we believe the legislature intended to hold juveniles accountable for their crimes by giving discretion to the state attorney to reject court supervision and to proceed to prosecution.the finding of guilt and a disposition of probation constitute a final and appealable order.while the disposition can be modified,nothing in the act allows we do not believe that the legislature delinquency finding to be vacated in the manner and under the circumstances presented here.our interpretation is consistent with the overriding concerns of the act of protecting the public and holding juvenile offenders accountable.
there are also a number of collateral ways that the public is protected by the finding of delinquency.other statutes require that minors who are found delinquent based on certain sex offenses register with law enforcement ilcs et west,and that minors who are adjudicated delinquent for a violation of the law that would be a felony in criminal court provide dna samples ilcs west.the act of vacating a finding of delinquency would jeopardize enforcement of these provisions,as minors who have had their findings of guilt vacated would no doubt seek to have their information removed from the sex offender registry and their samples removed from the state police database.this might also have the incongruous effect of making the procedure of vacating a finding of delinquency upon completion of probation an even more lenient disposition than court supervision under the act,at least in felony cases,even though a continuance under supervision is supposed to be the most lenient disposition available for delinquency petitions under the act,except for dismissal.see in re.this is because the requirement for dna submission is triggered upon a disposition of court supervision or a finding of delinquency in juvenile court for any felony.see ilcs west.but if a delinquency finding is vacated,it is unclear whether police could continue to have access to the minor genetic information.
additionally,judge stralka order vacating the delinquency finding interferes with the statutory scheme for expungement of juvenile law enforcement and court records.section of the act provides two different subsections for expunging records,with different criteria and time limits for obtaining expungement.ilcs,west.under the first subsection,a person can expunge his records if he has reached years of age or all juvenile proceedings related to that person have been terminated,whichever comes later,but only in the following circumstances no petition was filed or the minor was not found delinquent of the offense or the minor was placed on court supervision and had it successfully terminated or the minor was adjudicated for a class b misdemeanor or less.ilcs west.but the second subsection does not allow expungement for records related to a delinquency finding for a class a misdemeanor,as was committed here,unless the minor has reached the age of or five years have elapsed since all juvenile court proceedings relating to the minor have terminated,whichever is later.ilcs west.thus,vacating the delinquency finding as if it never existed frustrates the purpose of the act to hold minors accountable by preserving their court and law enforcement records for a longer period of time when they have committed serious misdemeanors or felonies.
the purposes of the act with respect to rehabilitation and providing minors with an individualized assessment are adequately served by the statutory provisions that give the court discretion to modify the sentencing disposition.judge stralka was admirably promoting these concerns when he terminated the minor probation early and closed the case based on the minor good behavior.the judge,however,stepped just beyond the edge of his legitimate authority when he vacated the delinquency finding itself that was lawfully imposed months previously.
the cases relied upon by and judge stralka for assertion of the court general equitable powers as sufficient authority in this situation are distinguishable and do not support their position.in in re,d,the state insisted on prosecution of a minor for retail theft after he stole worth of merchandise.the trial court denied the minor motion for a station house adjustment because the state wanted to prosecute.the minor later filed a motion requesting that upon a finding of guilt,he not be adjudicated a ward of the court.prior to a resolution of this motion,the minor pled guilty and was found guilty of retail theft.at the sentencing hearing,the court held that because the minor had already been found guilty,it did not have the power to allow the minor motion not to adjudicate him a ward of the court.the court also concluded that,absent consent by the state,supervision was not an appropriate sentencing disposition.it then sentenced the minor to months of probation.
the appellate court reversed and remanded the cause for further proceedings.in re,d at.it found that the plain language of section of the act allows the court to determine whether it is in the best interests of the minor to be adjudicated a ward of the court and that such a determination must be made before the entry of the sentencing disposition.in re,d at.accordingly,the appellate court remanded the cause for a hearing to determine whether or not it was in the best interests of the minor or the public that he be made a ward of the court.in re,d at.the court found that its resolution of
