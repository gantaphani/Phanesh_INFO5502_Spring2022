introduction 
timothy,a juvenile,pled guilty to one count of burglary of an inhabited dwelling,a felony,in exchange for the dismissal of five other counts and the agreement of the prosecutor that if timothy successfully complete d probation the prosecutor would dismiss the residential burglary allegation and reduce the charge to a misdemeanor.the parties did not further define successfully complete probation.
among the conditions of probation was an order that timothy and his parents be jointly and severally liable,together with the other boys involved in the burglary scheme,for restitution to the victims for their losses.the restitution totaled more than.after two years of probation,timothy had fulfilled all of the other conditions of probation,and he and his parents and the other boys had paid approximately of the total restitution owed.at a hearing,the trial court acknowledged that timothy had performed successfully on probation and converted the remaining restitution obligation to the multiple victims into civil judgments against timothy and his parents.the court then said that it was terminat ing jurisdiction successfully based on the court finding that timothy has complied with all the terms and conditions and he has terminated probation entirely successfully.
upon a defense motion for dismissal of the residential burglary allegation and reduction of the burglary charge to a misdemeanor,the prosecutor objected,arguing that timothy had not successfully completed probation because the full amount of victim restitution had not been paid.the court denied the defense motion to enforce the plea agreement on this ground.on appeal,the parties disagree as to whether timothy successfully complet ed probation,such that the people must honor their portion of the agreement.
because there is no evidence that timothy failure to pay the full amount of the restitution was willful or that his failure to pay is attributable to any reason other than an inability to pay,and in view of the court finding that timothy fulfilled all of the conditions of probation with the exception of the restitution condition,which the court converted to a civil judgment,we conclude that,as a matter of law,timothy successfully complete d probation.we therefore reverse the trial court order and remand the matter to the trial court to enforce the terms of the plea agreement.
factual and procedural background 
between september through,timothy and three friends broke into six different residences and stole items from each of the homes 
the san diego county district attorney filed a complaint against timothy alleging six counts of burglary.the complaint further alleged that the burglaries were of inhabited dwellings.
on march,timothy attorney indicated to the court that timothy was prepared to enter an admission with respect to count and its corresponding allegation,with the understanding that counts,and will be dismissed with a harvey waiver and restitution,and a lso with the understanding that if timothy successfully completed probation a section allegation will be dismissed and the section charge would be reduced to a misdemeanor pursuant to section,subd.b.the court confirmed with timothy that he was agreeing to admit to the allegations supporting count and also admit the inhabited dwelling allegation in exchange for the terms that timothy attorney had recited.
timothy proceeded to admit the truth of the allegation in count,as well as the inhabited dwelling allegation.the court dismissed the remaining counts with a waiver pursuant to harvey,supra,cal d.the trial court then said to timothy,and the agreement is that should you successfully complete probation that at the time that your probation is completed the allegation making this a residential burglary would be dismissed and the section burglary charge may be reduced to a misdemeanor pursuant to section,subdivision b of the penal code.is that your understanding timothy responded,yes.
the probation officer social study report that was submitted to the court prior to the wardship hearing included a number of suggested conditions of probation,including that timothy be ordered to perform hours of community service,complete an class,submit to substance abuse testing,participate in individual and family counseling,write letters of apology to the victims,attend an open house at juvenile hall,be prohibited from associating with gang members,and that he be held responsible for any restitution ordered.with respect to the imposition of a fine,the probation officer noted,due to the family limited income,it appears to the probation officer there are insufficient financial resources that support imposing a fine pursuant to welfare and institutions code section.
the court adjudged timothy to be a ward of the court on april,and placed him on probation.the court imposed a number of probation conditions,including the conditions suggested in the probation officer report.the probation conditions included the following 
the minor and parents,and are presumed jointly and severally responsible for the payment of restitution,fines or penalty assessment.
the minor and companion s are jointly and severally responsible for the payment of restitution to the victim s.
the juvenile court held a victim restitution hearing on june.at that hearing,the parties agreed that the appropriate amount of victim restitution for the crimes against the six victims was.
the court held an annual review hearing in timothy case on april.at that hearing,the court noted that timothy had been doing very well on probation.records indicated that timothy had completed his hours of community service,completed the class,written apology letters to his victims,and attended a tour of juvenile hall.the court noted,however,that the victim restitution had yet to be paid.timothy attorney indicated that he was seeking another year of probation in order to allow timothy to make more restitution payments and to avoid a civil judgment against him and his parents,and indicated that timothy had been consistently making payments and he is doing very well.the prosecutor stated,as the court noted,the minor seems to be doing very well aside from the restitution.so i will submit to the court discretion as to the request to extend probation.the court agreed to extend timothy probation and converted it to probation to the court so that he would no longer be reporting to a probation officer,but,instead,to the court directly.the court indicated its hope that timothy and his companions could get this restitution knocked down in the next year.
the court held another review hearing in the case approximately a year later,on april.the court indicated that the victim restitution balance was,which meant that approximately had been paid.timothy attorney indicated to the court that timothy parents had become unemployed during the previous year and that it was unlikely that timothy and his parents would be able to pay the full restitution amount even if they were given another year to try to do so.timothy attorney asked the court to find that timothy had successfully completed probation,and to convert the restitution order into a civil judgment against timothy and his parents.the trial court asked the prosecutor to respond,and the following colloquy occurred 
prosecutor well,your honor,we need a and i will submit on the rest.these are always bad situations with multiple defendants and of course a victim that has not been reimbursed for her losses.
the court i will go ahead and terminate jurisdiction successfully.ask probation to prepare a for the balance of the restitution.
defense counsel your honor,previously i believe there was an agreement with the people that upon successful completion they would strike the allegation and b.
prosecutor i am going to disagree with that.there is no there is so much restitution that has been paid i would disagree,especially reducing it to a misdemeanor.the victim remains terribly unwhole.
the court that a contractual issue between you and the as far as their agreement.what they consider successful termination is not what i necessarily consider successful termination.
defense counsel i mean,again,the agreement was if timothy successfully completed probation that would be stricken and the felony charge would be reduced to a misdemeanor.that was the bargain entered.restitution is restitution and at some point your honor ca get blood from a turnip.the family is out of work.they had made a handful of efforts to pay off as much as they can.there are.they paid as much as they are able at this point.it is not simply a matter of the family not wanting to pay the restitution.this is a matter of timothy not being able to.they simply do have the financial resources for it and they understand that it will affect their credit moving forward,but we would ask for specific performance with the plea bargain that timothy entered into.
prosecutor let me reverse.i did actually say what i thought.i think it should be without comment.there w ere six residential burglaries,six,and basically i submitted on the court doing a successful termination.i do really agree with it when they do pay restitution because,you know,there are six victims that are suffering today and are unlikely to ever be reimbursed.so i actually think it is without comment in the first place.
the court the reason that i gave him a successful termination is because as far as the other conditions of probation go,he satisfied them.so i giving him a break on that.the people make a point if he has not satisfied all the conditions of probation and there are still approximately six victims at least out there that are owed about in restitution that have not been made whole.so i really ca force the to agree to my assessment that timothy has complied with all the terms and conditions and he has terminated probation entirely successfully.so if you want to bring a motion and challenge the on their situation you can do that but i am not going to force them to do that today.
defense counsel very well.then while we are here can we calendar this for a motion for specific performance 
prosecutor i would ask that it be given without comment,your honor.
the court well,i think 
prosecutor by the way,i do know who gave this long ago.this forces the issue of the people to start insisting on full payment of every restitution case if it is going to be a successful completion of probation because i have to respect that the victims are so harmed.
the court i am trying to see whether i should just terminate and let you bring it up on an appeal or appeal from the court order or keep the case active and hear a motion.i am trying to see what would be appropriate.
defense counsel your honor,again,it is similar in many ways to the court hearing a sealing of records.i mean,the court has terminated probation but this is i think the court would still have jurisdiction to modify or enforce a plea bargain when probation is over.
the court but it would be a rehearing in front of me right now i am denying your motion.you are asking me to force a to do something they feel was not within the bargain and i am denying your request,so that a final order.so you will be asking for a rehearing of that order 
defense counsel i understand the court interpretation.
the court i think it would be better 
defense counsel if you prefer i can take it on appeal.
the court i think it is better if i just terminate him successfully to the extent he has done everything but the restitution and i feel his behavior warrants that he terminate probation successfully.however,the victims are still outstanding almost in restitution.i do think that as far as a contractual obligation goes that he has satisfied that because there is still,almost in restitution and the court is giving him a little bit of a break in terminating him successfully so that he can move on with his life and makes it easier to seal the record and move on.but as far as the contractual obligations to the,i find that he has not met those and that is the court final order.so i will terminate jurisdiction this morning successfully.
the court entered separate restitution orders as to each victim pursuant to welfare and institutions code section,subdivisions h and i,and penal code section which together ensure that restitution owed to a victim that remains unpaid at the end of the probationary term is enforceable as if it were a civil judgment.the minute order for that day states that the court finds that t he minor has successfully complied with conditions of probation and indicates that the court terminated jurisdiction over timothy.the minute order also states that the defense motion to enforce the plea agreement was denied.
timothy filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
as described on the record by the trial court,in addition to the agreement to dismiss counts through of the petition in exchange for timothy admission of guilt on count,the plea agreement provided that if timothy successfully complete s probation,then at the time that probation is completed the allegation making the offense a residential burglary would be dismissed and the burglary charge in count would be reduced to a misdemeanor pursuant to section,subdivision b the question at issue in this appeal is whether timothy is entitled to dismissal of the section allegation and reduction of the section allegation to a misdemeanor,pursuant to the terms of the plea agreement.the parties dispute whether timothy successfully complete d his probation,since one condition of probation was that he and his parents,together with his cohorts,would be jointly and severally liable for restitution to the victims.
the people maintain that successful completion of probation requires the successful completion of all the terms and conditions of probation.italics added.the people further contend that t his definition of successful completion of probation best captures the mutual intent of the parties at the time the plea agreement was reached.the people assert that u ndoubtably,had the parties been asked at that time whether successful completion of probation meant completion of some of the terms or all of the terms,they would have agreed it meant the successful completion of all the terms of probation.timothy disagrees with this assessment,and argues that the trial court finding that he successfully complied with the conditions of probation and the court subsequent termination of jurisdiction over him amount to the successful completion of probation.

the trial court imposed a number of conditions of probation on timothy.one of those conditions was that timothy and his parents pay restitution to the victims of timothy crimes pursuant to welfare and institutions code section,which is the juvenile offender counterpart to the victim restitution provision for adult offenders codified in penal code section.welfare and institutions code section establishes that it is the legislature intent that the victim who incurs any economic loss as the result of a minor criminal conduct that results in the minor being determined to be a ward pursuant to welfare and institutions code section
