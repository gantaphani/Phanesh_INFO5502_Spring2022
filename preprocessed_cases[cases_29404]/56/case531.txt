subsequent events during the litigation

in august and september,the respective lawyers for and the county executed a stipulation which included the following provisions

at about the same time as the parties stipulation,the trial court set a trial date for case for january.on august,the trial court granted request to correct his pleadings so that the doe amendment,which he had filed in january,would identify edward anhalt as doe,rather than doe.during the latter part of,the parties stipulated to continue the trial date to may.

on april,the trial court granted the county ex parte application for an order continuing the may trial date.the record suggests that the court the trial date for september.

on a date not readily ascertainable from the record on appeal,the trial court trailed the trial date from september to october.
the motion challenging the doe amendments 
on september,gilbert rodriguez doe,ron barrett doe,david jimenez doe,paula heath doe,david sanchez doe,and robert phillips doe filed a document,which they entitled a motion to quash service.the doe defendants motion argued that had known their identity for a significant period of time but had nonetheless unreasonably delayed in naming and serving them as doe defendants under section.the doe defendants further argued that they had been prejudiced by the delay and requested that the trial court grant their motion to quash for that reason,or grant such other relief as the court deemed just and proper.
on october,the trial court granted the doe defendants motion to quash for the following written reason unreasonable delay in filing an amended pleading after discovering a doe defendant identity may bar the plaintiff from using the fictitious name device if the delay is prejudicial.barrows american motors d.
filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
section is irrelevant 
contends the trial court acted in excess of its authority when it granted the doe defendants motion to quash under section.more specifically,argues section is limited to cases where there is a lack of personal jurisdiction,which is not challenged here.arguments fail to persuade us to find reversible error because,insofar as we read the record on appeal,is simply mistaken in thinking that section applies to his case.
the doe defendants motion to quash did not discuss nor even cite section neither did the trial court order granting the motion.the issue presented to the trial court by the doe defendants motion was whether could avail himself of the doe amendment procedure authorized by section and bring the doe defendants into the case on the eve of trial.the substance of the motion to quash is what mattered,not its label,see also barrows,supra,d at.the trial court ruled that could not avail himself of the doe amendment procedure authorized by section because he had unreasonably delayed in filing the doe amendments,which named the doe defendants as parties.
our role is to review the decision actually made by the trial court.for this reason,we summarily reject all of arguments insofar as they are based on section and precepts of personal jurisdiction.such matters are not relevant to the issues involved in this appeal.
ii.the trial court doe amendment ruling is not infected with error 
contends the trial court dismissing his action against the doe be reversed because the barrows standard was not met.we disagree.
these were the extant circumstances in barrows plaintiffs son died in a vehicle accident in november.in january,plaintiffs filed a complaint for wrongful death,followed by an amended complaint in october.filed a demurrer arguing that plaintiffs claim was barred by the statute of limitations because the amended complaint failed to allege that respondents were the doe defendants fictitiously named in the original complaint.when
