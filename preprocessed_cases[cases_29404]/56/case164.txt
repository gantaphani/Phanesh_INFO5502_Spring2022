it is a federal crime to use the internet to knowingly attempt to persuade,induce,entice,or coerce a minor to engage in unlawful sexual activity,b,and it is also a crime to aid or abet another in committing a federal crime.after using the internet to contact a person,who turned out to be an undercover government agent,in order to arrange for sex with two children,james hornaday was charged by superseding indictment with violating both b and.the case was tried to a jury,which returned a general guilty verdict.
in his appeal hornaday contends that his actions are not prohibited by b because he never used the internet to communicate directly with a minor.he also contends that he is entitled to a new trial because,under the facts of this case,it was improper for the court to instruct the jury that he could be convicted pursuant to,and the jury general verdict may have been based on that improper legal theory.he is wrong about the first point.as for the second,there was error but it was harmless.
loving families is an internet chat room where people communicate via realtime messages about having sex with children.as part of his duties with the law enforcement against child harm task force and the lucie county sheriff office,detective neil spector entered the loving families chat room on august.his undercover profile for the chat room described him as wayne,the father of a son and daughter.
hornaday contacted wayne via instant messaging he said he was a bisexual male searching for a loving family and that he had had family experiences before and want ed more.wayne said that he enjoyed family love and sometimes had bisexual experiences.hornaday described his prior sexual encounters with mothers and their daughters.he asked whether wayne had sex with his children,and he sent a nude photograph of himself to wayne.
wayne suggested that he call hornaday and hornaday agreed.during that conversation,hornaday told wayne about some of his prior sexual experiences with families,including minors,and said he was looking for another family.he explained it very tough for me to find somebody that,you know,going to accept me into their home and accept me having sex with their children or have sex,you know,sex with each other.
the next day,august,wayne contacted hornaday via instant messaging.hornaday asked are you interested in a bi male like me for your family he spoke about his sexual encounters with the minor daughter of a former girlfriend and asked about wayne children sexual interests.wayne said brian was twelve and susie was thirteen and asked what he should tell them.hornaday replied i guess you can tell them you met a nice bisexual single male that would like to join you all for friendship and sex.hornaday also sent three pornographic photographs of himself,two of which showed him in graphic poses with a girl he described as fourteen years of age.
later that day,hornaday contacted wayne via instant messaging and asked whether he would show the photographs to brian and susie.hornaday asked about wayne sexual interests and about the children sexual interests.he also asked about the family prior sexual experiences together.they agreed that wayne would call hornaday momentarily,and he did.
during their phone conversation,hornaday asked whether the children could be trusted not to tell anyone and he talked again about his sexual experiences with minors.because wayne and hornaday both had plans that weekend,hornaday suggested they get together the next weekend.they agreed to meet the next saturday and see what happened.wayne asked for pictures of hornaday clothed to share with the children.he also asked about hornaday expectations so that the children would know beforehand what was going to happen.
the men did not talk again until wayne called hornaday on wednesday,september.at that time,hornaday asked if wayne had shown the children the photographs he sent and what they thought of him.
the next morning,wayne contacted hornaday by instant messaging.hornaday asked d o you think either or both of the kids are anxious to explore me sexually he expressed interest in sex with wayne and with each of the children.the men agreed to meet at a local friendly ice cream on saturday morning.a email the next day confirmed their plans.
on saturday,september,hornaday was arrested when he arrived at friendly to meet wayne and the children.he was charged by superseding indictment with violating b and.after a jury trial,during which the jury heard recordings of the telephone calls and was given of the instant messages and photographs,a general verdict of guilt was returned.
in,when hornaday contacted wayne,b provided that 
whoever,using the mail or any facility or means of interstate or foreign commerce,or within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the united states knowingly persuades,induces,entices,or coerces any individual who has not attained the age of years,to engage in prostitution or any sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense,or attempts to do so,shall be fined under this title,imprisoned not more than years,or both.
b.the statute was amended in to increase the penalties,but not in any way that matters to this appeal.
hornaday contends that his actions are not prohibited by b because he never used the internet to communicate directly with a only communicated with wayne,an adult.that argument fails because,while this appeal was pending,another panel of this court held that the use of an adult intermediary like wayne does not take the defendant actions outside the prohibitions of b.united states murrell,cir.
murrell involved a factual scenario that matches this one in all relevant respects a sexual predator used the internet to communicate with an undercover agent posing as an adult intermediary who would arrange for the sexual predator to engage in various unlawful sexual activities with a minor.id.at.the panel concluded that the defendant conduct fit squarely within the definition of induce in b,id.at,and that the use of an adult intermediary did not change the analysis,see id.at noting that the efficacy of b would be eviscerated if a defendant could circumvent the statute simply by employing an intermediary to carry out his intended objective.because the defendant in the murrell case had the intent to induce a minor to engage in unlawful sexual activities and took a substantial step toward committing the offense,the court upheld his b conviction.id.at.
hornaday attempt to sexually abuse children using a parent who turned out to be a law enforcement agent is not different in any material way from what happened in the murrell case,which is not surprising since the same detective was posing as the parent in each.because the cases are not distinguishable on the facts,murrell forecloses most of hornaday arguments about why the statute should not be applied to him.foreclosed are his arguments that the plain statutory language does not cover this type of conduct and we should accordingly look behind that language to examine congress intent in passing b,and his assertion that the rule of lenity requires interpreting the statute so that it does not cover his actions.
also foreclosed is hornaday argument that reading the statute to cover his conduct would entail such a novel interpretation that it could be applied only to conduct occurring after that interpretation was announced.the interpretation announced in murrell was applied to the defendant in that case even though his conduct obviously preceded the decision applying the statute to it.in a similar fashion,hornaday arguments that b is void for vagueness insofar as adult intermediary situations are concerned can not be reconciled with murrell holding that the plain language of b clearly applies to those situations.
hornaday related contention that if b covers his actions its enactment exceeded congress commerce power is meritless.he argues that congress lacks the authority to criminalize communications of a sexual predator using an instrumentality or channel of interstate commerce to seek out child victims,unless those communications are directly with the intended victims.see appellant br.at finally,the commerce clause also requires that the statutory language be read to criminalize only direct communications between the defendant and the minor via the facility of interstate commerce here,the internet.emphasis in original.there is no basis for that position.
for the legal premise of his conclusion hornaday relies on a case which does not support it to begin with and which in any event has been vacated pending en banc review.united states drury,cir,rehearing en banc granted and opinion vacated by cir.the internet is an instrumentality of interstate commerce.see united states pipkins,cir united states panfil,cir.congress clearly has the power to regulate the internet,as it does other instrumentalities and channels of interstate commerce,and to prohibit its use for harmful or immoral purposes regardless of whether those purposes would have a primarily intrastate impact.see heart of atlanta motel,united states,d brooks united states.the commerce clause power is plenary.riley merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir.congress may reach and prohibit the use of a telephone or the internet to set up the sexual abuse of children through intermediaries,just as it may prohibit the use of those instrumentalities to set up a fraudulent scheme or to arrange a contract murder.the communication does not have to be directly with the victim.
we need not pause for long on account of hornaday frivolous argument that applying b to him is unconstitutional because it punishes him for engaging in speech activities protected by the first amendment.speech attempting to arrange the sexual abuse of children is no more constitutionally protected than speech attempting to arrange any other type of crime.
to sum up our decision so far,the conduct that the evidence proved hornaday committed is prohibited by b.a defendant properly may be convicted and punished for that conduct.none of hornaday contrary arguments has any merit.the next question is whether he may be convicted pursuant to when the only one with whom he acted is a government agent.
the indictment under which he was convicted charged hornaday with violating title,united states code,section b and title,united states code,section.the latter statutory provision is the general punishment as a principal provision,which states that 
a whoever commits an offense against the united states or aids,abets,counsels,commands,induces or procures its commission,is punishable as a principal.
b whoever willfully causes an act to be done which if directly performed by him or another would be an offense against the united states,is punishable as a principal.
section does not establish a separate crime of aiding and abetting,but rather an alternative charge that permits one to be found guilty as a principal for aiding or procuring someone else to commit the offense.united states martin,cir internal marks and citation omitted.a defendant can be properly convicted as a principal under even when he has not personally commit ed all the acts constituting the elements of the substantive crime aided.id.at.he can also be convicted under that provision when there is no mention of it in the indictment.id.
during trial in this case,the government asked that the jury be instructed on liability under.defense counsel objected.the government acknowledged the settled case law that it takes two to conspire,and one of the two can not be an undercover agent.it nonetheless argued that under a defendant can be held criminally responsible for conduct he aids and abets or causes an undercover agent to commit even though the agent himself can not be.eventually agreeing with that position,the court instructed the jury on as a theory of conviction and the prosecutor argued that theory to the jury although without much force.the jury returned a general verdict convicting hornaday as charged in the indictment.
hornaday contends that the general verdict embraces the possibility of conviction on an invalid legal theory aiding and abetting an undercover agent who could not himself be held responsible for the crime.or to put it in terms of one of our decisions,the argument is that there was no principal offense for hornaday to aid and abet because the government agent,lacking intent,never committed a crime for the defendant to aid and abet.see united states edwards,cir holding that the defendant conviction for possession with intent to distribute drugs could not be sustained on aiding and abetting grounds,because the defendant never possessed the drugs and the government agent who had them lacked the intent to distribute.
the problem with the holding in the edwards footnote is that it ignores the second subsection of,and it disregards prior precedent of this court that is consistent with that subsection and inconsistent with the edwards holding.it is plausible to read a as including a requirement that someone other than the defendant be guilty of the crime which the defendant aids and abets.indeed,that reading is the most plausible one in light of the subdivision language,which makes punishable as a principal anyone who aids,abets,counsels,commands,induces,or procures the commission of an offense the argument that someone else has to commit an offense for that particular statutory language to fit is a forceful one.
the same can not be said,however,about the language in the second subsection.section b language fits,and is obviously designed for,the situation in which a defendant with the requisite intent to commit a crime gets someone else to act in a way necessary to bring about the crime,even if that other person is innocent.or to put it another way,the defendant supplies the intent and maybe another element or two while getting someone else to supply at least one additional element that is necessary to the commission of the crime.that someone else may be an undercover law enforcement officer or an entirely innocent third person.
one of the oldest examples in our decisions of b criminal liability based upon the actions of innocent third parties is pereira united states,cir in that case we affirmed under b the conviction for transporting in interstate commerce a security which the defendant knew had been fraudulently obtained,even though the actual transportation mailing of the security was done by an innocent bank at the defendant request.id.at.another example is united states walser,cir,in which the defendant got another person to give testimony under oath that the defendant knew was false but the testifier did not.we sustained the defendant conviction for perjury even though she never gave any testimony herself.id.both the pereira and walser decisions preceded edwards and trump its holding that there can be no criminal liability where one of the necessary elements is performed by a party that lacks the intent to commit the crime.see cohen office depot,cir tompkins moore,cir united states steele,cir en banc.
it is true that pereira and walser were not undercover agent cases,but we have applied the same principles to impose liability under b in those types of cases.one case upon which the government places heavy reliance is united states delgado,cir,where we affirmed a conviction for importing illegal drugs into the united states in violation of a and,even though those who actually brought the drugs into this country at the behest of the defendant were undercover dea agents,id.at.the agents act of importing the drugs could be written up against the defendant under the aiding and abetting doctrine,we explained,so long as the defendant had a proprietary interest in the drugs.id.at.we said that the defendant proprietary interest in that case was evidenced by the fact that he took possession of the drugs from the dea agents.id.at.for support of the legal component of our holding on that issue we cited a number of other decisions upholding convictions on an theory where some of the necessary conduct,the importation or transportation of the drugs,that the defendants had procured or aided was actually done by government agents haynes united states,cir united states meinster,cir united states gould,cir united states mercer.
