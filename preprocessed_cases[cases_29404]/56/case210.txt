introduction 
kyle appeals from juvenile court adjudication and disposition orders.the adjudication order declared kyle a ward of the court and sustained a petition that the people filed under welfare and institutions code section alleging that kyle had committed one count of felony vandalism pen.code,subds.a,b and one count each of misdemeanor vandalism,subd.b and misdemeanor possession of an aerosol container with intent to vandalize,subd.e.the disposition order directed that kyle be placed in a suitable juvenile detention facility for a maximum of three years.
kyle argues on appeal that there is insufficient evidence to support the juvenile court finding on the felony vandalism count that kyle caused or more in property damage,which is the amount of damage necessary to punish vandalism as a felony rather than as a misdemeanor.pen.code,subd.b.we agree.in our view,the people failed to present sufficient evidence,specific to kyle acts of vandalism,demonstrating that the actual amount of damage he caused reached the felony vandalism threshold of.therefore,we reverse the adjudication order in part and instruct the juvenile court to reduce the felony vandalism count to a misdemeanor vandalism count.we also reverse the disposition order and remand for a new disposition consistent with the reduction of the felony count to a misdemeanor.
factual and procedural background

the adjudication hearing on the petition was tried in front of the juvenile court on september.officer miguel barragan was the lone prosecution witness to testify whether,for purposes of the petition felony vandalism count,the amount of damage that kyle caused to the two properties on south barrington avenue was or more officer barragan testified that he previously had handled vandalism cases and that part of his assignment is to determine the cost of repairing walls and other structures damaged by vandalism.the prosecutor asked him,h ow is it that you go about determining the dollar amount of city property that needs to be repaired due to vandalism or tagging officer barragan answered,f or city properties,we have a graffiti removal cost list.it is issued by the city for my investigations on how to come up with estimates of removal of graffiti.
with implicit reference to the dimensions of the tagging at south barrington avenue,the prosecutor asked officer barragan,does the graffiti removal cost list have a dollar amount for how much it costs to approximate sic a two by tag on a wall yes,officer barragan answered.what is that dollar amount the prosecutor asked.kyle counsel objected to that question on the grounds of hearsay and lack of foundation.the court overruled the objections,and officer barragan responded,according to the graffiti removal cost list,it is for each incident of removing graffiti.applying that rate,officer barragan stated that it would cost a total of to remove the three tags on the two properties two tags on one wall at south barrington avenue and one tag at south barrington avenue.
on,officer barragan stated that the graffiti removal cost list was one page long.he conceded that he did not prepare the list someone else,whom he did not identify,prepared it.nor was officer barragan able to explain how the list cost removal determinations were made.officer barragan also conceded that he was unaware whether any repairs had been made to the two properties in question.additionally,he conceded that he was unaware of the cost of materials to make the repairs.and he conceded that he did not know how long it would take to make the repairs and how many people would be needed to make them.officer barragan did say that he had visited the two properties as part of his investigation.but he acknowledged that his repair cost figures were based entirely on the graffiti cost removal list.
at the close of their case,the people did not offer into evidence the graffiti removal cost list,photographs of the tagging,or any other document.
after the people rested,kyle counsel made an oral motion to reduce the petition felony vandalism count to a misdemeanor,based on the testimony of the evaluation of the cost of repair.the court denied the motion.
kyle did not testify or present any evidence in his defense.after the people waived closing argument,kyle counsel renewed his argument that the felony vandalism count should be reduced to a misdemeanor because any damage kyle caused to the properties was less than.the court again denied the request.the court then proceeded to sustain the felony vandalism count,as well as the petition two misdemeanor counts,and memorialized its findings in an adjudication order.
following an october,disposition hearing,the juvenile court ordered kyle suitably placed in a level facility,with a maximum period of confinement of three years 
kyle appeal was timely.
