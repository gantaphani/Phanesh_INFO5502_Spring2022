in this case we determine whether a trial court has the authority to order a school district to pay the educational portion of a delinquent minor residential placement.was adjudicated a delinquent minor and was placed on probation.subsequently,the juvenile court placed at the heritage center the center in utah.oak park river forest high school district oak park or the school district,resident school district,objected to an order compelling it to pay for the educational component of residential placement at the center.the appellate court reversed,finding that the juvenile court lacked authority under the school code code ilcs et west and the juvenile court act of act ilcs et west to order oak park to pay for the educational component of residential placement.d.we affirm.
background 
the state filed a petition for adjudication of wardship on may,arising from reckless conduct in igniting and throwing firecrackers,endangering the safety of others.was adjudicated delinquent,and probation was imposed on october.on july,the state filed a petition for supplemental relief,alleging that had not complied with the conditions of his probation.was again placed on probation.probation officer recommended that receive a residential placement because mother was unable to secure his attendance at school,counseling,or probation department appointments.in november,the juvenile court apparently entered an order extending probation with the additional condition of residential placement.while there is no written order in the record on appeal,a docket sheet entry dated november,indicates that a finding of a probation violation was entered along with an extension of probation for months and the condition of residential placement.a docket sheet entry of december,shows that was accepted at the center.was admitted to the center on march.
the public defender office of cook county filed a motion in juvenile court,requesting an order for the care and support of subsequently,in approximately february,oak park received a notice to appear in the juvenile court of cook county,regarding oak park potential obligation to pay for the educational portion of residential placement.
at the time of his original adjudication as a delinquent minor,was a resident and special education student in the elmwood park school district.he began receiving special education services in may.in february,following a reevaluation of individual educational program,was placed in a therapeutic day program at joseph academy.mother became a resident of oak park in january.
probation officer testified that,while at joseph academy,did not comply with the terms of his probation.according to the probation officer,was frequently truant and failed to abide by his counseling and requirements.would also engage in fighting and general gross behavior,resulting in suspensions.according to the probation officer,it was difficult to determine whether improved at joseph academy due to his frequent truancy.was later discharged from joseph academy,but was still considered to be in need of services.the probation officer recommended a therapeutic residential placement in view of problems with attendance at school,counseling,and probation department appointments.an advocacy supervisor at the cook county juvenile probation department testified that a placement at the center would be appropriate.
on june,the juvenile court found that oak park was liable for the educational portion of residential placement.an order requiring oak park to provide payment to the center for education costs was entered on june.oak park filed a notice of appeal pursuant to supreme court rule.
the appellate court reversed d,initially rejecting the state argument that the court lacked jurisdiction over oak park appeal.according to the appellate court,the june,order was final for purposes of appeal.the court reasoned that a judgment is final if it decides the controversy between the parties on its merits and fixes their rights such that,if judgment is affirmed,all that remains for the circuit court to do is execute the order.d at,citing in re.according to the appellate court,the june order was final regarding oak park obligation to pay for the educational portion of placement.the court further reasoned that the state invocation of supreme court rule a a was misplaced because appeals in delinquency proceedings are governed by the rules applicable to criminal appeals.d at.finally,the court held that oak parks citation to rule was not fatal to its appeal.the state was not prejudiced by oak park citing to the wrong appellate rule.d at,citing in re,d.
the appellate court next held that the juvenile court lacked the statutory authority to order oak park to pay for the educational portion of the delinquent minor residential placement.d at.regarding placements made pursuant to section of the act,either the legal guardian of the minor ilcs west or the county ilcs west is required to pay for the minor care and support.d at.also,section a of the act ilcs a west provides for state reimbursement of county funds expended for the placement of minors pursuant to section.d at.according to the appellate court,this statutory scheme does not include a school district as a responsible party.d at.
we granted the state petition for leave to appeal and now affirm the judgment of the appellate court.
initially,the state argues that oak park never properly invoked the jurisdiction of the appellate court because it brought its appeal under rule.nevertheless,the appellate court found that the failure to cite the correct rule was not fatal.see in re,d,holding that the state was not prejudiced by the incorrect invocation of civil rather than criminal rules in a delinquency matter.the state maintains that the disposition of this case is not controlled by because this court has suggested that a greater showing is required by a party seeking to invoke jurisdiction under the incorrect rule.see in re curtis,where this court heard an appeal brought under a rule not invoked by the appellant rule a because the statute invoked by the appellant section of the juvenile court act of was subsequently held to be unconstitutional.the state contends that neither oak park nor the appellate court has provided any justification as to why an appeal should be allowed under the improper rule in this case.
it is apparent that oak park should have cited supreme court rule a a,rather than rule,in its notice of appeal.rule governs appeals in juvenile cases,providing,in relevant part,a ppeals from final judgments in delinquent minor proceedings,except as otherwise specifically provided,shall be governed by the rules applicable to criminal cases.a.under rule a,appeals in all criminal cases,other than those where a sentence of death has been imposed,are perfected by filing a notice of appeal with the clerk of the trial court.a.generally,the filing of the notice of appeal is the only jurisdictional step required to perfect an appeal.see,in re tekela,steinbrecher steinbrecher.in this case,oak park timely filed its notice of appeal in the trial court,albeit citing rule rather than rule a.we agree with the appellate court that it had jurisdiction because oak park perfected its appeal.
our decision in curtis does not affect this analysis.curtis involved child protection proceedings where the trial court entered an order that established a permanency goal of substitute care,pending the outcome of a parental rights termination proceeding.the mother appealed,and the state moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction.the appellate court granted the state motion,and the mother appealed.this court held that section of the juvenile court act of ilcs west,permitting immediate appeals from permanency orders,violated the separation of powers doctrine.curtis,at.as a result,the state argued that the mother has forfeited the opportunity to appeal,having exclusively relied on the appeal provision of section.nevertheless,we held that the appellate court should consider the mother appeal as properly brought pursuant to supreme court rule a a.curtis,at.while we noted special circumstances in curtis,we did not base our holding on those circumstances.we agree with the appellate court that some showing of prejudice is required to prevent a party from proceeding with an appeal brought mistakenly under the civil appeal rules rather than the applicable criminal appeal rules.d at,citing in re,d at.here,there was no prejudice demonstrated.
the state next argues that,even if oak park can assert jurisdiction pursuant to rule a,it did so too late.under the act,notice of appeal must be filed within days of the final judgment or within days of the entry of an order disposing of all timely motions directed against the judgment.see a.the state refers this court to dispositional orders entered on october,and november.oak park filed its notice of appeal on july.according to the state,the order of june,was not a final and appealable order because the case remains active for purposes of regular status reports on progress at the heritage center and his compliance with the terms of his probation.
except in those situations where a supreme court rule provides for an interlocutory appeal,the appellate court only has jurisdiction to review final judgments.in re.a final judgment is defined as one that fixes the rights of the parties in the lawsuit it is final if it determines the litigation on the merits and,if affirmed,leaves only the execution of the judgment,at,dispositional orders from juvenile court are generally final and appealable.see in re,d.furthermore,an order is final for purposes of review when matters left for future determination are merely incidental to the ultimate rights that have been adjudicated by the judgment.deckard joiner.
contrary to the state position,the june,order was the only order entered that required oak park to pay the educational portion of placement at the heritage center.for oak park,all that remained was enforcement of the order.this is true even though the order remained subject to future modification.we also note that oak park was not a party when the october,and november,dispositional orders were entered in this case.therefore,oak park could not have challenged those orders.
the state lastly maintains that the june,order does not contain the requisite language to make it appealable pursuant to supreme court rule a a.according to the state,the order is not appealable because the juvenile court made no finding that there was no just reason to delay appeal or enforcement of the order.rule governs appeals in juvenile cases,providing,in relevant part,a ppeals from final judgments in delinquent minor proceedings,except as otherwise specifically provided,shall be governed by the rules applicable to criminal cases.emphasis added.a.the order appealed from here was entered in a delinquency proceeding,and therefore,this case is governed by the rules applicable to criminal appeals.rule a is not applicable to criminal appeals.see.therefore,it is inapplicable to this case.
we now turn to the central issue presented by this appeal whether the juvenile court had authority to order oak park to pay for the educational portion of,residential placement.as noted by the appellate court and argued by the parties,resolution of this case depends upon harmonizing and differentiating between the school code and the juvenile court act.
a.the individuals with disabilities education act and the school code 
the education for all handicapped children act of eahca was enacted by congress to rectify the failure of state education systems to meet the educational needs of children with disabilities.tucker,federal disability law.in,the eahca was amended and renamed the individuals with disabilities education act idea et.by its own terms,the idea requires that students with disabilities receive a free appropriate public education fape.c.a fape includes special education and related services that a have been provided at public expense,under public supervision and direction,and without charge b meet the standards of the state educational agency c include an appropriate preschool,elementary,or secondary school education in the state involved and d are provided in conformity with the individualized education program.

when the student resident school district is unable to meet a student disability needs,the student is eligible to receive educational services elsewhere.see ilcs west children attending classes in another district ilcs west children attending private schools,public schools,public school residential facilities,or private special education facilities.in cases where a student attends a private school,public school,public school residential facility,or private special education facility,section of the school code provides an avenue for the school or facility to be reimbursed by the student resident district.ilcs west.section states that,if,
because of his or her disability the special education program of a district is unable to meet the needs of a child and the child attends a school or special education facility,the school district in which the child is a resident shall pay the actual cost of tuition for special education and related services.a n onpublic special education facility include s a residential facility within or without the state of illinois.ilcs west.

the district of residence of the parent or disabled student is responsible for the actual costs of the student special education program and is eligible for reimbursement under this section when placement is made by a state agency or the courts.ilcs west.
