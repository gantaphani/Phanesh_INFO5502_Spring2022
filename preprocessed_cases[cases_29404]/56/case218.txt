this action was brought by three members of the board of directors board of the friars village homeowners association fvhoa against six other board members and the fvhoa manager but,surprisingly,not against fvhoa itself despite the fact the dispute focuses on the activities of the board and its governance of fvhoa and the friars village community.
friars village is comprised of townhouses located in san diego.the three board members,former plaintiff lance mcdonald mcdonald and plaintiffs and respondents nancy ann lee lee and patricia jean rocha rocha sometimes collectively plaintiffs,sued defendants and appellants sil silveira silveira,shelley smith smith,wilfried birleanu birleanu,anne durst durst,helen fox fox and john nielsen sometimes collectively director defendants following a board vote of to renew an fvhoa managerial contract in which plaintiffs voted against such renewal.
director defendants timely moved under code of civil procedure section to strike the complaint of plaintiffs,which consisted of a single claim for declaratory relief.director defendants argued the complaint was based on decisions and statements they made in duly noticed board meetings while conducting board business and,thus,involved acts or activities in furtherance of constitutionally protected activity within the meaning of the statute.
the trial court denied the motion.in so doing,it ruled that the only relief sought by plaintiffs was a determination of what was required under the hoa governing documents and,as such,that plaintiffs declaratory relief cause of action did not arise out of director defendants rights.the court therefore never reached the issue of whether plaintiffs could satisfy their burden under subdivision b of section to establish a probability of success on their claim.
as we explain,we independently conclude the court erred when it found the gravamen of plaintiffs complaint did not involve protected activity under section.we further conclude plaintiffs can not show a probability they will prevail on their claim.therefore,we reverse the order denying the special motion to strike of director defendants and direct the trial court to grant that motion with respect to each such defendant.
factual background 
the following is taken from the allegations in the complaint and the declarations and evidence proffered in connection with the motion.
at all times relevant,the fvhoa board consisted of nine resident homeowners,each of whom served a staggered term.at the time they filed their march complaint,plaintiffs mcdonald elected in,lee and rocha sat on the board.shortly after service of the complaint,defendants durst,fox and nielsen appointed resigned from the board,while silveira,smith,and birleanu remained as active board members.the complaint,which referred to director defendants as the m ajority b lock,alleged they developed an affinity for one another as they bec a me closely connected and mutually dependent on another as they carried out the wrongful conduct alleged.italics added.
the complaint alleged that,in march,fvhoa entered into an contract with companies,a california corporation dba ark management sometimes march contract.under the terms of the march contract,agreed to provide fvhoa with financial management services to maintain and manage its common areas to supervise contractors and to advise the board and its committees in the operations of fvhoa,among many other duties.
in october,ark llc was formed.about a month later,it acquired the property management business belonging to companies,including.following the acquisition of by ark llc,the board on behalf of fvhoa executed a march,contract with ark llc sometimes march contract.
the march contract included a term for automatic renewal,which provided commencing on june,and hereinafter from sic.if notification by either party of their intent not to renew this agreement for one additional year is not received by the other party in writing at least sixty days prior to the expiration date of this agreement,this agreement shall automatically renew in full force and effect for the ensuing period,commencing on the date after the final day of the previous term.the renewal deadline date will be included on the annual calendar and ark llc will provide at least a day reminder of contract renewal to the b oard.
on february,director defendants and plaintiffs attended a board meeting to discuss renewal of the march contract.the complaint alleged that,during the meeting,plaintiffs requested the board seek additional bids for the management contract and even volunteered to obtain such bids before the next board meeting.however,director defendants believed the board should renew the march contract for one more year.each director defendant testified that,while he or she was open to a new management company,he or she was concerned it would be difficult for a new management company to step in and assist in the oversight of the extensive renovation projects that were then occurring at friars village.
following a discussion of ark lcc performance under the march contract and of the need for a out request for proposal before seeking bids for a new management contract,and after each board member had expressed his or her views regarding renewal of the march contract,silveira made a motion to approve the management contract,subject to the advice of counsel that the minor changes did not constitute a new contract durst seconded the motion,and the motion was put to vote,which,as noted,passed six to three with plaintiffs voting against renewal.
plaintiffs complaint alleged director defendants failed to follow proper bid procedures when they voted in to renew the march contract.it further alleged director defendants unlawfully delegated board duties to machale,which caused monetary damage s to the residents of friars village that the board was sworn to serve and to which the board owed a fiduciary duty.
specifically,plaintiffs alleged that director defendants did not permit sufficient bids to ensure fvhoa paid the best price for its manager that machale,as agent of the prior manager,exposed fvhoa to violations of california law that machale orchestrated a settlement in which the fvhoa insurance policy was tapped to pay for the settlement,resulting in a substantial increase in the insurance premiums fvhoa is required to pay for insurance that director defendants obstructed any due diligence into manager defendants conduct,refused to permit a bona fide bidding process to be followed in selecting the fvhoa manager and instead automatically approved contracts hiring machale and ark llc as fvhoa manager that the board voted on the ark llc management contract without negotiating or seeing the terms of the new proposed contract,and without performing an annual review as called for in the governing documents and that the extension of the march contract involved material changes in terms and otherwise required three bona fide bids to ensure the board on behalf of fvhoa obtained the best price available for its manager.
plaintiffs complaint further alleged that director defendants adopted policies in violation of the rights of plaintiffs to carry out their respective responsibilities and duties as directors and officers of the fvhoa and that director defendants allowed machale to control the bidding process on fvhoa projects including making a recommendation on the bid winner,which was then approved by director defendants in a rubber stamp vote.as a result,the complaint alleged neither fvhoa nor its members receive d the benefits of the best prices for such services and products.
as particularly relevant to the motion,the complaint alleged that the board allowed the friars village roofing project to escalate to about,when that project initially was limited to six buildings involving four bids obtained by the board in march,which bids ranged from about to about that none of these four bids was accepted that the board awarded the bid for the roofing work to re reconstruction experts,re,whose bid of about was submitted about two months after the original bids and that the contract with re increased from about to.
the complaint continued that director defendants subsequently approved a change order that increased the re contract from to an increase of that the board later agreed to an additional increase that brought the re contract up to about that the bids on the roofing project were not in any event open to the public and that director defendants ignored complaints about the bidding process.
machale in her declaration in support of director defendants motion testified the roofing project was prompted due to the deterioration of numerous roofs throughout the fvhoa,which,if not remedied,would result in water intrusion into the residences and damage to the buildings.the fvhoa retained fred baron,a licensed architect,to evaluate the roofs to identify the buildings that most required maintenance,and establish a priority schedule in accordance with the urgency for repair.the roofs were graded one through five,with the most urgent roofs as level one.
according to machale,the board received more than three bids in connection with the roofing project.ultimately,the board voted to approve re bid of about,which included a option for upgraded materials that the board also approved,for a total contract price of about.
the record shows silveira,smith,durst and fox were on the board when it voted to approve the friars village roofing project.silveira in her declaration in support of the motion testified that on may,she attended a board meeting to discuss the roofing project and the several bids the board had received in connection with that project that she reviewed the various vendors and proposals,evaluated their quotes,reputation and prior experience,and made a determination as to which contractor,in her opinion,was most suitable.following discussion of each of the director viewpoints regarding the possible vendors,a director made a motion to accept re s proposal to complete six of the priority level one roofs,which was seconded,and put to a vote.the motion passed six votes in favor of the motion,including her vote,and one opposed vote.
silveira testified that at the september,meeting,the board addressed the next phase of the roofing project.at that meeting,the board discussed whether to complete the remaining portion of the priority level one roofs by way of a change order with the current contractor,re silveira believed that in light of the pending rainy season,this phase of the r oofing p roject should be completed by change order,in light of the most recent competitive bids received just months prior.re agreed to complete the remaining seven roofs at the same pricing as initially quoted in the first phase of the contract.following discussion of each of the director viewpoints,a director made a motion to continue the r oofing p roject under the current contract with re,which was seconded and put to a vote.the motion passed with five votes in favor,including her vote,and one opposed.
in explaining the cost to complete the next phase of the roofing project,silveira further testified that although the unit pricing was the same,the total square footage of the seven additional buildings was larger,therefore the cost of the next phase was.additionally,during the process of reroofing,there were several problems,including one building that had significant damage to the main support beam,which cost an additional to remedy.thus,the total amount of the roofing project at this point was.
the complaint also alleged there was retaliation by one or more director defendants,on the one hand,against one or more plaintiffs or members of fvhoa,on the other hand.the complaint specifically alleged silveira,at all times relevant the president of fvhoa,retaliated against mcdonald after he joined the board in november and became its treasurer.with respect to retaliation against fvhoa members,the complaint alleged when a member raised concerns about whether fvhoa money should be maintained in an bank as opposed to a california bank,the member received a cease and desist letter from contracted legal counsel of the board.the complaint provided other examples of such alleged retaliation by director defendants,including in connection with a water project undertaken by the board 
in addition to not following proper bidding procedures,as summarized ante,the complaint alleged that director defendants refused to allow the board secretary to take verbatim transcripts of meetings of the fvhoa because they d id not want an accurate record made of their actions and decisions that director defendants instead had empowered ark lcc to produce minutes of the fvhoa b oard meetings,rather than the s ecretary and that director defendants allowed ark lcc to impose onerous default fees on members of the fvhoa.
prayer for relief and refinement of dispute 
as noted,the complaint consisted of a single cause of action for declaratory relief.however,the prayer for relief sought a declaration as follows under the fvhoa governing documents on nine different subject matters 
that at least three bids are required before the fvhoa can award contracts in material amounts 
that proper bidding procedures must be followed before awarding contracts,including the contracts for the manager and roofing projects 
that the secretary may make a verbatim record of what is said at the fvhoa board meetings 
that the secretary is the officer charged with the duty of ensuring the accuracy of the minutes before they are submitted to the fvhoa board 
contactors doing business with the fvhoa and fvhoa members should be free of conflicts of interests 
the fvhoa should not enter into contracts based upon former employees using confidential information obtained while at friars village 
that fvhoa board members should not disclose confidential information of the fvhoa with machale as agent for ark llc 
that the fvhoa treasurer should not be retaliated against by the m ajority b lock and machale because he raised legitimate concerns about the fvhoa reserve deficiency,and raised ways of reducing fvhoa costs and 
that the fvhoa or defendants machale or ark llc not be permitted to retaliate against association members for their lawful public participation or questions of their board.
perhaps because their complaint sought declaratory relief on so many broad subject matters or because the trial court at the hearing on the motion found plaintiffs complaint was not a model of clarity,on appeal plaintiffs argue that director defendants seek to evade a requested judicial declaration on the following two subject matters the fvhoa board has to obtain bids for fvhoa projects involving hundreds of thousands of dollars,and the fvhoa can keep verbatim notes with regard to the bidding issue,as relevant here plaintiffs on appeal further argued that the dispute that forms the basis of the case arose in connection with the roofing contract and the contract with the fvhoa manager.
as noted,the trial court denied the special motion to strike of director defendants.
discussion 
guiding principles 
a court employs a analysis in determining whether a claim should be stricken under the statute,subd.b.in the first step,the defendant bears the initial burden of making a prima facie showing that the claim aris es from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech.see damon ocean hills journalism club th,damon.
subdivision e of section provides that an act in furtherance of a person right of petition or free speech under subdivision b of section includes,as relevant here,any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest,or any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.
if the defendant meets this threshold burden,in the second step the burden then shifts to the plaintiff to establish that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim,subd.b see kleveland siegel wolensky,llp th,kleveland.
under section,subdivision b,the trial court in making these determinations considers the pleadings,and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is based.citation.for purposes of an motion,t he court considers the pleadings and evidence submitted by both sides,but does not weigh credibility or compare the weight of the evidence.rather,the court responsibility is to accept as true the evidence favorable to the plaintiff citation.kleveland,supra,th at.these determinations are legal questions,and we review the record de novo.damon,supra,th at.
threshold burden 
as noted,a defendant can meet the burden of making a threshold showing that a claim arises from protected activity by demonstrating the act or acts underlying the plaintiff claim falls within one of the four categories identified in section,subdivision e.city of cotati cashman cal th.
public forum 
for purposes of the third category in subdivision e of section,a public forum is traditionally defined as a place that is open to the public where information is freely exchanged.damon,supra,th at.this court in damon concluded the board meetings of a homeowners association constituted a public forum within the meaning of the statute because they serve a function similar to that of a governmental body.as our supreme court has recognized,owners of planned development units comprise a little democratic subsociety citations.in exchange for the benefits of common ownership,the residents elect a board and delegate powers to this board.this delegation concerns not only activities conducted in the common areas,but also extends to life within the confines of the home itself.citation.a homeowners association board is in effect a entity paralleling in almost every case the powers,duties,and responsibilities of a municipal government.ibid.
furthermore,b ecause of a homeowners association board broad powers and the number of individuals potentially affected by a board actions,the legislature has mandated that boards hold open meetings and allow the members to speak publicly at the meetings.citations.these provisions parallel california open meeting laws regulating government officials,agencies and boards.citation.both statutory schemes mandate open governance meetings,with notice,agenda and minutes requirements,and strictly limit closed executive sessions.damon,supra,th at.
we concluded in damon that the alleged defamatory statements made by the defendants about the plaintiff during a duly noticed board meeting met the statutory definition of a public forum as provided in subdivision e of section.damon,supra,th at.
much like the board of directors of the homeowners association in damon,the fvhoa board necessarily functioned similar to a body it promulgated and enforced policies and rules,and voted on and approved projects,that directly affected the lives of fvhoa members who lived in the townhouses that comprised friars village.
what more,the acts of director defendants that are the primary focus of plaintiffs complaint occurred in,or were made in connection with,meetings of the board as it was conducting board business.this included director defendants alleged failure to obtain at least three bids with respect to the roofing project and the renewal of the ark llc management contract and their refusal to allow the board secretary to take verbatim board minutes.on this record,we therefore independently conclude the meetings of the board in which director defendants allegedly engaged in such wrongful conduct constituted a public forum within the meaning of subdivision e of section.
issue of public interest 
the definition of public interest within the meaning of the statute has been broadly construed to include not only governmental matters,but also private conduct that impacts a broad segment of society that affects a community in a manner similar to that of a governmental entity.citations.m atters of public interest include activities that involve private persons and entities,especially when a large,powerful organization may impact the lives of many individuals.damon,supra,th at.
here,we independently conclude the acts of director defendants that are the principal thrust or gravamen see martinez metabolife,th,of plaintiffs complaint as more precisely defined by plaintiffs on appeal concerned matters of public interest within the meaning of subdivision e of section.indeed,director defendants decisionmaking process and debate in approving both the roofing project,which affected multiple buildings in friars village,and the ark llc management contract,which management entity was responsible for the operations of fvhoa and the friars village community,impacted a broad segment,if not all,of fvhoa members.see,country side villas homeowners ivie th,noting a homeowner complaints about the actions of a homeowners association board in connection with the repair and replacement of balconies and shingle siding were matters of public interest within the meaning of section because,even if not all of the members balconies and siding needed repair or replacement,the board decision affected all members of the association as the expenses to make these repairs would be borne by all cabrera alam th,noting a defendant statements at a homeowners association meeting in which the defendant was seeking reelection to the board of directors of the association involved protected activity because such statements concerned an issue of public interest,namely,the qualifications of a candidate for office in the association.
plaintiffs contend their declaratory relief claim does not implicate section,subdivision e because this law applies to statements,not actions.in support of this contention,plaintiffs principally rely on talega maintenance standard pacific th talega.
there,the plaintiff homeowners association sued two developers for construction defects with respect to certain trails that were badly damaged during rains in and again in.of significance here,the suit also named three former employees of one of the developers who,upon formation of the board,were appointed to represent the interests of the developer.the three former employees then comprised a majority of the board.in,these three board members represented that the homeowners association,as opposed to the developers,were responsible for the damage to the trails.the complaint alleged these three board members then knew,but failed to disclose,that under the relevant controlling documents,the d evelopers were responsible for the cost of repairs.talega,supra,th at.
in,when the trails were again damaged by heavy rains,the board of the homeowners association was then comprised of independent members.talega,supra,th at.as a result,the board of directors hired its own consultants who,after investigation,determined for the first time that the d evelopers were bound forever to provide repairs to the t rails,that the t rails were not actually completed,and that the t rails failures were likely the result of construction defects.id.at.in response,the plaintiff homeowners association sued the developers and the three former employees of the developer for breach of fiduciary duty,fraud,constructive fraud and negligence.as relevant here,the three developer board members moved under section to dismiss all four causes of action.talega,at.
in affirming the trial court denial of the motion of the developer board members,the talega court noted it could immediately rule out all but the fraud cause of action because the thrust or gravamen of the homeowners association action against the developer board members was principally based on withholding information and improperly directing the expenditure of funds,which acts,the court further noted,were not written or oral statements within the meaning of subdivisions e,and of section.talega,supra,th at.
in rejecting the developer board members argument their act of voting at board meetings in connection with the trails constituted protected activity,the talega court noted voting could be,but was not,per se protected activity.talega,supra,th at.the court concluded the mere fact the developer board members had voted did not implicate the protections afforded by section because the claims of the homeowners association arose from the act of spending money in violation of the d eveloper b oard m embers fiduciary duties.the allegations in the complaint concerning the breach of fiduciary duty cause of action,for example,include no mention of voting.while the expenditure of money may have been precipitated by a vote,t he vote was merely incidental.id.at,italics added.
the talega court found the issue of whether the fraud cause of action was subject to the statute to be a closer question.talega,supra,th at.nonetheless,and,as relevant here,it ultimately determined the issue of who was going to pay for repairing the trails was not an issue of public interest within the meaning of subdivision e of section because that issue was not subject to any controversy,dispute,or discussion when the developer board members in represented that the homeowners association was responsible to pay the costs of repair.id.at.
in contrast,the talega court noted there had been an ongoing controversy in this court decision in damon,inasmuch as the alleged defamatory statements in damon concerned the decision whether to continue to be or to switch to a professional management company talega,supra,th at and the general manager competency to manage the association ibid.the talega court further noted the residents of the homeowners association in damon were split into two camps on these issues.ibid.
talega is factually and legally distinguishable from the instant case.as we discuss post,we conclude it is significant that plaintiffs and not fvhoa brought this action against director defendants,which is quite unlike the facts of talega in which the complaint against the developer board members was brought by the homeowners association.moreover,talega involved allegations that the three developer board members were appointed to the newly created board of the homeowners association to represent the developer interests.here,in contrast,director defendants were each volunteers and,with the exception of nielsen who was appointed,were duly elected to serve on the fvhoa board for staggered terms.in addition,director defendants were each fvhoa members and residents of friars village as such,and unlike the developer board members in talega,director defendants presumably were representing the interests of the community when serving on the board.
further,the acts complained of by plaintiffs in the instant case involved director defendants decisionmaking on public issues,the roofing project and the ark llc management contract that divided the board,as clearly indicated by the instant lawsuit.in contrast,the complaint in talega involved allegations the three developer board members in withheld information on what was then a noncontroversial issue pending before the board of the homeowners association regarding the party responsible for repair of the damaged trails.talega,supra,th at.
finally,and perhaps most importantly,although the three developer board members in talega argued that their votes to expend money to repair the trails constituted protected activity within the meaning of the statute,the talega court found this vote was merely incidental to the gravamen of the complaint,which concerned their violation of fiduciary duties.see talega,supra,th at.
unlike the facts of talega,here it is clear from the substance of plaintiffs declaratory relief claim that director defendants acts in voting were not merely incidental to the allegations of wrongful conduct asserted against the majority block.to the contrary,plaintiffs allege director defendants engaged in such wrongful conduct as a result of how they voted in board meetings on public issues affecting fvhoa members.see navellier sletten cal th,noting the statute definitional focus is not the form of the plaintiff cause of action but,rather,the defendant activity that gives rise to his or her asserted lability and whether that activity constitutes protected speech or petitioning italics added.as such,for this separate reason we conclude talega provides no guidance in our case.
conversely,we conclude the case of schwarzburd kensington police protection community services district board th schwarzburd informs our decision in the instant case.in schwarzburd,a local board as well as three individual board members were named as respondents in a writ petition brought by two other board members challenging the salary of,and a merit bonus awarded to,a police chief.id.at.the schwarzburd court followed the case of san ramon valley fire protection dist.contra costa county employees retirement association th san ramon in concluding that the petition did not arise from protected activity insofar as it targeted the board as an entity.schwarzburd,at.
however,as particularly relevant here,the schwarzburd court also concluded that the three individual board members who voted in favor of the salary increase and merit bonus were protected by subdivision e of section schwarzburd,supra,th at.in so concluding,the court noted that the three individual board members were sued by the two other members for allegedly violating board policy by voting in a manner inconsistent with that policy id.at,and that the three board members were not sued simply because they voted,but based on how they voted and expressed themselves at the b oard meeting ibid.as a result,the schwarzburd court declined to follow donovan dan murphy foundation th donovan on which plaintiffs herein also rely,which held t he mere act of voting is insufficient to demonstrate that conduct challenged in a cause of action arose from protected activity.schwarzburd,at,quoting donovan,at.
in focusing on whether the conduct of the three board members implicated section,the court in schwarzburd noted that when the trial court questioned legal counsel of the two board members regarding why they had sued the three individuals when they could get the relief they were looking for by just suing the d istrict,petitioners attorney responded,those three individuals violated the procedures and the rules.he also admitted i do think there any additional advantage there,any strategic advantage.petitioners have not alerted us to any additional justifications for the decision to sue the three individual board members footnote omitted.thus,while they could have sued the d istrict directly to challenge the validity of the chief of police contract,they elected not to do so,lending support to defendants assertion that petitioners motivation in filing this lawsuit was,at least in part,to intrude upon the first amendment rights of the individual b oard members.this is the kind of conduct section was intended to discourage footnote omitted.schwarzburd,supra,th at,fns.omitted italics added.
just recently,our high court in city of montebello vasquez cal th vasquez cited schwarzburd approvingly when it concluded that votes cast in favor of a hauling contract by three former councilmembers and a former city administrator were protected activity under section the vasquez court noted schwarzburd was consistent with its reasoning that votes taken after a public hearing qualify as acts in furtherance of constitutionally protected activity.and schwarzburd,like this case,demonstrates that elected officials may assert the protection of section when sued over how they voted without chilling citizens exercise of their right to challenge government action by suing the public entity itself.vasquez,at.
relying on vasquez,schwarzburd and san ramon as guidance,we conclude director defendants voting at board meetings on both the roofing project,including the next phase of that project,and on the ark llc management contract,were acts in furtherance of their right to free speech made in connection with a public issue and,thus,were protected under subdivision e of section 
in fact,the instant case when considered in light of schwarzburd provides an even more compelling example of why an individual board member vote on a public issue implicates his or her right to free speech under section unlike schwarzburd,where the local board or entity was at least named as a defendant in the action,here plaintiffs purposely omitted the entity i
