this case presents an blessedly in which both the court and the prosecutor erred,but defendant is entitled to no relief.we publish it because it seems to be that rare cautionary tale with different lessons for all the parties.
chuong appeals from the trial court order declaring him a ward of the court pursuant to welfare and institutions code section.the order was based upon the determination he was culpable for three counts of assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury and with a deadly weapon,in violation of penal code section,subdivision a.chuong argues the order must be reversed because the prosecutor misrepresented his readiness for the jurisdictional hearing,and informed the court only after the hearing was underway that his key witness,the only one who could tie chuong to the assault,was unavailable to testify for at least another week.chuong argues that this conduct effectively denied him his right to a speedy trial.additionally,chuong suggests the court abused its discretion when it subsequently granted the prosecutor request for an recess in the hearing until the witness became available.
we agree with both contentions.however,whether the circumstances in this case are evaluated as a speedy trial violation or as an abuse of discretion in granting a midtrial recess,chuong must establish that the error amounted to a miscarriage of justice to justify a reversal of the court jurisdictional order.the only prejudice he asserts is that additional admissible evidence,crucial to petitioner case,was ultimately produced after the lengthy recess period.that does not constitute a miscarriage of justice.consequently,the jurisdictional order is affirmed.
the petition to declare chuong a ward of the court was based upon his alleged participation in a group assault of three teenaged boys on january.the incident was sparked by an apparently insulting comment made by andy le,a teenaged male walking along a sidewalk with two friends.spotting a honda automobile passing by,he characterized its occupants as fob,which we are told stands for fresh off the boat.presumably,they heard him and took umbrage,as the car immediately made a back toward the pedestrians.le and his friends took off running and sought refuge in an apartment complex.the honda followed,however,and the three teenagers were soon confronted by approximately eight individuals who spoke vietnamese.
some of the eight began assaulting le,and when his friend john tran sought to help,the group set upon him as well.one of the assailants used his belt,with a heavy buckle on one end,as a weapon.the buckle was used to hit tran in the face,causing a cut which required stitches to repair.the third friend,kevin luong,was also struck in the head with the belt buckle.
neither le,tran nor luong identified chuong as being among the attackers.nonetheless,tran did subsequently identify an individual named thanh nguyen as one of them.officer james kingsmill of the westminster police department subsequently visited nguyen home to question him about the incident.
when kingsmill arrived at nguyen home,he saw six asian males standing outside.one of the six was chuong.kingsmill questioned chuong about whether he had been involved in the fight on january.chuong admitted being present,but initially denied any involvement.after further questioning,chuong acknowledged that he had held back two of the three victims while the third presumably le was being beaten.based upon that admitted involvement,the instant wardship petition was filed against chuong on april.
on april,counsel was appointed for chuong,and the pretrial hearing and jurisdictional hearing were set for april,and may,respectively.thereafter,the jurisdictional hearing was continued several times,with chuong waiving time in each instance.the matter was ultimately set for a jurisdictional hearing on september.it then trailed,without any additional waiver of time,until september,the sixth day of the grace period identified in welfare and institutions code section,subdivision e.on that date,the parties announced they were ready to proceed,and stipulated to allowing a court commissioner to sit as a temporary judge in the case.the hearing commenced in the afternoon.
the prosecutor offered the testimony of two of the victims during that first afternoon.the next day,september,the hearing again occupied only the afternoon session.the prosecutor offered the testimony of the third victim,plus the police officer who had responded to the initial call regarding the assault.none of those four witnesses identified chuong as being present,let alone involved in the incident.
after completing his examination of the police officer who initially responded,the prosecutor informed the court that although he had one more witness,officer kingsmill,we have heard from him i unsure of the status.the court inquired whether kingsmill was under subpoena,and the prosecutor responded yes,i believe he is.he explained we ca get ahold of him today i believe he is involved in a special assignment.the prosecutor asked to trail the case to september nine days hence,to know for sure that he is available.
chuong counsel objected,noting the case had a estimate,and the defense had all its witnesses under subpoena and ready to testify in accordance with that expectation.she also noted that if officer kingsmill was in fact on a special assignment,then notice of that could have been provided to us to work out something at that point,but to just bring it up on the date he is supposed to be called and ask for a continuance is absolutely not okay with us.
counsel pointed out that chuong has a right to have his trial finished.it was a estimate,and to trail it over a week for a trial is are objecting,and the prosecutor answered ready yesterday when we began this trial 
the court,noting it was already in the afternoon,stated he would give the prosecutor until the next day to produce officer kingsmill since this officer is on special detail,i will give you to tomorrow.the prosecutor then stated that kingsmill may not be available the next day,and pointed out that the petitioner had actually been ready to proceed back on august,but that chuong had obtained a continuance which appeared,in retrospect,to have been unnecessary.the court responded your officer is under subpoena.he decided that something else is more important than this.that the decision that he has to make.there is no good cause to continue because he is not injured,he is have heard anything that establishes good cause for him not to be here.italics added.
when the parties reconvened the next day,the prosecutor informed the court that kingsmill had not been subpoenaed,was not present,and would not be available to testify until september.the court inquired as to why kingsmill was unavailable,but the prosecutor could not explain.instead,he chose again to focus the court on the fact that the petitioner would have been ready to proceed on august,and that although kingsmill claimed to be unavailable on that date,he had agreed to make himself available for the of august.the prosecutor again expressed skepticism about the necessity of the continuance obtained by chuong on that date,which had caused the hearing to be rescheduled to september.nonetheless,a court liaison purportedly trailed kingsmill from the to september and even though the officer was not under subpoena,he nevertheless made himself available on the.
the prosecutor then acknowledged that kingsmill was actually unavailable to testify at any time after september,but explained that the officer unavailability after the was not communicated to me until yesterday when i called in to have him be here yesterday afternoon for the trial.despite chuong further objection,the court was persuaded to grant the recess.
when the hearing resumed eight days later,kingsmill testified,offering the only evidence tying chuong to the incident.at the conclusion of the hearing,the court found chuong culpable for all three counts of assault.one of the three counts,relating to the most seriously injured victim,was found to be a felony,while the other two counts were reduced to misdemeanors on
