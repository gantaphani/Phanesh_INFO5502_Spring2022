standard of review 
in evaluating the extent,if any,to which state law preempts the ordinance,we must interpret both the ordinance and relevant state statutes.the construction of statutes and the ascertainment of the legislature intent involve questions of law and our review is de novo.bravo vending city of rancho mirage th,d bravo vending.
ii.principles governing state law preemption 
recently,in city of stockton cal th,d,our supreme court restated the general principles relevant to determining whether a local ordinance is preempted by a state statute 
under article xi,section of the california constitution,a county or city may make and enforce within its limits all local,police,sanitary,and other ordinances and regulations not in conflict with general state laws.if otherwise valid local legislation conflicts with state law,it is preempted by such law and is void.citations.a conflict exists if the local legislation duplicates,contradicts,or enters an area fully occupied by general law,either expressly or by legislative implication.citations.citations.
a local ordinance duplicates state law when it is coextensive with state law.citations.
a local ordinance contradicts state law when it is inimical to or can not be reconciled with state law.citations.
a local ordinance enters a field fully occupied by state law in either of two the legislature expressly manifest s its intent to occupy the legal area or when the legislature impliedly occupies the field.citations,supra,cal th at,d.
the legislature impliedly occupies the field in three situations w hen the subject matter has been so fully and completely covered by general law as to clearly indicate that it has become exclusively a matter of state concern the subject matter has been partially covered by general law couched in such terms as to indicate clearly that a paramount state concern will not tolerate further or additional local action or the subject matter has been partially covered by general law,and the subject is of such a nature that the adverse effect of a local ordinance on the transient citizens of the state outweighs the possible benefit to the locality.citation,supra,cal th at,d.
where the legislature has adopted statutes governing a particular subject matter,its intent with regard to occupying the field to the exclusion of all local regulation is not to be measured alone by the language used but by the whole purpose and scope of the legislative scheme.citations.state regulation of a subject may be so complete and detailed as to indicate an intent to preclude local regulation.citation.whenever the legislature has seen fit to adopt a general scheme for the regulation of a particular subject,the entire control over whatever phases of the subject are covered by state legislation ceases as far as local legislation is concerned.citations.when a local ordinance is identical to a state statute,it is clear that the field sought to be covered by the ordinance has already been occupied by state law.citation,supra,cal th at,d.
appellant contends the legislature has impliedly,fully occupied the field of underage drinking,leaving no room for supplementary or complementary local legislation.she also contends the ordinance is coextensive with and therefore duplicates state law in regulating the blood alcohol content of persons under age in public.appellant has the burden of demonstrating state law preemption.big creek lumber county of santa cruz cal th,d,big creek.w hen local government regulates in an area over which it traditionally has exercised control,california courts will presume,absent a clear indication of preemptive intent from the legislature,that such regulation is not preempted by state statute.citation.id.at,d,accord,supra,cal th at,d.the presumption against preemption accords with our more general understanding that it is not to be presumed that the legislature in the enactment of statutes intends to overthrow principles of law unless such intention is made clearly to appear either by express declaration or by necessary implication.citations.big creek,at,d,fn.omitted.
iii.analysis 
a.the field is not fully occupied 
article xx,section of the california constitution provides in relevant part the state of california shall have the exclusive right and power to license and regulate the manufacture,sale,purchase,possession and transportation of alcoholic beverages within the state,and shall have the exclusive right and power to regulate the importation into and exportation from the state,of alcoholic beverages the sale,furnishing,giving,or causing to be sold,furnished,or giving away of any alcoholic beverage to any person under the age of years is hereby prohibited,and no person shall sell,furnish,give,or cause to be sold,furnished,or given away any alcoholic beverage to any person under the age of years,and no person under the age of years shall purchase any alcoholic beverage.
in,people butler,d supp.butler considered whether state law preempted a fresno municipal ordinance prohibiting a person from drink ing any alcoholic beverage on any street,sidewalk,alley,highway or playground.butler noted that article xx,section of the california constitution expressly preempts the manufacture,sale,purchase,possession and transportation of alcoholic beverages but makes no mention of consumption,d supp.at.butler acknowledged that s tate laws,to be sure,have been adopted to regulate consumption under certain specific conditions and situations.id.at.listing examples from the and the bus.we do not believe that by the adoption of such selective laws,the legislature intended to say that it had covered all those areas wherein the consumption of alcoholic beverages might create police problems.id.at.
butler rejected each of the three bases for implied preemption.as to the first criterion,it found that regulation of consumption of alcoholic beverages as distinguished from possession,transportation,was,almost studiously,omitted,it seems,in article xx,section of the california constitution.as to the second criterion,the general laws relating to the consumption of alcoholic beverages are quite selective and limited in their application and demonstrate no comprehensive scheme to prohibit the consumption of liquor in situations where such consumption could reasonably be expected to create a police problem.as to the third criterion,there would appear to be nothing in a municipal ordinance regulating the consumption of alcoholic beverages on streets,malls,which would have any appreciable impact on the transient citizen to the degree that it would outweigh the benefit to a municipality in the control of such drinking.butler,supra,d supp.at.
