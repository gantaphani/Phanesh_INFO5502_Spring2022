background 
the nature of renteria claim is undisputed he contends that on december,while he was incarcerated in the chaderjian youth correctional facility,he was attacked and bitten by a correctional officer dog.
in may all further dates are to events in that year,renteria filed a petition in the superior court seeking an order t o p erpetuate t estimony p reserve e vidence relating to the event specifically,he sought to examine a videotape depicting the incident,and to preserve it for use in the event an action is subsequently filed.his petition states that he expects to be a plaintiff in an action based on a violation of civil rights,assault and battery,negligent supervision and training when he was attacked by a dog under the control of officers employed by the djj some capitalization omitted and that the action is expected to be filed against the state,djj and officers employed by djj for injuries and damages.renteria petition to preserve evidence was set for hearing on june.
on june,a deputy attorney general wrote a letter to renteria counsel,agreeing to preserve any videotape s relating to the incident without the need of a court order.
on july nine days after the deadline,renteria filed with the state victim compensation and government claims board an application to file a late claim against djj,asserting that his failure to file a claim within six months of the incident,by june as required by statute was due to mistake,inadvertence and excusable neglect,subd.b,in that a secretary in his attorney office removed the public entity statute of limitations from our calendaring system after receiving the letter from the deputy attorney general regarding our motion and petition to preserve evidence.
in support of his application,patricia ketchie,a secretary in the law firm acting as renteria counsel averred as follows one of my job duties is to input in our calendaring system all statute of limitations dates in all cases when a file is opened.this includes writing the statute in my hard calendar as well as inputting the date into our computer calendaring system.on june,our office received a letter dated june,from the attorney general office acknowledging receipt of our original notice of motion and petition as well as the amended notice of motion and petition and agreeing to preserve the evidence.upon receipt and review of said letter,i assumed that our paralegal had served the state of california with the governmental claim and thereafter removed a public entity statute of limitations from our calendaring system.the removal of said statute was done by checking the written entry in my hard calendar and checking the entry off in our computer calendaring system.paragraph numbers omitted.
alternatively,renteria styled his proposed claim as an amended claim,asserting that his petition to preserve evidence fulfilled all of the requirements and purposes of a claim and was,in fact,a claim so as to provide these public entities with sufficient information to enable them to adequately investigate claims and settle them,if appropriate,without the expenses of litigation.
the victim compensation and government claims board responded on august that it had received renteria application and had forwarded it to the affected state agencies for review and recommendation,after which renteria would be notified and the matter set for hearing.renteria never received any further communication and his application was deemed rejected,subd.c.
he then petitioned for judicial relief from the requirements of the claim presentation statutes on the ground that his failure to present the claim within the limitation period was excusable,subd.c because it was caused by a calendaring error or clerical error by the office of his attorney.
djj opposed renteria motion,arguing that his motion to preserve evidence did not satisfy the statutory claim filing requirements and the secretary mistake does not excuse his failure to file a timely claim.
following a hearing,the trial court denied renteria petition for leave to file a late claim against djj because there is no sufficient reason to justify the delay and rejected his alternative theory that the motion to preserve evidence substantially complied with the claim presentation requirement.
discussion 
california tort claims act the act authorizes limited governmental liability for injuries suffered as a result of the acts or omissions of public entities or their employees.the act establishes a uniform claims procedure,making the filing of a claim within a brief period of the injury a prerequisite to maintaining a suit for damages,munoz state of california th,d munoz.
under the act,a person who wishes to sue a public entity for money or damages based on a cause of action relating to personal injuries must first present a claim to the entity within six months of the date the cause of action accrues.the claim presentation requirement of section serves several purposes it gives the public entity prompt notice of a claim so it can investigate the strengths and weaknesses of the claim while the evidence is still fresh and the witnesses are available it affords opportunity for amicable adjustment,thereby avoiding expenditure of public funds in needless litigation and it informs the public entity of potential liability so it can better prepare for the upcoming fiscal year.munoz,supra,th at,d.
if the claim is not timely presented,an application for leave to present a late claim may be made within a reasonable time,not to exceed one year of the date the cause of action accrues.the board of the public entity has days to grant or deny the late claim application the application will be deemed denied if the board fails to act.if the application is denied,the claimant may petition the trial court for relief from the requirement of presentation of a timely filed claim as a precondition to bringing suit,subds.a,b.
