defendant struck his girlfriend baby less than a month hard that he broke three of her ribs.in case no,he pleaded guilty to felony child endangerment,subd.a,and he admitted a personal infliction of great bodily injury enhancement,subd.a.he was placed on probation,with jail time to be served on weekends.
when the baby was five months old,her mother left her with defendant one night so she could go to work.by the time she got back,the baby had two skull fractures,severe brain damage,and numerous other injuries.defendant threatened to kill the mother if she took the baby to the hospital.
as a result,in case no,a jury found defendant guilty on one count of felony child endangerment,subd.a,with an enhancement for personal infliction of great bodily injury on a child under five,subd.d,and on one count of attempting to make a criminal threat.two strike prior conviction allegations including the conviction in case no.were found true.defendant was sentenced to years to life in prison.
in case no,defendant probation was revoked,and he was sentenced to an additional six years in prison.
in the published portion of this opinion,we will hold that the trial court erred by ruling that the mother was not an accomplice because she did not have the specific intent necessary to be an aider and abettor.for instructional purposes,an accomplice includes a coperpetrator as well as an aider and abettor.there was substantial evidence that the mother,through her criminal negligence in leaving the baby with defendant,was a coperpetrator of defendant crime of felony child endangerment in fact,she had already pleaded guilty to felony child endangerment.thus,the trial court should have given accomplice instructions.we will also hold,however,that the error was harmless because the mother testimony was adequately corroborated.
in the nonpublished portion of this opinion,we find no other error.hence,we will affirm.
factual background 
melanie littlefield met defendant in september.she was pregnant at the time.in january,their relationship became first romantic,then sexual.
on may,littlefield gave birth to a daughter,named cree.she already had a son,named trevaughn.defendant was very attentive to the baby,as if she were his own.
a.the prior offense.
on may,littlefield told defendant he had to leave because the baby was there now and financially we were making it.defendant called his sister and asked her to come and pick him up.meanwhile,littlefield took a shower.she left the baby lying on the couch.while in the shower,she heard the baby crying like she was hurt.she ran into the living room.defendant was holding the baby.the onesie the baby had been wearing was on the floor.defendant said the baby had rolled off the couch.
littlefield took the baby to the hospital.she asked the doctors to take.the baby only apparent symptoms,however,were vomiting which the doctors attributed to a previous bout of meningitis and resulting dehydration.after an external examination,they told littlefield to take the baby home.
the next morning,the baby was still vomiting,so littlefield took her back to the hospital.there,the baby was seen by david tito.he ordered,which revealed that the baby had three broken ribs,on the left side.there was a space around her brain that was potentially consistent with the healing stage of shaken baby syndrome.
according to tito,it physically impossible for a baby to roll or roll off the couch under their own power.moreover,the baby broken ribs could not have been caused by falling off a couch they would have required a fall of at least five or six feet.
both children were immediately removed from littlefield custody.defendant and littlefield were arrested.littlefield was charged with child abuse,but the charges were dropped almost immediately.defendant pleaded guilty to child abuse and admitted personally inflicting great bodily injury.
b.the current offense.
in july,defendant was released from jail.he began visiting littlefield again.littlefield kept asking him if he had hurt the baby,but he insisted that the baby had fallen off the couch.at her request,he swore on a bible.after that,she believed him.
in september,littlefield regained custody of her children.she had to agree n ever to allow defendant around my kids.nevertheless,in late september or early october,he started visiting her apartment.on the first visit,he wanted to see trevaughn,and she let him.the next time,she let him watch the baby for to minutes while she took trevaughn to school.on his third visit,he looked after both children for about an hour while she went to the department of social services.
on october,defendant watched both children while littlefield went to work.the baby had been diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux disorder,which was causing her to vomit a little,and she had a cold.when littlefield left,however,at or,the baby was alert and responsive.
while littlefield was on a break,sometime before,she phoned home.defendant told her the children were okay.when she persisted in questioning him,he told her to shut up and get off the phone so he could play a video game.
littlefield got home sometime after.she found the baby asleep on the couch.when littlefield tried to pick her up,defendant told her to leave the baby alone and go to bed.about five minutes later,when he came to bed,he brought the baby with him.littlefield tried to wake her,but she was responding.she would stay awake.
littlefield said,i have to take my baby to the hospital.defendant responded,you are going no where sic,man.i am not being responsible.i ai even supposed to be here.if i go to jail,i will kill you all.
littlefield tried to call cynthia wallace,who was her friend and neighbor as well as defendant.defendant grabbed the phone and yanked out the cord.littlefield then tried to call wallace on a cordless phone it rang once before defendant grabbed that phone,too.wallace,however,had caller id and returned the call.
wallace testified that she got littlefield call after.she arrived at the apartment minutes later.at that point,littlefield testified,defendant completely changed,suddenly urging her to take the baby to the hospital.was a nurse the baby.the baby reflexes were not functioning.her pupils were fixed.there were two knots on her head.wallace asked,did the baby fall littlefield turned and looked at defendant he said no.
defendant left before the paramedics arrived,saying again that he was not supposed to be there and adding that he did want no one to think that he did anything.he went to a friend apartment.he said he had had an argument with his girlfriend,so his friend let him spend the night.
after the baby was admitted to the hospital,she was treated by rebecca piantini,a specialist in child abuse cases.the baby was unconscious and unable to breathe on her own.she had two skull fractures.blood vessels surrounding her brain were torn and bleeding.nerve cells throughout her brain had been ripped apart.the retinas of both eyes were bleeding.she had a punctured lung,two broken legs,and possibly a fractured left wrist.there were bruises on her forehead and abdomen.
there were signs of previous bleeding around the brain that was in the process of healing.also,in addition to the ribs that had been broken in the earlier incident,there were areas that were suspicious for healing fractures on the right side as well.
in piantini opinion,the baby injuries could only be the result of child abuse.one of the skull fractures,in particular,would have required as much force as a car accident or a fall from a building headfirst onto cement.the fact that both broken leg bones were sheared off at the tip was highly specific for child abuse.the bleeding in the back of the eye indicated shaken baby syndrome.the abdominal bruises were in areas where bruises do just happen accidentally.
after a beating like th is,symptoms would have shown up right away in less than an hour.
the next morning,the police went to defendant friend apartment.they caught defendant trying to escape out a rear window.
when the police interviewed defendant,he told them littlefield left for work at.while she was out,the baby was okay.there was no one there besides defendant,the baby,and trevaughn.littlefield got back at or midnight.defendant was certain littlefield would not have hurt the baby.when asked who could have done it,he said,i do know.
littlefield pleaded guilty to child endangerment.her plea was based on letting defendant be around the baby,not on her personally abusing the baby.she was sentenced to one year in jail.
failure to instruct regarding accomplice testimony 
defendant contends the trial court erred by ruling,as a matter of law,that littlefield was not an accomplice,and hence by refusing to give accomplice instructions.
additional factual and procedural background.
defense counsel requested accomplice instructions,arguing that littlefield was an accomplice as a matter of law.the prosecutor disagreed,arguing a n accomplice has to share the criminal purpose of the coparticipant she can be criminally negligent without any intention that the crime that defendant committed be committed.
the trial court responded in looking at the caljics for guidance,caljic,which is criminal intent,it is necessary to make one an accomplice.merely attempting to or aiding or assisting in the commission of a crime without knowledge of the unlawful purpose of the perpetrator and without the intent or purpose of committing,encouraging,or facilitating the commission of the crime is not criminal and i think that exactly what we have here.for her to be an accomplice,she would have to intend that she gave control of the baby or left the baby in defendant possession so he could abuse the baby.
the trial court then ruled t he facts are clear and undisputed that she was not a n accomplice as a matter of law.so i do think the accomplice instructions are appropriate and not warranted by the evidence,so they wo come in.
if there is evidence that a witness against the defendant is an accomplice,the trial court must give jury instructions defining accomplice,caljic.it also must instruct that an accomplice incriminating testimony must be viewed with caution,caljic and must be corroborated,caljic.if the evidence establishes that the witness is an accomplice as a matter of law,it must so instruct the jury,caljic otherwise,it must instruct the jury to determine whether the witness is an accomplice,caljic.people hayes cal th,and,fn,d,see also people zapien cal th,d.
the reason most often cited in support of these instructions is that an accomplice is inherently untrustworthy because he or she usually testif ies in the hope of favor or the expectation of immunity.citation.in addition,an accomplice may try to shift blame to the defendant in an effort to minimize his or her own culpability.citation.people tobias cal th,d,quoting people coffey cal.
for instructional purposes,an accomplice is a person who is liable to prosecution for the identical offense charged against the defendant on trial in the cause in which the testimony of the accomplice is given.citations.people arias cal th,d,italics added,quoting.in order to be an accomplice,the witness must be chargeable with the crime as a principal citation and not merely as an accessory after the fact citations.citation.people sully cal d.principals include those who directly commit the act constituting the offense as well as those who aid and abet in its commission.accordingly,perpetrators are accomplices within the meaning of section citations people belton cal d,fn.omitted accord,people gordon cal d.
t he dividing line between the actual perpetrator and the aider and abettor is often blurred.it is often an oversimplification to describe one person as the actual perpetrator and the other as the aider and abettor.when two or more persons commit a crime together,both may act in part as the actual perpetrator and in part as the aider and abettor of the other,who also acts in part as an actual perpetrator.people mccoy cal th,d.moreover,the aider and abettor guilt for the intended crime is not entirely vicarious.rather,that guilt is based on a combination of the direct perpetrator acts and the aider and abettor own acts and own mental state.id.at,d.
the trial court relied on the general principle that a n aider and abettor must act with knowledge of the criminal purpose of the perpetrator and with an intent or purpose either of committing,or of encouraging or facilitating commission of,the offense.citation.people mendoza cal th,d,italics omitted,quoting people beeman cal d.even the supreme court has said that an accomplice must act with such knowledge and intent,people prettyman cal th,d.as long as the issue is vicarious criminal liability,and not the duty to give accomplice instructions,this is all well and good.
under penal code section,however,accomplice is not synonymous with aider and abettor a perpetrator can be an accomplice.and,depending on the nature of the crime charged against the defendant,a perpetrator may be able to commit it without intending to do so,and without any knowledge that the defendant intends to do so.for example,the accomplice may be the perpetrator of a crime that does not require specific intent,whereas the defendant is the aider and abettor or coperpetrator.
here,littlefield could commit felony child endangerment without any intent that defendant commit it.this crime requires circumstances or conditions likely to produce great bodily harm or death,subd.a.it can be committed by both active and passive conduct,child abuse by direct assault and child endangering by extreme neglect.citation.people sargent cal th,d,quoting people smith cal d.
littlefield committed felony child endangerment,if at all,by inflicting harm,by leaving the baby with defendant.under these circumstances,felony child endangerment requires at least criminal negligence.people valdez cal th,d.under the criminal negligence standard,knowledge of the risk is determined by an objective test i f a reasonable person in defendant position would have been aware of the risk involved,then defendant is presumed to have had such an awareness.citations.id.at,d,quoting williams garcetti cal th,d.
as the trial court correctly found,there was no evidence that littlefield intended defendant to hurt the baby.it follows that she did not aid and abet the commission of felony child endangerment.nevertheless,there was evidence that she committed felony child endangerment as a coperpetrator.as she did not directly inflict the harm,she did not have to know that leaving the baby with defendant could result in great bodily harm,as long as a reasonable person would have known.defendant had inflicted great bodily injury on the baby before.littlefield had agreed,for the protection of her children,not to let defendant near them.also,the baby had older,healing injuries of which littlefield inferably might have been aware.the jury could find that a reasonable person would have known that leaving the baby with defendant presented a risk of great bodily harm.see people james d.where there was evidence that mother knew the defendant was abusing her daughter but failed to protect her,mother was accomplice to the defendant felony child endangerment.finally,the likelihood that defendant would inflict great bodily harm was precisely what made littlefield criminally negligent.she created a danger to the baby defendant escalated this same danger to the level of actual injuries.
accordingly,there was sufficient evidence that defendant and littlefield were coperpetrators of the same crime.and if littlefield was a coperpetrator,then she was an accomplice.this is true even though she was not an aider and abettor,even though she did not intend defendant to commit the crime.
at oral argument,the people argued for the first time that littlefield committed felony child endangerment if at all the moment she left her baby in defendant care even if she had come back and found the baby unharmed,she would still have been guilty of felony child endangerment.thus,she and defendant could not be found guilty of the identical offense.at our request,both sides filed supplemental briefs on this point.
the people argument,though appealing,is flawed.felony child endangerment is a crime.see people culuko th,d fourth,div.two.moreover,as we
