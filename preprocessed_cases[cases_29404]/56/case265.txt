appellant appeals from the decision of the trial court rejecting his request to seal his juvenile records.he contends that the court erred by considering the seriousness of his offenses and abused its discretion by not finding him rehabilitated.moreover,appellant argues that the application of section,subdivision a of the welfare and institutions code violated his right to due process,in that the statute is unconstitutionally vague we conclude that the court did not err in declining to seal the records of the appellant,and therefore affirm.
factual and procedural background 
appellant was born in october.his juvenile records consisted of at least incidents.we state only the significant facts.when he was years old,appellant was arrested for petty theft in violation of penal code section.he was counseled and released.when he was years old,he was arrested for disturbing the peace in violation of penal code section.he was counseled and released as well.a couple of months later,on october,he committed three counts of attempted robbery in violation of penal code sections,and one count of battery causing serious bodily injury in violation of penal code section,subdivision d.in this incident,appellant and three other individuals took part in an attempted robbery.appellant and his companions surrounded the victims and demanded that the victims empty their pockets.when one of the victims refused the command,appellant punched him on the left side of his face for those offenses,he was ordered home on probation for six months.during this time,appellant committed a series of infractions for which he was fined.they are identified as lsmc violations,which appear to have been traffic related.on appeal,the attorney general offers no further explanation of these violations.the total amount of fines exceeded.
appellant juvenile probation ended on october.he turned in october.shortly thereafter,appellant petitioned the court to have his juvenile records sealed pursuant to section,subdivision a.four days prior to filing the petition,appellant paid,an amount he believed sufficient to satisfy his outstanding fines.the court initially ordered the records sealed on december.however,the court subsequently received information that appellant had not fully paid his fines and vacated its order.then the court proceeded to a hearing in order to consider once again whether to seal appellant juvenile records 
at the hearing,although it appeared that appellant might have been given incorrect information regarding the total amount of his outstanding fines,the court accepted the as payment in full.during the hearing,appellant presented evidence of his rehabilitation in the form of three letters.two were from a counselor at antelope valley youth build.the first indicated that appellant had completed his community service,and the second was a generic letter of recommendation.finally,a pastor who had mentored appellant for the past months wrote a letter attesting to appellant good character.appellant provided proof that he had attended and finished high school,was currently enrolled in a community college class,and wanted to join the united states air force.the air force recruiter advised appellant to attempt to have his records sealed.
the court weighed the evidence of the rehabilitation proffered by appellant but declined to seal his juvenile records.the court was concerned that appellant october,attempted offenses were serious and insufficient time had elapsed since the crime.the court concluded appellant was not yet rehabilitated,but left open the possibility of sealing the records after more time had passed.appellant filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
the complementary pillars of juvenile justice 
the juvenile delinquency system is not concerned merely with punishing juvenile offenders.instead,the court is also concerned with rehabilitating them.in re carl th.the purpose of the juvenile court system is set forth in section.minors under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court as a consequence of delinquent conduct shall,in conformity with the interests of public safety and protection,receive care,treatment,and guidance that is consistent with their best interest,that holds them accountable for their behavior,and that is appropriate for their circumstances,subd.b.the minor rehabilitation and the concomitant protection of public safety are important considerations in the juvenile justice system.in re carl,at.
the court s discretion to seal juvenile records 
section,subdivision a grants the court discretion to seal the juvenile delinquency records unless the juvenile has committed an offense specified under section,subdivision b.appellant has not committed any of the enumerated offenses that would render him statutorily ineligible to have his records sealed.section,subdivision a provides that an eligible juvenile offender can at any time after the person has reached the age of years,petition the court for sealing of the records,including records of arrest,relating to the person case,in the custody of the juvenile court and probation officer and any other agencies,including law enforcement agencies,and public officials as the petitioner alleges,in his or her petition,to have custody of the records.records shall be ordered sealed only if the court finds that since the termination of jurisdiction the petitioner has not been convicted of a felony or of any misdemeanor involving moral turpitude and that rehabilitation has been attained to the satisfaction of the court,subd.a.this court reviews the trial court order for abuse of discretion.in re gina th.
the court may consider the seriousness of the offense 
appellant principal argument on appeal is that the trial court relied on an improper factor to deny his petition the seriousness of his offenses.appellant argues that the seriousness of his offenses should not be considered because the focus in such a hearing should be on the applicant rehabilitation,that is,on his behavior following the juvenile adjudication,not on his prior criminal activity.
we agree with appellant that the focus is on the juvenile rehabilitation but part company with his assertion that the seriousness of the offenses is somehow unrelated to rehabilitation.
first,the language of section suggests the court should consider the seriousness of the juvenile offenses.if the juvenile has committed an offense enumerated under section,subdivision b,the court may not seal the records even if the court concludes the juvenile is otherwise rehabilitated.see in re th.as the statute provides that some offenses are so serious juvenile records must remain open as a matter of law,it would be at odds with the legislative intent for the trial court to be precluded from even considering the seriousness of the offense in determining whether the juvenile has or has not been rehabilitated.
second,other statutory schemes that require a determination of rehabilitation allow consideration of the seriousness of the offense.we find an analogy to adult parole.penal code section,subdivision b states that a release date must be set unless the board determines that the gravity of the current convicted offense or offenses,or the timing and gravity of current or past convicted offense or offenses,is such that consideration of the public safety requires a more lengthy period of incarceration for this individual,and that a parole date,therefore,can not be fixed at this meeting.in effecting penal code section subdivision b,our supreme court held in in re lawrence cal th,that the critical determination in a parole decision is whether the inmate presents a current risk of danger to society.however,the gravity and seriousness of the commitment offense may be relevant to that determination,particularly when there has not been a lengthy passage of time or other evidence of a change in the inmate psychological or mental attitude indicating the offense is no longer predictive of current dangerousness.indeed,as established in the companion case of in re shaputis cal th,filed concurrently with this opinion,the governor does not act arbitrarily or capriciously in reversing a grant of parole when
