previous referrals 
this family first came to the attention of dcfs in december,when dcfs received a referral alleging that linsey who was seven years old at the time had been sexually abused by father,and that mother knew about the abuse.that referral was closed as unfounded.dcfs received a second referral in april based upon similar allegations.linsey and carlos were removed from their parents custody and declared dependants of the juvenile court,but linsey later recanted the allegations of sexual abuse and the children were returned to parental custody.the juvenile court terminated jurisdiction in january.
initial petition in this case 
a month before the juvenile court terminated jurisdiction,linsey was raped by father while mother was away.when mother returned home,the door to father bedroom was locked.she knocked and,after a delay,father opened the door.she saw linsey lying in the bed.linsey told mother what father had done,and mother responded by telling linsey to wash up and stay away from father.although mother said she would file a police report,she did not do so,nor did she report the rape to dcsf.
linsey became pregnant as a result of the december rape six months later,in may,mother asked linsey school to transfer linsey to a school for pregnant girls.upon discovering that linsey was pregnant,school officials contacted dcfs and the police.when linsey disclosed that father had raped her,mother yelled at linsey,why did you tell them she said that linsey was a liar and a bad child,and denied that she was aware of any sexual abuse by father.father was arrested for sexual against linsey.
dcfs filed a section petition as to linsey and carlos based upon father sexual abuse of linsey and mother failure to protect linsey and carlos,and the children were removed from parental custody.the juvenile court sustained the allegations of the petition as to both parents and denied reunification services to father.after a contested disposition hearing almost six months later,the court denied reunification services to mother in light of her persistence and consistent lack of demonstrated ability to understand the impact of what has happened here and her responsibility in it,and in light of the continued denial of the facts.the court suspended mother visitation with linsey,finding visitation posed substantial risk of detriment to linsey.although the court ordered monitored visitation for mother and carlos in a therapeutic setting,no visits took place after that october disposition hearing 
in september,the juvenile court ordered legal guardianship as the permanent plan for carlos,and his foster mother,hilda foster mother was named his legal guardian.linsey continued in foster care.the court ordered no visits between carlos and his parents at that time,finding visitation would be detrimental to his emotional.
subsequent petition 
in the meantime,at some point during the summer of,dcfs received a referral from linsey therapist,who said that linsey told her that carlos attempted to molest a cousin.the therapist also said that foster mother told her that carlos disclosed that father performed unimaginable sexual acts on him.
dcfs conducted an investigation.in the initial interviews with foster mother,linsey,and carlos,dcfs gathered information that suggested carlos may have been sexually abused by father.initially,carlos neither confirmed nor denied the abuse he said he did not want to talk about it.by august,however,carlos therapist reported that carlos was beginning to open up about the abuse he had suffered.three days later,carlos told the emergency case worker that father had sexually abused him more than once,but he would not provide any details about the abuse.in november,the case worker met again with carlos in an attempt to get further information about the alleged abuse.although carlos was generally more talkative than he had been earlier,he did not provide any details about the alleged abuse.in december,foster mother reported to dcfs that carlos told her that father had performed oral sex on him.in january,dcfs filed the subsequent petition at issue in this appeal.
the subsequent petition alleges counts under section,subdivisions b,d,and j.the allegations of each count are identical father sexually abused carlos on numerous occasions,mother reasonably should have known of the abuse but failed to take action to protect the children,and father abuse and mother failure to protect places carlos and linsey at risk of physical harm,damage,danger,and sexual abuse the children were not detained they remained placed in foster care.
dcfs filed a report in march that,among other things,described interviews that were conducted the previous month with father,mother,linsey,carlos,foster mother,and carlos therapist.
according to the report,father denied the allegations.he said he always respected his children although he acknowledged he had sex with linsey one time,and that he never touched carlos or had carlos touch him.
when mother was told about the allegations during her interview,she initially said could not believe it,but then said that if her son said it happened,she believed him.she denied,however,any knowledge of the abuse,saying that she would have reported it had she known.when asked whether she reported father abuse of linsey when she first found out,mother admitted that she had not.but she appeared to try to avoid taking responsibility for that failure to report.she said i was his wife and he had to take care of us.i never told anyone but linsey use sic to hit me all the time.she would always be mad at me for no reason.he father would always come home mad too,or tired.i was abused too.but i never said anything because i did want my kids to be taken from me.
