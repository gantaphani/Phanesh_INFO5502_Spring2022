julie braden,under appointment by the court of appeal for minor,
in march,came to the attention of the san diego county health and human services agency agency as a result of domestic violence between her mother,patricia,and stepfather,roger s.the juvenile court found roger was presumed father under family code section,subdivision d.statutory references are to the family code unless otherwise specified.when genetic testing showed alvaro was biological father,the court entered a judgment of paternity in his favor,and found that judgment necessarily rebutted roger presumed father status.roger appeals,contending the court erred by entering a judgment of paternity for alvaro without considering roger competing paternity interests under section,subdivision b.roger asserts this denied him his due process right to a fair hearing on his paternity status.we conclude that where,as here,a child has both a presumed and a biological father,the court must hold an evidentiary hearing at which it reconciles the competing paternity interests to determine which of those interests are founded on the weightier considerations of policy and logic.accordingly,we reverse the judgment of paternity in favor of alvaro and remand the case for a hearing under the standard articulated in section,subdivision b.
factual and procedural background 
patricia came to san diego from mexico when she was pregnant with.she met roger when was two months old,and married him several months later.roger provided a home,food and clothing for,and told everyone he was her father.considered roger to be her father.the relationship between patricia and roger was marred by domestic violence.told the social worker she did not feel safe when her dad was at home because she twice saw him push her mother to the floor.

the court sustained the allegations of the petition,declared a dependent and placed her with patricia.the court found roger was presumed father under section,subdivision d,but deferred entry of a paternity judgment until proper notice was given to alvaro so that he could request a hearing to rebut the presumption or establish his own paternity.the court ordered reunification services for roger,including supervised visits with 
when genetic tests showed alvaro was biological father,he requested a judgment of paternity.patricia and supported alvaro request,noting was enjoying frequent telephone calls from alvaro,and she no longer wanted visits with roger.roger opposed the request for a paternity judgment in favor of alvaro and asked for a hearing to allow the court to balance the interests of the two fathers,and ultimately,to have a judgment of paternity entered in roger favor.the court,however,found it was unlikely that roger could disprove alvaro biological paternity,and alvaro status as biological father entitled him to a judgment of paternity,thereby rebutting roger presumed father status.the court entered a judgment of nonpaternity as to roger,but nevertheless gave agency discretion to allow roger to visit if she wanted visits.
discussion 
the issue presented in this appeal,which implicates the rights of a presumed father and a biological father,is whether the court can use evidence of biological paternity to enter a judgment establishing paternity under section,subdivision c,for the purpose of rebutting the presumption of paternity under section,subdivision d,without weighing the competing interests of a statutorily presumed father.the resolution of this issue depends solely on statutory interpretation and is subject to our independent review.in re liam th.the objective of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent.to accomplish that objective,courts must look first to the words of the statute,giving effect to their plain meaning.in re jerry th,see also gabriel suedi th.
before we begin our analysis,we address the issue of mootness raised by alvaro in his request for judicial notice,which we grant,subd.d.according to a march,minute order,the juvenile court placed with patricia and terminated its jurisdiction.although is no longer a dependent child,the issue on appeal whether roger was entitled to a hearing to have the court weigh competing paternity claims is not moot because roger rights were adversely affected by the court judgment of paternity for alvaro,which may have consequences for roger in the future.see in re th,clifford superior court th.further,w e exercise our discretion to resolve the issues of first impression raised here as matters of continuing public interest that are likely to recur.in re adrianna th.
there are three types of fathers in juvenile dependency law presumed,biological,and alleged.in re kobe th.a presumed father is a man who meets one or more specified criteria in section.a biological father is a man whose paternity has been established,but who has not shown he is the child presumed father.an alleged father although not relevant here is a man who has not established biological paternity or presumed father status.in re zacharia cal th,fn.these categories are meant to distinguish between those fathers who have entered into some familial relationship with the mother and child and those who have not.in re sabrina d.
