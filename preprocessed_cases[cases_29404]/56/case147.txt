a juvenile,appeals the sentence imposed by the district court as a result of his guilty plea delinquency adjudication,under which will remain confined until his birthday.the district court had jurisdiction under the federal juvenile delinquency act fjda,et,and we have jurisdiction over his appeal pursuant to.we hold that the sentence imposed was both arbitrary and in direct contravention of the rehabilitative purposes of the fjda and therefore an abuse of discretion.
background and procedural history 
factual background 
is a old member of the cheyenne river sioux tribe.he was born in montana and spent the first six years of his life on the fort belknap indian reservation with his parents and other family members.a precocious young person,attended head start and could read and count to by the time he was three.
in,when was around six,his parents separated.and his younger brother and sister officially remained in the custody of their mother,who moved to south dakota.although they lived with their mother,the three siblings returned to stay with their father and paternal grandmother in the fort belknap indian community on a regular basis over the next two years.attended first grade in south dakota,where he received excellent or outstanding grades.
around the time of his parents separation,was referred to the fort belknap health center fbhc by the fort belknap tribal court.parents had ongoing conflicts and both of them alleged that had been abused by the other.paternal grandmother also reported to fbhc workers that was mean when he returned from his mother residence in south dakota.fbhc own report indicated that appeared to be nervous.concerned,the fbhc clinician requested that be interviewed alone.however,denied that anyone had ever touched him sexually.other than the initial interview,was not referred for further evaluation or counseling.
tragically,was in fact being severely sexually abused by multiple offenders during the period both before and after this interview.when was between four and five years old,an older boy for whom mother was babysitting abused repeatedly,sodomizing him approximately thirty to forty times and forcing him to perform oral sex approximately twenty times over a period.fearful of retaliation and only barely old enough to comprehend what was happening to him,did not report the abuse to his parents or anyone else.
unfortunately,victimization did not stop with this traumatic experience.a couple of years later,while staying with his mother in south dakota,was again abused,this time by an older cousin.over a period of many months,this cousin sodomized on at least forty or fifty occasions and forced him to engage in oral sex.he also exposed to pornographic material and,on at least one occasion,tied him up while he abused him.although little sister complained to their mother about their cousin behavior,apparently their mother did not seek treatment or counseling for either of the children,nor did she inform their father about what had occurred.no punishment was ever imposed on either of the individuals who victimized,nor did he receive counseling or other support services as a result of these incidents.
when returned from south dakota,his father noticed a marked change in his personality,including more physical inhibitions.as father explained at the sentencing hearing,
i remember vividly when would come home to montana,and i would always call him tweety bird,because he had great big eyes.and he used to always tell me about his encounters.and i remember he used to come home,crawl over my shoulders like a little snake up and down my legs and jump on my lap and one summer he came home and he never did that.and he stayed away he was distant i thought that was because he was reaching adolescence at any early age because he talked about the birds and bees,because he had some questions about why hair was growing in certain places,if it was all right to grow there and stuff.but the day he stopped crawling all over me and telling me about his fun he had in south dakota,makes sense now,because that when he was victimized 
in,father obtained physical custody over all three siblings through the tribal court.
as noted above,was an exceptional student and,for many years,did not have problems in school.his instructors at the catholic school in montana where he attended fifth and sixth grade reported that he was by teachers and other students,although he was somewhat quiet.as he entered middle school,however,began to have repeated attention and discipline problems.later reported that he experienced recurring nightmares,insomnia,anger,intrusive thoughts,and depression during this time,all of which are associated with stress disorder ptsd,a frequent symptom of sexual abuse among children.see et,at.
in december,when he was twelve,attempted suicide by intentionally ingesting a muscle relaxant.after his stomach was pumped,he reported to hospital officials that he was depressed because of his younger ongoing treatment for leukemia.he was released the following day and,again,no one referred for further evaluation or counseling.
several months later,on april,school psychologist contacted fort belknap social services to report allegations that had sexually abused two children.the federal bureau of investigations fbi subsequently took over the investigation.during the course of the investigation,it was revealed that had initiated sexual contact with a slightly younger girl by touching her vaginal area on one occasion.one of cousins also alleged that had placed his hand on his penis and buttocks while they were sitting on a couch,and that had sodomized him and forced him to engage in oral sex several years earlier when was approximately eight or nine years old 
almost immediately upon hearing of the allegations about his son,father requested that be evaluated by clinicians at fbhc.fbhc workers noted that occasionally appeared disengaged from conversation,described himself as having an ability to distract himself from bad things and was possibly subject to ptsd.also expressed to fbhc workers that he was shocked and numb as a result of the allegations,and denied that the alleged conduct had taken place.
a few weeks after his initial evaluation by fbhc,was examined by a doctor in billings,montana,who conducted a psychosexual evaluation.during this three and a half hour interview,reported his own history of abuse for the first time and admitted the sexual conduct that underlies the instant offenses.the evaluating physician diagnosed with a of possible problems and categorized as a moderate risk juvenile sex offender.he also expressed concern that living situation at the was living at home and was not yet receiving any counseling or inappropriate.he expressed his belief that placement at a residential treatment center would offer the appropriate level of support and structure.he indicated that,at a minimum,any placement should meet minimal standards of care and that should not be placed in an environment with young or vulnerable children.
after evaluation,fhbc prescribed him two different and referred him and his family to a counselor,connie dilts.initially had difficulty admitting his conduct to dilts and,according to dilts,was very shut down emotionally during many sessions,a coping skill he developed to avoid dealing with his own abuse.was,however,very aware of how much pain he was experiencing and the need to address his sexual issues,and expressed his desire to have someone help him to deal with his problems.
in,shortly before the initial charges were filed against him,was placed at normative services residential treatment facility normative.while the first two months of his stay there,particularly the first month,were marked by an overall poor performance,starting in june,was more open and participating in group and individual treatment without resistance.thus,at the time of sentencing,had been successfully performing at normative for nearly half of his time there.normative officials estimated that with another year of treatment,depending on and his family continued participation and cooperation,would be ready to be released to his family.at the time of sentencing,normative personnel recommended that be continued in their program.
underlying proceedings and procedural history 
on march,the united states attorney filed an information charging with two counts of aggravated sexual abuse of a child,as defined in c,both occurring during the year and continuing into,while was between the ages of twelve and thirteen.on april,appeared for arraignment and entered a plea of not true to the information.
on june,pursuant to a plea agreement,pleaded guilty to the second count of the information.the plea agreement contained the government recommendation that be committed to the custody of the attorney general until his eighteenth birthday,and that he be required to successfully complete sexual offender treatment.on july,the probation office submitted its report psr.
on july,the district court conducted a sentencing hearing,at which it embraced the factual findings of the psr,with a few exceptions.the court also heard from father,who expressed regret at his failure to identify needs earlier,and,who apologized for his actions as well as his early acting out at normative.the district court then sentenced to the custody of the attorney general until his birthday,the maximum sentence that a court can impose under the fjda.the district court summarized the reasons for its sentence as follows 
t here are a number of reasons for the sentence that i am going to impose.and they include the seriousness of the offense,the fact that there are other offenses in your past and in your history that are of the same type beyond the charge that was admitted,the fact that you have been given the opportunity to attempt to make progress with treatment and that you have done very little to take advantage of that.but that you have a real and even profound need for continued treatment that will succeed only if you cooperate with it and only if you are placed in an environment where that treatment will be seen by you as a positive opportunity and i have determined that that can only be accomplished if you are assured of being in a structured environment that will not permit you the choice of seeking to return to your prior activities.
the district court also issued a strong recommendation that be placed in a bureau of prisons facility in south dakota,approximately miles from home and tribe.
on august,filed this timely appeal.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
both parties assert that the applicable standard of review for a juvenile delinquency sentence that falls within the guidelines is abuse of discretion.however,neither united states nor united states juvenile lwq,which the parties refer to as stating the applicable standard,explicitly considered this question.see united states,cir applying abuse of discretion standard to review of a district court decision to depart from the sentencing guidelines range united states juvenile lwq,cir applying abuse of discretion standard to review of probation sentences imposed under the sentencing reform act.thus,the question of the appropriate standard of review for a juvenile delinquency sentence that falls below the maximum is apparently a new question for this circuit.
as discussed below,the sentencing reform act of and the accompanying implementation of the sentencing guidelines left little impact on the fjda,including the discretion it vests in district courts to fashion a sentence that serves the rehabilitative goals of that act.if an essentially factual inquiry is present,or if the exercise of the district court discretion is determinative,then we give deference to the decision of the district court.united states owens,cir,rev on other grounds,d.accordingly,we hold that the appropriate standard of review is abuse of discretion.accord united states alexander,cir reviewing for abuse of discretion transfer decision under.
sentencing under the fjda 
under the fjda,a district court has several sentencing options the court may suspend the findings of juvenile delinquency,enter an order of restitution,place him on probation,or commit him to official detention.the maximum term of official detention to which a juvenile may be sentenced is the lesser of the period until the juvenile turns years old or the maximum that could be imposed under the united states sentencing guidelines.c.although the guidelines and the juvenile age set the upper limit for sentencing,the guidelines are explicitly not applicable to other sentencing determinations for juveniles.see also united states,d although determining the maximum sentence will require sentencing and reviewing courts to determine an appropriate guideline range,we emphasize that it does not require plenary application of the guidelines to juvenile delinquents.united states,cir does not require plenary application of the guidelines to juvenile delinquents.quoting,at.
although the fjda does not set out specific guidelines for crafting a juvenile sentence below the maximum,the scope of a district court sentencing discretion is limited by the purposes of the fjda,which authorizes federal courts to sentence particular juveniles in the first place.the purpose of the fjda is to enhance the juvenile system by removing juveniles from the ordinary criminal justice system and by providing a separate system of treatment for them.united states,cir see also united states v.one juvenile male,cir,at describing amendments to fjda as incorporat ing the rehabilitative concept of a juvenile proceeding.a successful prosecution under the act results in a civil adjudication of status,not a criminal conviction.united states doe,cir.although t he rehabilitative philosophy which underpins the fjda is tempered by a realistic analysis when the presumption of juvenile status is challenged in the transfer hearing process,united states,so long as a juvenile remains within the auspices of the fjda for sentencing,he or she is presumptively capable of rehabilitation,and any sentence imposed by a district court must accord with this presumption.see id.where realistic chances for rehabilitation exists,the balance ought not to tip in recognition of the general societal interests subsumed in the broader sense of the word justice.
in keeping with its rehabilitative goals,the fjda disfavors institutionalization and in particular the warehousing of young people away from their communities.see whenever possible,the attorney general shall commit a juvenile to a foster home or community located in or near his home community.accord,robert shepherd,ed.aba juvenile justice standards,annotated hereinafter aba standards introduction xix discussing basic principles of standards,including principle that t he least restrictive alternative to accomplish the purpose of the intervention should be the choice of decision makers at every stage,with written reasons for finding less drastic remedies inadequate.and aba standards standards relating to dispositions b there should be a presumption against coercively removing a juvenile from his or her home,and this category of sanction should be reserved for the most serious or repetitive offenses.youth who are adjudged to be delinquent under the fjda must therefore be confined in the environment that will support their continued rehabilitation.see,at explaining amendments to formerly as indicating that juvenile detention must be in as an environment as possible,see also id.at the highest attention must be given to minimizing the involvement of young offenders in the juvenile and criminal justice system and to reintegrating delinquents and young offenders into the community.although a disposition in the juvenile court may authorize confinement until age,it will last no longer and within that period will last only so long as the juvenile behavior demonstrates that he remains an unacceptable risk if returned to his family.mckeiver pennsylvania,d white,concurring.while a standard for confinement may not be constitutionally required,see reno flores,d,we conclude that such a requirement is implicit in the structure and purposes of the fjda sentencing provisions 
the government asserts that amendments to the fjda by the sentencing reform act of fundamentally shifted the goal of the fjda from rehabilitation to punishment,deterrence,and incapacitation.we find this assertion unpersuasive.the supreme court has specifically rejected the argument that the amendments fundamentally altered the rehabilitative purposes of the fjda.see,at.as the supreme court has made clear,congress specifically considered and rejected incorporation of adult sentencing provisions into.see id.at.more importantly,the amendments did not alter the basic sentencing structure of the act,nor did they remove or transform the rehabilitative language surrounding commitment proceedings.see sentencing reform act of,stat,
moreover,if the primary goal of the federal juvenile justice system is no longer rehabilitation,as the government asserts,then the lessened due process protections afforded under the system would become extremely problematic.courts have repeatedly justified the informality and lesser procedural protections afforded in the juvenile system on the basis of its unique,rehabilitative nature.see schall martin,at.state interest in preserving and promoting the welfare of the child makes a juvenile proceeding fundamentally different from an adult criminal trial quoting santosky kramer,d mckeiver,at.trial by jury for juveniles not constitutionally required united states male juvenile,cir rejecting right to jury trial for juveniles under fjda.we have explicitly held that the rehabilitative purpose of juvenile delinquency proceedings obviates the requirement of the formalities of the criminal adjudicative system.united states indian boy x,cir holding no formal indictment process required under fjda.the government suggested construction of the fjda would require us to reevaluate the rationale underlying juvenile justice jurisprudence for the past forty years.we reject such a broad reinterpretation of the statute and hold that,absent a clear indication from congress to the contrary,the primary purpose of the fjda remains to rehabilitate children who have committed criminal acts,assisting them to become successful and productive members of their communities.
in short,although the fjda grants district courts the discretion to select from among the dispositions authorized under,this discretion must be exercised in accordance with the rehabilitative function of the fjda,which requires an assessment of the totality of the unique circumstances and rehabilitative needs of each juvenile.it must be clear from the record,if not explicit,that a district court weighed all of the relevant factors and found that the disposition imposed was the least restrictive means to accomplish a young person rehabilitation,given the needs of the child and the community.with these principles in mind,we now turn to the disposition imposed upon by the district court.
district court sentence 
as noted above,the district court in this case imposed the maximum disposition available to it under,sentencing to confinement by the bureau of prisons until his birthday,or nearly seven years.only eighteen of the months of sentence are to be served in a treatment program for juvenile sexual offenders the remaining five plus years of sentence,regardless of while in bureau of prisons custody.successful completion of treatment,are to be served in a general bureau of prisons juvenile detention facility with no provisions for targeted treatment.in short,over of sentence was imposed for purely punitive or incapacitating purposes,neither of which constitute permissible sentencing factors under the fjda.
we hold that the district court in this case abused its discretion.as an initial matter,we note that a seven year sentence is grossly discrepant with the recommended term of confinement promulgated by the aba and ija for offenses such as the one committed by see aba standards standards relating to juvenile delinquency and sanctions.the juvenile justice standards categorize offenses such as,for which the maximum sentence authorized would exceed five years if the crime was committed by an adult,as a class two juvenile offense.id.at.for a class two offense,the standards recommend that the court not impose a sanction more severe than confinement in a secure facility or placement in a nonsecure facility or residence for a period of eighteen months.id.at a.thus,the district court disposition exceeded the recommended maximum term of confinement by over five years.
more importantly,the district court offered no support for its conclusion that a sentence was necessary to effectuate successful treatment,nor does the psr provide any support for such a conclusion.although initial evaluation,conducted over a year before sentencing,recommended that he be placed in a structured environment,at the time of sentencing,had already been placed in a residential treatment facility in accordance with that recommendation.moreover,the district court finding that was not performing well at normative is unsupported by the record.the psr indicated that,after a bumpy first month,fared well at normative,receiving positive reports from his counselors,participating in group and individual treatment without resistance,improving his grades,and joining the choir.the treating professionals at normative,who had charge of prior to sentencing,estimated that he could be ready to return to his community within a year.given that all of serious problems at normative occurred in his first month there,when he was experiencing his first time away from home and from native american family members,the district court apparent emphasis on this time period is unfathomable.
by its terms,sentence exceeded what was necessary for treatment by more than five years.even if required longer than eighteen months to complete a treatment program successfully,there is no support for the conclusion that he would need seven years to do so,or that custody by the bureau of prisons was the least restrictive means to accomplish such treatment.indeed,it appears that continued treatment at normative would have been a perfectly viable option.
in short,nothing in the record indicates that the district court weighed whether custody by the bureau of prisons was the least restrictive means to accomplish successful rehabilitation,given the needs of and the community.although we note that the district court explicitly found that the disposition it selected was chosen for purposes of treatment,mechanical articulation of rehabilitation as a goal is not sufficient.the district court must provide a reasoned basis for why it has rejected less restrictive interventions.see united states daniels,cir district court grossly abused its discretion by failing to evaluate the relevant information before it with due regard for the factors appropriate to sentencing.see also sue righthand carlann welch,juveniles who have sexually offended a review of the professional literature.ojjdp march hereinafter ojjdp literature review at xviii treatment of juvenile sexual offenders should be provided in the least restrictive environment necessary for community protection and should involve the least intrusive methods that can be expected to accomplish treatment objectives.
adding to the arbitrariness of its decision,the district court utterly failed to consider own history of victimization,or,worse yet,considered it as a factor which should increase time in detention.see williams oklahoma,d in discharging his duty of imposing a proper sentence,the sentencing judge is authorized,if not required,to consider all of the mitigating and aggravating circumstances involved in the crime.own history of abuse,if anything,counsels against imposing the most severe sentence,not in favor of it.the district court also failed to consider that had shown progress since the initial intervention by in coming to terms with his own abuse and in accepting responsibility for his conduct and his need for treatment.progress in treatment was sustained,with some short digressions,through his counseling with dilts as well as his time at normative.given serious needs,the implicit expectation that he would respond instantly to treatment is patently unreasonable and shows a startling lack of understanding
