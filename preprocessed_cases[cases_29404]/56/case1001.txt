in this appeal,we are asked to consider whether the illinois dna indexing statute,section of the unified code of corrections ilcs west,is unconstitutional as applied to respondent,lakisha,a minor who was adjudicated delinquent,by the circuit court of cook county,after being found guilty of committing a nonsexual felony offense.the appellate court upheld the constitutionality of the statute.unpublished order under supreme court rule.for reasons that follow,we affirm.
background 
on december,lakisha and another female student were taken to the detention room at collins high school in chicago because they had been fighting.while there,lakisha hit and kicked the dean of her high school as he blocked her attempt to resume fighting with the other girl.based on this incident,a petition for adjudication of wardship was filed against lakisha.after a trial ilcs west,a juvenile court found lakisha guilty of committing the offense of aggravated battery,a class felony ilcs b,e west and adjudicated her delinquent.she was then sentenced to one year of probation and ordered to submit a saliva sample to the department of state police for deoxyribonucleic acid dna analysis and indexing,as required by section a of the unified code of corrections ilcs a west.
lakisha appealed,challenging both her adjudication and the constitutionality of the dna indexing statute as it applied to her.in an unpublished summary order,the appellate court affirmed lakisha adjudication and upheld the constitutionality of the statute.unpublished order under supreme court rule.
lakisha petitioned this court for leave to appeal,which we granted.we also permitted the children and family justice center of the northwestern university school of law,the public defender service for the district of columbia,and a coalition of juvenile justice,civil liberties and public defender organizations to file,jointly,an amicus curiae brief in support of respondent.
lakisha has successfully completed her sentence of probation and does not challenge her adjudication in this court.the only issue she raises here is whether section of the unified code of corrections ilcs west is unconstitutional as applied to her,a minor adjudicated delinquent for a nonsexual felony offense.
section is applicable to respondent pursuant to subsection a,which provides in pertinent part 
a any person found guilty or given supervision for any offense classified as a felony under the juvenile court act of ilcs et shall,regardless of the sentence or disposition imposed,be required to submit specimens of blood,saliva,or tissue to the illinois department of state police in accordance with the provisions of this section,provided such person is 
convicted or found guilty of any offense classified as a felony under illinois law or found guilty or given supervision for such an offense under the juvenile court act of on or after august.
lakisha does not dispute that dna analysis and typing produces a unique print or genetic profile for every person and,accordingly,is an accurate scientific process useful as a means of identification.moreover,she acknowledges that the plain language of section a explicitly and unequivocally requires her and every minor adjudicated delinquent based on the commission of a felony offense on or after august,to provide a dna sample to the illinois department of state police so that genetic marker grouping analysis information obtained from the sample may be included in state and national dna databases.ilcs a,f west.lakisha contends,however,that the compulsory extraction of her saliva,its analysis for dna genetic marker groupings,and the perpetual storage and potential for repeated searches of her genetic profile,permitted by the statute,violate her right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures as guaranteed by the fourth amendment to the united states constitution,amends.iv,xiv,as well as article i,section,of the illinois constitution of.const,art.i.she also contends that the statute,when applied to minors like herself,permits an unreasonable invasion of privacy,in violation of the privacy clause of the illinois constitution of.const,art.i.
we begin our analysis by noting that all statutes are presumed constitutional and that the party challenging a statute validity bears the burden of demonstrating a clear constitutional violation.people wilson.a court must construe a statute so as to affirm its constitutionality,if reasonably possible.people funches,citing people greco.our review of a statute constitutionality is de novo.people dinelli.
the fourth amendment 
the fourth amendment of the united states constitution,applicable to the states through the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment,guarantees to all citizens the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.people lampitok.the touchstone of fourth amendment analysis is always the reasonableness in all the circumstances of the particular governmental invasion of a citizen personal security terry ohio,d,and reasonableness depends on a balance between the public interest and the individual right to personal security free from arbitrary interference by law officers united states,d.pennsylvania mimms,d.see also samson california,d,lampitok,at,whether a search is unreasonable within the meaning of the fourth amendment depends on the degree to which the search intrudes upon the individual privacy balanced against the degree to which it is needed to promote a legitimate governmental interest,citing united states knights,d.
lakisha burden in this case is considerable,not only because she must overcome the presumption of constitutionality,but also because,in people garvin,this court considered and upheld the constitutionality of section ilcs west,as applied to adult felons.
in garvin,the defendant was convicted of burglary and theft,sentenced to a term of years imprisonment,and directed to provide a blood sample for dna analysis pursuant to section.on appeal,the defendant argued that the dna indexing statute was unconstitutional under the search and seizure provisions of both our federal and state constitutions,because it permitted warrantless,suspicionless searches without a showing of special need or other justification.garvin,at.the defendant also contended that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to him because he was convicted of a nonsexual felony and,as a result,the potential usefulness of his stored dna in solving future crimes was greatly diminished.garvin,at.
addressing these claims,we found that the compelled blood extraction,though a search within the meaning of the fourth amendment,was reasonable.this was true whether we applied the special needs test advocated by the defendant or the less rigorous pure balancing test for determining reasonableness.garvin,at.in reaching this determination,we held that the primary purpose of our dna indexing statute is the creation of a criminal dna database that can be used to absolve innocents,identify the guilty,deter recidivism by identifying those at a high risk of reoffending,or bring closure to victims and that this purpose serves a special need beyond that of general law enforcement,thereby satisfying the special need prong of the reasonableness test.garvin,at.further,we held that the state has an interest in creating a dna database to p romot e an effective and accurate criminal justice system and increas e public safety through either deterrence or removal of criminal offenders from the streets and that these interests are compelling.garvin,at.weighing the state interests against a felon privacy interest in his genetic information,the scale tipped heavily in favor of the state.garvin,at.this is because the intrusion caused by taking a dna sample is almost negligible,a felon reasonable expectation of privacy is greatly diminished,and access to the information stored in the database is limited to peace officers.garvin,at.finally,we held that the fact that the defendant was convicted of a nonsexual felony offense was of no consequence because one could imagine myriad examples involving other felonies where the perpetrator dna evidence might be useful.garvin,at.
lakisha acknowledges our holding in garvin,but argues that when weighing the state interests against the privacy interests of a minor adjudicated delinquent,rather than a convicted felon,different considerations inform the reasonableness inquiry and cause the balance to tip in the minor favor.the state,however,maintains that the fourth amendment balancing test for determining reasonableness is the same for adjudicated minors as it is for adult felons and that we should continue to follow our decision in garvin.we agree with the state.
dna statutes,similar to our illinois statute,have been enacted in all states.though the scope of these statutes varies,constitutional challenges brought against these statutes uniformly have been rejected.see people hunter,d,people garvin,d.while it is undisputed that the bodily intrusion involved in taking a blood,saliva,or tissue sample for dna analysis,as required by these indexing statutes,is a search within the meaning of the fourth amendment,these searches have universally been upheld as reasonable.courts have found these statutes to be reasonable because the intrusion involved in taking a dna sample is very slight and the governmental interest in the information obtained as a result of these searches outweighs any legitimate privacy interests of the offender,whether a minor or an adult.see miller,validity,construction,and operation of state dna database statutes,wl courts have uniformly expressed the view that dna database statutes do not violate the fourth amendment and,occasionally,analogous state constitutional provisions,whether the courts have applied traditional fourth amendment analysis,the doctrine of prisoners reduced expectation of privacy,or the special needs doctrine.
moreover,no court has ever held that a juvenile is entitled to greater fourth amendment protections by reason of her minority.those courts that have addressed the constitutionality of state statutes requiring juveniles to provide dna samples have consistently upheld them.see in re calvin,th,d requiring juvenile found to have committed felony car theft and driving without a license to provide dna sample did not violate fourth amendment intrusion into juvenile fourth amendment interests,including his interest in confidentiality of juvenile court proceedings,did not outweigh legitimate government interest in dna testing as aid to law enforcement ex rel.attorney general,dna testing is a onetime procedure that applies equally to juveniles found delinquent and adults found guilty of a crime and acts as an identification device,much like a fingerprint,stored in secure local and national databases in re,pa super,trial court had authority to order juvenile to submit to dna sampling under the dna act after adjudication of delinquency in re leopoldo,app in re,state,so d state statute imposing dna testing requirements on felons convicted of specific,enumerated offenses did not violate a juvenile right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures,equal protection,or right of privacy under the state constitution any intrusion to be suffered by the juvenile was outweighed by the state interests in identifying perpetrators,exonerating innocent persons charged with criminal offenses,and preventing the furtherance of criminal activity in re nicholson,ohio app d,fourth amendment challenge of ohio dna statute as applied to juveniles rejected in re appeal in maricopa county juvenile action numbers,app statute did not violate the juveniles right to privacy or authorize an unreasonable search and seizure in re orozco,oregon dna statute did not violate fourth amendment when applied to juvenile sex offender.
although lakisha recognizes that other jurisdictions have upheld the constitutionality of dna indexing statutes as applied to juveniles,she argues that these opinions are not persuasive and are,for the most part,appellate court decisions that are not binding on this court.she maintains that the fourth amendment balancing test employed in garvin involves different considerations when applied in the juvenile context and urges this court to hold our indexing statute constitutionally unreasonable because it treats adjudicated minors the same as adult felons.
first,relying on people taylor,lakisha argues that a delinquency adjudication is not the equivalent of a criminal felony conviction and,for that reason,delinquent minors do not have the same diminished expectation of privacy as convicted felons.lakisha also points to certain provisions of the juvenile court act and our court rules that are designed to protect the confidentiality of a juvenile identity.see c minors,including adjudicated delinquent minors,must be referred to by their first name and last initial,or simply by their initials,in appellate proceedings ilcs,a,west strict limits placed on access to juvenile court records and files.she maintains that,because our juvenile justice system affords juveniles greater privacy protections than the criminal justice system gives to adults,juveniles expectations of privacy are not only undiminished,they are significantly greater and,thus,juveniles have heightened privacy interests.
lakisha further contends that maintaining confidentiality of a juvenile identity is consistent with the goal of rehabilitation,which remains a more important consideration in the juvenile justice system than in the criminal justice system taylor,at,and with the provisions of the juvenile court act that provide certain juveniles the opportunity to have their delinquency records expunged see ilcs west.she notes that a juvenile expungement rights under the juvenile court act do not extend to dna indexing.see ilcs west.thus,even if a juvenile succeeds in having her juvenile records expunged under the juvenile court act,she will remain in the dna database for the rest of her life.from this lakisha concludes that applying the indexing statute to juveniles is at odds with the purpose and goals of the juvenile court act.
we are not persuaded by lakisha arguments.initially,we note that her reliance on our decision in people taylor,is misplaced.taylor had nothing to do with dna extraction or the fourth amendment.in taylor,we were asked to consider whether the escape statute,which applies to a person convicted of a felony,would encompass a juvenile adjudicated delinquent of a felony offense.we held,as a matter of statutory construction,a delinquent juvenile was not a person convicted of a felony.we said,we simply do not believe that the term person convicted of a felony can be read to include juvenile adjudications under the plain meaning of the existing statutory framework at issue here.taylor,at.we came to this belief based on the fact that,at the time of the defendant adjudication,the juvenile court act did not provide for a plea or a finding of guilty of an offense and because,inmost cases,juveniles do not have the right to a jury trial and the law does not authorize a felony conviction in the absence of a right to a trial by jury.taylor,at.
in the case at bar,we are not faced with a question of statutory construction.the dna indexing statute explicitly and unequivocally includes juveniles adjudicated delinquent for felony offenses within its scope.further,while it is undoubtedly true that a delinquency adjudication is still not the legal equivalent of a felony conviction despite the amendments to the act,it does not follow inexorably that a juvenile adjudicated delinquent for committing a felony offense does not have a diminished expectation of privacy.when a minor,like respondent here,is found guilty of committing a felony offense and is made a ward of the court see ilcs west after hearing the evidence,the court shall make and note in the minutes of the proceeding a finding of whether or not the minor is guilty.if the court finds that the minor is guilty,the court shall then set a time for a sentencing hearing to be conducted under section at which hearing the court shall determine whether it is in the best interests of the minor and the public that he or she be made a ward of the court,her identity is a matter of state interest and,as a result,she can no longer have the same expectation of privacy enjoyed by ordinary,citizens.
we also do not agree that a juvenile expectation of privacy with regard to her dna identifying information is increased because certain provisions of our juvenile court act serve to maintain the confidentiality of juveniles identities.the same argument was advanced and rejected in in re calvin,th,d.we find that court reasoning to be sound.
in in re calvin,the minor was adjudicated delinquent for felony car theft and required to provide a dna sample in accord with the california dna indexing statute,penal code section.like respondent here,the minor argued that his interest in keeping his juvenile adjudication confidential significantly alters the fourth amendment balancing of interests found in the decisions upholding the constitutionality of penal code section when the offender is an adult.emphasis in original.in re calvin,th at,d at.in response,the third appellate district of the california court of appeal acknowledged the state strong public policy favoring confidentiality of juvenile proceedings and the statutory provisions supporting this policy.nonetheless,the court held that the compulsory extraction and testing of the minor dna required by its state indexing statute had little impact on the minor interest in the privacy of juvenile proceedings.in re calvin,th at,d at.
the california court noted that its dna indexing statute permitted the dna and forensic identification profiles to be used only for certain identification purposes and permitted with few exceptions release of the information only to law enforcement agencies.in re calvin,th at,d at.also,the statute made it a criminal offense for a person to use dna specimens or profiles for other purposes or to disclose the dna information to an unauthorized person or agency.in re calvin,th at,d at.the court then concluded with the use of dna samples and the dna database so limited,making juveniles subject to the provisions of penal code section is hardly a public announcement of a juvenile offender felony conviction.in re calvin,th at,d at.
similarly,our illinois dna indexing statute restricts the dissemination of genetic marker grouping analysis information to peace officers of the united states,of other states or territories,of the insular possessions of the united states,of foreign countries duly authorized to receive the same,to all peace officers of the state of illinois and to all prosecutorial agencies,and to defense counsel as provided by section of the code of criminal procedure of.ilcs f west.also,our statute limits the permitted uses for the genetic marker grouping analysis information to certain enumerated law enforcement purposes ilcs f west and provides that use of the genetic marker grouping analysis information,or any other information derived from a dna sample,beyond the authorized uses as provided under this section,or any other illinois law,is guilty of a class felony,and shall be subject to a fine of not less than ilcs west.
the provisions of our juvenile court act that afford minors greater privacy protections do so with respect to the general public.there is nothing to suggest that these provisions indicate a legislative intent to provide juveniles with greater privacy rights with respect to law enforcement officials,who are the only ones given access to the genetic marker information derived from the searches required by the dna indexing statute.ilcs f west.we conclude,as did the court in in re calvin,that our state public policy favoring confidentiality of juvenile proceedings,and the statutory provisions supporting that policy,do not alter a delinquent juvenile expectation of privacy with respect to the minimally intrusive,compulsory extraction of dna,as required by our indexing statute.
we note,too,that our legislature has explicitly set forth as important purposes of the juvenile court act protecting citizens from juvenile crime,holding juvenile offenders directly accountable for their acts,and rehabilitating juveniles to prevent further delinquent behavior.ilcs west.in garvin,we held that dna sampling has a deterrent and rehabilitating effect because it identifies those at risk of reoffending.garvin,at.therefore,maintaining a delinquent juvenile genetic analysis information in state and national data banks for law enforcement purposes advances,rather than conflicts with,the goals of our juvenile court act.see in re calvin,th at,d at the juvenile court goals of protecting the public and rehabilitating the minor are aided by dna testing of juvenile felons by facilitating the detection,apprehension,and conviction of offenders.
lakisha next argues that the fourth amendment reasonableness balance must tip in her favor because the state interests in obtaining an adjudicated minor dna are not as compelling as they are for a convicted felon.according to lakisha,adjudicated minors are not as culpable as adult offenders see in re rodney,no suggestion or taint of criminality attaches to any finding of delinquency,quoting in re dow,d,and have a greater potential for reform roper simmons,d,it would be misguided to equate the failings of a minor with those of an adult,for a greater possibility exists that a minor character deficiencies will be reformed.she maintains,therefore,that there is less potential that a juvenile dna will be useful for solving future crime,particularly when the juvenile has been adjudicated based on the commission of a nonsexual offense.she concludes that extracting dna from juvenile offenders who commit nonsexual felony offenses does not advance state interests and,as a result,the dna indexing statute is constitutionally unreasonable when applied to them.lakisha further adds that,when weighing the state interests,we should also recognize that the indexing statute,as applied to juveniles,sweeps too broadly because it permits the state to retain and perpetually examine a delinquent juvenile dna while affording juveniles only limited opportunity to have their dna expunged from the database.ilcs west expungement is available only upon reversal of a conviction based on actual innocence or the granting of a pardon.
we find lakisha reasoning to be faulty.while it may be true that juveniles,because of their lack of maturity,often act impetuously and may be more easily influenced by others,that does not negate the fact that juvenile crime is a serious concern of the state.our legislature has declared that despite the large investment of resources committed to address the needs of the juvenile justice system of this state,cost of juvenile crime continues to drain the state existing financial capacity,and exacts traumatic and tragic physical,psychological and economic damage to victims.ilcs west.in addition,our legislature has recognized that many adults in the criminal justice system were once delinquents in the juvenile justice system.ilcs west.thus,lakisha assertion that the collection,analysis,and storage of delinquent juveniles dna does not advance the fundamental concerns of the state and law enforcement for promoting an effective and accurate criminal justice system and increasing public safety garvin,at,can not be sustained.
also,we continue to believe,as we held in garvin,that a person status as a nonsexual felony offender does not diminish the state interest in the person dna.there are a number of ways that a nonsexual offender might leave behind dna and,as techniques in dna retrieval and analysis continue to advance,the possibility that such person dna information will be useful in solving future crimes should increase.garvin,at.
finally,to the extent that lakisha presents an overbreadth argument,it must be rejected.as we said in garvin,the overbreadth doctrine has only been applied in relation to first amendment constitutional challenges.it is not cognizable in the context of a fourth amendment challenge.garvin,at.
lakisha raises one last argument in her fourth amendment challenge to illinois dna indexing statute.she argues that,when deciding reasonableness,the balancing test here must be different from that in garvin because the indexing statute has been amended and now permits genetic marker
