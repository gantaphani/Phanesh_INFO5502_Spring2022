the department of children and family services department seeks a writ of mandate to reverse respondent court order dismissing a petition filed under welfare and institutions code section,subdivisions b and d respondent court dismissed the petition,finding that a male,was not at substantial risk of sexual abuse by,father,even though father was convicted of sexually assaulting young boys on two separate occasions,was civilly committed as a sexually violent predator svp for almost years after his year prison term,and discontinued any sex offender treatment after his release in.we conclude the record does not contain substantial evidence to overcome the presumption of jurisdiction set forth in section,subdivision d.the department petition is therefore granted.
factual and procedural background 
father and sex crimes 
in,father pled guilty to violating penal code section,committing lewd and lascivious acts with a minor under.according to the police report,father sodomized a boy on june.the crime took place at an elementary school,and the victim claimed father grabbed the victim around his neck,choking him,and kept him from screaming by placing his hand over the victim mouth.afterwards,father told the victim you better not tell anybody or i kill you.the victim reported the incident to his grandmother,who notified police.a medical exam confirmed signs of sexual assault.police questioned father,and he admitted to sodomizing the victim.nothing in the police report mentions any other suspects or participants.
father again sodomized a young boy in january while on probation for his earlier sex crime.father was years old and his victim was six years old.father lured the victim to his bedroom with a promise of toys,and after sodomizing the child,father gave the victim a twinkie and told him not to tell anyone because father would get in trouble.the victim reported the incident to his mother,and a medical examination revealed a small tear on the top of his anus,which was good evidence that the victim had been the victim of a recent sexual assault.when questioned by police,father again admitted the crime and also disclosed that he had been arrested two years earlier for a similar crime.he was convicted of violating penal code section and subdivision c of penal code section sodomy of person under years with a year age difference.father served seven years in prison.
father civil commitment as a n svp 
father was clinically evaluated during his prison sentence to determine whether he qualified as an svp under sections et.the evaluating psychologist,gary zinik,opined father was sexually attracted to males and also suffered from polysubstance abuse for cocaine,alcohol,marijuana,and pcp phencyclidine.zinik noted alcohol and drugs made it easier for father to act without conscience on his sexual impulses toward children.the doctor further observed that a widely accepted psychiatric reference guide explained that pedophilia is usually chronic especially those attracted to males.the recidivism rate for individuals with pedophilia involving a preference for males is roughly twice that for those who prefer females.father offense record shows that he clearly fits this profile.the district attorney petitioned for father to be civilly committed as an svp in june and again in december.father was evaluated by mental health professionals who concluded that he suffered from a diagnosed mental disorder,and as a result of the disorder is predisposed to the commission of sexual acts to such a degree that he constitutes a menace to the health and safety of others.although the disposition of the petition is not in the record,a jury found the petition true,and in december,father was civilly committed as an svp.
father was held in state mental hospitals for nearly years and was subject to numerous psychological evaluations during that time.the record at trial included psychological evaluations between april,and february.until,the evaluators consistently concluded that father was likely to commit sexually violent offenses in the future.father was not willing to enroll in the second phase of a treatment program for sexual offenders because he did not consider himself a child molester.in a january evaluation with dawn starr,father stated his plans after release would be to move in with his mother in alabama and care for her,then get a job and move in with his girlfriend,register as a sex offender,continue with narcotics anonymous na and alcoholics anonymous aa meetings,and continue his muslim beliefs.he said he did not participate in sex offender treatment because he considered it a waste of time.he identified alcohol,drugs,and having too much spare time as potential risks.a report by douglas korpi,in the same time frame states father has consistently informed all who have asked that he does not suffer a sexual disorder,is not a child molester and does not require treatment.he has been quite frank about this if he is released he will not seek treatment.
for the first time in a report dated march,starr concluded father was no longer likely to commit sexually violent crimes in the future.starr conclusion was based on the fact that father planned to seek therapy with jan brown,a sex therapist,when he returned to alabama and appeared committed to sobriety and a socially acceptable lifestyle.starr reiterated her concern about father likelihood of future sexual offending and recognized that without a court order,father participation in treatment would be voluntary.she believed,however,with the support of his family,father would stay committed to therapy.given father new commitment to therapy,starr concluded father was not likely to commit future sexually violent offenses.
gary zinik evaluated father in the same time frame and concluded that father remained a danger to others,was likely to commit sexually violent crimes in the future due to a mental disorder,and continued to meet the criteria of an svp.zinik recognized that father had quit smoking,attended anger management and interpersonal skill classes,and regularly participated in muslim religious activities.father seemed sincere about his muslim religious practices and hoped his religion would keep him from reoffending.zinick noted father had stopped attending meetings eight months earlier.father identified himself as a sex offender and admitted he needed sex offender and substance abuse treatment,but refused to participate in the hospital sex offender treatment program because he did not believe he had a mental disorder.zinik was aware of father plans to seek therapy from jan brown after his release,but considered this plan insufficient because the proposed group therapy sessions met only once every two weeks.in zinik opinion,father needed intensive sex offender treatment and his history of refusing treatment lowered the chances he would stay in treatment.zinik notes father motivation for sex offender treatment is questionable,since he has refused sex offender treatment at the state hospital for the past six years if he were to be released,he would not be under any supervision.he would be accountable to no one and there would be no way to ensure that he would get the treatment he needs to reduce the risk to reoffend.
father began the second phase of a treatment program for sex offenders in early.when asked what motivated him to begin the second phase after almost years of civil commitment,he explained that he did not like the way the program was run at atascadero state hospital,but that the program at coalinga was different.specifically,the treatment contract at atascadero required him to admit he had a problem,but the contract at coalinga made no mention of such a requirement.later in,he prepared a release plan detailing the steps he planned to follow to make a successful transition back into the community when released.father stated that upon his release,he would leave california to reside with his mother and year old nephew in alabama.the release plan stated father understood the responsibility of being accountable.he planned to follow all sex offender registration laws,keep a daily journal,set up daily call times so that his support group knows his whereabouts at all times,and practice full disclosure with employers,landlords,neighbors,and members of the na group he planned to attend.
psychological evaluations in and reached varying conclusions about father likelihood to commit future sex crimes.those psychologists who concluded father no longer met the criteria for svps emphasized father attendance at programs,his muslim faith,and his recognition of the need for continued treatment.evaluators responded positively to the fact that father was attending treatment and appeared committed to continuing treatment after his release.they continued to diagnose father as suffering from mental disorders,including pedophilia and drug and alcohol dependence.at least one psychologist diagnosed him as having pedophilia,drug and alcohol dependence,and antisocial personality disorder but concluded that because the norms for a psychological test called the static had changed since,father predicted risk level had fallen so he no longer met the criteria for an svp.
father release from civil commitment 
on april,the court denied the district attorney petition to recommit father as an svp.it also granted district attorney motion to dismiss earlier recommitment petitions dated september,and october,and ordered father released forthwith.nothing in the record or the briefs provides any reason why the district attorney moved to dismiss the and petitions,or whether the court considered the possibility of imposing conditions on father release.a social worker interviewed the district attorney,who recalled the doctors and father all agreed that father needed to continue to participate in ongoing,treatment for sex offenders after his release.the district attorney claimed father was in denial about his issues,and she did not trust father with any child.
department investigations of possible risk to children living with father 
less than eight months after his release,father moved in with mother and her daughter,in november,the department investigated a report that father,a convicted pedophile,was residing with mother and.when the department informed mother of father criminal history,mother separated from father in order to protect,and the department closed the matter without filing a petition.at some point thereafter,mother reunited with father and became pregnant,a male and the subject of the current petition,was born in june.
the department received another referral concerning mother and father on september.the caller reported mother and father smoked marijuana around,and father was a registered sex offender.the department conducted an investigation,interviewing mother,father,and a maternal uncle who occasionally resided with mother.father admitted his criminal history and denied he was subject to any conditions as a registered sex offender.father stated he lived with his sister in los angeles but spent the night at mother apartment three to five nights a week because mother works nights.a long beach police officer was present at the initial visit and advised father that he would need to register in long beach even if he maintained a separate residence in los angeles.father agreed to do so.father also admitted he smoked marijuana and drank beer on occasion.
mother is slightly developmentally disabled.she told the investigating social worker she knew about father criminal history but was unaware of what type of child abuse father went to prison for.she explained that is his past and i know him now.the investigating social worker asked father to describe his past convictions to mother in the social worker presence.father began by reminding mother that he had been molested by his cousin as a child.he explained that the arrest stemmed from the fact that he was present while his cousin was molesting another child and denied participating in the molestation.he admitted he was arrested for sodomy in.mother did not know what sodomy was and father had to explain it to her.the department report from its investigation reflected mother was similarly confused about father past but had eventually agreed to separate from father in order to avoid the department involvement.
in different interviews with the department,father repeatedly minimized the significance of his earlier sex crimes,his diagnosis as a pedophile,and his designation as an svp.on september,father denied participating in the molestation that led to his arrest in,attributing the molestation to his cousin.father said he had received sex offender treatment at the state hospitals from to,but he did not need professional support after his release.on october,father took the position that it was unfair of the department to take his earlier crimes into consideration,because he had already served his time and been to treatment.when told the severity of his earlier sex crimes was a cause for significant concern,father responded it not like it seems.regarding his mental health diagnoses,he claimed that while he was at the state hospital,he was classified as but that was only while he was incarcerated.father emphasized that since his release,he had not been involved with law enforcement and respected the law.on november,father claimed he had changed and no longer was the person who had committed the crimes.he said he completed sex abuse classes while in the hospital.father said he would not hurt and repeatedly insisted he needed unmonitored visits.in a may interview,father said he did not remember if he went to therapy when he first got out of the hospital in.father denied being diagnosed with a mental illness and said he was not eligible for disability because he did not suffer from any mental disorder.
father statements also demonstrate that after he was released from civil commitment in,he did not continue the rehabilitative activities that led to his release.rather than continuing to attend meetings as planned,he was drinking beer and smoking marijuana while living with mother.his release plan emphasized the importance of complying with sex offender registration requirements,yet while the dependency investigation and case was proceeding,father failed to register as required.a february,police report stated father was to register as an svp every days,and his last day period expired on june,without father registering.on october,a los angeles police officer conducted a compliance check at father residence,and he was not home.the officer left his card and requested father contact the officer.as of february,father had not contacted the officer or registered.
father also did not follow through on his plan to marry,the woman he identified as his fiance during his civil commitment.he became romantically involved with mother instead.is mother aunt and raised mother from childhood.father stated he believed called in the referral because she was upset that father and mother had formed a romantic relationship.
dependency court proceedings 
the department filed a petition on october,alleging that father is a registered sex offender and has a criminal history of sex abuse convictions for sodomy with a minor under years old.the petition further alleged that mother was aware of father criminal history and failed to protect the child by allowing father to reside in the home with unlimited access to the child.the department alleged these facts placed the child at risk of physical harm,damage,danger,sexual abuse,and failure to protect.
respondent court held a detention hearing,found father to be a presumed father,found a prima facie case,and released the child to both parents.the department petitioned for a stay of the court order and authority to,which we granted on october.respondent court amended its order,granting father monitored visits only,in accordance with the directions provided by this court.
on january,respondent court ruled that all evaluations of father ordered by a court or the department of corrections were discoverable and not privileged,but other physician and psychological records were privileged and not discoverable.the court ordered evaluations from father civil commitment proceedings produced.
expert report 
on may,barry hirsch completed a report evaluating the risk father presented of sexually molesting his son.he prepared the report under contract with the department but did not interview father or mother because they both declined to be interviewed.hirsch is a psychologist with years of experience working with sexual offenders and years experience as a forensic psychological evaluator.hirsch reviewed father criminal history,department reports,and father mental health evaluations and concluded that father presented a serious and risk of sexually grooming sexual grooming consists of planning and deliberate behaviors to befriend and establish an emotional connection with a child to have the child lower and abandon whatever inhibitions the child might have against inappropriate sexual activities.the risk of sexual grooming therefore creates a risk that father will molest at some point.in hirsch opinion,father would wait until the court was no longer focused upon him,his son,and mother before beginning to groom and sexually molest his son.
hirsch based his opinion on a number of facts.father had resisted sexual offender treatment until everyone told him that if he obtained treatment he would be released.the state hospital had a sex offender treatment program that typically takes four years to complete.father had only participated in a little over a year in phase two of the program.father presented a treatment plan to attend treatment for his sexually deviant interest,attend local meetings,and settle down with his fiance.once released,however,father repudiated any need for continued sex offender treatment,never attended meetings,and abandoned his plans to marry instead,he began using marijuana and drinking beer,both identified triggers for predatory acts.father moved in with and impregnated mother,who demonstrated such a lack of insight into the nature of his prior crimes that she reconciled with him after learning of his status as a registered sex offender,had a child with him,and trusted him to care for their son alone overnight.in addition,father failed to register as a sex offender after the department filed a petition asking the court to exercise dependency jurisdiction based on his criminal history and former status as an svp.father sought to introduce expert testimony through a telephonic or video appearance,but the court denied his motion.
on june,respondent court held a jurisdictional hearing,admitting numerous reports and evaluations,and taking testimony from hirsch.the department also sought to question father,but father asserted a right against under the fifth amendment of the united states constitution and was not required to take the stand.
on july,respondent court dismissed the section petition,finding no substantial risk was proven to support jurisdiction over.the department filed the petition for extraordinary relief and sought a stay of respondent court dismissal.minor counsel submitted a preliminary opposition.this court granted the stay and issued an alternative writ.
respondent court failed to comply with our writ,which directed it to reverse its order denying jurisdiction and to enter a new jurisdictional order over instead of entering a new jurisdictional order as directed,the court set an adjudication hearing on the petition for december.neither respondent nor any real party in interest filed a return.this court heard oral argument on the petition on november.
discussion 
we note preliminarily that respondent court and real parties in interest have admitted the allegations in the petition because no party filed a return to our alternative writ.in response to an order to show cause,real parties in interest may file a return by demurrer,verified answer,or both.cal.rules of court,rule b.in the absence of a true return,all and verified allegations of the writ petition are accepted as true.bank of america,superior court th,d.nonetheless,we permitted counsel for father and for the minor to appear at oral argument.after considering the petition,the submitted exhibits,and oral argument,we conclude respondent court erred in dismissing the petition.
standard of review 
we review respondent court order for substantial evidence.in re th,d.the term substantial evidence means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind would accept as adequate to support a conclusion it is evidence which is reasonable in nature,credible,and of solid value.citation.ibid.however,substantial evidence is not synonymous with any evidence.citations.a decision supported by a mere scintilla of evidence need not be affirmed on appeal.citation.furthermore,w hile substantial evidence may consist of inferences,such inferences must be a product of logic and reason and must rest on the evidence citation inferences that are the result of mere speculation or conjecture can not support a finding citations.citation.the ultimate test is whether it is reasonable for a trier of fact to make the ruling in question in light of the whole record.citation.in re savannah th,d.
dependency law in the context of sex crimes 
a child falls within the jurisdiction of the dependency court when there is a substantial risk that the child will suffer serious physical harm or illness,as a result of the failure or inability of his or her parent to adequately supervise or protect the child or if there is a substantial risk that the child will be sexually abused,as defined in section of the penal code,by his or her parent,subds.b,d.
penal code section provides an extensive definition of sexual abuse,including t he intentional touching of the genitals or intimate parts of a child for purposes of sexual arousal or gratification,subd.b.the definition of sexual abuse also includes conduct in violation of penal code sections an act of sodomy with another person who is under years of age and more than years younger than the perpetrator and any lewd or lascivious act upon or with the body of a child who is under the age of,subd.a.
the department must show by a preponderance of the evidence that a minor is a child described by one of the subdivisions in section,subd.a.if,however,a parent has been convicted of sexual abuse even for an offense that occurred many years earlier with an unrelated child that conviction is prima facie evidence that the parent own child is a person described by subdivision a,b,c,or d of section and is at substantial risk of abuse or neglect,subd.d see also in re th,d.a parent status as a registered sex offender also provides prima facie evidence that a child is at substantial risk of abuse or neglect,subd.d.the burden of producing evidence then shifts to the offender,rather than the department,subd.d.in establishing this presumption of risk,the legislature sought to focus on the heightened risk facing minors who come into contact with sex offenders and to ensure the juvenile court has information about such persons when assessing jurisdictional facts.in re john th,d.an uncodified section of the bill adding this presumption explains the legislature intent the legislature finds that children of the state of california are placed at risk when permitted contact with a parent or caretaker who has committed a sex crime.further,the legislature finds that children subject to juvenile court dependency jurisdiction based on allegations of molestation are in need of protection from those persons.therefore,the purpose of section is to ensure that information regarding those acts is appropriately considered by the juvenile court in determining whether a child is in need of juvenile court dependency protection.stats,ch.
