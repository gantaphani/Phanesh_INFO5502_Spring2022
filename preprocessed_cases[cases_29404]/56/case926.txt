the issue on appeal is whether a court has discretion to order a juvenile disposition after a minor with no known prior criminal history pleads guilty to second degree robbery and admits personal firearm use on a discretionary direct file for which proposition authorizes,but does not mandate,a criminal trial instead of a juvenile hearing the minor,alonza rydell thomas,entered a store with a firearm and demanded money.after the firearm discharged in a struggle for control of the weapon,harming no one,store clerks subdued him.the prosecutor charged him with,inter alia,second degree robbery with personal firearm use,subd.c,subd.a,subd.b.at age,he pled guilty to second degree robbery,admitted the personal firearm use allegation,and made a motion for a juvenile disposition,subd.c,subd.b.after the prosecutor opposed,and the court denied,his motion,the court imposed a state prison sentence.
before adjudicating the issue on appeal,we must address three foundational questions is proposition constitutional does the statutory requirement that a prosecutor consent before a court can order a juvenile disposition on a discretionary direct file violate the state constitution separation of powers doctrine does a statute that the legislature passed unanimously and that changes to the accused benefit the applicability of a statute within proposition operate retrospectively we will answer all three questions in the affirmative.
on the facts and the law here,we will hold that a court has express statutory discretion to order placement in a juvenile hall,ranch,camp,or the youth authority or to impose an adult sentence instead.the record shows no awareness by the court of that discretion,however,so we will affirm the judgment,order the state prison sentence stricken from the judgment,and remand the matter for an exercise of informed judicial discretion.
discussion 
constitutionality of proposition 
thomas argues that proposition violates the initiative rule cal,art.ii,subd.d and that the discretionary direct file authority enacted into welfare and institutions code section,subdivision d by proposition violates state constitutional guarantees of separation of powers cal,art.iii,equal protection of the laws,art.i,subd.a,uniform operation of laws,art.iv,and due process of law,art.i,subd.a.
after briefing was complete here,the supreme court adjudicated challenges like thomas.the court held that proposition does not violate the initiative rule cal,art.ii,subd.d,that the grant of discretion to the prosecutor by welfare and institutions code section,subdivision d to file criminal charges against certain minors without a judicial fitness hearing does not violate the separation of powers doctrine cal,art.iii,that the elimination of a judicial fitness hearing by that statute does not violate due process of law cal,art.i,subd.a,and that the grant of discretion to the prosecutor by welfare and institutions code section,subdivision d to file criminal charges against some minors but not others does not violate equal protection of the laws cal,art.i,subd.a or the uniform operation of the laws doctrine,art.iv.manduley superior court cal th,d.
ii.constitutionality of penal code section,subdivision a 
thomas argues that a court has discretion to order a juvenile disposition on a discretionary direct file.the attorney general argues the contrary.at the heart of the issue is a statute requiring a court to secure a prosecutor consent to order a juvenile disposition on a discretionary direct file 
notwithstanding any other provision of law,the following shall apply to a person sentenced pursuant to section.subject to the knowing and intelligent consent of both the prosecution and the person being sentenced pursuant to this section,the court may order a juvenile disposition under the juvenile court law,in lieu of a sentence under this code,upon a finding that such an order would serve the best interests of justice,protection of the community,and the person being sentenced.prior to ordering a juvenile disposition,the court shall cause to be received into evidence a social study by the probation officer,prepared pursuant to section of the welfare and institutions code,and shall state that the social study made by the probation officer has been read and considered by the court,subd.a,italics added.
on the threshold question of whether requiring a prosecutor consent violates the state constitution separation of powers doctrine,we examine relevant case law.see cal,art.iii,
in the seminal case of people tenorio cal d,tenorio,the supreme court held that a statute requiring a court to secure a prosecutor consent to dismiss an allegation of a prior conviction violates the state constitution separation of powers doctrine by improperly invading the constitutional province of the judiciary 
when the decision to prosecute has been made,the process which leads to acquittal or to sentencing is fundamentally judicial in nature.just as the fact of prosecutorial discretion prior to charging a criminal offense does not imply prosecutorial discretion to convict without a judicial determination of guilt,discretion to forgo prosecution does not imply discretion to sentence without a judicial determination of those factors which the legislature has never denied are within the judicial power to determine and which relate to punishment.the judicial power is compromised when a judge,who believes that a charge should be dismissed in the interests of justice,wishes to exercise the power to dismiss but finds that before he may do so he must bargain with the prosecutor.the judicial power must be independent,and a judge should never be required to pay for its exercise.id.at.
in the years after tenorio,the supreme court applied the rationale of that case to several analogous situations.in esteybar municipal court cal d,the court held that a statute requiring a magistrate to secure a prosecutor consent to determine that a wobbler is a misdemeanor rather than a felony violates the separation of powers doctrine see,subd.b 
since the exercise of a judicial power may not be conditioned upon the approval of either the executive or legislative branches of government,requiring the district attorney consent in determining the charge on which a defendant shall be held to answer violates the doctrine of separation of powers.esteybar municipal court,supra,cal d at.
in people navarro cal d,the supreme court held that a statute requiring a court to secure a prosecutor consent to order a posttrial commitment to a narcotic detention,treatment,and rehabilitation facility violates the separation of powers doctrine 
the imposition of sentence and the exercise of sentencing discretion are fundamentally and inherently judicial functions.citation.it bears reiteration that the legislature,of course,by general laws can control eligibility for probation,parole and the term of imprisonment,but it can not abort the judicial process by subjecting a judge to the control of the district attorney.id.at,fns.omitted.
in people superior court on tai ho cal d,the supreme court held that a statute requiring a court to secure a prosecutor consent to order pretrial diversion to a narcotic treatment and rehabilitation program violates the separation of powers doctrine 
w hen the jurisdiction of a court has been properly invoked by the filing of a criminal charge,the disposition of that charge becomes a judicial responsibility with the development of more sophisticated responses to the wide range of antisocial behavior traditionally subsumed under the heading of crime,alternative means of disposition have been confided to the judiciary.id.at.
in davis municipal court cal d,the court held that a local rule on wobblers precluding diversion to those whom a prosecutor charges with felonies while permitting diversion to those whom a prosecutor charges with misdemeanors does not violate the separation of powers doctrine.the local rule granted discretion that a prosecutor could exercise before the filing of a criminal charge,but the challenged statutes at issue in tenorio and progeny purported to give a prosecutor the right to veto a decision made by a court after criminal charges had already been filed.none of the cases suggests that the exercise of prosecutorial discretion prior to the filing of such charges improperly subordinates the judicial branch to the executive in violation of the constitution,even though the prosecutor exercise of such charging discretion inevitably affects the sentencing or other dispositional options available to the court.davis municipal court,supra,at.like the challenged statutes at issue in tenorio and progeny,penal code section,subdivision a purports to give a prosecutor the right to veto a decision that a court makes after the filing of a criminal charge.
manduley stresses the critical distinction between discretion before and discretion after the filing of a criminal charge.tenorio and progeny establish that the separation of powers doctrine prohibits the legislative branch from granting prosecutors the authority,after charges have been filed,to control the legislatively specified sentencing choices available to a court.a statute conferring upon prosecutors the discretion to make certain decisions before the filing of charges,on the other hand,is not invalid simply because the prosecutor exercise of such charging discretion necessarily affects the dispositional options available to the court.manduley superior court,supra,cal th at,d.because welfare and institutions code section d does not confer upon the prosecutor any authority to interfere with the court choice of legislatively specified sentencing alternatives after an action has been commenced pursuant to that statute,we conclude that section d does not violate the separation of powers doctrine.ibid.
in people superior court romero cal th,d,romero,the supreme court approved the application of the rationale in tenorio to analogous situations in later cases and stated the fundamental principle in that line of authority when the jurisdiction of a court has been properly invoked by the filing of a criminal charge,the disposition of that charge becomes a judicial responsibility.romero,supra,at,d.romero implemented that principle and avoided finding a violation of the separation of powers doctrine by construing a provision of the three strikes law so as not to require a prosecutor consent to the exercise of a court authority on its own motion to strike a strike prior at sentencing.id.at,d,subd.f.
the discretion that penal code section,subdivision a grants to a court to order a juvenile disposition on a discretionary direct file indisputably constitutes a judicial responsibility squarely within the scope of a ll of the subsequent cases applying tenorio to invalidate legislative provisions see davis municipal court,supra,cal d at.like the statutes in tenorio and progeny,penal code section,subdivision a authorizes the exercise of a prosecutorial veto after the filing of criminal charges,when the criminal proceeding has already come within the aegis of the judicial branch.davis municipal court,supra,at.
we hold that the requirement of penal code section,subdivision a that on a discretionary direct file a court must secure a prosecutor consent to order a juvenile disposition violates the state constitution separation of powers doctrine cal,art.iii.since the constitutionally infirm requirement of a prosecutor consent is severable from the rest of that statute see people navarro,supra,cal d at,we turn to the issue of whether thomas is entitled to relief from the denial of his motion for a juvenile disposition 
iii.informed judicial discretion on a discretionary direct file 
thomas argues that the court was not aware of its discretion on a discretionary direct file to order a juvenile disposition or to impose an adult sentence and that a remand is necessary to allow the court to exercise that discretion.the attorney general argues that the court had no discretion and that no remand is necessary.
proposition mandates a criminal prosecution,without a judicial fitness hearing,of a minor years of age or older whom a prosecutor charges with a specified murder or serious sex offense.welf,subd.b.proposition authorizes a discretionary direct file,without a judicial fitness hearing,of a minor years of age or older against whom a prosecutor brings a different statutorily designated charge or allegation.welf,subd.d.here,the allegation of personal firearm use authorized the discretionary direct file against thomas,subd.a welf,subd.d b.
commenting on welfare and institutions code section,subdivision d,the statute at issue in manduley,the supreme court observed that t he prosecutor discretionary charging decision is no different from the numerous prefiling decisions made by prosecutors that limit the dispositions available to the court after charges have been filed.conferring such authority upon the prosecutor does not limit the judicial power,after charges have been filed,to choose among the dispositional alternatives specified by the legislative branch.manduley superior court,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.one of those alternatives is the discretion that penal code section,subdivision a grants to a court to order a juvenile disposition on a discretionary direct file.manduley characterizes as only a general rule the statutory preclusion of a juvenile disposition by welfare and institutions code section,subdivision d if the prosecutor initiates a proceeding in criminal court,and the circumstances specified in section d are found to be true,the court generally is precluded by statute from ordering a juvenile disposition.welf,subd.b see.manduley superior court,supra,at,d,italics added.
in manduley,the supreme court noted that the prosecutor traditionally broad power to charge crimes extends to selecting the forum manduley superior court,supra,cal th at,d.by selecting the forum,the prosecutor selects the procedure and protocol of that forum.by choosing a discretionary direct file,the prosecutor not only invokes the rigorous adversarial character of a criminal trial but also adds a dimension of evidence,findings,and rulings with which to inform the exercise of judicial discretion in selecting a juvenile disposition or an adult sentence.
as the supreme court observed,the voters,through the enactment of proposition,have determined that the judiciary shall not make the determination regarding a minor fitness for a juvenile disposition where the prosecutor initiates a criminal action pursuant to welfare and institutions code section d.manduley superior court,supra,cal th at,d,fn.omitted.we read that sentence as an articulation of the statutory mandate of welfare and institutions code section,subdivision d in any case in which the district attorney has filed an accusatory pleading against a minor in a court of criminal jurisdiction pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision,the case shall then proceed according to the laws applicable to a criminal case.
for two reasons,we decline to make a broader inference from that sentence.first,not once did manduley cite penal code section,subdivision a,the part of that statute in which the legislature expressly granted judicial discretion to order a juvenile disposition on a discretionary direct file.that part of that statute was simply not at issue in that case.it is axiomatic that cases are not authority for propositions not considered.people nguyen cal th,d,people gilbert cal d,fn.second,manduley itself notes that a prosecutor decision to file charges against a minor in criminal court pursuant to welfare and institutions code section d is not analogous to a prosecutor veto of a court legislatively authorized determination,after a judicial hearing,of a defendant suitability for a particular disposition manduley superior court,supra,cal th at,d.
on that rationale,as the prosecutor authority in welfare and institutions code section,subdivision d to make a discretionary direct file survives a separation of powers analysis,so the requirement in penal code section,subdivision a that a court secure a prosecutor consent to order a juvenile disposition on a discretionary direct file does not.in short,a prosecutor exercise of discretion before the filing of a criminal charge is not at all inconsistent
