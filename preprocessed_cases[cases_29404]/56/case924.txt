minor adrian was charged along with two other juveniles with committing misdemeanor assault and battery for the benefit of,at the direction of or in association with a criminal street gang in violation of section d of the penal code on march.after a jurisdictional hearing,the court sustained the assault charge as to all three juveniles and continued minor as a ward of the juvenile court.
at the dispositional hearing,the court placed minor with his grandparents and imposed a number of probation conditions,including the following no contact with the other two juveniles involved in the offense or the victim you are not to be present at any known gang gatherings,you not to be around anyone whom you know is in a gang.over minor constitutional objections,the court found that the crime was and it ordered minor to register pursuant to penal code sections and.
on appeal minor contends that the gang registration statutes are unconstitutional.he contends the initiative that enacted them violated the rule.he also contends the statutes are vague and overbroad and infringe on his rights to due process,privacy,free speech,association,and counsel and his protections against,unreasonable search and search,and cruel and unusual punishment.for the reasons stated below,we will affirm the dispositional order after adopting a narrowing construction of the statutes.
the offense 
on march,gerardo,took the school bus home from aptos high school.he got off the bus at hyde,an elementary school in watsonville near a department of motor vehicles dmv office.
according to deputy sheriff raymond hernandez,a gang expert,the bus stop is in the middle of a norteño neighborhood.hernandez can tell by the graffiti and by norteño crimes in the neighborhood.norteños and sureños are rival hispanic gangs in prison and on the streets who fight for territory.aptos high school has a reputation for being a sureño school.
as gerardo walked home with his friend,miguel,a group of four or five guys walked after them.as gerardo crossed the street,one of the guys yelled,norte califas we go down right here for it.someone yelled,puro norte,and,this is our barrio.here everything goes for norte.they asked gerardo to approach.he responded that he claimed nothing and did not care.he was telling them that he was not related to a gang.
gerardo continued to walk away.he ran when he saw them running after him.gerardo went into the dmv office for safety and looked back at the juveniles.gerardo called his mother from the dmv office.when he got home they called the police.
later that day a police officer apprehended four juveniles meeting gerardo description.gerardo identified three of them in the field as among his pursuers,including minor,luis,and albert gerardo recognized albert from aptos high.
according to gang expert hernandez,the words used amounted to gang challenges claiming the area for norteños and asking sureños to fight.a gang member can not back down from a challenge.a gang member can not refrain from aiding a fellow gang member in a fight.
according to hernandez,minor is a documented member of a gang called clifford manor locos cml,one of a number of watsonville norteño gangs.minor was involved in a misdemeanor assault two or three blocks away at the end of the prior year.minor and another individual approached a fellow who was walking home to clifford manor apartments from the aptos high bus stop.they asked him what he claimed.he said,nothing.he was beaten,kicked,and stabbed with a pen,while they said,it all about cml and norte.
according to hernandez,different norteños gangs used to fight with each other,but a few years ago the word came down from the prison gangs that all norteños should get along.now members of different norteño gangs commit joint assaults on perceived sureños.albert belongs to watsonville varrio norte wvn,another norteño gang.luis is a norteño associate.
according to hernandez,assaulting perceived sureños is a primary activity of cml.hernandez provided evidence of an assault conviction of sergio hernandez,a cml member,an assault conviction of carlos hernandez,a cml member,and an assault conviction of mike deanda,a wvn member.in raymond hernandez opinion,the current crime was committed under that umbrella for norteño,or norte,and specifically to benefit cml.
at the end of the dispositional hearing,the juvenile court stated,the people have sustained their burden regarding the gang elements.the court concluded that minor had committed an assault.h ad we not had the gang elements,three fifteen,individuals saying things like this without the gang overtures,it would be a completely different matter.
the statutory scheme 
penal code sections through were enacted as part of proposition,the gang violence and juvenile crime prevention act of upon a court finding that a person was involved in a crime,subd.b,the court is required to notify the person of his or her duty to register with the chief of police of the city in which he or she resides,or the sheriff of the county if he or she resides in an unincorporated area,within days of release from custody or within days of his or her arrival in any city,county,or city and county to reside there,whichever occurs first,subd.a,subd.a a.registration requirements are spelled out in section.the registration requirements last for five years,subd.c.a registrant must keep law enforcement apprised of any change of address,subd.b.it is a misdemeanor to knowingly violate the registration requirements,subd.a.
the single subject rule 
manduley superior court cal th,d,among other things concluded that proposition does not violate the rule,set forth in article ii,section,subdivision d,of the california constitution,applicable to initiative measures.id.at,d.this answers minor claims that the proposition violates the rule.id.at,d.
vagueness of crimes 
the statute applies by its terms to three types of crimes.section provides in part b subdivision a shall apply to any person convicted in a criminal court or who has had a petition sustained in a juvenile court in this state for any of the following offenses 
subdivision a of section.
any crime where the enhancement specified in subdivision b of section is found to be true.
any crime that the court finds is gang related at the time of sentencing or disposition.
here the juvenile court ordered registration after finding that minor crime was a crime under section,subdivision b.on appeal minor renews his contention that is unconstitutionally vague.minor argues that the word gang has no fixed or established meaning and means different things in different jurisdictions,thereby encouraging arbitrary enforcement.
people castenada cal th,d,explained recently,the united states supreme court had this to say on the topic vagueness may invalidate a criminal law for either of two independent reasons.first,it may fail to provide the kind of notice that will enable ordinary people to understand what conduct it prohibits second,it may authorize and even encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.chicago morales,d.id.at,d.v ague sentencing provisions may pose constitutional questions if they do not state with sufficient clarity the consequences of violating a given criminal statute.batchelder,d.
the word gang in isolation has many and varied meanings.lanzetta new jersey.people lopez th,d.without further definition it may be unconstitutionally vague.lanzetta new jersey,supra,at.see people lopez,supra,th at,d.
as we shall explain,in its statutory context gang in section,subdivision b has a specific and limited meaning.we observe that the offense described in related section,subdivision b and the enhancement described in related section,subdivision b are concerned specifically with one type of gang,a criminal street gang.section,subdivision a,mentioned in section,subdivision b,prohibits active participation in any criminal street gang with knowledge that its members engage in or have engaged in a pattern of criminal gang activity,and who willfully promotes,furthers,or assists in any felonious criminal conduct by members of that gang.section,subdivision b,mentioned in section,subdivision b,prohibits commission of any felony for the benefit of,at the direction of,or in association with any criminal street gang,with the specific intent to promote,further,or assist in any criminal conduct by gang members.
the phrase criminal street gang is defined elsewhere in the statute.section,subdivision f states as used in this chapter,criminal street gang means any ongoing organization,association,or group of three or more persons,whether formal or informal,having as one of its primary activities the commission of one or more of the criminal acts enumerated in paragraphs to,inclusive,of subdivision e,having a common name or common identifying sign or symbol,and whose members individually or collectively engage in or have engaged in a pattern of criminal gang activity.
section,subdivision e adds to this definition.it enumerates offenses which can identify a gang and it states as used in this chapter,pattern of criminal gang activity means the commission of,attempted commission of,conspiracy to commit,or solicitation of,sustained juvenile petition for,or conviction of two or more of the following offenses,provided at least one of these offenses occurred after the effective date of this chapter and the last of those offenses occurred within three years after a prior offense,and the offenses were committed on separate occasions,or by two or more persons 
we recognize that section,subdivision b uses the word gang when other parts of the initiative that enacted section specifically employ the phrase criminal street gang.for example,proposition added subdivision d to section ante,fn,which prohibits commission of a public offense punishable as a felony or a misdemeanor,which is committed for the benefit of,at the direction of or in association with,any criminal street gang with the specific intent to promote,further,or assist in any criminal conduct by gang members.it was this subdivision that minor was charged with violating.
but we do not believe the voters intended to distinguish between gang and criminal street gang.findings in the initiative demonstrate the voters concerns.section stated b criminal street gangs and violence pose a significant threat to public safety and the health of many of our communities.criminal street gangs have become more violent,bolder,and better organized in recent years.k dramatic changes are needed in the way we treat juvenile criminals,criminal street gangs,and the confidentiality of the juvenile records of violent offenders if we are to avoid the predicted,unprecedented surge in juvenile and gang violence.voter information guide primary text of,at.as of,
given the concern of the voters with criminal street gangs,we construe gang in section,subdivision b to mean criminal street gang as defined in section,subdivisions e and f.people lopez,supra,th,d reached the same conclusion when the word gang in an adult probation condition was challenged as unconstitutionally vague.id.at,d.
minor also contends that the word related is vague.related is a commonly used word with a broad meaning that encompasses a myriad of relationships.for example,a leading legal dictionary defines related to mean standing in relation connected allied akin.black law dict.ed.bay cities paving grading,lawyers mutual ins.cal th,d.t he fact that related can encompass a wide variety of relationships does not necessarily render the word ambiguous.to the contrary,a word with a broad meaning or multiple meanings may be used for that very achieve a broad purpose.ibid.
again,related must be understood in context.the attorney general suggests that a crime is gang related,when it was committed,in the words of the statute,for the benefit of,at the direction of,or in association with a street gang.people gardeley cal th,d.though this discussion by the california supreme court was not concerned with section,subdivision b,we adopt it as an explanation of related.
we conclude that this narrowing construction of renders the phrase constitutionally clear.
judicial authority to rewrite statutes 
minor recognizes that a court can save a statute from a vagueness challenge by a narrowing construction.in kopp fair pol.practices com.cal th,d,kopp,the california supreme court extensively reconsidered the power of courts to reform or rewrite statutes and initiatives.id.at,d.the court concluded that a court may,rewrite a statute in order to preserve it against invalidation under the constitution,when we can say with confidence that i it is possible to reform the statute in a manner that closely effectuates policy judgments clearly articulated by the enacting body,and ii the enacting body would have preferred the reformed construction to invalidation of the statute.by applying these factors,courts may steer clear of judicial policymaking in the guise of statutory reformation,and thereby avoid encroaching on the legislative function in violation of the separation of powers doctrine.id.at,d.
minor invokes this court statement in in re timothy d.courts will attempt to preserve an enactment constitutionality by a reasonable narrowing construction,franklin leland stanford junior university d,but i f elimination of objectionable parts of a statute requires a wholesale rewriting,a court attempt to do so transgresses both the legislative intent and the judicial function.citation people stevenson cal d,in re king cal d,cert.den,d.id.at.
as explained above,we regard it as consistent with the voters intent to construe gang in section,subdivision b to mean criminal street gang.we are confident the voters would prefer a narrowing construction to invalidation of the statute.
the registration requirement 
on appeal minor challenges the probation condition requiring him to register with local law enforcement.the focus of many of minor objections is section,subdivision a c,which states that upon registration a written statement signed by the juvenile,giving any information that may be required by the law enforcement agency,shall be submitted to the law enforcement agency.
minor contends that a requirement that he disclose any information that may be required by the law enforcement agency is so vague and overbroad as to infringe his constitutional rights to due process,privacy,free speech,association,and counsel,and his protections against,unreasonable search and seizure,and cruel and unusual punishment.
due process and 
as indicated above,to satisfy due process,a statute must provide definite guidelines for the police in order to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.citations.when the legislature fails to provide such guidelines,the mere existence of a criminal statute may permit a standardless sweep that allows police officers,prosecutors and juries to pursue their personal predilections.citations.people heitzman cal th,d.
it is established that the privilege against is violated by a registration statute directed at a highly selective group inherently suspect of criminal activities albertson subversive activities control board,d albertson that requires disclosure of information which would surely prove a significant link in a chain of evidence tending to establish marchetti united states,d marchetti the registrant guilt of a past crime.accordingly,in albertson the united states supreme court set aside orders requiring people to register as communist party members.albertson,supra,d.in other cases,the united states supreme court has held that the privilege applies to statutes requiring disclosure of participation in illegal gambling marchetti,supra,d grosso united states,d,possession of an unregistered firearm haynes united states,d,and possession of marijuana leary united states,d.
while the statute in issue here does not necessarily require disclosure of incriminating information,it broadly requires disclosure of any information that may be required by the law enforcement agency.it seems obvious that a law enforcement agency would be most interested in obtaining incriminating information from those already adjudged to have been involved in crimes.
because the statute targets this group for unlimited disclosure to law enforcement,we consider it distinguishable from vehicle code sections requiring persons involved in vehicle accidents to identify themselves.these statutes are unlike registration schemes aimed at identifying criminal behavior and are essentially regulatory,its purpose being to promote the satisfaction of civil liabilities arising from automobile accidents.people kroncke th,d,quoting from california byers,d.the limited vehicle code disclosure requirements are directed at the public at large rather than at a group suspected of criminal activities.people jiminez th,d,disapproved on other grounds by people kobrin cal th,d.
minor argues that section,subdivision a c,as broadly written,infringes due process and invites violation of the privilege of a registrant,as it provides no guidelines for the information that may be required.kolender lawson,d.the attorney general essentially concedes that the statute must be given a narrowing construction to save it from constitutional infirmity,asserting that the language of section,subdivision a c should be construed to require any information reasonably related to criminal street gang activity.
the attorney general alternatively suggests that law enforcement agencies can ask for information which does not require any,such as the name of the gang to which the juvenile allegedly belongs,the territorial boundaries of that gang or others,names of gang associates or rivals,monikers or aliases,the number of members,the description and license plates of vehicles driven by the registrant or others,employment information,and other locator information.however,there may well be circumstances in which the answers to some of these questions could be incriminatory.as noted above ante,fn,section,subdivision a penalizes criminal knowledge,willful promotion of a felony,and active participation in a criminal street gang.people castenada,supra,cal th at,d.
these observations suggest that a more limited disclosure requirement on registration would not only avoid potential infringement on the privilege against,but also other constitutional problems discussed below.our desire in construing this statute is to provide definite guidelines that address these constitutional concerns.
it is established that routine booking information concerning a person identity and address is not incriminatory.see pennsylvania muniz,d plurality people rucker cal d.the right to remain silent does not apply to questions seeking biographical information for booking purposes.gladden roach,people powell d.
the purposes of registration would be served by construing any information to be limited to information enabling law enforcement to identify and locate the registrant,such as the person full name,any aliases or gang monikers or change of name,the person date of birth,residence address,school or employment,and description and license plate number of any vehicle the person owns or drives.
in other contexts courts have assumed that the legislature requires registration of those criminal offenders who are more likely to repeat their offenses.registration facilitates police surveillance and crime detection and deters recidivism.people castellanos cal th,d,wright superior court cal th,d,in re luisa th,d.presumably the voters had the same reasons for enacting the registration requirement for those adjudged to have committed offenses.this construction does not usurp the initiative process but serves the purposes of the enactors.
we adopt this narrowing construction of section,subdivision a c in order to provide sufficient guidance to law enforcement.to the extent a law enforcement question may ask for more than identifying or locational information,minor is entitled to assert his privilege against.haynes united states,supra,d.as so construed the statute is not unconstitutionally vague.people bailey th,d bailey.
search and seizure 
not only is a registering juvenile supposed to provide any information required,but the juvenile is required to submit fingerprints and a current photograph,subd.a d.minor contends that this procedure will subject him to fingerprinting,photographing,and undetermined and unlimited questioning by law enforcement in a custodial setting,not unlike the booking process.he is not free to leave and he is not free to refuse to answer questions.he has effectively been seized without a warrant and without reasonable or probable cause.
the attorney general responds that minor waived this objection,since it was not among the constitutional arguments he made in the juvenile court.we will assume without deciding that the waiver doctrine does not apply to challenges of probation conditions that raise only pure questions of constitutional law.in re justin th,d contra,people gardineer th,d.
the united states supreme court has explained probation,like incarceration,is a form of criminal sanction imposed by a court upon an offender after verdict,finding,or plea of guilty.probation is one point on a continuum of possible punishments ranging from solitary confinement in a facility to a few hours of mandatory community service.inherent in the very nature of probation is that probationers do not enjoy the absolute liberty to which every citizen is entitled.just as other punishments for criminal convictions curtail an offender freedoms,a court granting probation may impose reasonable conditions that deprive the offender of some freedoms enjoyed by citizens.united states knights,d citations omitted.a minor who is on probation has a reduced expectation of privacy and what might otherwise be an unreasonable intrusion may be reasonable under the fourth amendment to the extent necessitated by legitimate governmental demands.in re tyrell cal th,d,in re binh th,d.we conclude that it is constitutionally reasonable to facilitate crime detection and deter recidivism to require a minor involved in a crime to provide fingerprints and locational information to local law enforcement for a period.weighed against the governmental interest in protecting the public,the modified disclosure requirement does not constitute unreasonable search or seizure.
california express constitutional privacy provision cal,art.i,is perhaps more protective of privacy than the federal constitution.see american academy of pediatrics lungren cal th,d.this provision was enacted to deter governmental collection of information about private citizens.white davis cal d.minor complains about the breadth of questions that he might be asked about himself and others.
loder municipal court cal d,loder explained,in white davis cal d,we observed that the amendment does not purport to prohibit all incursion into individual privacy but rather that any such intervention must be justified by a compelling interest.id.at.loder concluded that there is a substantial governmental interest in retaining records of arrests that do not lead to convictions.id.at.the interest may be characterized generally as the promotion of more efficient law enforcement and criminal justice more specifically,the state purpose is to protect the public from recidivist offenders.id.at.considering the limits on dissemination of arrest information outside of law enforcement,the court concluded that law enforcement retention of this information did not violate the state constitutional right of privacy.id.at.
we note that section provides d the statements,photographs and fingerprints required under this section shall not be open to inspection by any person other than a regularly employed peace or other law enforcement officer.for the same reasons as in loder,we conclude that the state constitution privacy provision does not prohibit requiring this limited disclosure of locational information by those adjudged to have been involved in crimes.this limited invasion of privacy is justified by the needs to deter recidivism and facilitate crime detection.people mills d.sex offender registration people hove th,d drug offender registration.
free speech and association 
minor contends that the disclosure requirement violates his right to free speech,since the right to free speech must,of necessity,include the right not to speak at all.
barenblatt united states,d stated undeniably,the first amendment in some circumstances protects an individual from being compelled to disclose his associational relationships.however,the protections of the first amendment,unlike a proper claim of the privilege against under the fifth amendment,do not afford a witness the right to resist inquiry in all circumstances.where first amendment rights are asserted to bar governmental interrogation resolution of the issue always involves a balancing by the courts of the competing private and public interests at stake in the particular circumstances shown.id.at.employing a balancing test,barenblatt upheld congressional inquiry into communist party membership and associations against a first amendment claim.
people quiroga th,d implicitly applied a balancing test in determining that the first amendment did not justify a suspect refusal to identify himself to the police after being arrested for another crime.while recognizing that the refusal to identify oneself amounts to protected speech id.at,fn,d,the court acknowledged a strong public interest in discovering the identity of a suspect.id.at,d.the routine booking interview is an indispensable procedure in the efficient administration of justice.ibid.the court concluded,in the words of penal code section,appellant act of refusing to disclose his identify at the booking interview unquestionably served to resist,delay and obstruct the responsible peace officer in the discharge of his duties.id.at,d.
applying a balancing test here,we conclude that the governmental interest in detecting and preventing crime outweighs whatever first amendment free speech right minor may have in refusing to provide locational information to law enforcement under the circumstance where he has been adjudged to have participated in a crime.bailey,supra,th,d.our narrowing construction refutes minor challenge that the statute is overbroad.
minor also invokes his first amendment freedom of association.people ex rel.gallo acuna cal th,d,acuna explained in a series of opinions,the united states supreme court has made it clear that,although the constitution recognizes and shields from government intrusion a limited right of association,it does not recognize a generalized right of social association.dallas stanglin,d.
the high court has identified two kinds of associations entitled to first amendment with an intrinsic or intimate value,and those that are instrumental to forms of religious and political expression and activity.of the first,the court has said that it is central to any concept of liberty and is exemplified by personal affiliations that attend the creation and sustenance of a the raising and education of children citation and cohabitation with one relatives.roberts united states jaycees,d.such affiliations,the court has remarked,involve deep attachments and commitments to the necessarily few other individuals with whom one shares not only a special community of thoughts,experiences,and beliefs but also distinctively personal aspects of one life.among other things they are distinguished by such attributes as relative smallness,a high degree of selectivity in decisions to begin and maintain the affiliation,and seclusion from others in critical aspects of the relationship.id.at.
the second kind of association that merits first amendment protection is composed of groups whose members join together for the purpose of pursuing a wide variety of political,social,economic,educational,religious,and cultural ends.roberts united states jaycees,supra,at.this instrumental right of protected association is directly related to the individual freedom to speak,to worship,and to petition the government for the redress of grievances because without it these liberties themselves could scarcely exist,much less thrive.ibid.id.at,d.
roberts united states jaycees,supra,cited naacp alabama,d,as an example of collective effort on behalf of shared goals.id.at.in that case,on which minor relies,the court applied a balancing test before concluding that the state had shown no sufficiently compelling interest to require a political organization to disclose all its members.alabama has fallen short of showing a controlling justification for the deterrent effect on the free enjoyment of the right to associate which disclosure of membership lists is likely to have.naacp alabama,supra,at.
acuna concluded that a street gang conduct in a particular area at issue in this case fails to qualify as either of the two protected forms of association.acuna,supra,cal th at,d.we do not understand acuna to hold broadly that criminal street gangs are not entitled to any first amendment association protection,as the attorney general asserts.however,we see no infringement of any associational freedom in this case.bailey,supra,th,d.law enforcement has a substantial interest in keeping track of those adjudged to have been involved in crimes.we conclude that the limited disclosure of identifying and locational information does not violate minor freedom of association.
right to counsel 
minor contends that the registration requirement violates his sixth amendment right to counsel.
t he right to counsel does not attach until the initiation of adversary criminal proceedings.united states gouveia,d.the core purpose of the counsel guarantee is to assure aid at trial,when the accused is confronted with both the intricacies of the law and the advocacy of the public prosecutor.id.at.although we have extended an accused right to counsel to certain critical pretrial proceedings,united states wade,d,we have done so recognizing that at those proceedings,the accused is confronted,just as at trial,by the procedural system,or by his expert adversary,or by both.id.at.
minor compares answering unlimited registration questions with a lineup.we do not regard registering a person name and address with local law enforcement as the initiation of adversary criminal proceedings or as custodial interrogation.we conclude that the registration requirement as we have construed it does not infringe on minor right to counsel.bailey,supra,th at,d.
cruel and unusual punishment 
minor contends that requiring him to register with law enforcement for five years violates the federal and state constitutional prohibitions of cruel and unusual punishment.united states const,cal,art.i.
one question that arises is whether the registration requirement qualifies as punishment.the primary purpose of the cruel and unusual punishments clause has always been considered,and properly so,to be directed at the method or kind of punishment imposed for the violation of criminal statutes.ingraham wright,d.in the few cases where the court has had occasion to confront claims that impositions outside the criminal process constituted cruel and unusual punishment,it has had no difficulty finding the eighth amendment inapplicable.thus,in fong yue ting united states,the court held the eighth amendment inapplicable to the deportation of aliens on the ground that deportation is not a punishment for crime.id.at.id.at.
minor relies on in re reed cal d,reed,where the california supreme court held that registration was punishment within the meaning of california prohibition of cruel or unusual punishment.the court adopted the due process clause analysis of kennedy,d to conclude that registration is punishment,even though it may not have historically been regarded as punishment,reed,supra,cal d at,because it bears other indicia of punishment.first,it is an affirmative disability or restraint.id.at.it comes into play only on a finding of scienter.id.at.while it has an alternative purpose of facilitating criminal investigations,it is excessive in relation to the alternative purpose.ibid.we conclude that the sex offender registration compelled by section is a form of punishment within the meaning of article i,section,of the constitution.ibid.reed also concluded that the lifelong registration requirement for a misdemeanor sex offender was void under the california constitution.id.at.
the attorney general contends that reed is no longer controlling.reed was disapproved by the lead opinion in people castellanos,supra,cal th,d,castellanos,as follows.upon reexamination of the decision in reed in light of more recent cases,we conclude that reed should be disapproved to the extent that decision can be interpreted as suggesting that sex offender registration constitutes punishment for purposes of ex post facto analysis.
to begin with,in this context,we believe it is appropriate to place greater emphasis than did the court in in re reed,supra,on the circumstance that sex offender registration has not historically been regarded as punishment.cal d at.while not dispositive,this factor is of great importance,because it supports the conclusions that the legislature did not intend the provision to constitute punishment and that the provision is not punitive in nature.as noted above,virtually every other jurisdiction that has passed on the question has concluded that sex registration provisions are regulatory rather than punitive,and do not constitute punishment for purposes of the ex post facto doctrine.see ante,at,d.as we have explained,our recent decision in wright superior court,supra,cal th,d,makes it clear that the registration provision is regulatory in nature.
second,because the question at issue in in re reed,supra,involved whether sex registration was cruel or unusual punishment as applied to the misdemeanor solicitation conviction of which the defendant in that case had been convicted,the court in reed directed much of its consideration to whether the registration requirement was excessive in light of a statement made by the los angeles city attorney,who appeared as amicus curiae in reed.this statement maintained that mandatory registration of section a misdemeanants as sex offenders is dysfunctional,because it overloads law enforcement computers with useless information and imposes a disability out of proportion to the relatively minor offense that triggered its application.cal d at,fn,italics added.these considerations do not apply in the present case.further,because reed addressed a claim of cruel or unusual punishment,the central issue was whether the registration requirement was excessive or disproportionate to the severity of the offenses committed by the defendant in reed.the present case,by contrast,involves an ex post facto claim in which the excessiveness of the registration requirement in relation to its purpose is only one factor of several to be considered.castellanos,supra,cal th at,d.
the attorney general acknowledges that the plurality opinion in castellanos has not authoritatively settled the proper test for determining what constitutes punishment in either an ex post facto context or in the cruel and unusual punishment context.the california supreme court is currently considered the questions whether registration is punishment and if it is,whether it is cruel and unusual.in re walter,review granted,gang member in re alva,review granted,sex offender people sanchez,review granted,gang member.but the attorney general argues that,in light of castellanos,lower courts are no longer bound by reed.
we believe the california supreme court will decide that registration is not punishment in the cruel and unusual context.however,even if the california supreme court reaffirms reed,that decision does not conclude that all registration is cruel and unusual.people king th,d king people tate d.unlike the lifetime registration requirement in reed,the requirement of section only lasts for five years.
a penalty offends the proscription against cruel and unusual punishment when it is so disproportionate to the crime for which it is inflicted that it shocks the conscience and offends fundamental notions of human dignity.in re lynch cal d.king,supra,th at,d reed,supra,cal d at.king upheld a registration requirement for a conviction of misdemeanor indecent exposure as not cruel or unusual after considering the aggressive,even hostile,manner in which the offense was committed.id.at,d.
minor contends that registration is disproportionate when considering the severity of his crime.the registration requirement applies only to a person adjudged to have been involved in a crime related to a criminal street gang.the rhetoric of proposition quoted above ante,at demonstrates the voters serious concern about offenses.minor here was adjudged to have been involved in a misdemeanor assault that was.there was evidence that minor was involved in a prior assault and battery.the juvenile court concluded that this assault would have turned into a battery if minor and his companions had caught up to their victim.while minor crime was not among the most serious,we also do not regard a registration requirement with limited disclosure as that onerous.minor attempts an interjurisdictional comparison,only to concede that he was unable to locate any state that has a gang registration requirement.we conclude that this registration requirement does not constitute punishment,but even if considered to be punishment,this requirement is not unconstitutionally cruel or unusual.
the demurrer 
on appeal minor contends that the juvenile court erred in overruling his demurrer to the wardship petition.minor questions the applicability of section,subdivision d,which we repeat for ease of reference any person who is convicted of a public offense punishable as a felony or a misdemeanor,which is committed for the benefit of,at the direction of or in association with,any criminal street gang with the specific intent to promote,further,or assist in any criminal conduct by gang members,shall be punished by imprisonment in the county jail not to exceed one year,or by imprisonment in the state prison for one,two,or three years,provided that any person sentenced to imprisonment in the county jail shall be imprisoned for a period not to exceed one year,but not less than days,and shall not be eligible for release upon completion of sentence,parole,or any other basis,until he or she has served days.
minor claims there is a confusing overlap between section,subdivision d and section,subdivision b,which we also repeat a ny person who is convicted of a felony committed for the benefit of,at the direction of,or in association with any criminal street gang,with the specific intent to promote,further,or assist in any criminal conduct by gang members,shall,upon conviction of that felony,in addition and consecutive to the punishment prescribed for the felony or attempted felony of which he or she has been convicted,be punished as follows a except as provided in subparagraphs b and c,the person shall be punished by an additional term of two,three,or four years at the court discretion.b if the felony is a serious felony,as defined in subdivision c of section,the person shall be punished by an additional term of five years.c if the felony is a violent felony,as defined in subdivision c of section,the person shall be punished by an additional term of years.
thus,subdivision b applies only to persons convicted of a felony,while subdivision d,added by proposition,applies to persons convicted of a public offense punishable as a felony or a misdemeanor.
minor contends that to avoid redundancy,the enhancement provisions of subdivision b should be construed to apply only to felonies,while subdivision d should be construed to apply only to wobblers,those crimes alternately punishable as a felony or a misdemeanor.people superior court alvarez cal th,d.therefore,subdivision d does not apply at all to simple assault,which is merely a misdemeanor,not a wobbler.
given the voters concern with crimes described above ante,at,we do not believe subdivision d was intentionally limited only to wobblers,rather than including all offenses punishable as felonies and misdemeanors.indeed,some legislative history suggests that the subdivision was aimed at gang members who commit misdemeanors.people arroyas th,d.the second district court of appeal,division two,has analyzed the interplay of subdivisions b and d,pointing out that the text of the proposition fails to indicate the purpose and effect of subdivision d in relationship to subdivision b.id.at,d.since the language of section is ambiguous,it must be construed in favor of appellant.such a construction precludes penalty enhancement un
