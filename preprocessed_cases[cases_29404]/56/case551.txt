the minor,appeals from the dispositional order committing him to the division of juvenile justice djj after he admitted violating probation by failing to return to placement,as alleged in an august,notice pursuant to welfare and institutions code section on appeal,the minor contends that section,subdivision c,bars the juvenile court from committing him to the djj.relevant here,section,subdivision c,precludes the court from committing a minor to the djj unless,among other things,the most recent offense alleged in any petition and admitted or found to be true by the court is an offense described in section,subdivision b.the minor argues that the most recent offenses admitted and found to be a december,petition under section,and the probation violation alleged in the august,notice under section b offenses and,therefore,section precludes his djj commitment.the minor also contends that an assault alleged in an earlier march,petition,which the juvenile court relied upon as the most recent offense under section,subdivision c,in committing him to the djj,is not one of the offenses listed in section,subdivision b,and thus he could not be committed to the djj based on that petition.
as we will explain,because the assault alleged in the march,petition is the most recent offense alleged in any petition and admitted or found to be true by the court and is an offense described in section,subdivision b,the juvenile court was not precluded by section,subdivision c,from committing the minor to the djj.accordingly,we will affirm the dispositional order.

on january,a petition under section was filed against the minor.the petition alleged that on or about january,the minor committed felony theft or unauthorized use of a vehicle,subd.a.

on may,the minor admitted the allegations in the october,notice,the january,petition,and the march,petition.the juvenile court continued the minor as a ward of the court,among other orders.the court subsequently approved the juvenile continued placement at starlight adolescent center,and on july,the juvenile was placed at the center.
august,notice and december,petition 
on august,a notice under section was filed,alleging that the minor failed to return to starlight adolescent center on august,after a day home pass had expired.the notice further stated that t he minor current whereabouts are unknown.
on december,a petition under section was filed against the minor,alleging two counts.in count,the petition alleged that the minor committed an attempted second degree robbery,a felony,and that he personally used a deadly and dangerous weapon,a knife,in the commission of the offense,subd.c,subd.b.in count,the petition alleged that the minor gave a false name to a peace officer,a misdemeanor.the juvenile court consolidated this petition with the august,notice.
on may,the minor admitted the allegations in count of the december,petition regarding the attempted robbery and weapon enhancement.count of the petition was dismissed.the minor also admitted the allegations in the august,notice regarding the violation of a prior court order.
contested disposition hearing 
on august,the juvenile court commenced the contested disposition hearing on the august,notice and the december,petition.at the hearing,the prosecutor supported the probation officer recommendation that the minor be sent to the djj.the minor counsel,seeking an alternative,acknowledged that the minor had been turned down from two organizations,but requested that the court consider lodge builders.the court heard testimony from the minor probation officer and from the minor.upon questioning by the court,the probation officer indicated that it was doubtful the minor would be accepted by lodge makers.the court stated i think in fairness we should probably have the minor screened by lodge makers.but i will tell you that if he is not accepted by lodge makers,i frankly do see that i going to have much choice but to send him to the djj.i heard everything today,but i not willing to simply release him into the community into programs.the court continued the hearing so that the minor could be screened by lodge makers and indicated that it wanted the parties to then come back for an actual disposition with no further evidence.
minor motion to withdraw the admission to the enhancement 
the clerk minutes for the continued dispositional hearing on september,indicate that the minor counsel raised the issue of the minor withdrawing his plea.counsel was to file the notice.
on september,the minor counsel filed a motion pursuant to penal code section to withdraw the minor admission to the weapon enhancement,subd.b in the december,petition.the minor counsel stated in a supporting declaration that the law had changed under section after the minor admission of the enhancement.under the new law,counsel explained that if the enhancement is found to be not true,this matter then falls under the purview of section,subdivision c,requiring the minor not to be committed to the djj.counsel stated that if this had been known to him at the time of the admission,he would have requested a trial on the penal code b enhancement issue only.the prosecutor filed written opposition to the motion.
the hearing on the minor motion to withdraw his admission was heard on october.the minor counsel explained that the section enhancement was the tipping point under the new section because the underlying offense,attempted second degree robbery,is not one of the offenses that allows a commitment under this statute.counsel maintained that he and the minor were unaware of the potential consequences of the minor plea at the time it was entered.in opposition,the prosecutor argued that the motion should be denied because the court already had the discretion to place the minor wherever it deemed appropriate without the necessity of allowing the minor to withdraw his admission,there was already a recommendation by the probation officer for the minor to go to the djj,and the court already heard evidence regarding the appropriate disposition in this matter.
after hearing argument from counsel,the court stated that it was the court recollection that there were no good alternatives for the minor and that the djj was the best alternative that we could find for him.the court stated that it was not sure where we would go if the djj was not available.however,the court did not believe that the minor knew at the time he entered his admission that he had a chance of not being a section,subdivision b,minor by requesting a contested hearing on the enhancement consequently,the court granted the minor motion to set aside his plea,but only as to the weapon enhancement in the december,petition.the court then set the date for a contested hearing on the enhancement allegation.
people motion to dismiss the december,petition 
on october,the prosecutor informed the juvenile court that he could not proceed with the contested hearing on the enhancement allegation in the december,petition because a witness was unavailable to testify.the prosecutor sought dismissal of the december,petition and requested that the court proceed to disposition on the august,notice.the court denied the prosecutor motion to dismiss the december,petition without prejudice but indicated that the parties could file briefs on the issue.
continued disposition hearing 
the prosecutor subsequently filed a written request to dismiss the december,petition,and the minor counsel filed written opposition.
on december,the continued disposition hearing was held on the august,notice and the december,petition,along with the hearing on the prosecutor request to dismiss the december,petition.after hearing argument from counsel,the court explained that there were three petitions that were pertinent in this case.one petition was the march,petition involving an offense under section,subdivision a,which was a section,subdivision b,offense,according to the court.the court noted that the minor was sent to a placement on that petition already.the court indicated that the other two petitions were before the court for disposition.the august,notice was for a violation of probation on the march,petition,and the december,petition involved an attempted robbery with an enhancement.the court explained that the minor originally admitted the enhancement and as originally admitted the offense was a section,subdivision b,offense and then this court set aside the enhancement,which took it out of being a section,subdivision b,offense.the court recognized that section precluded it from sending the minor to the djj unless the most recent offense was a section,subdivision b,offense,and stated as it stands right now,i ca send him to the djj on the december,petition.
the court explained that it had tried,and probation had tried,to find alternative placements for the minor,but he is not qualified for any alternative placements.the court indicated that it had asked for the minor to be screened for a placement in southern california,but the minor was too old and the facility is in fact,now closed.the court explained the district attorney is using section to ask me to dismiss the december,petition so that i can send him to the djj on the august,notice,which is a violation of probation on the march,petition,w hich is a section,subdivision b,offense section allows the court to dismiss the petition or set aside its findings and dismiss the petition if the court finds that the interest of justice and the welfare of the minor require that dismissal.section also allows dismissal if the court finds the minor is not in need of treatment or rehabilitation and that not a finding that i could make in this case.it appears to me that the minor is in need of rehabilitation and so the question is whether i can find that the interest of justice and the welfare of the minor require dismissal of the december,petition.and i will say my first inclination was to say the district attorney ca do this the ca move to dismiss the december,petition because they want a harsher or more restrictive solution for the minor.
the court further stated t he question that the court really has to address is whether under section and new section,whether i can in fact dismiss the december,petition and send the minor to the djj on the august,notice.and the probation report and the testimony that i already had at disposition leave me to believe that i really do have any other choices for the minor t here is no alternative placement that i can send him to n one of the alternative s that i have are in the interest of justice or help the welfare of this minor.
the court concluded for those reasons,it would dismiss the december,petition alleging the attempted robbery and send the minor to the djj on the august,notice for a probation violation.the court stated the decision was not reached easily but it believed the interest of justice and the welfare of the minor require d that disposition.the court set aside the december,petition and all subsequent proceedings on the petition,including the minor admission to the petition dismissed the petition in the interest of justice and ordered that the petition not be.regarding disposition of the august,notice,the court explained that the notice arose out of a violation of probation on the march,petition.the court indicated that the march,petition involved an assault under penal code section,subdivision a the assault was a section,subdivision b,offense and in view of section,subdivision c,the march,petition was relevant in that it is the most recent section,subdivision b offense the court continued the minor as a ward of the court,committed him to the djj,and set his maximum term of physical confinement at two years,among other orders.
on february,the minor filed a notice of appeal,purportedly appealing from an order made on december.in the notice of appeal,the minor asserted,among other things,that the court should have been precluded from committing the minor to cya.
discussion 
as a threshold issue,the people assert that the minor notice of appeal was not timely filed,and therefore the appeal must be dismissed.the minor previously filed a motion seeking relief from default due to his trial counsel failure to file a timely notice of appeal.we granted the minor motion in an order filed july.therefore,we will address the substance of the appeal.
the minor contends that section,subdivision c,bars the juvenile court from committing him to the djj.section,subdivision c,states in relevant part a ward of the juvenile court who meets any condition described below shall not be committed to the department of corrections and rehabilitation,division of juvenile facilities c the ward has been or is adjudged a ward of the court pursuant to section,and the most recent offense alleged in any petition and admitted or found to be true by the court is not described in subdivision b of section this subdivision shall be effective on and after september.
the minor contends that only the december,petition and the august,notice were before the juvenile court for disposition at the december,hearing that these filings contained the most recent offenses alleged against him that were admitted and found to be true that neither of these filings involved a section,subdivision b,offense and that therefore section,subdivision c,precludes his commitment to the djj.the minor also contends that the offense stated in the march,petition,which the juvenile court relied upon in committing him to the djj,is not one of the offenses listed in section,subdivision b,and thus he could not be committed to the djj based on the march,petition.
because section,subdivision c,precludes djj commitment unless the most recent offense alleged in any petition italics added is a specified offense,we will address the minor arguments concerning the december,petition first,followed by the august,notice,and then the march,petition.
the december,petition 
in construing whether section,subdivision c,precludes the minor commitment to the djj,we apply the rules governing statutory construction.we begin with the fundamental premise that the objective of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent.citations.to determine legislative intent,we turn first,to the words of the statute,giving them their usual and ordinary meaning.citations.when the language of the statute is clear,we need go no further.however,when the language is susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation,we look to a variety of extrinsic aids,including the ostensible objects to be achieved,the evils to be remedied,the legislative history,public policy,contemporaneous administrative construction,and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part.citations.people flores cal th,d.
section,subdivision c,precludes a minor commitment unless the most recent offense alleged in any petition and admitted or found to be true by the court is one of the specified offenses.on appeal,the minor maintains that the attempted robbery alleged in the december,petition was the most recent offense admitted and found to be true under section,subdivision c,despite the court decision to dismiss that petition.in view of the fact that his admission to the weapon enhancement allegation was set aside and the underlying attempted robbery is not a section,subdivision b,offense,the minor reasons that the juvenile court was precluded from committing him to the djj under section,subdivision c.
we determine that because the minor admissions to the allegations concerning the weapon enhancement and the attempted robbery were set aside,as were all subsequent proceedings on the december,petition containing those allegations,section,subdivision c,did not preclude his djj commitment.further,the december,petition was dismissed and the people were ordered not to it.under these circumstances,the attempted robbery alleged in the december,petition could not have been the most recent offense admitted or found to be true by the juvenile court within the meaning of section,subdivision c.
in a supplemental brief the minor argues that the language of section only authorizes the juvenile court to commit the minor to djj when the most recent admitted and sustained petition is a b offense.the statute does not give the juvenile court authority to dismiss the admitted and sustained petition to avoid the restriction on committing the minor to djj.the clear meaning of the limit commitments to djj to specified be enforced.the minor contends that i f the legislature had wanted to include this escape option of avoiding the prohibition against djj commitment by dismissing the latest admitted and sustained petitions,it would have included a provision for dismissal in section.
in response,the people contend that policy considerations support the allowance of section discretion in the context of section,subdivision c the people contend although juvenile courts continue to attempt to use the least restrictive option in treating a delinquent minor see,subd.a,there comes a point when the juvenile court may properly find that less restrictive dispositions in the past have not been effective in the minor rehabilitation.in a case such as this one,the people assert that the minor and society benefit from a djj commitment.the people contend that if a juvenile court is precluded from dismissing the most recent petition alleging a,subdivision b,offense and from ordering djj commitment,the court may be reluctant to consider a disposition that is less restrictive than djj commitment after the minor first commits a section,subdivision b,offense.
as the minor points out,section does not specifically authorize the dismissal of a petition containing the most recent offense admitted or found to be true.however,section does authorize the juvenile court to set aside findings and to dismiss a petition if the court finds that the interests of justice and the welfare of the minor require such dismissal,and it was pursuant to this section that the court dismissed the december,petition.because the december,petition was dismissed,and the minor admission to the allegations in that petition was set aside,the offense alleged in the december,petition could not be considered the most recent offense admitted or found to be true by the court under section,subdivision c.therefore,the court was not precluded by the december,petition from committing the minor to the djj under section,subdivision c.
the august,notice 
next,the minor contends that even if the dismissal of the december,petition meant that the attempted robbery could no longer be considered the most recent offense,he still could not be committed to the djj under section,subdivision c.the minor maintains that t he probation violation alleged in the august,notice,which was the only remaining petition before the court for disposition would then become the most recent offense.since the probation violation was not a b offense,he could not be committed to djj under section,subdivision c.
the people respond that the minor incorrectly refers to the section notice filed on august,as a petition.the people maintain that the minor refers to the allegation in the section notice as an offense and characterizes that notice of probation violation as a petition,impliedly putting it in the same category as a section petition alleging conduct charged as a criminal offense.the section notice was not a petition,and it alleged absconding as a probation violation only,not as a criminal offense.citing in re eddie cal th,d,eddie,the people assert that the california supreme court repeatedly distinguished sections and,noting that the latter no longer may be used to allege criminal conduct as a crime,but only as a probation violation 
in view of the plain language of section,subdivision c,we determine that the most recent offense in subdivision c refers to an offense alleged in a petition that is filed under section,but not to a probation violation that is alleged in a notice filed under section.
section,subdivision c,specifically refers to an offense that is alleged in a petition.as explained by the california supreme court,n o section case begins until the prosecutor files a petition under that statute on the people behalf,subd.c,subd.a.the petition states which penal laws were violated and whether the offenses are felonies or misdemeanors,subd.f.eddie,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.
in contrast,section has a notice provision,subds.a b.eddie,supra,cal th at,d.the notice provision replaced the supplemental petition that had been contemplated by the statute b etween section enactment in,and proposition approval in eddie,supra,cal th at,d.our supreme court has explained in,proposition changed the scope of section in section cases.as pertinent here,voters deleted the provision allowing prosecutors to allege probation violations amounting to crimes.now,for wards or probationers under section,section applies to a probation violation not amounting to a crime.a.with respect to procedural changes,proposition replaced the supplemental petition with a notice provision,subds.a b.a preponderance of the evidence standard now applies.c.other new language allows reliable hearsay evidence insofar as it would be admissible in an adult probation revocation hearing under people brown d.and any other relevant provision of law.c.fn.omitted.eddie,supra,cal th at,d.
the california supreme court has further explained that by limiting section a to matters not amounting to crime s,proposition only affected the manner in which such violations are officially treated under the statute.section a covers all probation violations alleged as such,including those that are criminal in fact.eddie,supra,cal th at,d.nonetheless,juvenile probation violations,like their adult counterparts,do not involve criminal guilt.while section continues to permit dispositional change for probation violations involving criminal conduct,the not amounting to a crime limitation precludes prosecutorial use of the statute to plead and prove the violation as a crime.thus,unlike criminal convictions or section offenses,section adjudications do not entail the stigma of a finding that the juvenile violated a criminal law.in re winship,d,fn.omitted.nor do such probation violations trigger other collateral consequences associated with convictions or section adjudications.see,subd.d subjecting certain violent or serious wardship adjudications to three strikes law.because section involves no formal criminal charge,the reasonable doubt standard need not constitutionally apply.eddie,supra,cal th at,d.additionally,section follows the adult scheme insofar as probation violations do not trigger a term of confinement any longer than the maximum term for the underlying crime.see,subd.c,subd.a people howard cal th,d.by this measure,section makes no unfavorable penal change,and the preponderance standard can apply.eddie,supra,cal th at,d.
in sum,proposition transformed section a into a probation violation procedure in which no criminal offense can be alleged.eddie,supra,cal th at,d.even if criminal in fact,new misconduct may be treated,under section a,only as a probation violation.if a violation is found,the violator may,at most,receive a more restrictive juvenile placement within the original maximum term.john superior court cal th,d.
in view of the different procedures in a proceeding under section as compared to a proceeding under section,including that the former is initiated by a petition while the latter is initiated by a notice,and the constitutional distinctions between alleging that a crime has been committed as compared to alleging that probation has been violated,we conclude that the reference to a petition in section,subdivision c,refers to a petition that is filed under section but not a notice filed under section.
in support of his argument that section,subdivision c,includes a section notice,the minor cites in re carl th,d carl,and in re emiliano cal th,d,emiliano.in carl,the parties agreed,and the court of appeal assumed without discussion,that section,subdivision c,could apply to a section notice.carl,supra,th at,d.for the reasons we have explained,we determine that the reference to a petition in section,subdivision c,does not apply to a section notice.
the other case cited by the minor,emiliano,supra,cal th,d,is not helpful,as it does not discuss section,subdivision c.in emiliano,the california supreme court explained that section,subdivision a,covers all situations in which new misconduct by a criminal juvenile probationer is alleged only as a probation violation,and a more restrictive disposition can be sought and obtained under the statute regardless of the actual criminal nature of the violation that is pled.citation.emiliano,supra,cal th at,d.the california supreme court concluded that the court of appeal thus erred in determining that section,subdivision a,excluded an act by the minor that constituted a crime.emiliano,supra,cal th at,d.the court of appeal judgment was reversed on this ground,and the california supreme court did not reach the issue of whether the gang registration provision of penal code section,subdivision b,applies in a section,subdivision a,probation violation proceeding.emiliano,supra,cal th at,fn,d.
we conclude in this case that the august,notice under section,alleging the minor violation of probation by failing to return to placement,does not constitute an offense alleged in a petition within the meaning of section,subdivision c.consequently,the fact that the minor admitted the allegations in the notice and the fact that the notice did not allege a section,subdivision b,offense did not preclude the juvenile court from committing the minor to the djj.
the march,petition 
at the december,dispositional hearing for the august,notice,the juvenile court explained that the notice arose out of a violation of probation on the march,petition.the court indicated that the march,petition involved an assault under penal code section,subdivision a the assault was a section,subdivision b,offense and in view of section,subdivision c,the march,petition was relevant in that it is the most recent section,subdivision b offense 
section,subdivision c,precludes djj commitment unless,as relevant here,the most recent offense alleged in a petition is described in section,subdivision b.section,subdivision b,includes an a ssault with a firearm or destructive device,subd.b and an a ssault by any means of force likely to produce great bodily injury,subd.b.penal code section,subdivision a,makes it a crime to commit an assault upon the person of another with a deadly weapon or instrument other than a firearm or by any means of force likely to produce great bodily injury 
the minor contends that the juvenile court erred by concluding that the march,petition involved a section,subdivision b,offense.he asserts that the march,petition alleges the crime of assault with a deadly weapon or by force likely to produce great bodily injury,in violation of p enal code section a.the minor explains that t he change of plea form that he signed does not specify whether the violation is for assault with a deadly weapon or for assault with force likely to produce great bodily injury it merely states that the admission is to a.he also points to an unsigned minute order that refers generally to the violations sustained by the juvenile court,including the a pc felony in the march,petition.
the minor argues that under the least adjudicated elements test set forth in people rodriguez cal th,d,the offense could have been committed by using an inherently dangerous weapon.he maintains that assault with a deadly weapon other than a firearm is not an offense enumerated in section b the finding that he committed an assault with a deadly weapon does not automatically mean that he used force likely to produce great bodily injury,which is a section,subdivision b,offense the court may not look beyond the bare juvenile adjudication and therefore t he least adjudicated elements of the offense defined by penal code section a are insufficient to establish a section b offense.
the people respond that both prongs of penal code section,subdivision a,were alleged in the march,petition.the people contend that i n admitting the offense as any amendment specifying that his offense was assault with a deadly weapon but not by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury the minor admitted he violated both prongs of penal code section,subdivision a,the deadly weapon prong and the likelihood of injury prong.the people further argue that an incident report regarding the assault provided a factual basis for the minor admission to both prongs.
the march,petition against the minor alleged as follows on or about february,the crime of assault with a deadly weapon or by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury,in violation of penal code section a,a felony,was committed by the minor who did commit an assault upon the person of gustavo with a deadly weapon and instrument other than a firearm,a chair,and by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury.
on may,the minor executed a general waiver and admission form,which stated,among other things,that he understood he was charged with,a fel ony that he understood the nature of the charge that he waived various rights and that he admitted the cha
