is a juvenile delinquent who receives an indeterminate residential commitment to the department of juvenile justice djj entitled to credit for time served in secure detention before the commitment the first district court of appeal,whose decision we review,answered this question in the negative but certified conflict t o the extent our opinion conflicts with state,so d dca,state,so d dca,state,so d dca,and state,so d dca.state,so d,dca.we exercise our discretionary jurisdiction to resolve the certified conflict.see art.v,b.const.
we agree with the first district that on an indeterminate commitment,which is a residential commitment on which djj retains authority over the offender until he or she reaches a statutorily prescribed age,precommitment credit for time served in secure detention is not required by any court rule,statute,or constitutional provision.accordingly,we approve the first district decision.however,to ensure that commitments will not exceed statutory limits,credit is required on a determinate commitment for an offense such as a misdemeanor that will necessarily conclude before the juvenile reaches the age at which djj authority ends.to the extent that the first district certification of conflict suggests that other district courts have held that credit is required on indeterminate commitments,we clarify this important distinction.we therefore disapprove the second district failure to distinguish determinate and indeterminate commitments in requiring credit in,but approve the fourth district requirement of credit on determinate sentences in,and 
facts and procedural history 
was taken into custody and placed in secure detention on a charge of lewd or lascivious battery on a person under sixteen,a felony.his case was continued five times and he remained in secure detention for days pending an adjudicatory hearing.after finding guilty,the trial court again ordered that he remain in secure detention.by the time of his disposition hearing,he had been in secure detention for days in the disposition hearing,the trial court imposed a commitment to djj followed by postcommitment probation.the trial court denied oral request for credit for time served in secure detention.the written sentencing order and judgment form is silent as to predisposition credit.
appealed.his appellate counsel filed a motion to correct disposition error under florida rule of juvenile procedure b.the motion requested credit for the days served in secure detention before disposition.following a hearing,the trial court granted the motion in principle but denied it in reasonable effect.the trial court concluded that because commitment on a felony punishable by a sanction was indefinite,credit for time served would have no real meaning.
the first district affirmed the denial of credit,giving two reasons.first,the court observed that because juvenile commitments are indeterminate in length,there is no definite point against which credit for time served could be subtracted.thus,an award of credit for time served in secure detention would have no effect on the length of a juvenile commitment,and would be a futile exercise and a waste of judicial resources,so d at.second,the court relied on the difference in purposes served by incarceration in the adult criminal and juvenile justice systems.according to the first district,credit for time served is consistent with the punitive purpose of incarceration in the criminal justice system in that it limits the overall duration of imprisonment to the term imposed by the sentencing court.see id.at.in contrast,a juvenile delinquency commitment serves the primary purpose of rehabilitation or treatment,and concludes when the offender is rehabilitated or treated.that treatment or rehabilitative effort may take longer in some situations than in others.the time required depends on how well the juvenile responds.accordingly,the rationale for awarding credit for time served is not applicable in the juvenile context.id.at.
in a separate opinion concurring in the judgment,judge benton noted that because a juvenile delinquency commitment can not exceed the maximum sentence that could be imposed for the crime in the criminal justice system,credit for time served in secure detention could determine the date the juvenile must be released on a commitment for a misdemeanor.he also pointed out that an adjudication on a felony such as lewd or lascivious battery could subsequently be reduced to the misdemeanor of simple battery,for which a commitment could not exceed one year.therefore,t he better practice,in my view,is for the trial judge to note in the disposition order any time the juvenile has already spent in confinement.making such a finding would prove useful in some cases and should not prove in any way.id.at benton,concurring in the judgment.
this case presents the issue of a juvenile entitlement to credit for time served in secure detention against a residential commitment to djj.the facts are not in dispute.in a recent decision concerning entitlement to jail credit on an adult sentence,we addressed the issue de novo.see moore state,so d.the same review standard applies here.in addressing the issue,we look to the sources of the requirement of presentencing jail credit the differences in adult criminal sentencing and juvenile delinquency sentencing,both in purpose and operation and pertinent district court precedent,including the decision below and the certified conflict cases.
credit for time served in the criminal justice system 
an adult offender sentenced to a term of imprisonment is statutorily entitled to credit for time served in county jail before imposition of sentence 
a sentence of imprisonment shall not begin to run before the date it is imposed,but the court imposing a sentence shall allow a defendant credit for all of the time she or he spent in the county jail before sentence.the credit must be for a specified period of time and shall be provided for in the sentence.
stat.relying on the mandatory language of this provision,this court has held that a sentence that does not mandate credit for time served would be illegal since a trial court has no discretion to impose a sentence without crediting a defendant with time served.state mancino,so d.under mancino,the failure to grant full presentencing credit is cognizable in a motion to correct an illegal sentence filed under florida rule of criminal procedure b.see id.the trial court must specify presentence jail credit even in imposing a sentence of life imprisonment.see jenkins state,so d,dca holding that under section,the trial court should have specified how much credit time appellant was entitled to have notwithstanding the imposition of a life sentence sutton state,so d,dca ordering credit for time served against minimum term on life sentence.
precommitment credit in the juvenile delinquency system 
no provision corresponding to section exists in chapter,florida statutes,which governs juvenile delinquency proceedings,or in the florida rules of juvenile procedure.therefore,the obligation to give juveniles credit for time served in secure detention was born of judicial interpretation,so d at.precedent on this issue reflects a distinction in adult and juvenile sentencing.in the criminal justice system,the maximum sentence for an offense is prescribed by statute.see.stat.section d,florida statutes,ties the length of the maximum juvenile commitment to the maximum term of imprisonment that an adult may serve for the same offense.however,this provision also imposes a second ceiling for commitments on crimes such as the felony in this case,in which the commitment could in theory last long into the offender adulthood.in cases such as this,the juvenile age rather than the maximum adult punishment determines the maximum potential commitment.in most instances,these commitments must conclude no later than the offender birthday.see d notwithstanding and this subsection,and except as provided in ss.and,a child may not be held under a commitment from a court under this section after becoming years of age.courts sometimes refer to commitments circumscribed by the maximum adult punishment as determinate and those limited only by the offender attaining a certain age as indeterminate,so d at.as will be seen,this distinction is crucial in determining entitlement to credit for time served in secure detention.
one of the first district court decisions requiring precommitment credit in juvenile delinquency cases was the decision in.there the second district held that a juvenile offender was entitled to credit for time served in secure detention on a juvenile commitment for three felonies and a misdemeanor.see,so d at.in requiring that the credit be granted,the second district relied on tal mason state,so d,in which this court held that an individual must be granted credit for time served in a state mental institution while incompetent to stand trial on a criminal charge against a sentence subsequently imposed upon conviction.in,the second district applied tal mason requirement of presentence credit for time spent in any institution serving as the functional equivalent of a county jail,id.at,to secure juvenile detention.the court reasoned that a lthough rehabilitation may outweigh retributive punishment as a purpose of the florida juvenile justice act,secure detention closely resembles county jail in that appellant is deprived of his liberty,and is in the total custody and control of the state at all times,so d at.the second district in did not distinguish felonies and misdemeanors for purposes of precommitment credit.the court remanded for the trial court to grant the credit against the period of commitment which shall terminate at his nineteenth birthday,or as otherwise provided by law.id 
as reflected in,the law provides alternative ceilings on a juvenile commitment.section d provides in pertinent part 
any commitment of a delinquent child to the department must be for an indeterminate period of time,which may include periods of temporary release however,the period of time may not exceed the maximum term of imprisonment that an adult may serve for the same offense,except that the duration of a nonresidential commitment for an offense that is a misdemeanor of the second degree,or is equivalent to a misdemeanor of the second degree,may be for a period not to exceed months notwithstanding and this subsection,and except as provided in ss.and,a child may not be held under a commitment from a court under this section after becoming years of age.
under this provision,apart from the exception for misdemeanors,a juvenile commitment for any offense can not extend beyond the duration of the punishment authorized for adults in the criminal code or the offender birthday,whichever comes first.
the fourth district issued several opinions on precommitment credit that,unlike the second district in,recognized a distinction between determinate and indeterminate commitments.in,the fourth district cited in requiring credit for time served in secure detention before adjudication against a commitment for the misdemeanor of simple battery.so d at.in state,so d dca,the fourth district,relying on,ordered that credit for time served in secure detention be granted against the maximum residential commitment for a misdemeanor.id.at.in,the fourth district ordered that credit for time served in secure detention be granted against a residential commitment for two misdemeanors and one misdemeanor.so d at.
in,the fourth district followed,and in requiring predisposition credit for time served in secure detention against a residential commitment for a misdemeanor.so d at.the court recognized a distinction,for purposes of precommitment credit,between commitments limited by the statutory maximum for the underlying crime and those limited only by the child attaining a certain age 
i t is only where a determinate length of commitment exists that such credit can be given any real meaning.this will occur in juvenile misdemeanor cases only where the maximum period of commitment is limited to a year and when the juvenile is committed within one year of reaching the age of nineteen.
the juvenile justice system is designed to rehabilitate youth.accordingly,juveniles are committed for indeterminate lengths of time.it is,therefore,generally impossible to fix a date from which to deduct time spent in secure detention.perhaps this is why there is no comparable statute to section found in chapter.nevertheless,this is one of those cases involving a misdemeanor where the credit for time served in secure detention can find certainty.
id.the fourth district applied the distinction for felony and misdemeanor commitments in its en banc decision in state,so d dca,which involved both.there the child was committed for a felony,throwing a deadly missile,and criminal mischief,a misdemeanor.id.at.the fourth district held that credit must be given,as it relates to the misdemeanor offense,so does not receive a disposition greater than the sentence he could have received as an adult.id.at emphasis supplied 
precommitment credit and the goals of chapter 
in this case,the first district held that juveniles whose dispositions are to indeterminate commitment programs are not entitled to credit for time served in secure detention,so d at the first district disagreed with reliance on tal mason to require precommitment credit on a commitment potentially lasting until the offender ages out of the juvenile justice system 
in tal mason,the offender was initially committed to receive treatment,then later sentenced to incarceration for a specific period of time.thus,in that case,granting credit for time served would achieve its goal.the defendant only served,and was coercively denied a liberty interest,for the period of time the court,through its deliberative sentencing process,determined to be appropriate 
however,t he juvenile justice system is designed to rehabilitate the offender.see,so d at.rehabilitation can be analogized to treatment.since the juvenile justice system is designed to rehabilitate offenders,a juvenile disposition is for treatment,not punishment.that treatment or rehabilitative effort may take longer in some situations than in others.the time required depends on how well the juvenile responds.accordingly,the rationale for awarding credit for time served is not applicable in the juvenile context.
disputes the first district determination that rehabilitation is the sole or primary goal of the juvenile justice system generally or a commitment specifically.he asserts that revisions to the juvenile delinquency laws and the transfer of the statutes from chapter to chapter,florida statutes,refocused the purposes of the juvenile justice system from rehabilitation to punishment and protection of society.he claims that credit for time served is congruous with these goals.
in fact,punishment has been one of the stated goals of the juvenile delinquency system since.see ch,at,laws of.the statement of purposes in chapter currently provides 
the purposes of this chapter are 
c to ensure the protection of society,by providing for a comprehensive standardized assessment of the child needs so that the most appropriate control,discipline,punishment,and treatment can be administered consistent with the seriousness of the act committed,the community need for public safety,the prior record of the child,and the specific rehabilitation needs of the child,while also providing whenever possible restitution to the victim of the offense.
c.stat.the statutory definition of residential commitment,to which was committed,emphasizes the safety of both the public and the juvenile offender 
residential.programs or program models at this commitment level are residential and do not allow youth to have access to the community except that,temporary release providing community access for up to continuous hours may be approved by a court for a youth who has made successful progress in his or her program in order for the youth to attend a family emergency or,during the final days of his or her placement,to visit his or her home,enroll in school or a vocational program,complete a job interview,or participate in a community service project.residential facilities are with perimeter fencing and locking doors.facilities shall
