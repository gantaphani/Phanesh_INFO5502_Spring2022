johnell wyne smith was convicted after a jury trial of residential burglary.the jury also found true the special allegation that smith had suffered two prior juvenile adjudications for robberies committed when he was years old based on the jury findings,smith was sentenced as a third strike offender to an aggregate term of years to life in state prison.
relying on apprendi new jersey,d apprendi and united states tighe cir tighe,smith sole contention on appeal is that it was unconstitutional to sentence him under california three strikes law based on his prior juvenile adjudications because he was denied the right to a jury trial in the juvenile court proceedings we believe smith argument misapprehends apprendi and tighe and hold,as has division four of our court in people bowden th,d bowden,that a juvenile adjudication may be used as a strike to enhance an adult offender sentence notwithstanding the absence of the right to a jury trial in delinquency proceedings.
apprendi and tighe concern the appropriate allocation of responsibilities between judge and jury,not the nature or scope of sentence enhancement factors 
in apprendi the united states supreme court invalidated a new jersey hate crime statute that provided for an extended term of between and years of imprisonment if the trial judge found,by a preponderance of the evidence,that certain felonies were committed with a purpose to intimidate an individual or group of individuals because of race,color,gender,handicap,religion,sexual orientation or ethnicity.apprendi,supra,at.the defendant had been convicted of two counts of possession of a firearm for an unlawful purpose,which had a sentencing range of five to years.he was sentenced on one of those counts.acting under the hate crime statute,the trial court found the defendant had intended to intimidate his victims because of their race and added another years to the defendant sentence.the apprendi court treated the crime,together with its sentence enhancement,as the functional equivalent of a single greater crime and held the federal constitution requires that all elements of a crime must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.other than the fact of a prior conviction,any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury,and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.id.at.
the california supreme court has succinctly explained apprendi in the following terms this is what apprendi teaches us except for sentence enhancement provisions that are based on a defendant prior conviction,the federal constitution requires a jury to find,beyond a reasonable doubt,the existence of every element of a sentence enhancement that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum punishment for that crime.citation.people sengpadychith cal th,d.
in tighe the ninth circuit considered both facial and constitutional challenges to a provision of the armed career criminal act e acca,which mandates a minimum sentence of years for any person who violates the federal statute and who has three prior convictions for violent felonies or serious drug offenses.after affirming the district court holding that acca is constitutional on its face,a divided panel held that prior juvenile adjudications do not fall within the fact of a prior conviction exception to apprendi general rule that all elements used to increase a defendant maximum penalty must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.tighe,supra,at.
in reaching this result,the tighe court emphasized language from jones united states,d,a case which preceded apprendi one basis for that constitutional distinctiveness of prior convictions is not hard to see unlike virtually any other consideration used to enlarge the possible penalty for an offense a prior conviction must itself have been established through procedures satisfying the fair notice,reasonable doubt and jury trial guarantees.citation.thus,jones recognition of prior convictions as a constitutionally permissible sentencing factor was rooted in the concept that prior convictions have been,by their very nature,subject to the fundamental triumvirate of procedural protections intended to guarantee the reliability of criminal convictions fair notice,reasonable doubt and the right to jury trial.tighe,supra,at,italics omitted.because juvenile adjudications do not afford jury trials and,therefore,do not meet the standard of procedural protections described in jones and apprendi,the ninth circuit concluded juvenile adjudications are not within the prior conviction exception to apprendi general rule.id.at.
contrary to the suggestion of smith and our dissenting colleague,the majority in tighe did not hold that the fact of a prior juvenile adjudication could not be used to enhance an adult offender sentence or that in trying a new offense and seeking an acca enhancement the united states attorney was required to present to the jury all the evidence that supported the earlier juvenile determination.rather,tighe held only that,under apprendi,to enhance an adult offender sentence the fact of the prior juvenile adjudication must be presented to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.tighe,supra,at.indeed,the majority specifically acknowledged that defendants might be prejudiced if their prior juvenile adjudications are presented to the jury,but noted that the district courts could fashion procedures to mitigate any prejudice to the defendant.tighe,at,fn.
ii.juvenile adjudications may properly be considered strikes notwithstanding the absence of jury trials in delinquency proceedings 
under california three strikes law a qualifying juvenile adjudication may be used as a strike to increase the sentence of an adult offender,subd.d,subd.b people garcia cal th,d.the dissent argues the more critical inquiry for purposes of a jury determination is whether smith actually engaged in the criminal conduct that gave rise to the prior adjudications,not whether he was adjudicated of having committed the offenses.however,nothing in apprendi or the cases upon which it relied limits the legislature authority to identify a prior juvenile adjudication involving a serious or violent offense or any other fact it deems reasonably relevant for purposes of imposing an increased sentence see,people flores d.legislative determinations regarding length of punishment evaluated under rational basis standard,provided the existence of the elements it has specified for sentence enhancement other than a prior conviction are submitted to a jury and found to exist beyond a reasonable doubt.see people sengpadychith,supra,cal th at,d.
i n our tripartite system of government it is the function of the legislative branch to define crimes and prescribe punishments such questions are in the first instance for the judgment of the legislature alone.in re lynch cal d.the choice of fitting and proper penalties is not an exact science,but a legislative skill involving an appraisal of the evils to be corrected,the weighing of practical alternatives,consideration of relevant policy factors,and responsiveness to the public will id.at.reviewing courts should grant substantial deference to the broad authority that legislatures necessarily possess in determining the types and limits of punishments for crimes solem helm,d.
in the three strikes law the legislature chose to rely on the fact that the defendant,when years of age or older,had been adjudicated to have committed a serious or violent offense,subd.d,subd.b.a prior juvenile adjudication of a section,subdivision d b offense demonstrates beyond a reasonable doubt citation that a defendant has engaged in serious criminal behavior in the past.by reoffending,a defendant shows he had failed to draw the proper lesson from the previous judicial determination that he violated the law.this failure warrants harsher punishment in the adult proceeding.citation.people fowler th,d.a qualifying juvenile adjudication must be pleaded and proved beyond a reasonable doubt,subd.a,subd.c people tenner cal th,d,and the defendant has a statutory right to jury trial on the issue of whether he or she suffered the prior adjudication,subd.b see people epps cal th,d,
by enacting the three strikes law,the legislature has simply said that,under specified circumstances,a prior juvenile adjudication may be used as evidence of past criminal conduct for the purpose of increasing an adult defendant sentence since a juvenile reliably mckeiver pennsylvania,d can be adjudicated a delinquent without being afforded a jury trial,there is no constitutional impediment to using that juvenile adjudication to increase a defendant sentence following a later adult conviction.bowden,supra,th at,d,quoting people fowler,supra,th at,d.
accordingly,even if we were to adopt the tighe majority analysis,there would be no error in this case.smith was in fact afforded the right to have a jury determine the question whether he had sustained a prior qualifying adjudication under the three strikes law,and the jury found the allegation to be true.indeed,smith,testifying on his own behalf at trial,admitted the juvenile court had sustained a delinquency petition alleging he had committed two robberies he can not now complain that use of his prior juvenile adjudications violated apprendi.
iii.any unfairness in continued use of juvenile adjudications as strikes is properly addressed by the legislature 
our dissenting colleague aptly describes the increasing convergence of the adult and juvenile justice systems.even so,as justice kennard explained in her dissenting opinion in manduley superior court cal th,d,the purposes of the juvenile system and adult courts and the consequences of adverse determinations in adult and juvenile proceedings remain markedly different the juvenile court system and the adult criminal courts serve fundamentally different goals.the punishment for serious crimes tried in the criminal courts is imprisonment,and the purpose of imprisonment for crime is punishment.citation.california rules of court,rule identifies seven objectives in sentencing a criminal defendant.they include punishment,deterrence,isolation,restitution,and uniformity in sentencing,but they do not include goals important in the treatment of juvenile offenders such as maturation,rehabilitation,or preservation of the family.the practical consequences are immense.an adult court may sentence a defendant to life imprisonment a juvenile court can not impose confinement beyond the age of.citations.adult convictions are public but juvenile commitments are sealed citations,a difference that affects future employability and many other matters.adult convictions are criminal in character,and may deprive the person convicted of the right to vote citation,to serve on a jury citation,to carry firearms citation and to enter certain professions,peace officers juvenile convictions carry no such collateral consequences.manduley,at,d,dis.opn.of kennard.
the potential use of a juvenile adjudication as a strike under the three strikes law does not change the essential nature of juvenile proceedings or eliminate the significant differences between a finding of criminal guilt in an adult criminal court and a declaration of wardship by a juvenile court.see in re myresheia th,d.nonetheless,in his dissenting opinion justice johnson forcefully describes the seeming injustice in classifying delinquency proceedings as something other than criminal trials for purposes of determining the offender right to a jury trial while also permitting the resulting declaration of wardship to be used as a prior felony conviction for purposes of sentence enhancement if the juvenile reoffends as an adult.
that sense of fundamental unfairness is all the more notable since the electorate approval in march of proposition the gang violence and juvenile crime prevention act of,which,among other significant changes to juvenile court law,authorizes prosecutors to file charges directly in adult criminal court,without a prior judicial determination the minor is unfit for a disposition under juvenile court law,against any minor who is years of age or older who is accused of committing one of the serious or violent offenses listed in welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b.welf,subd.d manduley superior court,supra,cal th at,d.in other words,at the time an accusatory pleading involving offenses that qualify as strikes is filed against a or offender,the prosecutor has the sole authority to determine whether to initiate the proceeding in adult criminal court or juvenile decision that dictates,among other matters,whether or not the accused minor is entitled to a jury trial.yet despite having decided to proceed against the minor in juvenile court,if the minor reoffends,the prosecutor remains free under the current version of the three strikes law to have the juvenile offense treated with the identical consequences as an adult conviction 
absent constitutional constraints,however,when the legislature has established policy,it is not for the courts to differ.gikas zolin cal th,d,see people loeun cal th,d.any meaningful response to the arguments advanced by justice johnson must come from the political branches of our state government.
disposition 
the judgment is affirmed.
i respectfully dissent from the majority as to the constitutionality of imposing a three strikes sentence on appellant.at the same time,i emphasize the three of us agree on the central problem.we only differ on the remedy.
the majority opinion joins in recognizing the seeming injustice in classifying delinquency proceedings as something other than criminal trials for purposes of determining the offender right to a jury trial while also permitting the resulting declaration of wardship to be used as a prior felony conviction for purposes of sentence enhancement if the juvenile reoffends,ante,at.in my colleagues view,however,the cure for this seeming injustice must come from the legislature.in my view,the injustice rises to the level of a constitutional violation and,as such,can and must be remedied by the courts.as thomas jefferson wrote i consider that trial by jury is the only anchor,ever yet imagined by man,by which a government can be held to the principles of its constitution.
the remainder of this dissent is devoted to explaining the alternative grounds for finding present california law violates the united states and california constitutions in denying alleged delinquents the right to jury trial in juvenile court,especially when they are charged with offenses.however,before beginning that discussion i first observe this case represents an especially questionable application of the california code provision that includes juvenile court adjudications as strikes under this state three strikes law.here both prior strikes the trial court used to justify imposing a sentence of years to life on this adult resulted from a single juvenile court proceeding where the juvenile judge found the defendant,then age,committed two offenses on a single occasion.this scenario alone raises a serious question whether the trial court abused its discretion by refusing to strike at least one of the strikes under people romero if such a case is not outside the three strikes scheme,in whole or in part it is hard to imagine what would be.at the outset,it is noteworthy appellant acquired his first two strikes in a single criminal incident,which appears to be a significant factor favoring dismissal of one of those prior convictions moreover,here appellant third strike was a burglary.and we have the further circumstance it is difficult to develop a lifetime pattern of recidivism at such an early age 
nonetheless,as suggested above,my concern about the romero issue is not the primary reason for this dissent.instead the objection is more fundamental and arises at the this or any trial court counts a juvenile court true finding as a prior strike,despite the absence of a right to jury trial in the juvenile delinquency proceedings where he was found to have committed that offense or offenses.in my view,the statute authorizing this practice violates both the california and united states constitutions and the constitutional rights to jury trial these documents enshrine.
because of the denial of jury trial in proceedings before the juvenile court,the california constitution bars use of juvenile court declarations of wardship as prior strikes warranting life sentences when convicted later of adult offenses.
the california constitution guarantees civil litigants and criminal defendants alike an inviolate right to trial by jury despite this guarantee,appellant and other accused juvenile offenders are tried in juvenile court without a jury,declared wards of that court,and later made eligible for life sentences based on those wardship declarations.in my view,for reasons explained below,the use of juvenile adjudications as strikes for purposes of imposing two and three strike sentences violates this inviolate right guaranteed by our state constitution.
a.what is the rationale for denying accused minors their ordinary state constitutional right to jury trial in juvenile court 
once the california supreme court establishes a rule it is not uncommon to forget the rationale behind the rule.as time passes and memories fade and generations pass away,the rule becomes black letter law.sometimes this means it is followed long after the rationale erodes to changes in the legal or social the rule naked and unsupported by logic or sound policy.
this is what happened with the supreme court decision,in re daedler announcing the denial of jury trials in this state new juvenile court delinquency proceedings did not violate the right to jury trial guaranteed by our state constitution.that rationale,questionable even when deployed to justify the court holding was based on a historical finding juvenile courts were not criminal courts holding criminal trials and imposing criminal convictions which would require guaranteeing the juvenile accused a right to jury trial.rather those courts were functioning as courts of equity and simply deciding whether to declare the juveniles accused to be wards of the court,a process and a decision not requiring a right to jury trial under english common thus not guaranteeing such a right under the california constitution.the remaining rationale for the daedler opinion was its factual finding the processes and consequences of declaring a juvenile accused a ward of the court were far different and much less severe than a criminal proceeding and a criminal conviction.
as demonstrated below,over the succeeding of a century both the legal and social environment have changed so much the rationale undergirding in re daedler holding has eroded completely away.it is utter fiction a century juvenile court is a court of equity merely adjudicating an accused youngster to be a ward of the court.in re daedler,cal,et.worse,it is a cruel hoax to characterize the fictional declaration of wardship as something other than a criminal conviction when deciding whether the jury trial right applies,then a few years later to characterize it as a criminal conviction or at the least the equivalent of such a conviction when deciding whether it can be used as a prior strike helping to justify a life sentence.
in succeeding sections,i present alternative independent and sufficient grounds for concluding the california constitution bars use of juvenile court adjudications as prior strikes under the three strikes law.
first,properly analyzed,there is a right to jury trial in such proceedings and consequently any true finding obtained in a proceeding where the accused lacked such a right is unconstitutional and can not be used as a prior strike.see section b below.
second,assuming there is no such right to jury trial in these proceedings it is only because they are properly classified as equitable wardship proceedings and the resulting adjudications merely constitute equitable declarations of wardship.as such,they do not qualify as and can not constitutionally be reclassified as the equivalent of criminal convictions supporting a subsequent three strikes sentence.see section c below.
third,by handing not juveniles accused of strike eligible option of deciding whether those juveniles are to have a right to jury trial,proposition has further undermined the fundamental policy underlying the constitutional right to trial by jury.it is unconstitutional to count a juvenile adjudication as a strike when a government official has chosen,for whatever reason,to force that juvenile accused into a forum where he or she lacks the right to jury trial rather than in a forum where that right is available.to do so deprives juveniles of the protection against government oppression the constitutional right to jury trial is designed to afford.see section d below.
b.the supreme court should reconsider the issue and conclude there is a right to jury trial under the california constitution in juvenile delinquency proceedings if so,appellant prior juvenile adjudications can not be counted as strikes because he was denied this right in the underlying juvenile hearings.
nineteen years ago,this court filed an opinion concluding the california constitution conferred a right to jury trial on alleged juvenile offenders when they were tried in juvenile adjudication proceedings we based this opinion on two independent and sufficient rationales.
first,we found the california supreme court decision,in re daedler had misread english law as it existed in and thus erroneously found it was permissible to deny california juveniles a right to jury trial when they were tried in juvenile court.as explained in our opinion,the constitutional right to jury trial for all californians,adult or juvenile and in civil or criminal proceedings,is with the right english citizens enjoyed when california became a state in that issue,in turn,is a matter of historical fact the california supreme court in its daedler opinion,held juvenile defendants in our state lacked a right to jury trial,based on its historical finding english chancery courts in had the power to declare juvenile delinquents wards of the court.there was no right to jury trial in these equitable proceedings in england,so there was no such right when california juvenile courts declared juvenile offenders here to be wards of the court 
in our opinion,in re javier,we made historical review of english procedural law,as it existed in on the basis of that research,we concluded our supreme court had erred some years earlier when it held juvenile courts could try alleged juvenile offenders without juries.with the advantage of library resources undreamed of in,we found the english wardship proceedings the supreme court relied on to support denial of jury trial to alleged juvenile offenders in fact were only available where the parent or other custodian of the child was delinquent,not when the child was delinquent in fact,in england,all juveniles accused of violating any criminal law which could result in a loss of liberty for longer than three months had an absolute right to jury trial accordingly,under the california constitution,we concluded the state constitution guaranteed alleged juvenile offenders a right to jury trial in any and all juvenile proceedings in which they faced even the possibility of a loss of liberty longer than three months 
second,employing a different but independent and sufficient rationale,we ignored english legal history and found the underlying policy rationale the california supreme court used to justify its decision was no longer of intervening changes in the goals and performance of juvenile courts.as we explained,the supreme court opinion had reversed a prior decision of that court issued years earlier which had held juveniles could not be denied a jury trial when accused of violating the criminal law in reversing that earlier opinion,the court emphasized juvenile courts at that time a relatively recent innovation in the united states had a very different goal and function from the criminal courts.in juvenile courts as they existed in,the state was not a prosecutor seeking vengeance,but a parens patria seeking only the best interests of the straying child.likewise,any disposition the court might impose on the juvenile offender,even a commitment to some sort of special juvenile facility,was not a punishment but only the corrective measure a loving parent might take to encourage better behavior in the future 
for decades after in re daedler,california courts and its legislature consistently reiterated juvenile offender proceedings were different from criminal proceedings.the goal was not to punish the child but to redirect him to the right path.in,for instance,a california appellate court explained the main purpose of the juvenile court is to provide for the care and custody of children who have shown criminal tendencies,in order to have them trained to good habits and correct principles t he judge has more consideration for their future development than for their past shortcomings.likewise,in,another appellate court was emphasizing,proceedings of the juvenile court in dealing with incorrigible minors or those committing crime are not of a criminal nature.the juvenile court system is more in the character of a guardianship whereby the minor is relieved of the stigma of a criminal conviction by placing him upon probation with individuals or in institutions having the facilities to give him corrective care,supervision and training.in,another court made a similar distinction.an order adjudging a person to be a ward of the juvenile court is not a conviction of crime and proceedings to have such a wardship declared are not criminal proceedings.
as recently as,a california appellate court was still trumpeting the differences between the purposes and consequences of the criminal and juvenile delinquency systems.juvenile court action thus differs from adult criminal prosecutions where a major goal is corrective confinement of the defendant for the protection of society.the protective goal of the juvenile proceeding is that the child shall not become a criminal in later years,but a useful member of society.
meanwhile,in,the legislature erased any doubt about its insistence juvenile delinquency adjudications were not to be treated as criminal convictions.it enacted the predecessor of the present welfare and institutions code section,guaranteeing juvenile offenders a n order adjudging a minor to be a ward of the juvenile court shall not be deemed a conviction of a crime for any purpose,nor shall a proceeding in the juvenile court be deemed a criminal proceeding.this was consistent with other provisions in the juvenile court act stating the purpose of these courts was to serve the spiritual,emotional,mental and physical welfare of the minor and to secure for him custody,care and discipline as nearly as possible equivalent to that which should have been given by his parents.
this sharp distinction between criminal and juvenile proceedings,their purposes and consequences,was not to survive the century,however.when this court first examined the juvenile court process in our in re javier opinion,we already found an accelerating rate of convergence.in,the same year an appellate court was drawing the distinction that the primary purpose of criminal courts was to protect the public,while the primary goal of juvenile courts was to protect the minor the legislature formally altered the mission of juvenile courts.it amended the statement of purposes to embrace protection of the public from the consequences of criminal activity,and charged juvenile judges with the responsibility of tak ing into account such protection of the public in their determinations,their findings of guilt and dispositional decisions 
as a result of these and other developments,by division two of this court was conceding the widely held belief that under current practices juvenile court proceedings are in reality criminal proceedings and the claim that such proceedings are for the protection of the minor is pure fiction while possibly not true in,is certainly true today.then in proposition became the law of the state,threatening to place juvenile adjudications and criminal convictions on the same plane,allowing both to be used for purposes of impeachment or sentence enhancement thus,by,the california supreme court itself was compelled to admit the accuracy of division two characterization the distinction between criminal and juvenile proceedings was pure fiction.
based on our review of english legal history in the century and of the historical evolution of california juvenile purposes,procedures,and consequences during the century,this court was left with only one choice.as of,there was no justification for denying alleged juvenile offenders a right to trial by jury in juvenile court.
yet because our division was differing from prior opinions of the california supreme court on the right to jury trial issue,the majority felt bound by the higher court earlier decision.so we affirmed the defendant adjudication and lengthy commitment,but with a strong plea to the then california supreme court asking it to reconsider what we believed to be an erroneous decision by that court 
significantly,the dissent from this reluctant affirmance came from a pro tem justice,judge carol fieldhouse,who had spent several years as a juvenile court judge and who returned to that assignment when his pro tem tour concluded.judge fieldhouse dissented on grounds this court should have reversed,despite the california supreme court case of in re daedler.in his view and based on his own experience within that system,the juvenile court process had changed dramatically since.the rationale of daedler simply no longer squared with reality.already,by,the goals were too punitive,the process too adversarial,and the consequences too much like punishment to qualify as anything other than criminal 
the california supreme court denied review over two dissenting justices in the case of in re javier i am not at all sure that court would have declined to hear this case had the justices foreseen the possibility of a three strikes law and the notion a juvenile offender who was denied the right to jury trial and found guilty by a juvenile court judge could,as a result,end up many years hence with a sentence of years to life or worse for something as inconsequential as a petty theft,possession of a minuscule amount of drugs,or a similar relatively minor crime.but i have no intention of lingering on that lost opportunity.my concern is with the present and the constitutional consequences of allowing trial courts to use juvenile court adjudications as prior strikes when imposing two strike and three strike and even sentences on former juvenile but now adult defendants.
the answer would be simple,of course,had the california supreme court granted review of in re javier in and already found there was a right to jury trial in juvenile offender cases involving possible commitment beyond three months.had our state high court done so at that time,any juvenile adjudication for any offense obtained without a waiver of the right to jury trial would be unavailable as a strike when it came to sentencing in the adult court for whatever crime made the defendant eligible for second or third strike sentencing.denied of such a fundamental constitutional right,the defendant prior juvenile delinquency adjudication would be invalid and could not be used as a strike when calculating his sentence in the present case 
in my view,it is now time for the california supreme court to revisit this issue.there is even more reason for our high court to do so in than there was in.the intervening two decades have only piled on more and more onerous consequences when a juvenile is adjudicated to be a delinquent.while the daedler court emphasized juveniles were not punished as a result of being found to have committed criminal offenses the legislature changed the law in to expressly authorize them to receive punishment.similarly,welfare and institutions code section may still purport to provide a n order adjudging a minor to be a ward of the juvenile court shall not be deemed a conviction of a crime for any purpose.yet in this prohibition was overruled by the three strikes law which expressly provides such an order is a felony conviction for the most critical possible enhancement under that law.as the relevant section reads a prior juvenile adjudication shall constitute a prior felony conviction for purposes of sentence enhancement under the three strikes law now scores if not hundreds of criminal defendants receive life sentences every year based on strikes they earned as young teenagers in proceedings where they lacked the fundamental constitutional right to trial by jury.
it took almost years.but the metamorphosis of juvenile court adjudications from equitable declarations of wardship in to felony convictions in the current day was completed when the three strikes law became effective in.as explained above,over the years these adjudications already had drifted in that direction.years before juveniles could be deprived of their freedom in order to protect the public,even where this was not the best course toward rehabilitation.not long after that,juvenile judges were instructed they could and presumably should impose incarceration as punishment.but it is difficult to overestimate the escalation represented by the reclassification of juvenile delinquency adjudications as felony convictions for purposes of the three strikes law.
for any juveniles accused of strike eligible offenses in juvenile court the most significant consequence they face from a true finding is the addition of a strike to their record.even if the juvenile adjudication results in a commitment to a juvenile facility for a substantial period of time that loss of liberty is dwarfed by the possibility of being sent to prison for the rest of one life,often for a trivial future offense,because of a strike or strikes one acquired in those juvenile proceedings.
indeed in my view,the california supreme court has to wear blindfolds to avoid revisiting the issue of whether the juvenile process and its consequences have changed so much since and especially since they now require the accused possess a right to demand jury trial.at a minimum,our high court should reconsider this question when the offense alleged may entail a significant loss of freedom or especially when it would count as a strike for purposes of future sentencing as an adult.the possibility a youthful offender can be denied an opportunity for a jury trial in a juvenile court proceeding that can put him of the way to a life sentence does not square with fundamental notions of due process.appellant situation is even more dramatic,of course.here two juvenile adjudications arising from a single criminal act put him of the way toward the life sentence he received.
much of the discussion and many of the cases upholding the denial of jury trial in juvenile court proceedings are based on what appears to be a false dichotomy.if a juvenile court system allows jury trials,it is assumed,the system can not and will not retain whatever rehabilitative and parental characteristics it may possess in the absence of such a right.and yet these are completely unrelated a juvenile court decides whether the accused committed the crime of which he or she is charged need have no bearing whatsoever on how it deals with that same juvenile once the judge,or a jury,returns a true finding.in jurisdictions,including large states such as texas and michigan,accused delinquents have long enjoyed a right to jury trial in juvenile court nothing suggests those juveniles are treated any worse than those in california or other states that deny juveniles this right nor is there anything demonstrating any deleterious change occurred in the treatment of juvenile offenders in alaska after,the year the supreme court of that state ruled it was unconstitutional to continue denying alleged juvenile offenders the right to jury trial in juvenile court 
it simply has not been demonstrated the declaration of a constitutional right to jury trial in juvenile delinquency proceedings must or will eliminate the remaining rehabilitative and parental features of the juvenile court system.nor,conversely does the existence of any such features furnish a reason for continuing to deny juveniles their constitutional right to trial by jury during the phase of the juvenile court process.
the majority opinion quotes a passage from a california supreme court dissent summarizing the remaining differences between the consequences attending a juvenile declaration of wardship and those following an adult criminal conviction in california,ante,at.one might question the significance of some of these as an effective eight or cap on the loss of freedom a juvenile court can impose on a or when the maximum effective incarceration an adult would suffer for most crimes,including many strike eligible felonies,is at or less than that cap.as to those offenses carrying a higher adult sentence,one could anticipate the prosecutor would likely bring the case in adult court and thus avoid the juvenile cap.one also might question whether these remaining differences between juvenile adjudications and criminal convictions are not dwarfed by the consequences that are now especially the provision converting many juvenile adjudications of and into felony convictions.
nonetheless,it is encouraging to see some differences remain.but as explained above,those differences do not justify the denial of a right to jury trial in such cases when they are heard in juvenile court.nor would the enforcement of a constitutional right to jury trial in juvenile court mean those differences would disappear.it is simply a false dichotomy,not consistent with the experience in states which give their alleged juvenile delinquents a right to trial by jury in juvenile proceedings.consequently,the existence of these differences in treatment should not be employed as an excuse for denying alleged juvenile offenders their inviolate right to trial by jury in california juvenile courts.
should our supreme court revisit the issue,for all the reasons discussed above,in my view it will prove difficult to avoid the conclusion juveniles alleged to have committed strike eligible offenses are entitled to demand trial by jury under the california constitution.likewise,as to those juveniles,such as appellant,previously adjudicated to have committed such offenses without affording them a right to jury trial,it will prove difficult to escape the conclusion those adjudications are invalid and unavailable as prior strikes when calculating their sentences under the three strikes law.
juveniles can be denied a right to jury trial only because juvenile courts are courts of equity rather than criminal courts and their adjudications are equitable declarations of wardship not criminal convictions as such,these adjudications can not be reclassified as felony convictions and counted as strikes in the three strikes sentencing scheme.
assuming a juvenile court can adjudicate a juvenile accused to have committed a criminal offense without affording that accused a right to jury trial the question remains whether that adjudication can be counted constitutionally as a strike for purposes of the three strikes law.just because the adjudication itself is valid,despite denial of a jury trial,does not mean the california constitution permits its use as a strike.
as explained earlier,the constitutionality of denying juveniles a right to jury trial is predicated on classifying juvenile delinquency proceedings as something other than criminal proceedings.indeed if classified as criminal proceedings the accused of necessity would enjoy an indisputable right to jury trial under both the federal and california constitutions instead,as established by statute,juvenile courts are courts of equity wielding equitable powers and limited to dispensing equitable remedies they are empowered to declare juveniles to be wards of the court based either on the absence of proper parents dependency jurisdiction or the juvenile own misbehavior delinquency jurisdiction once having declared these juveniles to be wards of the court,the judge can place them with substitute parents or in institutions designed,theoretically at least,to give them proper care and guidance.
because,and only because,there was no right to trial by jury in english courts of equity as of,and only because our juvenile courts are courts of equity rather than criminal courts,do juveniles lack a constitutional right to jury trial in these courts in california.it may be pure fiction,as pointed out in the prior section to continue treating california juvenile courts as if they were courts of equity and their adjudications as equitable judgments declaring juveniles accused to be merely wards of the court.but unless we indulge that fiction,if we instead admit what is happening in juvenile court is now the equivalent of criminal proceedings and the resulting outcomes the equivalent of criminal convictions,we can no longer constitutionally deny juveniles a right to jury trial in delinquency proceedings before the juvenile court.on the other hand,if we continue to indulge the fiction,and do so honestly,we can not treat a mere declaration of wardship as a felony conviction for purposes of imposing two strike and three strike sentences.in doing so,we retroactively convert the limited equitable remedy this court of equity was empowered to deploy without a jury trial into the much harsher and qualitatively different judgment only a full blown felony trial court can produce and then only after allowing the accused a right to trial by jury.
for another way of viewing the constitutional dilemma,return to the juvenile court at the time the judge has found the accused committed a strike eligible offense.when the court then declares this juvenile a ward of the court it is simultaneously finding him guilty of a felony conviction for purposes of the three strikes law.in many instances,the latter will prove to be far more important to the juvenile than the former it can condemn him to a lifetime in prison,with a minimum years or more behind bars.the felony conviction consequence may appear in the penal code,many volumes removed from the welfare and institutions code where the juvenile court law is found.but it is still part of the body of california law defining what the juvenile court is deciding and what consequences it is imposing on the juvenile accused.for all practical purposes,it is as if the juvenile court law itself provided the juvenile court could declare a juvenile delinquent it found had committed a offense to be a ward of the court and also a convicted felon for purposes of future sentencing under the three strikes law.
the felony conviction consequence california three strikes law added to a juvenile court declaration of wardship is far beyond what an english court of equity could have ordered in.consequently,consistent with california constitution,it is a consequence which can not be levied unless and until juvenile courts allow accused juveniles their inviolate constitutional right to trial by jury.in the meantime the only way to avoid this constitutional infirmity is to disallow usage of juvenile adjudications as strikes in the sentencing scheme.
recent changes in california law unconstitutionally allow prosecutors to unilaterally decide when and whether older juveniles charged with strike eligible offenses shall be tried by a juvenile judge or by a jury.
finally,as the majority opinion itself observes,proposition introduced recent changes in the law allowing prosecutors the choice of filing potential cases against juveniles or older in adult court rather than filing them in juvenile court,ante,at.as a result,under current law,the prosecutor has the option of choosing whether the juvenile accused will have a right to demand trial by jury or instead be denied that right and tried before a juvenile court judge.this allows a prosecutor,an integral part of the government,to defeat one of the main historical purposes of the right to jury allow litigants to avoid having their cases decided by government officials who in a given case or type of case may be suspect on grounds of incompetence,bias,cronyism,or even corruption 
it is true this recent grant of discretion allows a prosecutor to channel an accused delinquent into the juvenile court rather an adult criminal court for all the right reasons the particular juvenile is not very dangerous,or is a promising candidate for rehabilitation,and like considerations.but it also gives the prosecutor discretion to deny an accused juvenile the opportunity for a jury trial for all the wrong prosecution case is weak,or this particular juvenile would be especially sympathetic to a jury,or for some other reason the jury would be more likely to acquit than a judge.or it is even possible to imagine a prosecutor choosing a juvenile court trial without jury in order to gain the advantage of trial before a judicial officer or group of judicial officers known to render decisions favorable to the other words,the very sort of judge the right to jury trial is designed to allow an accused to avoid.moreover,whichever route the prosecutor elects,if successful,the conviction or juvenile adjudication inflicts a strike on the accused ordinarily by far the most significant consequence attaching to a finding of guilt.
ironically,at the same time california law gives the prosecutor the option of trying an accused juvenile to a judge or to a jury,it denies the juvenile that same choice.in joey superior court,a juvenile willingly offered to surrender the benefits offered by the juvenile court in order to enjoy a right to jury trial in the adult court.a juvenile court denied him that option and the appellate court affirmed 
in my view,the law conferring this enormous power on california prosecutors also provides an additional independent and sufficient ground for finding california juvenile court scheme as presently constructed is unconstitutional.what the supreme court said about the reasons behind the right to jury trial underlie the california constitution jury trial guarantee as well.in large measure the right to jury trial,especially in criminal cases,exists to protect citizens accused of crime from the corrupt or overzealous prosecutor and the compliant,biased,or eccentric judge.yet this new provision puts one government official,a prosecutor,in absolute control of whether a juvenile accused will be tried by another government official,a judge,or by a jury of fellow citizens.thereby,the juvenile accused faces the possibility of a corrupt or overzealous prosecutor,for his or her own reasons,forcing the accused to trial before a compliant,biased,or eccentric judge.this compounds the effect of denying the juvenile accused his own choice between judge and jury.in my view,it also pounds another nail in the constitutional coffin encasing the claim our juvenile courts can properly deny jury trials to this class of alleged juvenile offenders.
ii.the united states constitution bars use of a juvenile adjudication obtained in a proceeding where the defendant lacked the right to jury trial to enhance a sentence beyond the maximum permitted for the current crime.
in,the supreme court interpreted the constitution to allow states to deny juveniles a right to jury trial in juvenile proceedings now nearly a third of a century later it is not altogether clear the rationale of that opinion,mckeiver pennsylvania,remains sound given the inexorable convergence of the criminal and juvenile systems since it was issued furthermore,even if juvenile courts can deny jury trial rights to alleged delinquents,this does not mean the constitution allows adult criminal courts to use adjudications these juvenile courts produce as strikes to enhance later adult sentences.
in the landmark case of apprendi new jersey the supreme court held a jury,not a judge,must decide all facts the judge uses to sentence a defendant to a lengthier term than that provided for the offense of which the jury hearing the case found the defendant guilty.the court allows an exception for prior convictions.but even this is not a true exception,because the facts behind those prior criminal convictions also were decided by a could have been if the defendant so chose.true,it is not the same jury as decided the defendant guilty of the current offense.yet it is a jury,nonetheless,making the factual determination the defendant committed the earlier criminal acts warranting an escalation of the penalty beyond the maximum for the current offense.thus,the prior conviction exception preserves the fundamental constitutional goal of protecting defendants right to a jury trial as to all facts relevant to his loss of liberty.
but what of prior juvenile adjudications in states,like california,which deny accused delinquents any opportunity for a trial by jury may courts still use those juvenile adjudications as prior convictions warranting enhanced sentences despite the fact no jury decided whether the defendant committed the prior offense or does this practice violate apprendi and the rationale underlying its holding at this point there is a split of authority on this issue in the federal courts.in my view,however,the better reasoned view is the one adopted by the ninth circuit in united states tighe 
in tighe,the court held a trial court can only use a prior conviction to enhance a defendant current sentence if the defendant had the right to trial by jury in the proceeding where he was found guilty of that earlier offense.the tighe court went on to hold prior juvenile court adjudications are unavailable to enhance adult sentences for the reason defendants were not afforded a right to jury trial in those juvenile proceedings as a consequence,it reversed a sentence under a federal statute,the armed career criminal act.this statute mandates a minimum sentence for defendants who have three previous convictions for violent or serious drug convictions and are later found guilty of possessing a firearm.the ninth circuit reversed the sentence because one of the defendant three priors was a juvenile delinquency adjudication in which the defendant had no right to trial by jury 
the tighe court based its decision on the supreme court apprendi case and related opinions.
o ther than the fact of a prior conviction,any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury,and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.
thus,the supreme court has held that prior convictions are exempt from apprendi general rule and,as sentencing factors,need not be afforded the same procedural protections that attach to facts that are construed as elements of the charged crime.at first blush,it may appear that tighe juvenile adjudication,which congress has characterized as a prior conviction for the purposes of acca,falls precisely within apprendi exception for the fact of a prior conviction,thus foreclosing tighe argument that the use of that adjudication at sentencing to increase his maximum penalty violated apprendi.such an analysis,however,ignores the significant constitutional differences between adult convictions and juvenile adjudications.
i n jones united states t he court explained why the fact of prior convictions was constitutionally distinct from other facts,u nlike virtually any other consideration used to enlarge the possible penalty for an offense a prior conviction must itself have been established through procedures satisfying the fair notice,reasonable doubt and jury trial guarantees thus,jones recognition of prior convictions as a constitutionally permissible sentencing factor was rooted in the concept that prior convictions have been,by their very nature,subject to the fundamental triumvirate of procedural protections intended to guarantee the reliability of criminal convictions fair notice,reasonable doubt and the right to a jury trial.
one year later,in apprendi,the court further elaborated on the importance of such procedural protections being inherent in prior convictions used as sentencing factors to increase statutory penalties.the court explained that the certainty that procedural safeguards attached to the fact of prior conviction was crucial to,d constitutional holding regarding prior convictions as sentencing factors.citation omitted.the court identified the right to a jury trial as one of the requisite procedural safeguards to which it referred there is a vast difference between accepting the validity of a prior judgment of conviction entered in a proceeding in which the defendant had the right to a jury trial and the right to require the prosecutor to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,and allowing the judge to find the required fact under a lesser standard of proof.citations omitted.the court continued acceptance of the prior conviction exception,then,was premised on prior convictions being the product of proceedings that afford crucial procedural the right to a jury trial and proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
therefore,the district court violated apprendi when,at sentencing,it increased tighe penalty beyond the prescribed statutory maximum based on an adjudication which denied tighe the right to a jury trial.italics added.
in my view,the tighe rationale is correct and,moreover,applies to the use of juvenile adjudications as strikes in california three strikes scheme just as it did to the use of prior serious or violent felonies to enhance sentences under the federal armed career felons act.in both instances,the trial court is using a juvenile adjudication as a prior conviction to enhance the defendant sentence for his present crime beyond the statutory maximum punishment for that crime.and,in both instances,the defendant was found to have committed that prior offense in a juvenile court proceeding where he was denied the right to trial by jury.thus,in the instant case as in tighe,the underlying the defendant actually committed the offense charged in the juvenile court proceeding are being decided by a judge rather than a jury because the defendant was denied the option of jury trial.as the tighe court held,under the rationale of united states supreme court opinions in apprendi and jones,this represents an unconstitutional denial of the constitutional right to trial by jury.
i find unpersuasive the eighth circuit apparent attempt in united states to shift the emphasis of the apprendi and jones opinions away from the right to jury trial,implying a decision would be sufficient if decided under a reasonable doubt standard indeed if one of these procedural stars is higher in the constellation of constitutional guarantees than the other,it pretty clearly is the right to trial by jury not proof beyond a reasonable doubt.in our opinion,in re javier,we had occasion to quote from thomas jefferson first inaugural address when he extolled the fundamental nature of the right to trial by jury in the american system.equal and exact justice to all men,of whatever state or persuasion and trial by juries impartially selected.these principles form the bright constellation which has gone before us and guided our steps s hould we wander from them in moments of error let us hasten to retrace our steps and to regain the road 
in any event,the tighe court did not consider these two rights were in competition.rather,along with the right to notice they form an essential triumvirate,all three of which must be present before it can be said a prior adjudication by a court qualifies as a prior conviction the defendant committed an earlier offense thus justifying an enhanced sentence for the current crime.that a defendant enjoyed one of those rights or even two of simply irrelevant to the question whether a trial court can utilize the prior adjudication as a reason to elevate the defendant sentence beyond the statutory maximum for the present crime.in my view,the tighe court has the better of it on this score,as well.
the smalley court further denigrates the importance of the constitutional right to trial by jury when it suggests the exception for prior convictions turns on whether juvenile adjudications,like adult convictions,are so reliable that due process of law is not offended by such an exemption.this argument appears to assume a conviction can be reliable even though the defendant is denied the option of a jury trial.this appears to challenge the entire legal edifice which is constructed on the foundation of a citizen right to trial by a jury of his or her own fellow citizens.in the words of england legendary legal philosopher,william blackstone 
trial by jury ever has been,and i trust ever will be,looked upon as the glory of the english law.and if it has so great an advantage over others in regulating civil property,how much must that advantage be heightened,when it is applied to criminal cases it is the most transcendent privilege which any subject can enjoy,or wish for,that he can not be affected either in his property,his liberty,or his person,but by unanimous consent of twelve of his neighbors a right that i may venture to affirm has,under providence,secured the just liberties of this nation for a long succession of ages 
it is,therefore,upon the whole,a duty which every man owes to his country,his friends,his posterity and himself,to guard with the most jealous circumspection against the introduction of new and arbitrary methods of trial,which,under a variety of plausible pretences,may in time imperceptibly undermine this best preservative of english liberty.
to the smalley court the plausible pretence evidently is the perceived need to use juvenile adjudications as if they were criminal convictions in order to compound the punishments inflicted on adult criminals.and,the arbitrary method of trial deemed an appropriate substitute for trial by jury is a finding predicated on a reasonable doubt standard of proof.is this the very sort of incremental undermining of the glory of jurisprudence,the right to trial by jury,blackstone warned us to resist 
blackstone may have offered the most eloquent defense of the right to jury trial,but the united states supreme court has explained the practical reasons for the right.these reasons reach far beyond the timid form of due process test the smalley court employs to satisfy the exception.in one of many opinions emphasizing the critical importance of the right to jury trial,especially in criminal cases,our nation high court explained,the right to jury trial in the sixth amendment was incorporated within the concept of due process and hence applicable to the states in serious cases because a jury was deemed to give the defendant an inestimable safeguard against the compliant,biased,or eccentric judge.
in the juvenile context,the real danger in fact may come not as much from compliant,biased,or eccentric judges,as from the kindly,fatherly or motherly judge who sees a youngster mired in a horrendous environment and wants to rescue the juvenile before it is too late.the temptation,often irresistible,is to remove the child from those terrible circumstances even though that may require bending the reasonable doubt standard in order to find him or her guilty of the charged offense.
thus,even assuming juvenile judges deciding an offender guilt without a jury ordinarily produce a reliable adjudication does not mean this satisfies the due process right to the inestimable safeguard of a right to trial by jury.in other words,reliability may be necessary,but it certainly is not sufficient under the constitution.
true,adult criminal defendants frequently waive their right to jury trial and submit to trial by judge.but merely because those defendants and the courts regard these decisions as reliable and constitutional,does not mean decisions are constitutional or even equally reliable when the defendant lacks the option to demand a jury.the right to demand a jury rather than a judge try one case both allows the defendant to avoid the compliant,biased,or eccentric or maybe the too kindly juvenile court judge,but also constrains any judge the defendant agrees to hear the case without a jury.for,if that judge wants future jury waivers from other defendants,he or she must avoid a reputation for unjust or irrational even kindly adverse adjudications of innocent juveniles.thus,even if one deems reliability the only and ultimate measure of the constitutionality of what passes for prior convictions under jones and apprendi,the absence of a right to jury trial renders juvenile adjudications so unreliable as to be constitutionally infirm.
other factors also bring the reliability of such decisions into question.a recent harvard law review article marshals empirical evidence and even recent supreme court authority suggesting juries are more reliable fact finders.the article reports,recent studies suggest that judges are more likely than juries to develop cognitive biases favoring police at the expense of defendants,that the unique dynamic present in the format of jury deliberations enhances reliability,and that the diverse range of experiences represented by a jury increases the fairness of its evaluations as compared to those of a single judge.relying on such social science research,the supreme court itself recognized in ballew georgia that larger groups of factfinders are more reliable than smaller ones.
at an even more fundamental level the smalley court appears to overlook the essential principle underlying the apprendi decision.the rationale of that opinion focuses on the defendant constitutional right to jury trial and not the reliability of the resulting decisions.the supreme court did not reverse the trial judge decision finding apprendi had done the acts justifying an enhanced sentence because that determination was unreliable.no,the court did so because those facts had been determined by a judge rather than by a jury.
the same principle applies here.reliable or not,a judge rather than a jury made the decision appellant had done the criminal acts leading to his juvenile adjudication.and that adjudication,in turn,dramatically increased appellant sentence beyond that attaching to the offense of which the current jury convicted him.the juvenile court adjudication finding appellant had committed strike eligible criminal acts is no more or less reliable than the apprendi trial judge finding the defendant in that case had committed acts justifying an enhanced sentence in that case.the reliability of the apprendi judge decision was not enough to save it from reversal by the supreme court for lack of a jury trial of those facts.consequently,appellant juvenile adjudication is no more deserving of immunity from the constitutional requirement a defendant enjoy the right of trial by jury as to all facts enhancing a sentence beyond the maximum for the current offense.the smalley court insistence juvenile adjudications do not offend the apprendi principle because juvenile judges render reliable decisions is simply a non sequitur.
our colleagues on division four and in the fifth district,both in published decisions and several other california appellate courts in unpublished taken fundamentally the same position as the eighth circuit did in smalley.for reasons explained above,i differ with these courts,as i do with the majority opinion in this case they simply ignore how an exception for prior adult criminal convictions decided in earlier trials where defendants enjoyed the right to jury trial is consistent with apprendi,while such an exception for prior juvenile adjudications decided without the opportunity for a jury trial is inconsistent with that opinion and its underlying principle.
finally,the majority opinion argues the tighe court only meant to suggest a jury trial was required to decide whether defendants actually had suffered a prior juvenile than holding juvenile adjudications could not be used at all to enhance sentences because the underlying offense was not tried by a jury.in my view,this is a narrow although plausible reading of some ambiguous language in the tighe opinion i note,however,it is not the reading given to the tighe opinion by division four of this court,by the fifth district,by the harvard law review,or even united states smalley.
yet even if my colleagues interpretation of the ninth circuit decision in tighe were accurate,it would not detract from the logical validity of the constitutional argument set forth in this section of the dissent.the supreme court did say what the tighe court said it said in the portions of the latter opinion quoted fundamental principle all facts used to increase a defendant sentence above the maximum provided for the crime of which the jury found him guilty must be submitted to and decided by a jury if the defendant chooses.it likewise is true prior adult convictions were decided by juries if the defendant requested same and therefore satisfy the apprendi principle.and it is also true as set forth in the language quoted above from the tighe opinion,that the supreme court in jones united and apprendi new explained the exception which is not really an exception for prior convictions is justified by the fact these convictions result from trials at which defendant enjoyed the right to trial by jury.and it likewise is true prior juvenile adjudications in california and most other states were decided without the benefit of a right to jury trial.
consequently,i would be arguing the united states constitution,especially the apprendi line of cases interpreting that constitution,forecloses the use of prior juvenile adjudications as felony convictions in california three strikes sentencing scheme even if united states tighe had never been decided.the ninth circuit adoption of this line of reasoning might make it more persuasive,but that endorsement is not required to make it a sound interpretation of the united states constitution.
for any and all of the several alternative independent and sufficient grounds discussed above,i would reverse appellant three strike sentence.in my view,to tolerate such a punishment with two of the three qualifying offenses decided in proceedings where appellant lacked the right to jury trial offends both the united states and california constitutions and several hundred years of legal tradition as well.
prior to submitting the issue to the jury in a unitary trial,the trial court found beyond a reasonable doubt,based on fingerprint identification evidence,that smith was the individual listed in the california youth authority documents introduced to prove the prior juvenile adjudications.
although smith trial counsel asked the court to dismiss the prior strike adjudications in the interests of justice pursuant to penal code section and people superior court romero cal th,d,on appeal smith does not argue the trial court abused its discretion by declining to do so.accordingly,we do not address our dissenting colleague concern that the trial court may not have properly applied the factors articulated in people williams cal th,d,in deciding whether to dismiss a prior conviction,trial court should consider whether,in light of the nature and circumstances of his present felonies and prior serious violent felony convictions,and the particulars of his background,character,and prospects,the defendant may be deemed outside the three strikes scheme spirit,in whole or in part.we note,however,the issue of the appropriate standard of appellate review of a trial court decision declining to dismiss a prior conviction for purposes of sentencing under the three strikes law is currently pending before the supreme court.people carmony,review granted may.
similarly,in united states smalley cir,the court of appeals considered only the question whether juvenile adjudications can be characterized as prior convictions as that term is used in apprendi so that they can be used to increase the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum without being submitted and proved to a jury.italics added.
because we are not in any event bound by decisions of the lower federal courts,even on federal questions people cleveland cal th,d,people avena cal th,d,our disagreement with our dissenting colleague as to the holding of the divided panel in tighe is purely academic.there can be no dispute that nothing in the supreme court decision in apprendi itself precludes the california legislature from classifying juvenile adjudications involving serious or violent offenses as strikes for purposes of enhancing an adult offender sentence.
statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated.
section,subdivision d,provides in part a prior juvenile adjudication shall constitute a prior felony conviction for purposes of sentence enhancement if a the juvenile was years of age or older at the time he or she committed the prior offense.section,subdivision b,contains the same limitation to juvenile offenses committed at the age of or older.justice johnson thus employs,perhaps understandably,a bit of hyperbole when he refers in his dissenting opinion to qualifying strikes earned by young teenagers in proceedings where they lacked the fundamental constitutional right to trial by jury.dis,post,at.
section,subdivision b,provides the question of whether or not the defendant has suffered the prior conviction shall be tried by the jury that tries the issue upon the plea of not guilty,or in the case of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere,by a jury impaneled for that purpose,or by the court if a jury is waived.
as justice johnson readily acknowledges in his dissenting opinion,in light of nearly years of precedent beginning with in re daedler cal,only the california supreme court can now reconsider the question whether the california constitution confers a right to a jury trial in juvenile court proceedings.
pursuant to section,subdivision c,the trial court,not the jury,determined that smith was the person who had suffered the prior juvenile adjudications for robbery.smith does not argue he was misidentified or that the trial court erred in concluding the fingerprint evidence established this fact beyond a reasonable doubt.accordingly,even if there were error in this case under the tighe analysis,any such error would be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.people sengpadychith,supra,cal th at,d,apprendi error evaluated under the harmless error standard of chapman california,d federal constitutional error requires proof of harmlessness beyond a reasonable doubt see ring arizona,d,fn,d,apprendi extended to include finding of aggravating factors necessary to impose death sentence,but leaving it to lower court in first instance to evaluate whether error was prejudicial.
in addition,although the legislature and the electorate elected to treat certain juvenile adjudications as prior felonies for purposes of the three strikes law,juvenile adjudications can not be considered either a prior serious felony conviction for purposes of the mandatory enhancement in section,subdivision a people west d,or a prior conviction for purposes of section,elevating petty theft to a felony.in re anthony d.
of course,the assessment at the time of the initial decision to proceed in juvenile court is whether the minor appears at that time to be amendable to the care,treatment and training programs available through the facilities of the juvenile court see welf,subd.a.when the prior juvenile adjudication is pleaded and proved as a strike to enhance an adult offender sentence,the focus at sentencing is whether the defendant should be treated as a recidivist in light of the nature and circumstances of his or her present felonies and prior serious offenses,as well as the particulars of the defendant background,character and prospects.people williams,supra,cal th at,d.

as articulated in a decision,the test is whether,in light of the nature and circumstances of his present felonies and prior serious violent felony convictions,and the particulars of his background,character,and prospects,the defendant may be deemed outside the scheme spirit,in whole or in part,and hence should be treated as though he had not previously been convicted of one or more serious violent felonies.people williams cal th,d,italics added.
see,people benson cal th,d,discussing whether a conviction which has been stayed for purposes of punishment under penal code section could count as a strike in calculating a three strikes sentence.in a decision the court held the trial courts could but are not required to treat such a conviction as a strike.in the course of that discussion,however,the high court acknowledged it might be an abuse of discretion for a trial court to count two convictions arising out of the same act,as in the case before this court as two prior strikes.w e need not and do not determine whether there are some circumstances in which two prior felony convictions are so closely connected for example,when multiple convictions arise out of a single act by the defendant as distinguished from multiple acts committed in an indivisible course of a trial court would abuse its discretion under section if it failed to strike one of the priors.benson,at,fn,d,italics added.considering the combination of circumstances here,this case appears a good candidate for finding an abuse of discretion in not striking one of the two juvenile adjudications defendant received for a single act of robbery.
i recognize,as the majority opinion points out,appellate counsel failed to raise the romero issue in his briefs.this failure means we need not address the issue if we choose not to.it does not oust us from jurisdiction,however,to raise and decide it on our own motion.of course,to issue an opinion other than a dissent would require the court to give the parties an opportunity to brief and argue the matter.by including this mention in the dissent i am merely signaling my willingness and desire to do explaining why i consider it a significant although secondary issue in the context of this case.

we first examined all the english cases cited in any american decision as supporting the notion the inherent parens patriae jurisdiction of english equity justified a declaration of wardship based on the minor commission of a felony without trial by jury.our research only located five such cases.none of these decisions suggests english equity courts had power to shift custody from the parents to another individual or institution for any reason remotely resembling the minor involvement in criminal activity.indeed in none was the court jurisdiction activated by any type of misbehavior on the part of the juvenile.to the contrary,in each case the focus was on the usually the the parent or potential nonparent guardian of the child.in re javier,supra,d at.fns.omitted.
we are now in a position to summarize the status of the juvenile delinquent right to jury trial in england.youngsters charged with a limited class of minor criminal conduct could be deprived of liberty for a maximum of three months without a jury trial.but those charged with felonious conduct and most lesser criminal acts were entitled to trial by jury.parliament had expressly refused to pass legislation permitting juveniles to be committed to reform schools for periods longer than three months without a jury trial.and where equity parens patriae jurisdiction depended upon a minor personal misbehavior,those courts could only declare the minor a ward of the court after a jury found he had committed a felony.in re javier,supra,d at.
as one chevrolet coupe made crystal clear,the classification and accompanying right to jury trial was fixed in century england.to return to the language of one chevrolet coupe,the constitution does not permit the legislature to confer on the courts the power of trying according to the course of chancery any question which has always been triable according to the course of the common law by a jury.cal d at.whether equitable considerations indicated a youthful felon should be declared a ward of the court and placed in the custody of some benevolent organization or an individual other than his parents was a question tried according to the course of chancery under the authority of the infant felons act.but whether a given minor was a felon,that is,whether he indeed had committed a crime and for this reason was eligible to be declared a ward,that was a question which has always been triable according to the course of the common law by a jury.it is this historical right which is made inviolate by article i,section of the california constitution.the legislature can not extinguish this right merely by shifting the determination of criminal conduct from law to equity.in re javier,supra,d at.

in,the california supreme court was able to distinguish juvenile courts from adult criminal proceedings in glowing terms which spoke of benevolent purposes and minimal consequences.as described by the daedler court the purpose of the statute is to save minors under the age of years from prosecution and conviction on charges of misdemeanor and crimes and to relieve them from the consequent stigma attaching thereto to guard and protect them against themselves and persons surrounding them to protect and train them physically,mentally,and morally.it seeks to benefit not only the child but the community also by surrounding the child with better and more elevating influences and training it in all that counts for good citizenship and usefulness as a member of society.under it the state which through its appropriate organs is the guardian of the children within its borders assumes custody of the child,imposes wholesome restraint,and performs parental duties it is of the same nature as statutes which authorize compulsory education of children,the binding of them out during minority,the appointment of guardians and trustees to take charge of the property of those who are incapable of managing their own affairs,the confinement of the insane,and the like.in re daedler,supra,cal.at.quoting from the leading case of commonwealth fisher,ann.cas.the california court continued by characterizing the procedural aspects of the juvenile court in there was no trial for any crime here and the act is operative only when there is to be no trial.the very purpose of the act is to prevent a trial,though if the welfare of the public require that the minor should be tried,power to try it is not taken away but as already stated the act is not for the trial of a child accused of a crime but is mercifully to save him from such an ordeal with the prison or penitentiary in its wake,if the child own good and the best interests of the state justify such salvation.in re daedler,supra,cal.at,italics added.in re javier,supra,d at.
