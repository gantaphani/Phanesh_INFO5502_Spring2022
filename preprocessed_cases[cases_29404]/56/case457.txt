the parents of the minor executed a relinquishment of parental rights with the state department of social services state adoptions in conformance with family code section.subsequently,the juvenile court of del norte county terminated their parental rights.mother and father appeal from that order,made pursuant to welfare and institutions code section we consider first father contention in which counsel for the minor has joined that the juvenile court erred in holding the section hearing and in issuing orders that terminated parental rights and granted a request by the minor foster parents foster parents to be designated as prospective adoptive parents pursuant to section,subdivision n.father argues that in doing so the court impermissibly interfered with a final,voluntary relinquishment the parents had made to state adoptions.this relinquishment included a designation of persons other than the foster parents as the intended adoptive placement,namely,mother sister aunt and aunt husband see,subd.f.
as discussed below,we agree with this contention and reverse the orders of the juvenile court.second,we conclude that it is unnecessary to address mother contention,that the court violated notice requirements of the indian child welfare act icwa,because any defect in the notice provided to indian tribes,concerning the minor dependency proceeding,was rendered moot by the parents voluntary relinquishment to state adoptions.
background 
in november,the county department of health and human services department initiated these proceedings as to the minor born june.on january,the juvenile court established dependency jurisdiction over the minor after sustaining allegations under section,subdivisions b,g,and j.after a dispositional hearing on january,the court directed the minor removal for placement and ordered the department to provide reunification services to the parents.on this date,the minor was placed with foster parents,and 
at the conclusion of the status review hearing hearing on august,the juvenile court terminated reunification services and set the matter for a hearing under section.mother sought review of this order by petition for extraordinary writ.the underlying facts and procedural background up to this point are summarized in this court decision denying mother petition.superior court,nonpub.opn.
the juvenile court held a hearing on september,to review visitation between the parents and the minor pending the section hearing.at this hearing,mother counsel indicated that her preference,since the termination of reunification efforts,was to have the minor adopted by aunt,who resided in clovis,fresno county.on the other hand,foster parents had retained counsel and were jumping through all the hoops in as vigorous a way as they can in seeking to adopt the minor.for this reason,mother counsel moved for a hearing on her request to have the minor placed with aunt pursuant to the relative placement provisions of section counsel representing aunt,who was present at the hearing,mentioned to the court that both mother and father were in the process of preparing a designated relinquish ment with state adoptions that is,a voluntary relinquishment of their parental rights that would include their designation of a person with whom they intended the minor to be placed for adoption.see,subd.f.minor trial counsel supported mother request for a relative placement hearing,noting that aunt had made a very strong showing,and that it better normally to leave the child with family rather than with foster parents.counsel for the department stated that state adoptions should be involved in the hearing.
at the outset of the relative placement hearing under section,aunt counsel again noted that both parents were prepared to sign a relinquishment of their rights with state adoptions,designating aunt as the person they intended the minor to be placed for adoption.grandmother,the mother of both aunt and mother,appeared at the hearing and informed the court that the minor placement with aunt in clovis would interfere with her relationship with the minor,as well as the minor relationship with a half sibling,who lived with grandmother.grandmother further stated she herself was being considered for adoptive placement and,as she had previously adopted,queried why she should not be able to adopt the minor as well.mother testified to her desire that the minor be placed with aunt,stating she and minor had lived with aunt from before his birth until he was almost one year of age.mother explained neither she nor aunt had been able to maintain a relationship with her biological daughter and the minor half sibling because grandmother would not allow it.she indicated,however,that aunt would ensure the minor had contact with the minor two other half siblings,and,who had been adopted by their paternal grandmother.the state adoptions specialist for del norte county testified that she had only recently received an approved home study of aunt from the fresno branch of state adoptions.she stated that several families,including foster parents and grandmother,were also interested in adopting the minor,and she had not yet completed her adoption assessment for the section hearing.she recommended that the minor not be moved from his current placement with foster parents before she completed her assessment.at the conclusion of the hearing,on october,the court denied mother request for immediate placement of the minor with aunt.
meanwhile,both foster parents and aunt and filed requests for de facto parent status.the juvenile court granted these requests on november and november,respectively.on november,foster parents additionally filed a request to be designated as prospective adoptive parents pursuant to section,subdivision n.
the department report prepared for the section hearing,completed and filed december,recommended that the juvenile court terminate the parents parental rights and select adoption as the permanent plan.the department further recommended that the court designate foster parents as the prospective adoptive parents and that the minor remain placed with them for adoption.
the assessment by state adoptions,completed on december,by the arcata district manager,was submitted as an attachment to the department report.this assessment noted that in late november,mother and father had completed designated relinquishments identifying aunt and as the prospective adoptive parents.state adoption central office had received and acknowledged the completed relinquishment.state adoptions thus regarded aunt and as the minor prospective adoptive parents,deeming them suitable and committed to the adoption.it recommended that the juvenile court take into consideration the birth parents wishes,as reflected in their designated relinquishment.state adoptions noted that g iven the aforementioned designated relinquishments,in which the birth parents voluntarily terminated their parental rights,it is not necessary for the court to also move to terminate the parental rights of mother and father.declarations attached to the assessment averred that state adoptions headquarters had issued an acknowledgment of the relinquishment on december 
at the outset of the section hearing,on december,the juvenile court noted that it had before it the department report and its attachment.counsel for the minor pointed out,as a procedural matter that both parents had officially relinquished their claims,and thus there was no necessity for the classical reason of a section hearing.counsel for foster parents agreed,stating in effect there was no issue requiring a contested section hearing,as the parents could not contest the termination of parental rights they had already relinquished.the court continued the hearing without making any determination on this point.
at the continued hearing,on december,the juvenile court admitted the department report and the state adoptions assessment into evidence.counsel for aunt and expressed his view that the only issue to be resolved was whether state adoptions determined there would be serious detriment to the minor if he were removed from his current placement with foster parents.counsel for foster parents stated there was the additional issue of foster parents pending request for designation as prospective adoptive parents pursuant to section,subdivision n.father counsel made an objection to the court termination of parental rights based on the designated relinquishment of those rights.counsel for mother essentially expressed willingness to submit on the department report and the state adoptions assessment.the court,meanwhile,twice posed the question whether there was any reason not to complete our objectives under section,that is,to terminate parental rights and select adoption as the permanent plan.asking for any disagreement,and h earing none,the court proceeded to terminate both parents parental rights,made a finding that the minor was adoptable,and ordered a permanent plan of adoption.
counsel for foster parents then renewed his request that they be designated as prospective adoptive parents pursuant to section,subdivision n.counsel for aunt and objected on the ground that state adoptions had already determined that placement with aunt was appropriate pursuant to the parents designated relinquishments.the juvenile court did not find this objection persuasive,deeming the provisions of section,subdivision n,to be a procedure removing state adoptions placement discretion in a limited way.the court concluded that foster parents,aunt and,and grandmother were all to be designated as prospective adoptive parents,and continued the matter for an evidentiary hearing relating to the minor ultimate adoptive placement.
the parents appeal followed.
discussion 
i.the juvenile court orders impermissibly impaired the voluntary relinquishmenta.father contention 
father argues that the juvenile court erred in holding the hearing under section after the voluntary relinquishment he and mother made to state adoptions.he points out that the juvenile court had no right to limit their ability to make a voluntary relinquishment to a public adoptions agency that was willing to accept it,subd.b.father also points out that,once their designated relinquishment became final before the date set for the section hearing state adoptions was vested with exclusive custody and control of the minor until an order of adoption is granted,subd.a.in father view,the court decision to hold the section hearing,and to make orders that included one that terminated his and mother parental rights and one that granted foster parents request for designation as prospective adoptive parents under section,subdivision n,was error that impermissibly and prejudicially interfered with their voluntary relinquishment to state adoptions,with its designation of aunt and as the intended adoptive parents.appellate counsel for the minor has filed a responding brief that joins in this argument.
b.the statutory scheme 
father contention calls for a detailed examination of the family code provisions governing voluntary relinquishment and the applicable provisions of the dependency law.once a child is adjudged a dependent of the juvenile court,that court is authorized to issue orders that limit the control a parent may exercise over that child,to the extent necessary to protect the child,subd.a.the juvenile court may not,however,limit the ability of a parent to voluntarily relinquish his or her child to state adoptions or to a licensed county adoption agency at any time while the child is a dependent child of the juvenile court,if state adoptions or the county adoption agency is willing to accept the relinquishment,subd.b.
a birth parent may relinquish a child to state adoptions or a licensed adoption agency by a written statement signed before two subscribing witnesses and acknowledged before an authorized official of state adoptions or the licensed adoption agency,subd.a.to be effective,a certified copy of the relinquishment must be sent to and filed with state adoptions,subd.e.as noted above,a relinquishment generally becomes final when state adoptions sends a written acknowledgment of receipt of the relinquishment,or in any event after the lapse of business days after state adoptions receives the relinquishment for filing.see fn,ante.
after a relinquishment becomes final,it may be rescinded only by mutual consent of the relinquishing parent and state adoptions or the licensed adoption agency,subd.e.there is,however,one exception.as was done by father and mother in this case,a birth parent may name in his or her voluntary relinquishment the person or persons with whom he or she intends that placement of the child for adoption be made by state adoptions or the licensed adoption agency,subd.f.state adoptions or the licensed adoption agency may not accept a relinquishment under family code section including one that designates the intended adoptive parent unless the agency determines it is able to place the child for adoption,tit,subd.a.nevertheless,the provisions for voluntary relinquishment recognize that state adoptions or the licensed adoption agency,even after accepting a designated relinquishment,might ultimately decide either not to place the child with the designated persons or to remove the child from placement with the designated persons prior to granting of adoption.in such an event,state adoptions or the licensed adoption agency must provide notice of its decision to the relinquishing birth parent,subd.g.the relinquishing birth parent then has days from the mailing of the notice in which to rescind his or her relinquishment,or to rescind that relinquishment and make a new one that designates a different person or persons for adoptive placement,subd.h.with the exception of this right to rescind a designated relinquishment when the designated placement is terminated before an adoption order is granted,the filing of a voluntary relinquishment with state adoptions operates to terminate all parental rights and responsibilities with regard to the child,subd.j.
when a birth parent has voluntarily relinquished a child for adoption under family code section,and that child is a dependant of the juvenile court,the adoption agency accepting the relinquishment must,within five court days,provide written notice of the relinquishment to the juvenile court having jurisdiction,counsel for the minor,if any,and counsel for the relinquishing parent,if any,subd.i.
when a child is freed for adoption whether by voluntary relinquishment under family code section or by termination of parental rights the agency to whom the child has been freed becomes responsible for the care of the child,and is entitled to exclusive custody and control of the child until an order of adoption is granted,subd.a.the agency to whom the child has been freed for adoption may,in its discretion,terminate a temporary care placement or an adoptive placement at any time before an adoption order is granted,subd.a.the juvenile court retains jurisdiction over a dependent child freed for adoption,until the order of adoption is granted.see welf.inst.code,subd.c,subd.a.its oversight of placement decisions by the agency having exclusive custody and control however,is limited.once a petition for adoption has been filed by the prospective adoptive parents,the agency having exclusive custody and control may not remove the child from an adoptive placement with these parents without approval of the court that is,the juvenile court or family law court in which the adoption petition has been filed,subd.b see,subd.e.but before the prospective adoptive parents file an adoption petition,the juvenile court may interfere with or disapprove a placement decision made by the agency having exclusive custody and control only if the agency decision is patently absurd or unquestionably not in the minor best interests.in re harry th,d,quoting department of social services superior court th,d theodore.
this limitation on the juvenile court oversight of the adoption agency placement decisions was modified by legislation.if the court,by order or judgment,declares the child free from custody and control of both parents,or one parent if the other does not have custody and control state adoptions or the licensed adoption agency shall be entitled to the exclusive care and control of the child at all times until a petition for adoption is granted,except as specified in subdivision n,subd.j,italics added.subdivision n,in turn,authorizes the juvenile court at a section hearing or any time thereafter,to designate a current as a prospective adoptive parent if the caretaker has taken care of the child for at least six months,has expressed a commitment to adoption,and has taken at least one step to facilitate the adoption process,subd.n,italics added.the designation gives the caretaker limited standing in the dependency proceeding,essentially requiring the agency to give the caretaker notice of any proposed decision it has made to remove the child from placement with the caretaker,permitting the caretaker to file a petition with the juvenile court objecting to the proposed removal,and permitting removal of the child only if the court determines removal is in the child best interest,subd.n see wayne superior court th,d.
finally,we note that section generally outlines the procedures by which the juvenile court selects a permanent plan for a dependent child in order to provide a stable,permanent home for that child,choosing,in order of preference,a plan of either adoption,legal guardianship,or foster care,subd.b.the court may select a plan of adoption only after ordering the termination of parental rights,and,if the petition for adoption is filed with the juvenile court,may proceed with the adoption only after the appellate rights of the natural parents have been exhausted,subd.b see also,subds.c e.
but section is not the exclusive procedure to terminate parental rights in a dependency proceeding.with regard to a dependent child,the exclusive procedures for permanently terminating parental rights are those specified in section,and also those specified in several family code sections including section,subd.a.
c.the interplay of voluntary relinquishment and dependency law 
the foregoing provisions,read together,clearly evidence a legislative intent to preserve without limitation the right of a birth parent of a dependent child to relinquish voluntarily his or her parental rights and free the child for adoption through a public adoption agency.welf.inst.code,subd.b,subd.a.this right includes the ability to participate in the adoption process to the extent of designating a relative or other person with whom the birth parent intends the public adoption agency to place the child for adoption.it also includes the right notwithstanding the voluntary relinquishment of all other parental rights to rescind the relinquishment within the specified day period,in the event that the public adoption agency terminates the designated placement before adoption is final,subds.f,g h.these rights necessarily continue throughout the dependency proceeding,at least until the juvenile court has ordered the involuntary termination of parental rights,an order that obviously leaves the birth parent with no further rights to relinquish.
here the juvenile court,at its hearing on december,had before it the state adoptions assessment and attached declarations.the assessment and declarations indicated that the parents had completed a voluntary,designated relinquishment that had been accepted by state adoptions,a public adoption agency,and that duly became final on december,when state adoptions headquarters gave written acknowledgment of the relinquishment.see,subd.e a.the court was on notice,as the minor trial counsel pointed out,that there was no necessity for a section hearing,at least in its classical sense,because the parents had exercised their right under section,subdivision b,to relinquish their parental rights and free the minor for adoption through a public adoption agency.
neither the dependency law nor the applicable rules of court specify what the juvenile court must do in such circumstances that is,when the parents make a voluntary designated relinquishment that becomes final after the court has set a section hearing,but before the date set for the section hearing.the scheme outlined above,however,makes it clear what a juvenile court may not do.the court is barred by section,subdivision b,from making any order that interferes with a birth parent final voluntary designated relinquishment.
the orders made by the juvenile court in this case impermissibly interfered with the parents relinquishment in several respects.first and foremost,the court was no longer authorized to order the involuntary termination of parental rights.the parents had effectively terminated their parental rights through the alternative procedure of voluntary relinquishment,an alternative expressly authorized by section,subdivision a.moreover,an order of involuntary termination,once it becomes final,is conclusive and binding in nature,both on the parents and the minor,and the juvenile court can not set it aside,subd.i.as such,it would necessarily interfere with and effectively cut off the parents one remaining right to rescind their relinquishment in the event the designated placement was terminated before adoption became final,subds.g h.
because the court could not properly make an order that involuntarily terminated father and mother parental rights,it was also precluded from making an order under section placing the minor for adoption,subd.b.the minor had already been placed for adoption through the final designated relinquishment,at which point state adoptions was entitled to exclusive custody and control of the minor until the granting of an order of adoption,subd.a.the most that the juvenile could properly do,under theses circumstances,was to hold a hearing for the purpose of vacating the scheduled section hearing,and state on the record its reasons for doing so.that is,the selection of a permanent plan under section had become unnecessary because the parents and state adoptions,through a final voluntary designated relinquishment,had freed the minor for adoption through state adoptions,a public adoption agency.
finally,it was error for the juvenile court in this instance to issue an order granting the request of the minor current caregivers,foster parents,for designation as prospective adoptive parents.such an order may only be made at a section hearing or thereafter,subd.n.but the court in this instance could not accomplish the purposes of a section hearing.it was precluded by the final voluntary designated relinquishment from ordering the involuntary termination of parental rights,and thus from ordering the minor placed for adoption.nor was the court authorized to select any other permanent plan,as the relinquishment had effectively accomplished such a selection by freeing the minor for adoption through state adoptions.as we have noted,the only proper course open to the court was to vacate the section hearing,and thus it was premature for the court to consider properly any request for designation as prospective adoptive parents under section,subdivision n.more importantly,the order designating foster parents as prospective adoptive parents was in critical conflict with the father and mother final designation of aunt and as the intended adoptive placement,in violation of section,subdivision b and family code section,subdivision f.
the department argues that the juvenile court was entitled to proceed with the section hearing in order to address the protections offered to current caregivers under subdivision n of section,because those provisions are applicable n otwithstanding section of the family code.see,subd.n.the simple answer to this is that exclusive custody and control provisions of family code section apply when a child has been freed for adoption by either relinquishment or termination of parental rights,subd.a,italics added.when this language is read together with section,subdivision n,it is clear that the procedures of section,subdivision n,are intended to limit the exclusive custody and control provisions of family code section only when the child has been freed for adoption through a juvenile court order terminating parental rights involuntarily in a section hearing.the protections for current caregivers under section,subdivisio
