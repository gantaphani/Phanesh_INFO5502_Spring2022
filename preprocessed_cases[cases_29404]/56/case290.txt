mother appeals a juvenile court order terminating her parental rights to her children,and,and choosing adoption as the appropriate permanent plan under welfare and institutions code section.mother contends the court erroneous finding that the children should be removed from their relative caregiver and placed in a foster home under section deprived her of the ability to raise an exception to the adoption preference under section,subdivision c a.mother also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the court finding that the beneficial relationship exception to the adoption preference is inapplicable.
jose,the presumed father of and father,joins mother arguments and maintains his due process rights were violated when the court terminated his parental rights without having made a detriment finding as to him.
we conclude the court findings under section as well as its determination that the beneficial relationship exception did not apply are supported by substantial evidence.we also find that father invited the error he now appeals,and even if he did not do so,the juvenile court findings were sufficient to support termination of father rights.accordingly,we affirm.
factual and procedural history 
on september,the san diego county health and human services agency agency filed petitions on behalf of and,ages five and two respectively.filed under section,subdivision b,the petitions alleged mother excessive use of methamphetamine placed the brothers at a substantial risk of suffering serious physical harm because her drug abuse and history of substance abuse rendered mother unable to provide the children with regular care.the petitions also alleged mother admitted to weekly drug use and she tested positive for methamphetamine on september.
in the september,detention report,social worker james marcuzzo reported this was not first dependency experience.he was taken into protective custody in may when his parents were arrested,both for possession of dangerous drugs and probation violations.drugs and drug paraphernalia were found in the family home accessible to the child.mother ultimately reunified with after successfully completing her case plan.however,father remained in prison.mother also had a prior dependency case with her oldest child,angelica,in.the case began with family maintenance while mother and angelica lived in the kiva substance abuse program.however,mother was eventually arrested in march,failed to reunify with angelica,and angelica father was granted sole physical and legal custody of her.
according to marcuzzo,on september,the agency became concerned mother may have been producing methamphetamine in her home.chula vista police investigated the home times during the year,the majority of which were for suspected drug use on the premises.during an interview mother claimed,however,the maternal grandmother and the children had made false allegations against her because of her history of drug use.she also disclosed she had video cameras set up outside her home because of her fear of retaliation,the result of prior involvement with criminal activity and the mexican mafia.
marcuzzo reported when he interviewed mother she presented as a person who was drug free.however,though she claimed she had not been using illegal substances,both mother and her boyfriend tested positive for methamphetamine with drug levels consistent with chronic binge use.mother then acknowledged she had been using drugs three times a week during the previous six months,generally just prior to the children returning home from school.
marcuzzo reported he also interviewed on september at the palomar elementary school.reported he lived with his mother,brother,and p apa mike.he also reported grandpa rick visited regularly,but he did not like grandpa rick because he made him smoke a cigarette.described the cigarette as red and white and as long as a pen.the child also reported all the adults smoked small cigarettes and the big cigarette that was hard,yellow and purple,and made out of a bottle.nevertheless,marcuzzo recommended the children remain in mother care while she engaged in family maintenance services.
mother appeared at the detention hearing held september,and filed parentage inquiry questionnaires for both and in which she identified father as the boys father.the court did not follow the agency placement recommendation,but,instead,ordered the children detained at the polinsky children center or in an approved foster home.
in the october,jurisdiction and disposition report,social worker loretta de cunzo reported the agency had placed and with their maternal aunt natalie and it appeared they were appropriately cared for.de cunzo also reported mother disclosed father was incarcerated in a federal prison in indiana until may on drug charges involving a mexican drug cartel.however,de cunzo was unable to verify father whereabouts through the federal and state prison locators.
de cunzo had no doubt mother loved her children yet her continued drug use placed and at serious risk of harm.therefore,de cunzo recommended the court continue the children in care and order mother to participate in reunification services.de cunzo recommended mother participate in a case plan comprised of general counseling,a psychological evaluation,parenting education,and substance abuse services,including an outpatient substance abuse program,attendance at a minimum of two step meetings weekly,and on demand drug testing.
the court held the jurisdiction and disposition hearing on october,and found the petition allegations true and also found the agency had made reasonable efforts to locate father and notify him of the proceedings,all findings made by clear and convincing evidence.the court then ordered the agency to continue its search efforts to locate father,and placement with natalie continued,and mother to participate in the dependency drug court in addition to her current services.
in the status review report dated april,de cunzo reported that father whereabouts remained unknown and and placement with natalie continued to be appropriate.in the meantime,mother entered the south bay women recovery center in october where she completed seven of parenting classes and attended drug treatment three times weekly.however,during the reporting period mother missed several treatments and failed to drug test four times.she did,however,drug test on april,with negative results.
on february,mother completed a psychological evaluation with christopher carstens.carstens diagnosed mother as being amphetamine or dependent as well as having relationship problems.though carstens acknowledged that people do sometimes recover completely from methamphetamine abuse,he expressed concern that,because of mother comments,she was not committed to sobriety or avoidance of people who lead her to substance abuse.carstens opined that could change over the ensuing six months.
the court held the review hearing on april,found mother had made some progress with the provisions of her case plan,and ordered the agency to provide her with six additional months of services.the court also continued the children placement with natalie.
in the october,status review report,de cunzo reported and continued to live with natalie and appeared comfortable and well cared for.in the interim,mother continued to attend the south bay women recovery program once a week and remained employed by a south bay insurance company.additionally,though she was provided referrals for individual therapy as early in this dependency as november and again in june,mother did not engage in therapy until august.father whereabouts remained unknown.
according to de cunzo,the agency granted mother short unsupervised visits in late august.in earlier supervised visits,mother was observed to be loving and affectionate towards and.she provided snacks,gave both children individual attention,and took their lead in play activities.de cunzo noted what while mother had made a good start at addressing her drug use through treatment and negative testing,she had not yet demonstrated she had gained insight into the cause of her drug use.de cunzo opined mother needed to explore her triggers and red flags and develop a viable relapse prevention plan.nevertheless,mother reported if she could not reunify with and,she wanted them placed with either of their maternal aunts,natalie or claudia 
in the march,status review report,social worker christina morse stated the children caregiver,natalie,telephoned her to report mother had been beaten up by her michael additionally,natalie disclosed michael had transported and to her home on january in violation of the court no contact order issued in september.when contacted,mother denied she had been involved in a domestic violence incident or that the children had been in the presence of michael in violation of the court order.however,according to the police report,michael punched mother on her face and chest and pulled her hair repeatedly.additionally,and disclosed they had spent christmas eve and christmas day with mother and michael and that they argued at times.as a result,morse suspended mother overnight visits with the boys.
on january,morse met with mother at her home.during the ensuing conversation mother acknowledged michael had contact with and during the christmas holiday and disclosed that she and michael had gotten married in april while he was still in prison.mother agreed to have no further contact with michael or any of his friends or acquaintances and to obtain a restraining order as soon as possible.she also agreed to participate in domestic violence treatment when referred and to submit to a drug test that day,but later claimed she could not test because she lost her identification.
on january,mother informed morse of a second domestic violence incident with michael that occurred the day before.mother reported michael had held her in her home against her will and would not allow her to open the door when chula vista police arrived.police eventually forced their way into the home and arrested michael.according to mother,the court issued her a temporary restraining order earlier that same day.
on february,morse met with mother to discuss her relationship with michael.mother claimed michael sought help from his probation officer but received none.she also claimed michael loved her,wanted to be with her and the children,and she loved him and could not abandon him.because mother violated the court order of protection on at least three occasions and exposed the children to violence between her and michael,morse concluded she could not protect and from emotional abuse.morse noted mother lied to the agency and the court about the extent of her ongoing relationship with michael.she had not demonstrated she was able to successfully complete a domestic violence treatment program or develop a detailed domestic violence safety plan.morse recommended mother visitation remain supervised,that the court terminate her reunification services,and schedule a selection and implementation hearing.
in the april,addendum report,morse reported mother completed the south bay women recovery center drug program on november,and although the center offered her recommended aftercare,she rejected the offer.morse attempted to contact mother to request she drug test but was unsuccessful.additionally,after completing one domestic violence treatment group class,mother failed to return to the program.
the court held the month permanency review hearing on april,and found mother had not made substantive progress with the provisions of her case plan.thus,there was not a substantial probability and would be returned to mother physical custody within the subsequent six months because to do so would be detrimental to the children physical and emotional.the court found the agency had offered or provided mother reasonable services,terminated services,continued the children placement with natalie,and scheduled a selection and implementation hearing.
in the april,addendum report,social worker robyn santana reported the agency located father in the federal correctional institution in terre haute,indiana.father reported he was not aware the children were in foster care and requested an attorney be appointed to represent him.he further stated he had been incarcerated since and would be until,and that he might be deported to mexico once he was released.
the court held a special hearing on april,appointed counsel to represent father as he requested,and arranged for him to appear telephonically.the court found it was not required to make a detriment finding as to father because father had not requested custody of the children,and father counsel told the court that such a finding would not be appropriate.the court ordered father have supervised visits with and in accordance with the rules and regulations of the facility in which he was incarcerated.the court also ordered telephonic visits with the children be supervised.
in the july,section assessment report,social worker lengpea yang reported and remained placed with natalie where they had been since september.yang had been able to observe only four visits between mother and her children because the inability to reach mother by telephone made scheduling difficult.telephone calls went directly to mother voice mail and yang could not leave messages because her mail box was constantly full.
yang reported and were typically ready and waiting to go to their visit and left their caregivers willingly.when they arrived at the visits,the children appeared happy to see their mother,smiled and yelled mommy.at the first visit,mother forgot to bring juice because she was in a rush to get to the visit on time,but did bring pop tarts for the boys.she promised she would bring juice for the second visit,but on the next visit,she failed to arrive with any snacks.was hungry so yang shared her granola bar with him.
for the third visit,mother brought pizza and juice.throughout the visit,mother followed each child lead in play and both children were talkative.yang opined and were comfortable in their mother presence.at the end of the visit,the children kissed and hugged mother goodbye,but neither displayed any emotional distress when they separated or during the ride back to the caregiver home.
yang concluded and were likely to be adopted if the court terminated parental rights.the children were specifically adoptable because their maternal aunt,claudia,living in nevada,was very interested in adopting them and had begun the process of obtaining an contingent home study.if,for some reason,claudia could not adopt and,there were approved san diego county families interested in adopting the boys together.
yang noted this was the second dependency and had been through because of the same protective issues,and the agency remained concerned for the children safety.while mother did complete a drug treatment program,she could not identify any of the steps of the recovery model,though she claimed she had worked on the first three steps.therefore,yang recommended the court identify adoption as the children preferred permanent plan.
yang reported she assessed mother relationships with and by comparing the strength and quality of the relationships with the benefits of adoption.in doing so,yang opined mother had not been able to consistently demonstrate she could meet her children needs.she could not provide them with a safe and stable home environment,and she exposed them to domestic violence while violating a court order she stay away from michael.yang did note that during visits mother displayed some parenting skills with the children and expressed both physical and verbal affection towards them.however,mother had not served in a parental role to the children for nearly two years.though and had a good time visiting with mother,in yang opinion,they did not view her as a primary parent who filled their needs.
yang concluded the benefits of adoption outweighed the benefits of maintaining the relationships and had with mother.adoption provided the children with safety and the stability of being a permanent part of a family.therefore,yang recommended the court terminate all parental rights and order adoption as the children permanent plan.
in the july,addendum report,yang reported that father had requested his mother,and sister,be assessed for and possible placement.after several unsuccessful attempts at contacting and,a relative home assessment worker learned from that she and lived together and were unable to care for and yang also reported claudia continued to work with the state of nevada to complete her home study for placement.yang reported she asked the children how they felt about the possibility of living with claudia in nevada and they responded,that would be great 
in the august,addendum report,yang reported her observations garnered from mother three visits with and over the previous days.on the first visit,the children greeted mother by asking if she had brought food.however,as was the case on several occasions in the past,mother had not done so,claiming she had run out of time.when later in the visit mother asked for a hug,he ignored her and continued to read a comic book.on the next visit,mother was minutes late,claiming she had to stop at the store to pick up food.however,on the last visit,mother once again failed to provide snacks for the boys,prompting to ask yang if she had a granola bar.later asked mother to buy them a snack from the office vending machine.while mother was gone,the boys spoke with their attorney investigator and talked about the time they spent with claudia and their cousins.
yang reported claudia had not completed nevada icpc requirements to have and placed in her home.additionally,yang discussed permanent plan options with the children caregiver,natalie,who expressed interest only in assuming legal guardianship of the boys if claudia could not adopt them.
on september,the agency filed supplemental section petitions on behalf of and alleging their placements with natalie were no longer appropriate because two days earlier the caregiver asked that the children be removed,as she could no longer care for them.
according to the september,detention report,in june,natalie reported she and her boyfriend isaac were not interested in caring for and long term.at that time it was unclear if the icpc for claudia would be approved,and natalie said she and isaac would assume guardianship of the boys only if it was not.in late august,yang informed natalie the icpc was not complete,but for relative home assessment rha to approve the boys placement with her,she and isaac would have to find another residence.yang explained rha could not approve the placement because natalie lived on the same property as mother,who had a criminal and child protective services history.additionally,the boys maternal grandmother,who also lived on the same property,refused to cooperate with the agency and submit to live scan testing.
yang reported during the first week in september natalie informed her she and isaac could no longer care for and natalie explained isaac had lost his job and they could not afford to move from the family property,which she partially owned and where she did not have to pay rent.however,natalie expressed her willingness to work with the agency to find and the most permanent placement available.on september,natalie reported though she and isaac wanted to continue to care for the children,isaac was beginning to train for a new job in texas the next day and the children had to be removed immediately.natalie said once isaac completed his day probationary period,she would join him in texas and within days find a suitable residence for the family.she wanted and placed in foster care,but returned to her and isaac once they were settled.therefore,on september,the agency removed the children from natalie home and placed them with a confidential licensed foster family.
the court held the detention hearing on the section petition on october,and confirmed its findings that the agency had made a prima facie showing the allegations were true by clear and convincing evidence.the court ordered and detained in an approved confidential foster home and confirmed all prior visitation orders.
in the october,addendum report,yang reported since august she had observed four visits between the children and mother.visits were held weekly and after august had been increased from one hour to two.prior to two visits,said he no longer wanted to visit with mother.expressed similar feelings before a visit in october.however,with minimal encouragement,the children agreed to attend visits.yang explained that mother brought snacks and toys to the visits.the children typically ate snacks while talking about their week.once finished,usually ran to the monkey bars and played alone or with other children at the park.on the second visit,mother asked to spend the last minutes of the visit with her,but he refused,and on the third visit,wanted to be alone for the last minutes of the visit.
yang noted that while mother had demonstrated some parenting skills during visits with and,she had not been a parent to the children for the previous two years.although and appeared to enjoy visits with mother earlier in the dependency,yang observed their feelings had begun to change.she opined the children did not view mother as their primary parent,but instead,viewed her more as a friendly visitor.the children looked forward to visits because mother provided snacks and gifts,but yang believed those benefits from the relationship did not outweigh the benefits adoption would provide.therefore,yang recommended the court terminate the parents parental rights and order and permanent plan be adoption.
on october,the court held the combined jurisdiction and disposition hearings on the agency section petitions and the contested selection and implementation hearing pursuant to section.the court first proceeded with a document trial as to jurisdiction on the section petitions and received in evidence the agency section assessment report and the addendum report both dated july,the september detention report,yang curriculum vitae,and her stipulated testimony.
according to her curriculum vitae,yang held a bachelor degree in both human development and psychology and a master degree in social work.she became employed by the agency as a protective services worker in october and since has completed the hour public child welfare training academy instructional program as well as hours of agency generated instruction,including but not limited to specialized training in such disciplines as permanent placement assessment,visitation for adoptions,guardianship training,and investigation.
per her stipulated testimony,yang was assigned this case on april.once she was able to reach mother and arrange visitation,mother visited with and once weekly for one hour.she did not ask for additional visits until august nor did she ask for telephonic visits until september.yang extended the visits to two hours and provided mother with the foster parents telephone number.
yang stipulated testimony included that the boys were in a foster home with parents who had no criminal or child protective services history,had an approved adoptive home study,and wanted to adopt and however,they were not interested in guardianship.according to yang,the foster parents were willing to facilitate ongoing contact between the boys and their biological relatives including mother.
yang also would have testified that on their first night in the foster home and asked to telephone natalie but not mother.she opined saw mother more as a friendly visitor than as a parent.though showed affection toward mother at visits,he rarely initiated it and separated easily from her when visits ended.though appeared closer to mother than,he too separated easily when visits were over.
yang stated and would not have been greatly harmed if they could no longer have contact with mother.in that regard,yang opined the benefits of adoption outweighed those of maintaining the children relationships with mother.in reaching her opinion,yang considered,among other things,the boys ages,the fact that this was their second trip though the dependency system,that mother failed to reunify with another child,mother drug history,and her recent contact with her husband,michael.yang believed and deserved a permanent plan of adoption,not foster
