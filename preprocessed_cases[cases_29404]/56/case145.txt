michael alvarado was convicted of second degree murder and attempted robbery and is currently serving a to life sentence in california state prison.alvarado conviction was obtained primarily based on statements he made during a interrogation that occurred when he was years old.alvarado now seeks a writ of habeas corpus,alleging that he was deprived of his fifth amendment rights in violation of miranda arizona,d.the district court denied alvarado request for relief.our review of this case is governed by the and effective death penalty act of aedpa,which permits us to grant a federal writ of habeas corpus only if the underlying state court decision is either contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court.see d.
in haley ohio,the supreme court established the legal principle that juvenile defendants are,in general,more susceptible to police coercion than adults as such,due process demands that a defendant juvenile status be taken into consideration when determining the proper procedural safeguards that attach to a custodial interrogation.id.at.during the last half century,the court has consistently reaffirmed this principle.see,withrow williams,d fare michael,d schneckloth bustamonte,d in re gault,d gallegos colorado,d.to date,the supreme court has not directly addressed the issue of how a defendant juvenile status modifies an in custody determination for the purposes of miranda.however,haley and its progeny are highly instructive precedents to the case now before us.if a juvenile is more susceptible to police coercion during a custodial interrogation,then the same juvenile is also more susceptible to the impression that he is,in fact,in custody in the first instance.
in this case,the california court of appeal identified the correct legal standard for making an in custody determination.see thompson keohane,d stating that an in custody determination requires an inquiry into whether a reasonable person would have felt he or she was not at liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave but the california court of appeal and the district court upon habeas review failed to address how alvarado juvenile status,including the involvement of his parents at the behest of the police,affected the in custody determination.relevant supreme court precedents lead us to conclude that alvarado youth and inexperience with the police are simply too important to be ignored.moreover,on the facts of this case,proper consideration of this additional factor compels a different outcome,even under the highly deferential standard of review mandated by the aedpa.we therefore reverse the judgment of the district court.
the underlying facts of this case are not in dispute.on the night of september,a murder occurred at a shopping mall in santa fe springs,california.approximately one month later,sheriff detective cheryl comstock contacted the defendant mother at her place of employment and informed her that police officials needed to speak to her son,michael alvarado.alvarado mother told comstock that michael father would bring him to the sheriff station so he could be interviewed.both alvarado mother and father accompanied their son to the sheriff station.however,they were refused permission to be present during the interview.when these events occurred,alvarado was years old,had no criminal history and had never been questioned by the police.
the interview,which was conducted exclusively by comstock,lasted approximately two hours.during that time,alvarado was not given a statement to sign indicating in any manner that he was participating voluntarily in the interview,nor was he advised of his miranda rights.alvarado initially offered an account of his activities on the night of the murder that did not include reference to the shooting or to the hiding of a gun the most incriminating aspects of his subsequent statements.comstock then expressed disbelief at alvarado version of events and informed him that she,in fact,had witnesses who said quite the opposite.shortly thereafter,alvarado began to divulge details of the murder and of his role in hiding the murder weapon.well into the course of the interview,and after alvarado had started talking about the shooting and the hiding of the gun,comstock made comments implying that alvarado would be going home at the end of the interview.alvarado statements during the interview were admitted into evidence at trial.alvarado later took the witness stand in his own defense.
alvarado was convicted of second degree murder and attempted robbery in a jury trial.his conviction was subsequently affirmed by the california court of appeal on september.in both the trial court and on appeal,alvarado raised his age as a relevant factor in the miranda analysis.unfortunately,the decision of the california court of appeal did not specifically discuss whether alvarado juvenile status altered the miranda analysis.instead,the court concluded that a reasonable person under the circumstances in which alvarado was questioned would have felt free to leave.the interrogation was not custodial and no miranda warnings were required.soto,slip op.at.from the face of the opinion,it does not appear that alvarado age and inexperience with the police were included as part of the in custody analysis.in october,alvarado filed a petition for review in the california supreme court,which was denied on december.
on march,petitioner filed a petition for habeas corpus,pursuant to,in the district court.on july,a magistrate judge issued a report recommending that the district court dismiss the petition with prejudice.applying a totality of circumstances standard for determining whether alvarado was in custody,the magistrate judge concluded that a reasonable person during the interrogation would have felt free to leave therefore,alvarado was not in custody during the interview.
on august,the district court adopted the magistrate report and recommendation and denied alvarado petition.the district court also denied alvarado request for a certificate of appealability.on december,this court granted alvarado certificate of appealability with respect to one issue whether statements made by defendant were erroneously admitted by the trial court in violation of miranda arizona,d.
a denial of a writ of habeas corpus presents a question of law that is reviewed de novo,though factual findings will be reviewed for clear error.see hartman summers,cir perez marshall,cir.a determination whether an individual is in custody for the purposes of miranda warnings is really a mixed question of law and fact,which is subject to de novo review by appellate courts however,the state trial court answers to the questions,the underlying factual questions still are entitled to a presumption of correctness.bains cambra,cir citing thompson,at.
this case is,of course,a collateral appeal filed pursuant to.several years ago,the aedpa modified these statutory sections and made more deferential the standard of review to be applied by a federal court in examining the claims of a prisoner under judgment of a state court.in this circuit,review of a habeas petition under the aedpa requires a inquiry.the first question is whether the state court erred at all.anthony cambra,cir citing van tran lindsey,cir.if the answer is yes,then we apply the aedpa standard of review,which inquires whether the state court error was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as defined in the precedents of the supreme court.see d van tran,at requiring federal courts to first determine whether the state court decision was erroneous,prior to considering whether it was contrary to or involved an unreasonable application of controlling law under aedpa,promotes clarity in our own constitutional jurisprudence and also provides guidance for state courts,which can look to our decisions for their persuasive value.we now address in order the two stages of this inquiry.
in the case now before us,alvarado claims that his fifth amendment rights were violated because he incriminated himself without ever being informed of his rights under miranda,at.the supreme court holding in miranda,of course,generally precludes the evidentiary use of statements resulting from a custodial interrogation unless the suspect has been first advised of his or her constitutional rights.see stansbury california,d miranda,at.although miranda warnings are required only when a suspect interviewed by the police is in custody,stansbury,at.miranda,at,alvarado asserts that he easily passes the supreme court test for a custody determination,which is whether,under the totality of circumstances,a reasonable person would have felt he or she was not at liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave.thompson,at.see also berkemer mccarty,d holding that the only relevant inquiry to determine whether a suspect was in custody is how a reasonable man in the suspect position would have understood his situation.
ninth circuit case law has further elaborated the totality of circumstances inquiry by identifying several factors that are relevant to the in custody determination 
pertinent areas of inquiry include the language used by the officer to summon the individual,the extent to which he or she is confronted with evidence of guilt,the physical surroundings of the interrogation,the duration of the detention and the degree of pressure applied to detain the individual.based upon a review of all the pertinent facts,the court must determine whether a reasonable innocent person in such circumstances would conclude that after brief questioning he or she would not be free to leave.

under the specific facts of this case,alvarado presents a compelling argument.detective comstock contacted alvarado mother at her place of employment and informed her that the police needed to speak with her son.both parents then accompanied alvarado,who was then only years old,to the sheriff station so that he could be interviewed.despite the fact that alvarado had never been questioned by police before,his parents were refused permission to be present during the interview.alvarado was then escorted to an interrogation room,where detective comstock conducted a interview about the events of september.despite the fact that alvarado initially denied any knowledge or involvement in a crime,comstock repeatedly pressured alvarado to tell the truth as purportedly disclosed by the three notebooks of notes she had compiled from her interviews with alleged witnesses to the crime.well into the course of the interview,after a substantial amount of incriminating material had been obtained,alvarado was told that he could use the phone.only at the end of the interview did comstock inform alvarado that he was free to go.
in response,the state argues that supreme court precedents have consistently held that when a suspect is not placed under arrest,voluntarily goes to the police station and is allowed to leave unhindered by the police after a brief interview,a finding of custody for miranda purposes is unwarranted.see,california beheler,d no custody found when suspect voluntarily came to police station,was told he was not under arrest and was allowed to leave after thirty minute interview oregon mathiason,d no custody found when officer left card at suspect home stating that he would like to discuss something and to call,suspect voluntarily came to police station,was told he was a suspect,and was allowed to leave at conclusion of thirty minute interview.moreover,the state points out that a determination of custodial interrogation does not necessarily follow from the fact that the interviewee is suspected of a crime,is questioned in the confines of a police station or is subjected to trickery or deceit during the course of the police interview.see mathiason,at.police falsely stated that suspect fingerprints had been found at the scene of the crime.in the instant case,the state argues that comstock merely told alvarado that she did not believe his version of the september events.
nevertheless,alvarado makes a strong case that mathiason,a principal case relied on by the district court to deny alvarado miranda claim,is distinguishable on several grounds.first,the suspect in mathiason came to the police station voluntarily and was told immediately that he was not under arrest.id.at.in contrast,arrangements for the alvarado interview were made by his parents,who accompanied him to the police station moreover,alvarado was never told he was not under arrest.second,the interview in mathiason lasted only thirty minutes,and the suspect admitted his guilt within the first five minutes.id.at.in the case now before us,alvarado was interviewed for a full two hours and repeatedly denied any involvement in the shooting incident.only after he was subjected to various interrogation tactics designed to break down his defenses did he offer any incriminating statements.moreover,these statements occurred well into the course of the interview third,the suspect in mathiason was a parolee who obviously had some knowledge of the criminal justice system.id.in contrast,alvarado had no prior experience with the police.to buttress this point,alvarado directs our attention to minnesota murphy,d,which reasoned 
many of the psychological ploys discussed in miranda capitalize on the suspect unfamiliarity with the officers and the environment.murphy regular meetings with his probation officer should have served to familiarize him with her and her office and to insulate him from psychological intimidation that might overbear his desire to claim the fifth amendment privilege.
id.at.ruling that parolee who gave incriminating testimony during scheduled meeting with parole officer was not in custody for purposes of miranda.
based on these considerations,we agree with alvarado that the supreme court authorities relied on by the state court do not control the specific facts of this case.namely,alvarado was only years old and had no criminal history when the interview occurred,it lasted for approximately two hours the interviews in mathiason and beheler lasted thirty minutes and his parents,who brought alvarado to the police station at the request of detective comstock,were refused permission to be present during the interview.
although both alvarado and the state make their in custody arguments under an objective standard,alvarado status as a minor is an important subsidiary issue that potentially alters the constitutional analysis.unfortunately,this issue was essentially ignored in the prior state and federal court proceedings.the state cites united states erving,cir,to establish that the standard for evaluating the existence of custody remains objective.however,our own reading of erving suggests that the tenth circuit did employ the objective standard,but modified it to account for the defendant status as a minor.see id.at given these facts,a reasonable juvenile in position would not have believed that the officers had curtailed his freedom of movement to a degree associated with formal arrest.emphasis added.alvarado seems to adopt a similar objective standard,albeit without legal citation,when he makes the following argument 
a reasonable with no prior experience with being questioned by law enforcement would most likely believe that if he is at a police station being questioned by a police officer and the officer is stating repeatedly that she knows that he is lying and he is being cajoled to tell the truth,that he is not free to get up and leave,at least not until he has satisfied the officer desire for the truth.

under the supreme court due process jurisprudence,a criminal defendant age has long been a relevant factor in determining whether a confession or a waiver of a constitutional right was voluntary.see,withrow,at.noting that a defendant maturity is one of the factors used to determine if a defendant confession was voluntary michael,at.where the age and experience of a juvenile indicate that his request for his probation officer or his parents is,in fact,an invocation of his right to remain silent,the totality approach will allow the court the necessary flexibility to take this into account in making a waiver determination.schneckloth,at.stating that determination whether consent to search a car was voluntary is made under the totality of circumstances,including the youth of the accused in re gault,at.this court has emphasized that admissions and confessions of juveniles require special caution.gallegos,at.ruling under the totality of circumstances that confession of old to charges of assault and robbery could not be compared with an adult in full possession of his senses and knowledgeable of the consequences of his admissions haley,at.ruling that murder confession made by old without consultation with counsel or parents can not be judged by the more exacting standards of maturity and that defendant due process rights had thus been violated.
another possible dimension of the present case is how parental authority over a minor,who happens to be a criminal suspect,affects the in custody determination.this aspect may be particularly difficult to analyze because custodial status may be viewed as essentially ancillary to the issue of coercion.that is,certain police actions may be coercive in part because they take place in a setting where the suspect does not reasonably feel free to leave,and thereby escape the application of coercive measures.
here,the involvement of alvarado parents and,most relevantly,their absence from the interrogation at the behest of the police,may be significant factors in the events leading up to his incriminating statements.first,comstock enlisted the parental control of alvarado parents over their minor son by approaching alvarado mother rather than going directly to him.so the delivery of alvarado to the sheriff station with its consequent restriction of his freedom of movement was effected indirectly by comstock but with the intervening aid of the parents and without any manifestation of assent by alvarado to the exercise of official authority.second,alvarado was denied the protective presence of his parents when comstock denied their request to be present during the interview.their protective presence would appear,at least on the face of things,to be more relevant to the coercive conduct of the interview than to their having any role in facilitating alvarado freedom to leave the interrogation room 
to assess how and whether parental involvement juvenile status affect the in custody determination for miranda purposes,we find in re gault instructive.this case also involved the interrogation of a juvenile,although,of course,the in custody status itself was not in dispute.at.but the reasoning of the supreme court is important 
t he constitutional privilege against is applicable in the case of juveniles as it is with respect to adults.we appreciate that special problems may arise with respect to waiver of the privilege by or on behalf of children,and that there may well be some differences in not in upon the age of the child and the presence and competence of parents.the participation of counsel will,of course,assist the police,juvenile courts and appellate tribunals in administering the privilege.if counsel was not present for some permissible reason when an admission was obtained,the greatest care must be taken to assure that the admission was voluntary,in the sense not only that it was not coerced or suggested,but also that it was not the product of ignorance of rights or of adolescent fantasy,fright or despair.
the confession of gerald gault was first obtained by officer flagg,out of the presence of gerald parents,without counsel and without advising him of his right to silence,as far as appears.
id.at.footnote omitted.
the greatest care principle cited in gault appeared in the context of determining the minimum due process requirements that attach to a juvenile waiver of his fifth amendment privilege against.yet,if a juvenile is more susceptible to police coercion during a custodial interrogation than would be a similarly situated adult,there is no reason why the same juvenile would not similarly be less capable of determining whether he was,in fact,in custody in the first place in the case now before us,alvarado was subjected to a interrogation in a police interrogation room,with comstock expressing disbelief in alvarado version of events and informing him that she had witnesses who said quite the opposite.instead of exercising the greatest care to ensure that alvarado statements were not the product of his youth and inexperience with police,id.at,comstock essentially ignored alvarado status as a minor.at a minimum,comstock could have accommodated alvarado parents,who were then waiting in the station lobby,by allowing them to be present during the interview with their son.
when applying the totality of circumstances test for an in custody determination,we believe that the state court fell short when it failed to address,much less analyze,alvarado status as a minor.based on the supreme court jurisprudence dealing with the special due process considerations that pertain to juvenile defendants,we see no principled reason why similar safeguards,commensurate with the age and circumstances of a juvenile defendant,would not apply equally to an in custody determination moreover,the issue of parental involvement,at the behest of police officials,to arrange the police interview with alvarado and the subsequent refusal by police to let his parents attend the interview are certainly relevant issues in the totality of circumstances.see thompson,at.stating that in custody determination is made against the backdrop of historical facts that make up the totality of circumstances see also note,supra considering these additional factors in the objective determination of custodial status,we do not believe that a reasonable in alvarado position would have felt at liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave.thompson,at.berkemer,at.holding that the only relevant inquiry in an in custody determination is how a reasonable man in the suspect position would have understood his situation.
we proceed now to the second level of the prescribed inquiry,which requires the narrower focus whether the state court ruling was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.in williams taylor,d,the supreme court held that the contrary to and unreasonable application clauses represent alternative grounds for habeas relief.id.at.
the supreme court has recently confirmed the narrow inquiry available under the first clause.a state court acts contrary to established precedents if it applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in supreme court cases or if it confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of the supreme court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from supreme court precedent.early packer,d citing williams,at.
under the second clause,a state court decision involves an unreasonable application of federal law if it either correctly identifies the governing legal rule but then applies it to a new set of facts in a way that is objectively unreasonable,or extends or fails to extend a clearly established legal principle to a new context in a way that is objectively unreasonable.hernandez small,cir citing van tran,at anthony,at citing williams,at.as explained,infra,we believe this case is best analyzed under the unreasonable application clause of the aedpa.
in reviewing a state court judgment under the aedpa,we examine the state court last reasoned decision.benn lambert,cir see also shackleford hubbard,cir.our analysis under the unreasonable application clause is guided by the doctrine of clear error.anthony,at.under this standard,reversal is warranted only where the court of appeals is left with a definite and firm conviction that an error has been committed.id.quoting van tran,at.
finally,a critical factor to bear in mind when analyzing a case under the unreasonable application clause is whether the relevant supreme court precedents can be fairly categorized as clearly established federal law.d.in williams,the supreme court ruled that the phrase clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,d,refers to the holdings,as opposed to the dicta,of this court decisions.at.see also tyler cain,d stating that determined and held are synonyms in the context of d.we determine de novo what is clearly established federal law within the meaning of the aedpa.lajoie thompson,cir canales roe,cir.if the federal law is not clearly established at the time of the state court determination,d bars relief.williams,at.
we begin our aedpa analysis by stating that supreme court case law has clearly established the general right that an interrogation without miranda warnings violates the fifth amendment where,under the totality of circumstances,a reasonable person would not have felt free to terminate the conversation with police officials and leave in other words,the person being interviewed is in custody.see thompson,at.stansbury,at.berkemer,at.beheler,at.mathiason,at.even acknowledging that the supreme court has not had a specific occasion to analyze how a defendant juvenile status may alter an in custody determination,it does not follow that it would be reasonable,within the meaning of the aedpa,for the police to ignore a juvenile age and experience when applying the totality of circumstances test.
turning to the aedpa framework,we believe this case is best analyzed under the unreasonable application clause,which permits a writ of habeas corpus only if the judgment of the state court fails to extend a clearly established legal principle to a new context in a way that is objectively unreasonable.anthony,at citing williams,at.the relevant legal principle here,amply supported by supreme court precedent,is that juvenile defendants are accorded heightened procedural safeguards commensurate with their age and experience.haley and its progeny,supra,have clearly established this principle in the context of custodial interrogations.if juveniles are more susceptible to making involuntary confessions or waivers of their constitutional rights while in police custody,under an analogous totality of circumstances inquiry,these same supreme court cases compel the conclusion that a reasonable juvenile would be more susceptible to the impression that he was not at liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave.thompson,at.it can not reasonably be argued that a factor that is so important in analyzing the conduct of a custodial interrogation can become insignificant in the analysis of the circumstances that give rise to that situation namely,in the factual setting that determines whether a juvenile is,in fact,in custody.
in many respects,the present case would be more straightforward if the california court of appeal had directly addressed the issue of alvarado age and inexperience with the police and concluded that these additional circumstances were simply irrelevant to the underlying question whether alvarado was in custody.if the court had made such a ruling rather than skipping the analysis altogether,the constitutional infirmity would be facially apparent.
our analysis involves the extension of the principle that juvenile status is relevant to the conduct of a custodial interrogation to the further determination whether a defendant is,in fact,in custody.but our aedpa precedents explicitly contemplate the possibility that such an extension may be required by relevant supreme court case law.see hernandez,at a state court decision can involve an unreasonable application of federal law if it extends or fails to extend a clearly established legal principle to a new context in a way that is objectively unreasonable.anthony,at same van tran,at same in the case before us,we are compelled to this conclusion by the fact that a totality of circumstances approach applies equally to the appraisal of police conduct and to the in custody analysis.at least in the context of determining whether a juvenile knowingly and voluntarily decided to forgo his fifth amendment rights to remain silent,the supreme court has unequivocally stated 
the totality approach,it into all the circumstances surrounding the interrogation.this includes evaluation of the juvenile age,experience,education,background,and intelligence,and into whether he has the capacity to understand the warnings given him,the nature of his fifth amendment rights,and the consequences of waiving those rights.
michael,at.emphasis added 
the issue of waiver of his fifth amendment rights was never reached in the present case because alvarado was never informed of his miranda rights.and,as we have already noted,the cases upon which the state relies to support its contention that alvarado was not in custody are distinguishable.in contrast to beheler and mathiason,alvarado voluntary appearance at the police station was not obtained through his own consent but instead through enlisting his mother authority.upon his arrival,alvarado was never informed that he was not under arrest,and detective comstock summarily rejected his parents request to be present during the interview.alvarado was then escorted to an interrogation room and subjected to a full two hours of questioning.despite the fact that alvarado denied any knowledge or involvement in the shooting incident,comstock repeatedly pressured alvarado to tell the truth as allegedly defined by three notebooks of notes she had compiled from earlier witness interviews.although alvarado was permitted to use the telephone,this accommodation was not offered until well into the course of the interview,and only after alvarado had made several incriminating statements only at the end of the interview did comstock inform alvarado that he was free to leave.
after identifying these relevant circumstances,it is simply unreasonable to conclude that a reasonable,with no prior history of arrest or police interviews,would have felt that he was at liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave.thompson,at.moreover,when we apply the clear error standard,which guides our analysis under the unreasonable application clause of d,the totality of circumstances in this case is so compelling that we are left with a definite and firm conviction that an error has been committed.anthony,at quoting van tran,at.
before we can conclude that alvarado is entitled to federal habeas relief,we must consider whether improper admission of his incriminating statements by the state court had a substantial and injurious effect on the subsequent jury verdict.brecht abrahamson,d defining magnitude of constitutional error that is sufficient to justify habeas relief benn,at noting that all aedpa cases must satisfy the requirements of brecht bains,at joining the vast majority of our sister circuits by deciding that the brecht standard should apply uniformly in all federal habeas corpus cases under.here,we do not hesitate to conclude that the admission of alvarado statements during the interrogation by detective comstock,which were and played in open court,had a substantial and injurious effect on the jury verdict.
the state argues that the brecht threshold has not been met because,in the absence of testimony by detective comstock about the contents of her interview with alvarado,the jury would have nonetheless reached a guilty verdict based on the testimony of manuel rivera.we disagree.in order to illustrate the relative weakness of rivera testimony,we will summarize certain pertinent background facts.
according to rivera direct testimony at trial,rivera,alvarado,paul soto alvarado and several other youths gathered at rivera house on the night of september.rivera testified that throughout the course of the evening he consumed about two of budweiser along with strawberry wine,and some more beer.after midnight,the gathering left the house and moved into a parking lot area beside an adjacent shopping center.the victim drove his truck into the parking lot and stationed himself near a dumpster,where he proceeded to collect cardboard boxes.according to rivera,paul soto uttered the exclamation,let jack,which rivera interpreted as meaning that soto and at least some other members of the gathering should steal the truck.however,at that very moment,alvarado was in a nea
