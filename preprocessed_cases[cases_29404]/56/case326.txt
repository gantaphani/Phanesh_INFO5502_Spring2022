facts and procedural history 
according to the detention hearing report,an eighth grade student,was walking home from school on april,with some friends.was playing with a can of silly string,when minor,going in the opposite direction,came riding by on his skateboard.accidentally sprayed some of the silly string on minor.minor hopped off his skateboard,approached,and demanded that he give him the can of silly string.apologized to minor,and handed him the can of silly string,saying,here,you can have it.minor threw the can onto the ground and demanded that give him his cell phone.said no,but minor repeated his demand for the cell phone.again refused.minor then punched in the face several times,knocking him to the ground.minor kicked in the back before running away.and his mother reported the matter to the school resource officer at minor high school.when the school resource officer questioned minor about the incident,minor admitted he had punched the victim,saying,oh yea h,that kid pissed me off.
a month later,on may,minor took the cell phone of a classmate,from his desk at school.asked minor to give his phone back,but minor laughed at him and refused.minor ran off campus and did not return to school for the next two days.made a report to the police about the stolen phone.
on august,the people filed a petition in juvenile court,charging minor with attempted robbery of,assault on,receiving stolen property cell phone,and theft of the cell phone mistakenly alleged to be the property of.about a week after the petition was filed,minor went to residence to confront him about reporting the stolen phone.minor said,if i end up going to juvenile hall because you are pressing charges,i going to fuck you up denied pressing charges,but minor retorted,you are lying,i know it you,i just want to get one good hit in minor clubbed on the side of the head with a closed fist.minor left when mother threatened to call police.when minor was later taken into custody,he admitted finding out where lived so he could confront him about ruining my life by pressing charges.minor stated that he hit because he wanted him to admit that he was the one pressing charges against him.
after the confrontation with,the people filed another petition on august,alleging that minor had committed the offenses of attempting to dissuade a witness,assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury,and two counts of making criminal threats against both and mother.
in september,the parties appeared in court,and reached a settlement.when defense counsel described the agreement to the juvenile court,he stated,there is a disposition reached in this matter wherein minor will enter admissions in one petition to the attempted robbery in the other petition he is going to be admitting one of the criminal threats allegations.remaining counts in both petitions will be dismissed with comment and restitution.he will be determined a ward and placed at yop and refer it out for dispositional report.the court stated that it found that disposition to be a reasonable one.i suppose after reading the report i might take another view,but at this point anyway it seems to be a reasonable approach 
in taking the admissions from minor,the court admonished him,do you realize if you tell me these allegations from these two paragraphs sic are true,then a judge could put you in a state or county facility including a locked facility like juvenile hall or the youthful offender program facility in indio for up to three years,six months.do you understand that minor replied that he did understand.the court fixed the criminal threats charge as a felony rather than a misdemeanor.the attempt ed robbery is,of course,a felony.in terms of disposition the parties have agreed that the minor is going to be declared a ward and be committed to a placement in the youth offender program in indio.the court referred the matter to the probation department for a report to recommend complete,appropriate dispositional terms for minor.the court set a hearing to review the report,and advised the parties,if upon reviewing the report i find something inappropriate about the disposition,the minor because of the agreed upon terms of his admissions today could withdraw his admission,but i do expect that to happen.otherwise he is going to live with whatever disposition i give him.
the probation department prepared a dispositional report in advance of the hearing.the interagency placement screening committee that reviewed minor case concluded that placement was necessary.minor needed services to address anger issues,substance abuse issues,negative peer associations gang contacts,grief counseling,and academic deficits.minor mother was too complacent about minor behavior to supervise him adequately under one of the programs considered.
several features of minor case were concerning.he brutally attacked a younger child over a petty matter accidentally being sprayed with silly string.when a petition was filed,describing the theft of a classmate cell phone,minor purposely sought out the victim address,went to his home,threatened the victim and his mother,and physically struck the victim in retaliation for reporting the crime.minor general anger issues had led to several fights,which resulted in disciplinary actions at school.minor was not remorseful,and refused to apologize to the victims.he had other difficulties,including substance abuse,poor school attendance,and poor grades.he denied membership in a gang,but he was affiliated with a number of gang members.his older brother had been a gang member and had died when minor was years old.
minor mother was the one stable element in minor life,but she appeared unaware of or in denial about minor poor academic progress,his use of drugs and alcohol,his frequent fights,and his disciplinary issues at school.she had also failed to get any help for minor with respect to his grief over his brother death and the abandonment of the family by minor father.the mother was unable to maintain control of minor behavior.
because of minor anger issues and impulsive and volatile actions,he was at severe risk of harming others.until he receives appropriate treatment,it is only a matter of time until he strikes out again and injures someone else.the probation department therefore recommended an placement.specifically,the probation department recommended that minor be placed in a suitable home,relative home,county or private facility with no preference for such period as deemed necessary by officer,further,that the minor not be placed at yop indio without further order of the court,
the treatment plan for minor indicated that the type of placement appropriate for minor would take into consideration,the minor need for the least restrictive,most environment the minor age,sex,and cultural background the planned contacts during the separation and the specific actions to be taken b y the which will facilitate reunification the appropriateness of attempting to maintain the special needs of the minor,including transportation,diet,clothing,recreation,and education,and the capability of t he care provider to meet the needs of the minor.the placement selection will be a safe setting that is the closest proximity to the home,consistent with the minor needs and best interests.any placement would have to be able to dispense medications,treat substance abuse,provide family counseling and individual and group therapy,contain an school,isolate the minor from the community,provide a structured setting,instruct in independent living skills,and provide anger and grief counseling.
at the dispositional hearing,the court made findings in accordance with the probation report and case plan.the court declared minor a ward of the juvenile court and placed him in the custody of the probation officer.the court agreed that the minor needs to be placed,but noted that the report does recommend the youthful offender program in indio.it just recommends some unspecified placement.minor counsel related to the court that,the parties stipulated as part of the agreement that it would be yop indio it is unfortunate he does get referred out,because my information he has also been screened and accepted by twin pines ranch.which was not part of the deal,but now has the minor encouraged he is going to twin pines ranch and going tomorrow rather than sitting on a waiting list to go to yop.
the court opined that the parties might not be able to determine the disposition,because it is the unique role of a judge to rehabilitate a minor to make sure he has appropriate orders for rehabilitation.the prosecutor objected that the people had dropped a number of outstanding charges,including at least one strike offense,on the understanding that the defense agreed minor would be placed at yop.and i would ask the court to follow the district attorney and defense agreed upon negotiation.
the court probation officer interjected that the screening committee was reluctant to send the minor to yop right out of the gate,because that is our most restrictive placement.and with probation we attempt to use escalating consequences.in this matter the minor was screened for twin pines ranch and accepted.there is a mental health component there.there is gang component.there is drug component.it is felt that he should get an opportunity to work on some of these problems at the ranch rather than at yop.the probation department preferred to reserve yop as a consideration for escalated placement,if minor failed to benefit from placement at twin pines ranch.the court thereupon ordered that minor be placed in a suitable home,relative home,county or private facility with preference for twin pines ranch further,that the minor not be placed at yop indio without further order of the court,
the prosecutor asked the case to be recalled later the same day.the prosecutor argued that,because the court is not going to follow through with the negotiated disposition between the parties i would ask the plea essentially be withdrawn,the petition be reinstituted,and we would proceed on the petition.the prosecutor indicated that a number of serious charges had been dismissed,specifically in contemplation of minor agreement that he would be placed at yop.the matter was referred to the probation department because we ca place the minor without any social history.and that was the reason for it.certainly the people would not have dismissed those charges unless the yop was honored.that is my request at this point.i asking to proceed on the petition in whole.
defense counsel explained that one of the dismissed charges was a strike,and we were interested in getting rid of the strike as part of the disposition.that is the reason we agreed to the disposition.
the court took the view that,even if the parties agreed to some disposition to accomplish their own purposes,the court was charged with a different and overriding duty.the court did not believe that it was bound by the parties goals especially in juvenile court the duty of the court is to make appropriate rehabilitative orders with respect to the minor.in this case there is no basis in front of me to commit the minor to yop.secondly,i already made my orders.those are final orders.they were final two hours ago,or three hours ago.so i do think there is a basis for unwinding them at this point.the court noted,thirdly,that it had never agreed to sentence the minor to dispose of the minor case by sending him to yop.i could never do that,because i never had information providing a basis to make that kind of commitment.fourthly,if the parties wanted to know what recommendations probation might make,they might have requested some kind of report.that did happen in this case.minor had already made his admissions at the prosecutor request,and the court had already dismissed other counts in the interest of minor,well before the current dispositional hearing.the court therefore denied the people request to withdraw the plea agreement and reinstate the petitions.
the people have now appealed.
contentions 
the people contend that the juvenile court dispositional order was unlawful,because it contravened the terms of a negotiated disposition.minor responds that the matter is not cognizable on appeal,because the prosecution is prohibited from appealing an order granting probation to a minor.minor urges that the people remedy is to seek review by a writ of mandate or prohibition.welf,subd.c see also in re jeffrey th,d jeffrey.the people reply,also relying on jeffrey,that the appeal is not an appeal from the grant of probation,but rather an appeal from an illegal order the order denying the people request to withdraw the plea bargain and reinstate the charges,because the trial court unlawfully refused to honor the terms of the plea bargain.
ii.standard of review 
the initial point in the appeal is whether or not welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b,authorizes the appeal and,at the same time,whether welfare and institutions code section,subdivision c,nevertheless prohibits proceeding by way of an appeal in this case.in other words,is the appeal from an unlawful order welf,subd.b,or is it an appeal that either directly,or in substance,challenges an order granting probation welf,subd.c this is an issue of statutory construction,which we review de novo.people wills th,d.
the next issue to be considered,if the procedural hurdle can be passed,is whether the people may enforce the terms of the plea bargain,commitment of minor to yop or alternatively,to rescind the plea bargain and reinstate the charges.a plea bargain agreement is in the nature of a contract,and subject to the same rules of construction as other contracts.people kim th,d plea bargains are generally governed by a specialized form of the law of contracts.
the appellate court applies the standards of review applicable to contracts generally.people toscano th,d.t he interpretation of a contract is subject to de novo review where the interpretation does not turn on the credibility of extrinsic evidence.citations.people ex rel.lockyer reynolds tobacco th,d.
iii.the appeal is cognizable 
in jeffrey,supra,th,d,the parties to a juvenile delinquency proceeding announced ready on the last day to begin trial.no courtrooms were available on that day.faced with the prospect of dismissing the petition,the juvenile court instead dismissed a robbery charge in one petition,added a new grand theft charge,and took the juvenile admissions of the allegations,including the amended grand theft allegation.the prosecutor objected to this procedure as illegal judicial plea bargaining.the juvenile court overruled the prosecutor objection,and proceeded with the disposition,placing the juvenile on probation.the prosecutor appealed,asserting that the juvenile court lacked authority to enter into a judicial plea bargain with the juvenile.it sought to vacate the plea,and sought reversal of the orders dismissing the robbery allegation and adding the grand theft allegation.id.at,d.the prosecutor justified the appeal under welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b,which authorizes a people appeal from an order dismissing all or part of a case,before a minor has been placed in jeopardy.
the juvenile argued in opposition,however,that welfare and institutions code section,subdivision c,expressly prohibits an appeal from an order granting probation.because the dismissal of the robbery charge the authorization for a people appeal under welf,subd.b and resultant plea was the underlying basis for the juvenile court grant of probation,the juvenile argued that the appeal was
