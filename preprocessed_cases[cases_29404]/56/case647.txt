los angeles police officer brian coleman was assigned to a gang enforcement unit.on may,he and his partner were patrolling near street and budlong avenue.this was an area claimed by the five deuce hoovers,a gang also known as the hoovers.the officers saw carleisha standing on the sidewalk,wearing an orange shirt underneath a white.the hoovers identify with the color orange.a few days earlier,coleman had learned carleisha was on probation and had an outstanding warrant.coleman and his partner arrested carleisha on the warrant.she told them she was a rolling neighborhood crip member with a moniker of blue.asked if carleisha had mentioned any other association with gangs,coleman testified,she stated that she had family that associated with the five deuce hoovers and that she lives in that area.
coleman contacted carleisha probation officer,who verified she had a gang search condition attached to her probation.the police officers then went to carleisha house,which was just down the block.there,carleisha mother directed the officers to the bedroom carleisha shared with two sisters.on the top shelf of the bedroom closet,officers found a caliber rifle.next to it was a rifle magazine containing caliber bullets.also on the closet shelf was a small baggie containing two caliber bullets and one caliber bullet.inside the same closet,police found several items of orange clothing,as well as a pair of orange and blue tennis shoes.
on a door leading from this bedroom into a bathroom,police found a laminated miller genuine draft wall poster,on the back of which there was gang graffiti.the graffiti contained a positive reference to the hoovers and negative references to various other gangs.coleman testified the negative references included the number crossed out with a k at the end and,crossed out,crossed out and i believe crossed out.q and what does that signify a through my training and experience and seeing numerous sic gang graffiti,it represents killer,neighborhood crip killer,neighborhood crip killer and rolling sixties neighborhood crip killer.coleman explained the significance of the it a derogatory writing meaning that they do approve of that gang or their rival gang and these gangs are rival gangs in the area neighboring the five deuce hoovers.
coleman testified the hoovers are a type of crip gang,but that neighborhood crips and hoovers generally do not get along he had seen situations in which people who have lived in two different areas have associated with one gang and moved to a new area controlled by another gang,and they started associating with the new gang in the new neighborhood that they live in.and also if they have family members that are from a different gang,they might be rivals,but as family members,they still associate with one another.
detective andrew paredes testified he had been working the gang detail for the last five years.specifically,he had been assigned to work on the hoover sets,one of which was the hoovers.he described the usual gang participants as including an,who is a person that in charge that puts in his work that been in the gang for a while,meaning years,usually older soldiers,who put in the work for the gang,meaning dealing the drugs,carrying the weapons and associates who,while not actual members of the gang,hang out with the gang and assist the other gang members by hiding stuff and by committing crimes.asked,now,this particular gang,hoover,what types of crimes do you know them to commit,paredes testified they commit a lot of crimes.they commit crimes for sic murder,shootings,robberies,kidnappings,shoot sic robberies,bank robberies,weapons violations.
the prosecutor then asked paredes a hypothetical question 
q now,let me pose a series of facts to you,and i like to get your opinion regarding those facts.if there an associate of the hoovers,a person who admits to be an associate of the hoover gang and they keep an assault rifle in their closet in their bedroom,would you have an opinion as to what that person is having that rifle in their closet for 
q and what would your opinion be 
a my opinion,where an individual is an associate,basically they putting in work for the gang.they trying to become gang members so in this way,they put work in.the other gang members will use this individual by giving them the guns to store the guns,to hide the guns,hide narcotics.so they have these weapons for their enterprise,their protection.
q let me put one additional fact in there.specifically if the associate is a female,would that add to the equation 
a basically,these gang members out there use these females if it is for using them for sex,they using them to hide narcotics,to hide weapons.so a lot of times,when we stop them out there,the females will have narcotics on them or they have guns.there certain places that we ca search them and then there might not be a female out there to assist us to search them.
q and would it be your opinion that the person who had the assault rifle in their bedroom let say you take also the fact that besides this person admitting they an associate,that they also have me show you this poster,people,that poster represents type of gang involvement 
a yes,it is.
q can you tell us what would your opinion be regarding that poster 
a in my opinion if this individual had this,this person is definitely a gang member,because basically what it is,it telling me you got the hoover sign with the index middle finger showing the you got the rival gang being crossed out,killer,five killer,five eight killer,killer,you got their enemies they got crossed out.
q now,if that was also found in the room,along with the admission and this weapon,would you have an opinion as to what this weapon was possessed for 
a in my opinion,weapon s being possessed for the gang,individual storing the gun or the rifle in their closet in furtherance of the gang to sell their narcotics,to have protection for rival gang members or if they going to go do a shooting at a rival gang.
paredes testified he had experience dealing with both the hoovers and the rolling neighborhood crips,and that the two gangs are supposed to be enemies.asked,i f someone was a neighborhood crip and they move into hoover territory,if those individuals had family members who are also hoover,is it uncommon for them to associate with hoover since they live in their territory and have family members that are also from that set,paredes testified that a common thing,yes.
the prosecution put into evidence two minute orders showing prior convictions sustained by two persons,carl lynks and troy washington.lynks had been convicted of assault with a deadly weapon in may washington had been convicted of voluntary manslaughter in march.paredes testified he was familiar with these men and that they were both five deuce hoover gang members.
