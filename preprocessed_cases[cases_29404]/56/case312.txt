luke,age,appeals from an order of the sacramento county juvenile court denying his petition for an order compelling his mother,deborah,to make his nondependent sister,angel,available for weekly visitation luke contends the juvenile court erred when it relied on in re th to deny his petition,the court had authority to enter a visitation order against mother with respect to a nondependent sibling,the denial of his petition seeking sibling visitation violated his constitutional right to due process,and the court denied him a meaningful hearing.we conclude the juvenile court did not have jurisdiction to grant luke modification petition for visitation with a nondependent sibling.we find the case to be controlling on this issue.luke attempts to distinguish are not persuasive.the fact that the juvenile court had jurisdiction over mother does not mean the court had jurisdiction to compel visitation with a sibling who is not subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.further,in this case,luke did not have a constitutional right to visitation with his nondependent sibling.finally,luke has forfeited his argument that there was no evidentiary hearing.in any event,this argument fails because the juvenile court had no jurisdiction to order visitation with a nondependent sibling regardless of any evidence that would have been presented.accordingly,we affirm the juvenile court order.
factual and procedural background 
originating circumstances 
in april,the sacramento county department of health and human services the department received a referral from a mandated reporter expressing concerns about luke mental health related to ongoing abuse and exploitation by mother.
section petition 
in april,a petition was filed alleging luke came within section,subdivision c,in that he was suffering serious emotional damage as a result of mother conduct.the petition alleged mother degrades and belittles luke,deprives him of sleep as a form of punishment,yells at him for hours past his bedtime,threatens to luke if he does not listen to her,and engages in other excessively controlling,humiliating,and exploitive behavior.the petition alleged that,as a result,luke suffered physical symptoms including irritable bowel syndrome ibs,rashes,shingles,and blood in his stool.
a separate,petition was filed on behalf of angel,a developmentally delayed girl who had been adopted by mother.
at a detention hearing in may,the juvenile court found a prima facie showing had been made that luke comes within section.luke was ordered detained with the family of his best friend.
contested jurisdiction 
at a contested jurisdiction hearing in june,the juvenile court sustained the section,subdivision c,allegations.the court found luke may suffer serious emotional damage as a result of anxiety and depression.
by stipulation of the parties,the juvenile court dismissed the section petition as to angel.
contested disposition 
at the conclusion of a contested disposition hearing,the juvenile court found by clear and convincing evidence that there was a substantial risk luke physical health and emotional would suffer if returned to mother.the court adjudged luke a dependent and removed him from mother.
luke section modification petition 
mother refused to allow visitation between luke and angel.she explained to a social worker that,due to luke past history of involvement with child pornography,she was not comfortable letting luke visit with angel.in addition,allowing the visitation would expose mother to further allegations and emotionally destabilize angel who was working to adjust to new family dynamics.
in february,luke filed a section modification petition modification petition seeking to compel mother to make angel available for weekly visits with him.
the juvenile court ordered that a hearing take place in march,because the best interest of the child may be promoted by the request.
in march,mother filed opposition to luke modification petition seeking sibling visitation,citing her constitutional right to parent her nondependent child,angel.
in march,the juvenile court issued a tentative decision denying luke modification petition.in its ruling,the court stated,t he decision is controlled by the case of,supra,th.
at a hearing in april,the juvenile court adopted the tentative decision as its final decision.the court first held former section,subdivision b,does not apply to this case the court next held the policy of fostering of sibling relationships is to protect groups of siblings who all come under the jurisdiction of the juvenile dependency court and to emphasize the importance of the role of the court and the social services system once children become our children,to recognize the importance of keeping those children together.expressly relying on,supra,th,the court held it would be acting in excess of its jurisdiction if it ordered visitation between luke and his nondependent sibling,angel.
discussion 
luke contends the juvenile court erred when it denied his modification petition seeking visitation with angel,his nondependent sibling.specifically,luke contends the juvenile court erred when it relied on to deny his petition,the court had authority to enter a visitation order against mother with respect to a nondependent sibling,the denial of his modification petition seeking sibling visitation violated his constitutional right to due process,and the court denied him a meaningful hearing.
the juvenile court reliance on 
luke contends the juvenile court reliance on,supra,th was misplaced.this contention has no merit.in fact,is controlling in the resolution of the modification petition.
in,the appellate court reversed the portion of a dispositional order entitling,a year old dependent child,to supervised visitation with her half brother,whose dependency petition had been dismissed.the court described the limited jurisdiction of the juvenile court to make only those determinations authorized by specific statutory authority,supra,th at.the court explained the filing of dependency petition vested the juvenile court with subject matter jurisdiction,the inherent authority to deal with the case or the matter before it.citation.when the court dismissed petition following the jurisdictional hearing,was no longer in need of the juvenile court protection and its jurisdiction over him terminated.citation.ibid.
the court explained,there is no statutory provision requiring sibling visitation in these circumstances,supra,th at.the court first considered section,which provides where the court has ordered removal of the child from the physical custody of his or her parents pursuant to section,the court shall consider whether there are any siblings under the court jurisdiction,the nature of the relationship between the child and his or her siblings,the appropriateness of developing or maintaining the sibling relationships pursuant to section,and the impact of the sibling relationships on the child placement and planning for legal permanence.ibid.reasoned that,b ecause was not under the court jurisdiction at the time of dispositional hearing,this section is inapplicable.ibid.
the court next considered section,subdivision b,which permits a person who desires a sibling relationship with a child,who is either a dependent of the juvenile court or the subject of a dependency petition,to petition the court to assert that relationship and seek,inter alia,visitation with the dependent child,supra,th at italics added.reasoned this statute expressly requires the filing of a verified petition on behalf of a person seeking sibling visitation with a dependent of the juvenile court.since no such petition was filed here,that section is inapplicable.ibid.
we reach the same conclusion here.by stipulation of the parties,the juvenile court had dismissed the section petition as to angel.at that point,angel was no longer in need of the court protection and its jurisdiction over her terminated.luke filed his modification petition following the dismissal in angel case and the disposition hearing in this case.at that point,the court had jurisdiction over luke,not angel.because angel no longer was under the court jurisdiction
