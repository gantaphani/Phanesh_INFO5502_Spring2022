graham florida,held that the eighth amendment forbids the sentence of life without parole for juvenile offenders convicted of nonhomicide offenses.accordingly,the supreme court held that states must provide juvenile nonhomicide offenders sentenced to life imprisonment with some meaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.id.at.
nearly a decade before the supreme court decided graham,respondent,the commonwealth of virginia,sentenced petitioner dennis leblanc to life imprisonment without parole for a nonhomicide offense he committed at the age of sixteen.in light of graham,petitioner sought postconviction relief from his sentence in virginia state courts.the state courts denied petitioner relief,holding that virginia geriatric release program which was adopted more than fifteen years before the supreme court decided graham and will allow petitioner to seek release beginning at the age of sixty provides the meaningful opportunity for release that graham requires.
mindful of the deference we must accord to state court decisions denying state prisoners postconviction relief,we nonetheless conclude that petitioner state court adjudication constituted an unreasonable application of graham.most significantly,virginia courts unreasonably ignored the plain language of the procedures governing review of petitions for geriatric release,which authorize the state parole board to deny geriatric release for any reason,without considering a juvenile offender maturity and rehabilitation.in light of the lack of governing standards,it was objectively unreasonable for the state courts to conclude that geriatric release affords petitioner with the meaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation graham demands.id.accordingly,petitioner is entitled to relief from his unconstitutional sentence.

in,petitioner filed a motion to vacate his sentence in state trial court.the motion argued that graham rendered petitioner life sentence invalid.in opposition,respondents asserted that,notwithstanding virginia abolition of parole,petitioner life sentence did not violate graham because virginia allows for conditional release of geriatric prisoners.code ann.geriatric release.
at a hearing on august,the state trial court orally denied petitioner motion to vacate.in rendering its decision,the trial court relied on the supreme court of virginia decision in angel commonwealth,which held that geriatric release provides juveniles sentenced to life in prison a meaningful opportunity for release and therefore complies with graham parole requirement.petitioner appealed the trial court decision to the supreme court of virginia,which summarily denied his petition for appeal.
on june,petitioner filed a petition for habeas corpus pursuant to in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia.a federal magistrate judge reviewed the petition and recommended that the district court deny it.leblanc mathena,wl,at.july.petitioner filed objections to the magistrate judge report.finding the objections,the district court granted petitioner habeas petition,holding that his state court adjudication was contrary to,and an unreasonable application of,graham.leblanc mathena,wl,at.july.in particular,the district court concluded that geriatric release does not offer juvenile offenders sentenced to life imprisonment,like petitioner,the meaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation required by graham.id.at.the district court further concluded that geriatric release did not comply with graham dictate that state penal systems reflect the lesser culpability of juvenile offenders,explaining that geriatric release treats children worse than adult offenders.id.at emphasis in original.accordingly,the district court remanded petitioner case to the state court for resentencing in accordance with graham.id.at.
respondents filed a timely appeal,and the district court stayed its judgment pending resolution of that appeal.
the virginia general assembly established geriatric release in more than years before the supreme court decided graham as part of its reform package.the primary goal of reform was to close the gap between prisoners original sentences and the amount of time they actually served.brian ostrom et,in virginia april,available at.the centerpiece of the reform package was the elimination of parole for all offenders who committed felonies on or after january.id.
the statutory provision governing geriatric release,as amended provides,in its entirety 
any person serving a sentence imposed upon a conviction for a felony offense,other than a class felony,i who has reached the age of or older and who has served at least five years of the sentence imposed or ii who has reached the age of sixty or older and who has served at least ten years of the sentence imposed may petition the parole board for conditional release.the parole board shall promulgate regulations to implement the provisions of this section.
code ann.unlike with other components of the reform package we have identified no evidence in the contemporaneous legislative record speaking to the general assembly goal in enacting geriatric release or providing guidance regarding the implementation of geriatric release.
the virginia parole board is responsible for deciding whether to grant petitions for geriatric release.section directs the parole board to promulgate regulations necessary to implement the statute.pursuant to that authority,the parole board established administrative procedures governing implementation of the geriatric release provision the geriatric release administrative procedures.
the geriatric release administrative procedures set forth a review process for geriatric release petitions.at the initial review stage,the parole board reviews a prisoner petition which must provide compelling reasons for conditional release and the prisoner central file and any other pertinent information.the parole board may deny the petition at the initial review stage based on a majority vote.neither the statute nor the geriatric release administrative procedures states what constitute compelling reasons for conditional release,nor does either document require the parole board to consider any particular factors in conducting the initial review,nor does either document set forth any criteria for granting or denying a prisoner petition at the initial review stage.
if the parole board does not deny a petition at the initial review stage,the petition moves forward to the assessment review stage.as part of the assessment review,a parole board member or designated staff member interviews the prisoner.during that interview,the prisoner may present written and oral statements as well as any written material bearing on his case for parole.the interviewer then drafts a written assessment of the prisoner suitability for conditional release and,based on that assessment,recommends whether the parole board should grant the petition.in order to grant geriatric release to a prisoner sentenced to life imprisonment,at least four members of the parole board must vote in favor of release.
in engaging in the assessment review,parole board members should consider a ll factors in the parole consideration process including board appointments and victim input.id.the virginia parole board policy manual includes a long list of decision factors to be considered in the parole review process.these factors include public safety,the facts and circumstances of the offense,the length and type of sentence,and the proposed release plan.the parole board also should consider certain characteristics of the offender,including the individual history,physical and mental condition and character,conduct,employment,education,vocational training,and other developmental activities during incarceration,prior criminal record,behavior while incarcerated,and changes in motivation and behavior.finally,the parole board should consider impressions gained from interviewing the prisoner as well as information from family members,victims,and other individuals.
there are several key ways in which geriatric release differs from virginia parole system,which remains in place for prisoners who committed their offenses before january.the first and most obvious is the age limitation.in order to seek geriatric release,an inmate must be at least sixty years of age.by contrast,most inmates serving a life sentence will be considered for parole for the first time after serving fifteen years of their sentence.code ann.c.other prisoners will be considered for parole when they serve a certain percentage of their sentence.id.a.accordingly,whereas petitioner would have been considered for parole after serving twenty years of his sentence,petitioner can not apply for geriatric release until roughly twenty years later.
the second difference is that an inmate must actively petition for geriatric release once he or she becomes eligible,whereas the parole board automatically considers,on an annual basis,whether to release each inmate.
a third difference is that,unlike with parole,the parole board may deny a petition for geriatric release at the initial review stage without considering any of the decision factors enumerated in the parole board policy manual.indeed,unlike the parole system,which has established criteria that the parole board must consider in granting or denying parole,geriatric release affords the parole board unconstrained discretion to deny a petition for geriatric release at the initial review stage.relatedly,in their petition,prisoners must identify compelling reasons why they should receive geriatric release,notwithstanding that the compelling reasons requirement has no statutory basis and that the geriatric release administrative procedures do not provide any guidance regarding what constitutes a compelling reason.by contrast,there is no requirement that a inmate demonstrate compelling reasons in order to obtain parole.
fourth,the parole board or its designee interviews prisoners undergoing parole review as a matter of course.by contrast,the parole board can deny a petition for geriatric release at the initial review stage on a review of the record,without interviewing the inmate.
a final notable difference is that four members of the parole board must approve geriatric release of inmates sentenced to life imprisonment.by contrast,only three members of the parole board must approve parole of prisoners.

the eighth amendment,made applicable to the states through the fourteenth amendment,prohibits the infliction of cruel and unusual punishments.const.amend.viii roper simmons.to determine whether a punishment is cruel and unusual,courts must look beyond historical conceptions to the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.graham,at quoting estelle gamble.the eighth amendment prohibits not only barbaric punishments,but also sentences that are disproportionate to the crime committed.solem helm.
graham rests on a long line of supreme court decisions addressing the constraints imposed by the eighth amendment on the punishment of juvenile offenders.in thompson oklahoma,the supreme court held that the eighth amendment prohibits the death penalty for offenders who committed their crimes before the age of sixteen.the court grounded its decision on the principle that punishment should be directly related to the personal culpability of the criminal defendant.id.at quoting california brown.a dolescents as a class are less mature and responsible than adults,the court explained.id.inexperience,less education,and less intelligence make the teenager less able to evaluate the consequences of his or her conduct while at the same time he or she is much more apt to be motivated by mere emotion or peer pressure than is an adult.id.at.accordingly,a juvenile transgression is not as morally reprehensible as that of an adult.id.because juvenile offenders are not as personally culpable as adult offenders,juvenile offenders should not receive punishments as severe as those inflicted on adult offenders,the court held.id.at.
in roper simmons,the supreme court again emphasized the unique characteristics of youth when it extended thompson bar on the death penalty to all individuals who committed their offenses before the age of eighteen.at.like thompson,the roper court highlighted juveniles lack of maturity and underdeveloped sense of responsibility and propensity for reckless behavior.id.at citations omitted.roper further noted that the character of a juvenile is not as well formed as that of an adult and juveniles personality traits are more transitory,less fixed.id.at.as a result,it is less supportable to conclude that even a heinous crime committed by a juvenile is evidence of irretrievably depraved character.id.indeed,t he relevance of youth as a mitigating factor derives from the fact that the signature qualities of youth are transient as individuals mature,the impetuousness and recklessness that may dominate in younger years can subside.id.quoting johnson texas.
against this backdrop,graham held that for a juvenile offender who did not commit homicide the eighth amendment forbids the sentence of life without parole.at.the court explained that t his clear line is necessary to prevent the possibility that life without parole sentences will be imposed on juvenile nonhomicide offenders who are not sufficiently culpable to merit that punishment.id.emphasis added.in reaching this conclusion,the court again highlighted the lessened culpability of juveniles,noting that developments in psychology and brain science continue to show fundamental differences between juvenile and adult minds.for example,parts of the brain involved in behavior control continue to mature through late adolescence.id.at.moreover,j uveniles are more capable of change than are adults,and their actions are less likely to be evidence of an irretrievably depraved character than are the actions of adults.id.quoting roper,at.
graham explained that life without parole is the second most severe penalty permitted by law,behind only the death penalty,because it deprives the convict of the most basic liberties without giving hope of restoration,except perhaps by executive clemency the remote possibility of which does not mitigate the harshness of the sentence.id.at citations omitted.if a juvenile is sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole,he or she has no chance for fulfillment outside prison walls,no chance for reconciliation with society,no hope.id.at.
additionally,b y denying the defendant the right to reenter the community,the state makes an irrevocable judgment about that person value and place in society.this judgment is not appropriate in light of a juvenile nonhomicide offender capacity for change and limited moral culpability.id.at.accordingly,the sentence of life without parole for a juvenile nonhomicide offender will always be disproportionate under the eighth amendment because it always relies on a judgment made at the outset that the defendant is incorrigible.id.at.and while some juvenile offenders may ultimately prove to pose a risk to society for the rest of their lives,a life without parole sentence improperly denies the juvenile offender a chance to demonstrate growth and maturity later in life.id.at emphasis added.
although graham left it to the state s,in the first instance,to explore the means and mechanisms to comply with its dictates,id.at,the decision established at least three minimum requirements for parole or early release programs for juvenile nonhomicide offenders sentenced to life imprisonment,like petitioner 
first,graham held that such offenders must have the opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.id.at emphasis added.put differently,the juvenile offender must have a chance to later demonstrate that he is fit to rejoin society and that the bad acts he committed as a teenager are not representative of his true character.id.at.to that end,a parole or early release system does not comply with graham if the system allows for the lifetime incarceration of a juvenile nonhomicide offender based solely on the heinousness or depravity of the offender crime.id.at the eighth amendment prohibit s states from making the judgment at the outset that juvenile nonhomicide offenders never will be fit to reenter society.id.at stating that the eighth amendment prohibits courts from sentencing a juvenile nonhomicide offender to life without parole based on a subjective judgment that the defendant crimes demonstrate an irretrievably depraved character quoting roper,at.
second,graham held that the opportunity to obtain release must be meaningful,which means that the opportunity must be realistic and more than a remote possibility.id.at.graham meaningful ness requirement reflects the supreme court characterization of p arole a s a regular part of the rehabilitative process.assuming good behavior,it is the normal expectation in the vast majority of cases.solem,at.because parole is the normal expectation,it should be possible to predict,at least to some extent,when parole might be granted.id.holding that,for purposes of the eighth amendment,executive clemency is not a substitute for parole because clemency is an ad hoc process that provides inmates with nothing more than a bare possibility of release.to that end,graham held that the availability of executive clemency did not satisfy the meaningful opportunity to obtain release requirement.at.
third,graham held that a state parole or early release program must account for the lesser culpability of juvenile offenders an offender age is relevant to the eighth amendment,and criminal procedure laws that fail to take defendants youthfulness into account at all would be flawed.id.at see also miller alabama,explaining that graham foundational principle is that imposition of a state most severe penalties on juvenile offenders can not proceed as though they were not children accordingly,a state parole or early release system that subjects juvenile offenders to more severe punishments than their adult counterparts necessarily violates graham.
with these three principles in mind that juvenile nonhomicide offenders sentenced to life imprisonment must have the opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation,that this opportunity must be meaningful,and that the early release or parole system must take into account the lesser culpability of juvenile offenders we must determine whether the conclusion of the trial court and angel that geriatric release complies with graham parole requirement was contrary to,or an unreasonable application of graham 
a state court adjudication is contrary to clearly established law if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the supreme court on a question of law or if the state court confronts facts that are materially indistinguishable from a relevant supreme court precedent and arrives at the opposite result.williams taylor,barbe mcbride,cir.
here,angel,upon which the state trial court entirely relied,correctly identified graham as controlling and recognized each of the three minimum requirements set forth above for a parole or early release program for juvenile nonhomicide offenders sentenced to life imprisonment.in particular,angel repeatedly stated that graham requires that juvenile offenders be afforded an opportunity for release based on maturity and rehabilitation.at.likewise,the angel court acknowledged that the opportunity for release must be meaningful.id and angel recognized that graham demands that state penal systems account for the limited moral culpability of juvenile offenders.id.at.accordingly,petitioner state court adjudication was not contrary to graham.bell cone,holding that state court adjudication that correctly identified the principles announced by the supreme court as those governing the analysis was not contrary to clearly established law.
petitioner,therefore,may obtain relief only if his state court adjudication amounted to an unreasonable application of graham.a state court decision amounts to an unreasonable application of clearly established supreme court precedent if it identifies the correct governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.grueninger,at quoting wiggins,at.to satisfy this standard,the state court adjudication must be more than incorrect or erroneous it must be objectively unreasonable.lockyer andrade.that being said,to reach a decision that constitutes an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent,a state court need not address an identical factual or legal scenario to that previously addressed by the supreme court even a general standard may be applied in an unreasonable manner.panetti quarterman.
for several reasons,we agree with petitioner that his state court adjudication constituted an unreasonable application of graham.
first,geriatric release does not necessarily provide petitioner or any other inmate,juvenile or otherwise the opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation,as graham requires.in concluding that geriatric release satisfied this requirement,angel emphasized that if the prisoner meets the qualifications for consideration contained in the statute,the factors used in the normal parole consideration process apply to conditional release decisions under this statute.at.assuming arguendo the decision factors used in the normal parole consideration process adequately account for a juvenile offender maturity and rehabilitation,this conclusion ignores the parole board authority to deny geriatric release for any reason and without consideration of the decision factors and therefore is objectively unreasonable.
under the geriatric release administrative procedures,the parole board must consider the decision factors the factors used in the normal parole consideration process during the assessment review stage.but the parole board may deny a petition for geriatric release for any reason without consideration of the decision factors at the initial review stage.it was objectively unreasonable to conclude that geriatric release satisfied graham requirement that juvenile offenders be able to obtain release based on maturity and rehabilitation,when,under the plain and unambiguous language of the governing procedures,the parole board can deny every juvenile offender geriatric release for any reason whatsoever 
like respondents,the dissent seeks to insulate angel from collateral review by claiming that the virginia supreme court conclusion that virginia law requires consideration of normal parole factors such as rehabilitation and maturity is one of state law and thus is binding on this court.post at.but,contrary to respondents and the dissent characterization,angel does not hold that the geriatric release administrative procedures require consideration of the decision factors.rather,angel states that the decision factors apply to conditional release decisions,but never addresses whether much less holds that the parole board must consider the decision factors in reviewing every petition for geriatric release.at emphasis added.
indeed,by reading angel as requir ing consideration of the decision factors,the dissent puts angel into direct conflict with the plain language of the geriatric release administrative procedures,which permit the parole board to deny a petition for geriatric release at the initial review stage for any reason,and without consideration of the decision factors.see supra part ii.but in predicting how state courts would resolve an unsettled issue of state law,we must reject,if at all possible,predictions that would ascribe absurd or irrational conclusions to state courts.see,pena greffet,supp,refusing to predict that state court would resolve unsettled issue of state law in a way that would produce absurd results union cnty.merscorp,supp,adopting prediction of state law that was t he only,way to read the language of the law itself and the language of illinois appellate courts jakomas mcfalls,supp,rejecting plaintiff contention that state court would interpret state law in a way that would lead to an absurd result.accordingly,we refuse to read angel description of the geriatric release administrative procedues as apply ing the decision factors as requiring that the parole board consider those factors at the initial review stage,as the dissent proposes.
contrary to the dissent position,angel error is not that it irrationally interpreted the geriatric release administrative procedures as requiring consideration of the decision factors.rather,angel unreasonably concluded that the potential for consideration of maturity and rehabilitation at the assessment review stage is adequate to comply with graham requirement that states afford juvenile nonhomicide offenders a meaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation,at,when the procedures allow the parole board to deny geriatric release for any reason at the initial review stage and therefore provide no guarantee that the parole board will consider a juvenile offender maturation and rehabilitation a question of federal constitutional law.indeed,under the geriatric release administrative procedures,the parole board could allow petitioner to die in prison without ever having considered whether petitioner had matured or was rehabilitated.graham does not countenance such a possibility.at,rejecting sentences of life without parole for juvenile nonhomicide offender because such a penalty guarantee s the offender will die in prison without any meaningful opportunity to obtain release and foreswears altogether the rehabilitative ideal.
geriatric release also fails to comply with graham requirement that juvenile offenders have the opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation because it allows for the lifetime incarceration of a juvenile nonhomicide offender based solely on the heinousness or depravity of the offender crime.data provided by the virginia criminal sentencing commission shows that,to date,percent of the denials of geriatric release have been based on the serious nature of the crime.accordingly,the parole board denies geriatric release petitions in nearly every case on grounds that the petitioners crimes demonstrate an irretrievably depraved character directly contrary to graham instruction that state penal regimes take into account a juvenile nonhomicide offender greater capacity for change relative to his adult counterparts by giving such offender the opportunity to demonstrate that the bad acts he committed as a teenager are not representative of his true character.at.
for this reason,the dissent misconstrues graham when it appeals to the conduct giving rise to petitioner conviction and petitioner conduct at sentencing to justify its position.post at.rather,graham forbids states from making a judgment at the outset that a juvenile offender is incorrigible because juvenile offenders have a capacity for change.at.
a second reason petitioner adjudication was objectively unreasonable is that the geriatric release program does not offer juvenile nonhomicide offenders the meaningful opportunity for release traditionally afforded by parole.tellingly,when analyzing whether geriatric release complied with graham,the angel court said that the effect of the juvenile defendant life sentences is that he will spend the rest of his life confined in the penitentiary.at emphasis added.the supreme court of virginia,therefore,expected the defendant in angel who was when he committed his offenses and less than years older when the supreme court of virginia decided his appeal would spend his life jail,notwithstanding the availability of geriatric release and that the defendant had had only four years to grow and matur e.graham,at.but under clearly established supreme court precedent precedent repeatedly relied on by graham,id.at parole should be the normal expectation in the vast majority of cases,solem,at.it was objectively unreasonable,therefore,for the supreme court of virginia to take the position that a penal regime under which it concedes early release is the exception,rather than the expectation,complies with graham meaningfulness requirement.
relatedly,geriatric release also fails to satisfy the meaningful opportunity requirement because there are no standards governing the denial of geriatric release petitions.in the context of determining whether a life sentence without parole complied with the eighth amendment,the supreme court explained that t he law generally specifies when a prisoner will be eligible to be considered for parole,and details the standards and procedures applicable at that time,allowing prisoners to predict,at least to some extent,when parole might be granted.id.at.by contrast,mechanisms that allow a to grant or deny early release for any reason without reference to any standards,offer inmates nothing more than a bare possibility of release and therefore do not constitute parole for purposes of the eighth amendment id.at.
as explained above,the geriatric release statute does not provide the parole board with any guidance regarding what factors it must consider in deciding whether to release a geriatric prisoner.see supra part.and,as petitioner correctly notes,the geriatric release administrative procedures authorize the parole board to deny a petition for geriatric release at the initial review stage for any reason.without any statutory or administrative guidance regarding what constitutes a compelling reason warranting release or setting forth the criteria for denying a juvenile offender petition for geriatric release at the initial review stage,it is impossible to predict whether and when if at all the parole board will grant geriatric release.accordingly,geriatric release does not afford juvenile nonhomicide offenders the meaningful opportunity to obtain release to which graham entitles them.see graham,at holding that executive clemency,which the supreme court has recognized lacks governing standards,did not constitute meaningful opportunity to obtain release for juvenile offenders sentenced to life imprisonment.
third,the state courts unreasonably concluded that the geriatric release program complies with graham dictate that state punishment regimes account for the lesser culpability of juvenile offenders.in particular,even if the parole board wa required to consider the decision factors in deciding whether to grant a petition for geriatric release which it is not a prisoner youth at the time of his offense is not among those decision factors.therefore,neither the geriatric release statute nor the geriatric release administrative procedures require that the parole board consider the special mitigating force of youth,thompson,at,as graham requires.
more significantly and as the district court correctly noted geriatric release treats juvenile offenders sentenced to life imprisonment worse than adult offenders receiving the same sentence because juvenile offenders must serve a larger percentage of their sentence than adults do before eligibility to apply for geriatric release.leblanc,wl,at.for example,under geriatric release,a sentenced to life in prison will be eligible to apply for geriatric release in ten years,but a will have to serve years before receiving his first opportunity to apply for geriatric release.graham emphasized that a life sentence is especially harsh for a juvenile offender relative to an adult offender because,under such a sentence,the juvenile offender will on average serve more years and a greater percentage of his life in prison than an adult offender.at.given that the supreme court specifically held that sentencing systems that require juvenile offenders to serve more years a greater percentage of their lives relative to adult offenders violate the eighth amendment proportionality principle and that geriatric release subjects juvenile offenders to longer and proportionately longer sentences,it was objectively unreasonable to conclude that geriatric release complied with graham.
the dissent does not dispute that the geriatric release administrative procedures permit the parole board to deny a petition for geriatric release for any reason at the initial review stage,without consideration of the decision factors,post at,contrary to graham holding that juvenile nonhomicide offenders sentenced to life imprisonment must have an opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation,at emphasis added.and the dissent does not dispute that geriatric release subjects juvenile offenders,on average,to longer and proportionately longer sentences,post at,contrary to graham dictate that state penal regimes account for the lesser culpability of juvenile offenders,at.nonetheless,the dissent maintains that petitioner is not entitled to relief because we fail to afford his state court adjudication the level of deference section d requires,as the supreme court interpreted that provision in harrington richter.we disagree.
in harrington,the petitioner claimed that his state court adjudication amounted to an unreasonable application of the test for ineffective assistance of counsel set forth in strickland washington.harrington,at.in rejecting the petition,the supreme court explained that t he standards created by strickland and d are both highly deferential,and when the two apply in tandem,review is doubly so id.at quoting strickland,at knowles mirzayance.
notably,harrington further explained that evaluating whether a rule application was unreasonable for purposes of section d requires considering the rule specificity.the more general the rule,the more leeway courts have in reaching outcomes in determinations.id.at quoting yarborough alvarado.the court held that the strickland standard is a general one,so the range of reasonable applications is substantial.id.at citing knowles,at.this echoes the court earlier pronouncement in yarborough,upon which the dissent also relies if a legal rule is specific a pplications of the rule may be plainly correct or incorrect.other rules are more general,and their meaning must emerge in application over the course of time.applying a general standard to a specific case can demand a substantial element of judgment.at see post at.thus,determining whether a state court decision was unreasonable for purposes of section d depends on the specificity of the constitutional rule the state court applied.
a court applying strickland must determine two things that the defendant counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,and that the deficient performance was prejudicial to the defense.at.by contrast,graham set forth a categorical rule barring sentences of life without parole for juvenile nonhomicide offenders.at.and graham clearly established that parole or early release programs for such offenders must provide an opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation and account for the lesser culpability of juvenile offenders.see supra part.the court characterized these minimum requirements as establishing a boundar y on state courts authority to make sentencing determinations.at.accordingly,graham categorical rule and its minimum requirements for parole or early release programs do not afford state courts the same leeway that the reasonableness and prejudice components of strickland permit.indeed,the dissent misconstrues harrington when it affords the same doubly deferential review to petitioner state court adjudication as federal courts apply in reviewing state court decisions applying strickland.
contrary to the dissent,we do not engage in de novo review.rather,we hold that the supreme court of virginia unreasonably applied graham when it acknowledged graham minimum requirements for parole or early release programs for juvenile nonhomicide offenders sentenced to life imprisonment but concluded that geriatric release which permits the parole board to deny petitions for geriatric release without ever considering a petitioner maturity or rehabilitation and which treats juvenile offenders worse than adult offenders complied with those requirements.
nevertheless,respondents and the dissent seek refuge in supreme court statement that i t is for the state,in the first instance,to explore the means and mechanisms for compliance with graham requirements.appellants br.at,post at.according to respondents and the dissent,this single sentence effectively immunized petitioner sentence and those of all other juvenile nonhomicide offenders sentenced to life imprisonment eligible for any form of early release other than executive clemency from collateral review.
but the supreme court proper regard for states independent judgment regarding how best to operate their penal systems does not,e ven in the context of federal habeas,imply abandonment or abdication of judicial review.cockrell.this is particularly true when,as here,the supreme court clearly sets forth minimum constitutional requirements to guide state courts and policymakers decisions requirements that the supreme court of virginia readily determined from the plain language of graham.
in sum,we hold that notwithstanding its recognition of graham governing legal principles,the supreme court of virginia unreasonably concluded that geriatric release a program that predated graham by more than years,that permits the parole board to deny release for any reason whatsoever,and that treats juvenile offenders worse than adult with graham parole requirement.accordingly,we affirm the district court decision and remand so that the petitioner can be resentenced in accordance with graham and the eighth amendment.
in affirming the grant of dennis leblanc habeas petition brought under,the majority holds that the virginia supreme court concluded unreasonably that virginia geriatric release program provided a meaningful opportunity for release to juveniles and therefore satisfied the requirements of graham florida.graham forbids sentencing juveniles to life in prison without parole for nonhomicide crimes.in reaching its conclusion,the majority relies simply on its expressed disagreement with the virginia supreme court decision in angel commonwealth,and effectively overrules it.the virginia court opinion,however,is demonstrably every bit as reasonable as the majority opinion in this case and should be given deference under d.
after leblanc raped a woman in virginia beach,virginia,in,he was convicted in the virginia beach circuit court of abduction and rape.the court sentenced him in to life imprisonment on each count.while virginia had,in,abolished traditional parole for felony offenders,see.code ann,it had at the same time adopted a geriatric release program that allows for the conditional release of inmates who serve at least years of their sentence and reach the age of,see id.
in,the supreme court handed down its decision in graham,where it held that for a juvenile offender who did not commit homicide the eighth amendment forbids the sentence of life without parole.at.the court explained that a state must provide this class of juvenile offenders some meaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation,but that i t is for the state,in the first instance,to explore the means and mechanisms for compliance.id.at.
in its first application of graham,the virginia supreme court held that the factors virginia applies in considering candidates for geriatric release were the same as the factors used in the normal parole consideration process and that,while virginia geriatric release program had an age qualifier,it nonetheless afforded inmates,including juvenile offenders,the meaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation required by the eighth amendment.angel,at quoting graham,at.
after angel had been decided,leblanc filed a motion in the virginia beach circuit court to vacate his sentence as invalid under graham.the circuit court denied his motion,relying on angel to conclude that virginia had an appropriate mechanism in place to enable leblanc to receive some form of parole.but when leblanc sought federal habeas relief under,the district court granted leblanc petition,concluding,contrary to the virginia court decision,that virginia geriatric release program fell short of graham requirements.
in now affirming,the majority unfortunately fails to respect,in any meaningful way,the deference congress requires federal courts to give to state court decisions on postconviction review under.under even a loose application of the governing standard in d,a reviewing federal court would be constrained to conclude that the virginia beach circuit court ruling was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of graham.see d.to hold otherwise would require finding that the virginia supreme court decision in angel,as well as the virginia beach circuit court decision relying on it,amounted to an extreme malfunction in the state criminal justice system.harrington richter.
to reach its conclusion that virginia geriatric release program does not provide juveniles with a meaningful opportunity to obtain release,the majority conducts its own de novo review of the program,concluding that the program lacks governing standards for release.the majority,however,fails to recognize that our task on a habeas petition is not to evaluate state parole systems de novo but rather to determine whether the virginia supreme court evaluation of its own program was an unreasonable application of graham,see d,which it clearly was not.graham held that the eighth amendment forbids states from determining,at the time of sentencing,that a juvenile offender who did not commit a homicide never will be fit to reenter society,at emphasis added,and that such offenders must have a chance to demonstrate growth and maturity,id.at.analyzing the sufficiency of virginia geriatric release program under graham,the virginia supreme court reasonably concluded that the program,which employs the same factors used in the normal parole consideration process,provides nonhomicide juvenile offenders with the meaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation required by the eighth amendment.angel,at quoting graham,at.while the majority may disagree with the virginia supreme court conclusion,the fact that it was reasonable precludes leblanc from obtaining relief under.
moreover,beyond this case,the majority approach will encourage federal courts to scrutinize state policies and parole determinations under similar systems,a result that congress clearly intended to forestall when it imposed the restrictions stated in.indeed,the supreme court also sought to avoid this result by explicitly leaving the application of graham to the states.see graham,at noting that it is for the state to explore the means and mechanisms for compliance.
at bottom,when applying the prescribed standards to evaluate the virginia court application of graham,it is clear that leblanc petition for a federal writ of habeas corpus must be denied.i now address his petition under those standards.
during the morning of july,dennis leblanc,who was at the time years old,asked a woman,who was walking home from a grocery store,for a cigarette.after the woman told him that she did not smoke,leblanc pushed her down,dragged her to nearby bushes,raped her,and stole her purse.when police were later able to match leblanc dna with that of the sperm sample taken from the woman,leblanc was charged and convicted in the virginia beach circuit court of rape,in violation of virginia code,and abduction with intent to defile,in violation of virginia code.he was sentenced to life imprisonment on each count in march.the court noted that the two offenses have to be some of the most serious charges i ever heard about.when imposing life imprisonment,the court did not mention parole,as traditional parole had been abolished in when the geriatric release program was adopted.in response to the sentence given,leblanc told the court twice,f k you.
more than seven years after leblanc sentencing,the supreme court decided graham,holding for the first time that for a juvenile offender who did not commit homicide the eighth amendment forbids the sentence of life without parole.at emphasis added.the court explained that while a state was not required to guarantee eventual freedom to a juvenile offender convicted of a nonhomicide crime,it was required to provide the juvenile offender with some meaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.id.at.the court,however,directed that i t is for the state,in the first instance,to explore the means and mechanisms for compliance with that command.id.
after the graham decision had been handed down,the virginia supreme court considered whether virginia geriatric release program satisfied graham requirements,and it held that the program did so.see angel,at.more specifically,the court explained that virginia geriatric release program,as set forth in virginia code,allows for the conditional release of inmates when they reach age and have served years and that the factors used in the normal parole consideration process apply to such determinations.id.the court concluded that,w hile the geriatric release program has an age qualifier,it provides the meaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation required by the eighth amendment.id.quoting graham,at.
in may,several months after angel was decided,leblanc filed a motion in the virginia beach circuit court to vacate his life sentence as invalid under graham.he contended that angel was wrongly decided and that he did not indeed have a meaningful opportunity for release.the circuit court,however,denied leblanc motion,explaining 
the supreme court of virginia has already looked at this issue in the angel case and determined that there was an appropriate mechanism in place for a defendant to receive some form of parole as enunciated in graham,and they denied angel appeal.the court feels and finds and is so ordering that there is an appropriate mechanism in place,that the sentence rendered back in for leblanc in which the defendant received two life sentences was the appropriate sentence 
emphasis added.the virginia supreme court summarily denied leblanc petitions for appeal and for rehearing.
leblanc filed this federal habeas petition pursuant to,contending again that the virginia supreme court had wrongly decided angel and that,based on statistics that he had presented to the state court,he had only a remote possibility of release,which did not amount to the meaningful opportunity for release required by graham.a magistrate judge recommended dismissing leblanc petition,but the district court disagreed and granted the petition,ordering that the virginia beach circuit court resentence leblanc.the district court concluded that the state court decision was both contrary to,and an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law set forth in graham,explaining that t here is no possibility that fairminded jurists could disagree that the state court decision conflicts with the dictates of graham.the court noted further that the geriatric release program falls far short of the hallmarks of compassion,mercy and fairness rooted in this nation commitment to justice.
from the district court judgment,the respondents the commonwealth of virginia and randall mathena,the warden of red onion state prison collectively herein,the commonwealth or virginia filed this appeal.
the operative state court decision for our review is the decision of the virginia beach circuit court.see grueninger.dep t of,cir.look ing through the virginia supreme court summary refusal to review the defendant appeal and evaluat ing the circuit court reasoned decision.that decision concluded that virginia geriatric release program provides an appropriate mechanism for implementing graham.the circuit court relied on the virginia supreme court opinion in angel,which applied graham and concluded that virginia geriatric release program,which uses the normal parole factors for determining release,provided the meaningful opportunity to obtain released based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation required by the eighth amendment.angel,at quoting graham,at.
faced with the district court contrary conclusion,we must decide whether the circuit court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,graham,d.
first,to satisfy the requirement of d that the state court decision be shown to be contrary to graham,leblanc would have to show that the state court applie d a rule different from the governing law set forth in supreme court cases,or that it decided this case differently than the supreme court has done on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.bell cone.therefore,a decision applying the correct legal rule from supreme court cases to the facts of a prisoner case would not fit comfortably within the contrary to clause.williams taylor.
in this case,no one can seriously argue that the virginia beach circuit court failed to correctly identify graham as stating the applicable legal rule.in denying leblanc motion to vacate his sentence,the circuit court specifically discussed graham,noting how the supreme court in rendering its decision gave the court s guidelines to deal with defendants who were juveniles at the time of their offenses.because the circuit court operated under the correct supreme court rules and did not reach an opposite conclusion from the supreme court on a question of law,the argument that the virginia beach circuit court produced a decision contrary to graham can survive only if the facts of graham were materially indistinguishable from leblanc case.bell,at.but leblanc can not make this showing either.
graham involved a juvenile offender convicted in florida for a nonhomicide crime,who was sentenced to life in prison without any possibility of parole.as such,his sentence 
guarantee d he will die in prison without any meaningful opportunity to obtain release,no matter what he might do to demonstrate that the bad acts he committed as a teenager were not representative of his true character,even if he were to spend the next half century attempting to atone for his crimes and learn from his mistakes.
at.because florida had abolished its parole system,the life sentence gave graham no possibility of release unless he was granted executive clemency.id.at emphasis added.the court noted,however,that executive clemency provided graham only a remote possibility of release,id.at,and that florida had effectively denied him any chance to later demonstrate that he was fit to rejoin society,id.at.in these circumstances,the court held that the eighth amendment prohibits the imposition of a sentence of life without the possibility of parole for juvenile offenders who commit nonhomicide crimes.id.at.
leblanc case differs materially.unlike florida law before graham,virginia geriatric law affords a juvenile sentenced to life imprisonment some opportunity for release.the geriatric law provides in relevant part 
any person serving a sentence imposed upon a conviction for a felony offense who has reached the age of sixty or older and who has served at least ten years of the sentence imposed may petition the parole board for conditional release.the parole board shall promulgate regulations to implement the provisions of this section.
code ann.and the virginia supreme court the ultimate authority on virginia law has construed t he regulations for conditional release under to provide that if the prisoner meets the qualifications for consideration contained in the statute,the factors used in the normal parole consideration process apply to conditional release decisions under this statute.angel,at emphasis added.thus,leblanc can not show that the facts in graham,where the prisoner enjoyed no opportunity for release outside of clemency,are materially indistinguishable from the facts of this case,where leblanc has an opportunity to be released by the parole board.
second,leblanc is also unable to demonstrate that the decision by the virginia beach circuit court,applying angel,was an unreasonable application of graham.see d.to satisfy this requirement,leblanc would have to show that,even if the state court identifie d the correct governing legal principle from supreme court decisions,it unreasonably applie d that principle to the facts of the case.williams,at.and to show that the state court unreasonably applied governing legal principles,he would have to show that the state court decision was objectively unreasonable,rather than merely wrong or involving clear error.white woodall,quoting lockyer andrade.
to emphasize the difficulty of meeting this standard,the supreme court has said that a prisoner would have to show that the state court ruling on the claim being presented in federal court was so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.harrington,at see also id.at a state court determination that a claim lacks merit precludes federal habeas relief so long as fairminded jurists could disagree on the correctness of the state court decision quoting yarborough alvarado.not surprisingly,the rare decision finding d satisfied typically arises from the misapplication of a supreme court standard.see,rompilla beard,finding it was objectively unreasonable for the state court to conclude that,under strickland washington,capital defense lawyer failure to consult prior conviction file that was certain to contain aggravating evidence was not ineffective assistance wiggins smith,similar for file containing mitigating evidence.
in this case,after the virginia beach circuit court correctly identified graham as the governing law,it applied that decision to the facts of leblanc case.in doing so,the circuit court considered the graham requirement that states must provide a mechanism that affords a juvenile sentenced to life imprisonment a meaningful opportunity for release.since the graham court stated that its holding applied only to juvenile offenders convicted of a nonhomicide crime and sentenced to life imprisonment without parole,graham,at,and since the virginia supreme court had held that the geriatric release program employed normal parole factors,the circuit court reasonably concluded that leblanc sentence did not violate graham.
indeed,it strains credulity to conclude that the circuit court application of graham was so lacking in justification that it fell beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.harrington,at.for one,graham focus on the parallel between life without parole and the death penalty,see at,along with the court indictment of life without parole as impermissibly deeming a juvenile offender forever a danger to society,id.at emphasis added,suggests that the court saw no constitutional problem with state parole systems that allow for release only later in life.indeed,the court emphasized that t he eighth amendment does not foreclose the possibility that persons convicted of nonhomicide crimes committed before adulthood will remain behind bars for life.it does prohibit states from making the judgment at the outset that those offenders never will be fit to reenter society.id.at emphasis added.thus,the state court was justified in reading graham eighth amendment concerns as limited to traditional sentences of life without any possibility of parole.
further,graham did not define the bounds of its singular requirement that a juvenile must have some meaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.at.rather,in adopting a categorical rule against life without parole for juvenile nonhomicide offenders,id.at,graham declined to address what characteristics render a parole or release program meaningful.the court did not dictate,for example,how frequently a parole board must meet regarding a juvenile nonhomicide offender or when,after a sentence is imposed on the offender,it must first begin meeting.graham required only that,under a procedure that the court did not specify,the offender be given a meaningful opportunity for release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.given graham leeway with respect to procedures and decisionmaking,the range of permissible state court interpretation is commensurately broad.see yarborough,at e valuating whether a rule application was unreasonable requires considering the rule specificity.the more general the rule,the more leeway courts have in reaching outcomes in determinations.this is for good reason.federal courts simply can not be inserting themselves so deeply into state parole procedures that they effectively usurp the role of a state parole board.see vann angelone,cir.it is difficult to imagine a context more deserving of federal deference than state parole decisions.
affording the proper deference to its interpretation of graham broad rule,it is readily apparent that the virginia beach circuit court operated well within its margin of error in concluding that virginia geriatric release program provides a meaningful opportunity to obtain release.the program includes the parole board review of the inmate circumstances by considering a range of factors,such as 
whether the individual history,physical and mental condition and character,and the individual conduct,employment,education,vocational training,and other developmental activities during incarceration,reflect the probability that the individual will lead a law abiding life in the community and live up to all conditions of geriatric release if released 
length of sentence 
facts and circumstances of the offense 
mitigating and aggravating factors 
relationships with staff and inmates and 
changes in attitude toward self and others.
virginia parole board policy manual.these factors on their face allow for consideration of an offender maturity,rehabilitation,and youth at the time of the offense.further,inmates such as leblanc know in advance that the virginia parole board will be considering these factors when it determines geriatric release so that it is possible to predict,at least to some extent,when geriatric release might be granted.solem helm.thus,the virginia beach circuit court conclusion,after applying angel,that virginia geriatric release law provided the meaningful opportunity to obtain release,certainly was not an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.harrington,at see also id.at it bears repeating that even a strong case for relief does not mean the state court contrary conclusion was unreasonable.to hold otherwise would require a finding in effect that the virginia beach circuit court judge and the virginia supreme court justices failed to meet the definition of fairminded jurists.see id.at.
leblanc concedes,as he must,that the geriatric release program provides some opportunity for release.he argues,rather,that the opportunity is not meaningful because of the low level of success shown by statistics.the statistics to which he refers,however,provide him with minimal support as they relate to older inmates and do not reflect the outcomes of offenders similarly situated to him.given that virginia parole reforms apply only to felony offenders who committed their crimes after,juvenile offenders sentenced after will not gain eligibility for geriatric release for years to come,as they must first reach the age of.a juvenile offender who committed a nonhomicide offense in,for example,would not become eligible for geriatric release until.because of this timing,relevant statistics for juvenile offenders simply do not exist.
i conclude that,just as the virginia beach circuit court did not rule contrary to graham,it also was not an unreasonable application of graham to leblanc circumstances within the meaning of d.
nonetheless,the majority,for purposes i do not fully understand,engages in an aggressive effort to prop up leblanc claim.to do so,it rests on its unsupported conclusions that virginia geriatric release program does not adequately allow for release based on maturity and rehabilitation that it does not account for youth as a mitigating factor and that it lacks governing standards.even if the majority rigorous,de novo scrutiny of the virginia court reasoning did not defy d deferential standard of review,its conclusions are demonstrably mistaken on their own terms.
the majority first claims that virginia program fails to provide any consideration for the special mitigating force of youth,ante at see also ante at,and for an inmate progress with respect to maturity and rehabilitation,ante at.yet,in the very same opinion,it contradictorily quotes the factors that the parole board is required to consider in granting release under the program,noting that the parole board is to consider certain characteristics of the offender
