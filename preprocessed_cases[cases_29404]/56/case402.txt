discussion 
the juvenile court found jurisdiction over under section,subdivisions b and g and section c.we conclude substantial evidence supported jurisdiction under section c.
we affirm a juvenile court jurisdictional and dispositional findings if they are supported by substantial evidence.in re heather th.in making this determination,we draw all reasonable inferences from the evidence to support the findings and orders of the dependency court we review the record in the light most favorable to the court determinations and we note that issues of fact and credibility are the province of the trial court.ibid.section c states the juvenile court may adjudge to be a dependent a child who falls within this description the child is suffering serious emotional damage,or is at substantial risk of suffering serious emotional damage,evidenced by severe anxiety,depression,withdrawal,or untoward aggressive behavior toward self or others,as a result of the conduct of the parent or guardian or who has no parent or guardian capable of providing appropriate care.
t he question under section is whether circumstances at the time of the hearing subject the minor to the defined risk of harm.in re rocco th.
mother argues there was no evidence had displayed severe anxiety,depression,withdrawal,or untoward aggressive behavior,evidencing serious emotional damage.we disagree did experience severe anxiety and emotional damage,as demonstrated by her nightmares about mother taking her away from father,her fear of mother,and her belief mother was crazy.
whether actually was suffering serious emotional damage at the time of the hearing is not the only relevant issue section c extends both to a child who is suffering serious emotional damage,and a child who is at substantial risk of suffering serious emotional damage.the evidence firmly established was at substantial risk of suffering serious emotional damage from mother abusive conduct.mother falsely made an abduction report against father,causing to return early from a visit to her maternal grandmother,and falsely accused him of pushing her out of a car.heard mother say she would make false reports against father,and mother did make a false police report against him,as a result of which father spent two days in jail.heard the nasty messages mother left daily for the paternal grandmother.mother harassed and disparaged father,and called friends and neighbors to make disparaging remarks about him.even before the incident in which mother tried to have the police remove from father house,the social worker noted,m other has failed to show insight on how her negative relationship with f ather,and her inappropriate filing of false reports,continues to impact the child well being,her mental stability,and the physical environment,in which she is being raised and expressed concern that m other does not realize the emotional abuse she is putting her child through.
mother attempt to have the police remove from father custody by the ruse of a restraining order obtained by false pretenses was,without a doubt,a traumatic ordeal for,which substantiated the risk of serious emotional damage.at at night on october,only six weeks before the jurisdictional hearing,police officers rousted and told her to pack her things because she had to leave with mother.though only years old,had to stand up to police officers and tell them mother was not supposed to be at father home.cried throughout the ordeal and later had nightmares about it.after the november,incident,had a nightmare in which mother took her far away from her father by force.was scared of mother and thought she was crazy.
