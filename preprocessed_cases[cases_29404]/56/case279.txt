juan the minor was charged by a petition filed in juvenile court with one count of misdemeanor battery on school property,subd.a resisting an officer,subd.a disturbing the peace and felony threatening a public officer or employee.
at the time of the adjudication hearing,the prosecution motion to dismiss the misdemeanor battery count was granted.following the presentation of evidence the court granted the defense motion under welfare and institutions code section to dismiss the felony count for insufficient evidence.
the court made true findings on the resisting an officer charge and on the disturbing the peace charge.
the minor was placed on formal probation.he filed a timely notice of appeal.
the minor appeals contending there was not sufficient evidence to support the true findings on either count.after careful examination of the record,we agree with the minor that the prosecution failed to prove the elements of either offense.thus the court should not have made true findings on those charges.
statement of facts 
the facts of this case are not seriously disputed,although the factual statement in the respondent brief omits a material statement of the police officer in this case in which she explained that she never ordered the minor to stop.we believe the statement of facts in the appellant opening brief is accurate and we set it forth here as background for the discussion which follows.
jason gentile was the athletic director at king chavez high school at a street in downtown san diego.appellant came to gentile office whenever he c a me out of class for any reason,and gentile felt the two had a pretty good rapport.on june,gentile was on lunch duty outside when he heard a commotion and turned around to see the minor being punched repeatedly by another student.the minor did not appear to be fighting back he was covering himself in a protective position.gentile pulled the other student off of the minor,took him to the main office,and then returned for the minor.the minor was crying and mad.
inside the school building,on the way to the bathroom on the second floor,the minor punched a wall and a garbage can two or three times and said some f words.his fists were clenched,and he was really mad.gentile escorted the minor to the bathroom so that he could freshen up and calm down.but although the minor splashed some water on his face,he did not calm down.
gentile said,let calm down let talk about it,and tried to get the minor to accompany him to his office.the minor said,no i going to get a knife and gun and i going to end this.he said he was going to come back to the school.he went back downstairs and out the front door of the school building.gentile followed him.once outside,the minor walked down a street and turned south on third avenue.gentile tried to talk him down and said,let go grab a soda.but the minor merely turned right on c street and headed west.gentile continued to follow him,but at the corner of c street and first avenue,the minor suddenly threw down his backpack and rosary and ran off.gentile could not keep up with him,so he picked up the minor discarded belongings and returned to the school,where he locked the entrance door and called the police.
the school standard procedure any time anyone says anything involving a gun or violence is to lock the school down.accordingly,the students were called in from lunch and brought inside the locked school for their safety.in the meantime,gentile waited for the police at the front desk near the entrance door.about minutes from the time gentile had last seen him,the minor came to the school front door and tried to get in,but the door was locked.gentile went outside to speak with him.the minor still appeared angry.he said,where is he where is he gentile simply told the minor,i ca let you back in.the minor turned around,crossed the street,and sat down on the sidewalk across from the school.
san diego police department officer linda tousley arrived at that moment and spoke with gentile,who gave her a brief explanation of the situation.officer tousley began walking toward the minor.the minor immediately stood up and started walking away.officer tousley told the minor to stop she said she wanted to talk to him.the minor was angry he said,i do have time for this shit,and kept walking.
officer tousley continued to follow the minor from a distance of about to feet.she did not want to get too close because she was alone and the minor was believed to be armed with a firearm or knife,but she needed to stop him because of the danger he posed to others.in an effort to engage the minor,she asked him if his name was juan and told him she wanted to hear his side of the story.the minor said,you can call me juan or whatever the fuck you want.
officer tousley repeatedly told the minor to stop indeed,she told him at least six to eight times and repeatedly asked him questions.the minor did not slow down,stop,or answer her questions.he merely clenched his fists,made general remarks interspersed with profanity,and kept walking away from her due north.
when officer tousley had followed the minor about two blocks,the minor took off his shirt,turned around to face her,and looked at her while he wrapped his shirt around his fist.it appeared to officer tousley to be fighting type behavior.just then,however,backup officers summoned by officer tousley arrived from the north and ran towards the minor.as they reached him,the minor finally complied with officer tousley command to put his hands behind his back.
after being detained,the minor told officer tousley that the fight at school had started over a minor misunderstanding.he said the same student had tried to fight him in the past,but the minor had walked away.he denied saying anything to gentile about a gun,but admitted he said he was going to get a knife and come back to deal with his antagonist.he further stated that that was in fact his plan indeed,he even specified he would get the knife from the kitchen but gentile foiled it by following him.so,he abandoned the plan and instead went to a local continuation school,whose student body includes many probationers,to find someone to help him beat up the student who had punched him.
the minor testified in his own defense.he admitted that he saw officer tousley approaching him when he was seated on the sidewalk and that he stood up and walked away when he saw her.she responded by saying,come to me,and telling him that she did not know what was going on.the minor admitted he told her,i do give a shit,and kept walking away.he also admitted she repeated the command for him to come to her,but he just kept on walking.
the minor denied officer tousley ever told him to stop.but he admitted he knew the officer wanted to arrest him and that he saw her reaching for her handcuffs.nonetheless,he kept walking away from her until an officer with a baton confronted him.
on,the minor claimed he did not think officer tousley had been informed about the fight and his threats.he admitted that he said something to gentile about knives,however.he also admitted that he knew officer tousley wanted to talk to him,but he walked away from her because he did not feel like talking to her.and he admitted he knew officer tousley intended to detain him if she got her hands on him,so he just kept walking away.
