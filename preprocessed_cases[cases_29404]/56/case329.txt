order modifying opinion and denying rehearing 
no change in judgment 
the opinion that was filed july,is modified as follows 
delete the second sentence of the third paragraph of section.and replace it with here,the juvenile court granted parental visitation following termination of reunification services at the month review hearing,which is governed by section.
at the end of the sixth paragraph of section,add the following footnote 
in a petition for rehearing,father joined by mother again argues we should review the juvenile court order for substantial evidence,and he claims to find support in in re th.lexis,an opinion recently ordered published by our colleagues in division one.his reliance on this case is misplaced.in,the juvenile court bypassed reunification services for a mother under two exceptions to services listed in section,subdivision b,but then ordered services a few months later after the mother filed a section petition.at.held that the juvenile court had erred by failing to make the specific findings required under section,subdivision c before ordering services for the parents.at.concluded that these findings were not excused simply because mother made her request for services by way of a section petition since section expressly requires the findings a requirement now explicitly set forth in section following an amendment in.at fn.it is true that reviewed the juvenile court order for substantial evidence.id.at.this was proper,however,because orders regarding the bypass provisions of section,subdivision b are reviewed for substantial evidence.in re gabriel th.but stressed the differences between the evidentiary burdens and findings applicable to section petitions,as opposed to those applicable in proceedings brought under the bypass provisions,which have never been an issue in this case.at.
father also contends that the determination under section is subjective and less precise than the objective finding of detriment that was required before the termination of visitation,as set forth in in re manolito,supra,th at page,and that such a factual determination should be reviewed for substantial evidence rather than for an abuse of discretion.we reject the argument for two reasons.first,manolito reviewed the juvenile court termination of visitation after making a detriment finding for abuse of discretion.id.at.second,while we question whether the two standards are so different in this context,we note that the juvenile court here made a finding of detriment.father and mother petitions for rehearing are denied.
the addition of the footnote will not necessitate the renumbering of footnotes.

appellants father and mother appeal from an order by the juvenile court terminating their rights to visit their three youngest children.visitation had been authorized in july after the court terminated reunification services,and visits ensued intermittently for a year and a half.but the boys engaged in troubling behavior during and after these visits,and their attorney,joined by respondent san francisco human services agency agency,sought to end the visits by filing a request to change the july order under welfare and institutions code section this request was granted by the juvenile court in april,and it is this order from which the parents appeal.we conclude that the burden of proof applied at the hearing and that the boys and agency demonstrated sufficient new evidence under section to justify changing the previous court order.we therefore affirm.
factual and proceduralbackground 
father and mother are the parents of six children together,with their three youngest,all boys,being the subject of this appeal father and mother also have two children each from other relationships.the case began when the agency filed a dependency petition regarding all of the children in june.in october,the children were adjudged dependents of the court.in support of its order,the juvenile court made a number of findings,including the following the parents had a relationship characterized by domestic violence that was witnessed and imitated by the children a female child reported sexual abuse by her half brother the children reported that the parents used excessive physical discipline mother had mental health problems requiring therapy father had a possible drinking problem requiring assessment father physically abused his children from another relationship and several children of one or both parents were former dependents of the court,subds.b,j.
a reunification period of over a year and a half followed,and during it the boys were placed together in three different foster homes.status reports filed during this time described worrisome behaviors by the boys.the younger brother suffered possible developmental delays,which may have been due to brain bleeding at birth.the middle brother showed aggression when he was two years old and engaged in head banging.the older brother,according to his foster parents,play ed with his feces all the time when he was first placed in their care but stopped by early.
visits among the three boys,their siblings,and their parents during the reunification period sometimes involved violence among the children requiring constant intervention and redirection.according to a status report filed in october,the boys often acted out after visits.in early,the social worker reported that the boys returned from visits with their parents hyper and unable to self regulate.after visits,the older brother displayed increasingly aggressive behavior,the middle brother became the most disregulated,and the younger brother was often very fussy.
the parents were unable to reunify with their children.at the conclusion of a contested month review hearing in july,the juvenile court terminated reunification services and ordered the boys to be placed with a maternal aunt mother sister,where they had been living for just over a month,and where they have remained ever since 
at the july hearing,counsel for the agency and the minors expressed concerns that parental visits during the reunification period caused the boys to engage in continued aggression,tantruming,and acting out.the court noted that the boys were still adjusting to their new placement,and it was hard to know why they were experiencing difficulty.the court ordered that mother receive supervised visitation twice a month,but added,if it turns out that my call regarding visitation was wrong or there new information,come back to the court and i reconsider what i ordered.italics added.father visits with the boys had been stopped around the time father entered a program.the court ordered monthly supervised visits with father,subject to various conditions,including a requirement that father begin drug testing and that father sobriety be evaluated before the resumption of visitation.
the juvenile court renewed the boys dependency status at review hearings on january and august,and on january,following the filing of status review reports describing the boys progress in their aunt care.according to these reports,the boys displayed a good deal of aggression when they were first placed with their aunt,but they became less aggressive over time.the social worker reported at one point that the older brother had shown great improvement in his behavior and emotional regulation,although his preschool continued to work with him on his physical behaviors and socialization skills,and he still at times screamed uncontrollably and acted out sexually.the middle brother suffered from severe diarrhea early on in the placement that was attributed to anxiety.he was asked to leave his preschool because of violent behavior,and he was disruptive at a second preschool placement,where he hit and bit students and teachers.he was severely delayed in his speech,scored very low on an early childhood screening test,and suffered severe behavioral and emotional issues related to anxiety and disorder.the younger brother behavior was reportedly normal,although he continued to experience developmental delays.
mother was generally consistent in visiting the boys,but the boys were at times overwhelmed by the visits and experienced episodes of emotional dysregulation when they were with mother and were hard to control.father satisfied the conditions to begin visitation.he visited with the boys in november,and in january,february,and march,but then did not visit with them again until august.the two older brothers reacted negatively when father visits resumed.the older brother then about years old had a bowel movement in his pants during the first resumed visit,had one a few days later at school even though he was not ill,and acted defiantly at home.the middle brother then about years old and fully toilet trained suffered diarrhea for three weeks following the visit.
the aunt supervised mother visits with the boys.mother was frustrated that she was unable to exercise more of a parental role outside of her sister shadow.but,according to the social worker,the boys were accustomed to their aunt and responded well to her consistency and structure.starting in august,mother visits were supervised by a third party,apparently because of the tension between mother and her sister.
a new social worker was assigned to the case in early september.based on discussions she had with the boys aunt,teachers,and therapists,the social worker became extremely concerned about the boys behavior and the constant to the biological parents with whom they experienced extreme violence and neglect,which led to a spike in problematic behaviors,including aggression,biting,and scratching.the older brother appeared to react the strongest to visits with his parents.he acted out aggressively after a visit with father in late august,and as of late september a few months shy of his sixth birthday,when he was otherwise a fully kindergartener,he had had a bowel movement in his pants three out of four visits with father.the middle brother reportedly had less ability to focus at school after visits with his parents and became more emotional and aggressive,while the younger brother behavior could escalate very quickly at times.
the new social worker consulted with the director of the early trauma treatment center at san francisco general hospital,who had served as a consultant for the agency for years and had conferred with a previous social worker assigned to the case.the consultant recommended that all visits between the boys and their parents be terminated.the consultant stated that the boys behavior showed the classic characteristics of children whose brain development and emotional health has been derailed by their early experiences as they show emotional dysregulation,for example,in the form of the inability to control feces when under stress severe aggression lack of tolerance for frustration fear of separation chronic sleep problems and night terrors violence towards teachers and peers and food hoarding.she believed that visits with the parents were a reminder of the traumatic experiences that they experienced when in their care,and that their behaviors represent the trauma they suffered though they can not articulate their pain.
in late october,the aunt reported that the older brother had a bowel movement during a visit apparently with mother that was so bad his clothes had to be thrown away.he was able to avoid an accident during a different visit this one with father,but he then had diarrhea for the two days following it.the younger brother,who was almost four years old and fully toilet trained,also soiled his pants two days in a row after visits with father.the middle brother appeared withdrawn at school the day after an october visit with mother,and he pointed to angry and sad faces when his therapist asked him to describe how he felt after the visit.because of his behavior at preschool,he was on the verge of being expelled just three months after starting there.according to the social worker,all three boys acted out following parental visits,and this pattern continued through early.
because the boys distressing behavior persisted during and after parental visits in the fall of,the boys attorney sought to change visitation arrangements under section.in september,the attorney filed a petition to gradually reduce mother visits,but this petition was later withdrawn.on november,the attorney filed two new section petitions.the first requested that all visits between the boys and father be suspended because father had been inconsistent with visitation often canceling at the last minute,and the boys were displaying worrisome behaviors after visiting with him.for example,after the most recent visit with father,the older two brothers then nearly five and six years old had numerous accidents and suffered meltdowns,and the younger brother bit both of his brothers and displayed other unusual behaviors.the second petition requested that all visits between the boys and mother be suspended because the boys were experiencing and displaying great stress both during and after visits with her.for example,the older brother then nearly six years old was unable to control his bowel movements and had an accident during a recent visit,and his teacher reported that he was emotionally distraught and fragile on days after visits.according to the petition,the two younger brothers also displayed destructive behaviors after visits.
the juvenile court denied the boys ex parte request to suspend visits with father pending a hearing,but granted the request as to mother.thus,all visits between the boys and mother were suspended as of november.on december,the agency filed an addendum report with the juvenile court recommending that visits between the boys and both parents be terminated.
a contested hearing was held over four days in february,march,and april.at the hearing,it was undisputed that the boys acted out and presented challenges,but the parties disputed whether the boys behaviors were connected to visits with mother and father.the social worker testified that the boys behavior had improved dramatically while in their relatives care,but the boys regressed and acted out in extreme ways after parental visits.the day after a visit with father in late january the middle brother was expelled from his preschool his fourth because he bit the school director during a meeting about his aggressiveness toward other children.when his uncle went to pick him up from school,the middle brother bit him and scratched him,causing him to bleed,and his tantrumming explosion lasted about four hours.the older brother also had a difficult day at school the day after the visit with father and had to be sent home from kindergarten early.the social worker acknowledged on that the boys had exhibited troubling behaviors for years,that some of their outbursts occurred days or weeks after visits with the parents,and that father acted appropriately during visits and showed warmth toward his children.
the boys aunt testified that the boys displayed a lot of aggression when they first came to live with her,but their behavior had improved during the nearly two years that they were under her care.she reported that after parental visits,the older brother acted out in extreme ways at kindergarten,acted defiantly,and hit his brothers the middle brother had nightmares several times during the night,cried a lot,experienced meltdowns,became sensitive and emotional,and threw toys and the younger brother got anxious because of his older brothers aggression and began modeling those behaviors.the aunt testified that usually after a visit there is drama.it two or more days of chaos before she and her husband could get the boys to the point where they could play nicely together and not be so aggressive.
the care coordinator who had supervised six visits between father and the boys testified that visits generally went well.the older brother usually smiled and ran to greet father,and all three hugged him,smiled,and laughed during the visits.and although the older brother soiled his pants during an october visit with mother,the boys appeared excited to see her and hugged her.
the consultant who had recommended that parental visits be terminated testified as an expert in children mental heath issues,including attachment issues and child trauma,and their effect on children.she reiterated her view that the boys expressed extreme anxiety surrounding parental visits,appeared to have very high levels of separation anxiety from their aunt,and needed to be reassured that they would live with their aunt forever.according to the consultant,the boys behaviors were classic manifestations of a condition that is called complex post traumatic stress disorder which sometimes from sic repeated and cumulative experiences of witnessing domestic violence,being verbally punished,and witnessing other children being physically,sexually or emotionally abused.she acknowledged that the boys displayed love for their parents and that visits often began well,but she explained that the boys would react negatively when their parents tried to control them by yelling or sending them out of the room.the consultant explained that the boys are very easily triggered by any hint that they might be frightened,especially by father.she believed that parental visits should be terminated because they only served as triggers of early memories that are frightening and.
the consultant was pressed on whether there was a connection between parental visits and the boys acting out.she acknowledged on that the middle brother aggressive behavior had continued even after visits with mother were suspended.she testified that her recommendation to terminate visits was not based on a causal connection between visits and bad behavior,but instead was based on an overall case formulation that i have been trying to portray in the course of my testimony saying that these children are moralogically sic,physiological ly,cognitively,socially and emotionally showing intense serious manifestations of complex trauma disorder,so that what they need is a predictable,structured,safe reliable day to day experience without revisiting triggering stimuli.the consultant also admitted on that she had never directly observed the children but was relying on reports about them.
the juvenile court terminated all parental visits after finding that there was clear and convincing evidence that it was in the boys best interest to terminate visitation based on a change in circumstances or new evidence.mother and father both timely appealed.father has filed a joinder in mother opening brief to the extent her arguments benefit him,and mother has joined father opening brief subject to the same qualification.cal.rules of court,rule a.

mother and father contend that we should review the order for substantial evidence.father argues that in doing so we should bear in mind a burden of proof at the section hearing.but,as we discuss more fully below,we conclude that a standard applies at a section hearing to terminate parental visits during the stage of dependency proceedings.mother argues,after acknowledging that section rulings are generally reviewed for abuse of discretion,that the standard governs when the issue involves terminating parental visits.we disagree.the cases upon which she relies,unlike this one,arose in the context of visits being terminated during the reunification period and did not involve a section petition,in re mark th,fn.reviewing denial of visitation after finding detriment to the minor under,subd.a b.we see no reason to depart from the more direct authority requiring us to review a ruling on a section petition for an abuse of discretion.
burden of proof at the section hearing 
section allows interested parties to petition for a hearing to change or set aside a prior court order on the grounds of change of circumstances or new evidence,subd.a.the burden of proof at any such hearing is on the moving party to show by a preponderance of the evidence both that there are changed circumstances or new evidence and that also a change in court order would be in the best interest of the child,subd.b in re stephanie,supra,cal th at in re th.
as mentioned above,father argues that the moving parties were required to prove by clear and convincing evidence instead of by a preponderance of the evidence that continuing visits would harm the boys.father argument relies on statutes and cases involving the denial of visits during the reunification period,when the focus of the proceedings is on trying to reunify parents with their children.denial of visitation during this critical period is governed by section,subdivision a b,which provides that a visitation order shall not jeopardize a child safety.cases interpreting this statute refer to the specific findings that must be made to deny visitation during the reunification period,when there is a statutory presumption that visitation shall be as frequent as possible,consistent with the of the child,subd.a a,in re brittany th,in re th.although we need not resolve the issue,we recognize that when the focus of dependency proceedings is on reunification,a higher standard of proof may be warranted before a court may deny visitation outright.in re dylan th,visitation between incarcerated parent and minor may be denied only by proof of clear and convincing evidence that visitation would be detrimental to minor seiser kumli,cal.juvenile courts practice and procedure ed.disposition hearing,b iii,standard of proof for denial of visitation an open question.
visitation during the period,however,is governed by different statutes,which focus on permanency and stability for the child.here,the juvenile court granted parental visitation following termination of parental rights at the month review hearing,which is governed by section.subdivision a of that statute provides that when a juvenile court terminates reunification services and orders a hearing under section,the court shall continue to permit the parent to visit the child unless it finds that visitation would be detrimental to the child,without specifying a burden of proof for such a finding no hearing was held here because the boys were found not to be proper subjects for adoption,and there was no one willing to accept legal guardianship.but if the juvenile court had held such a hearing here and ordered foster care as the permanent plan which it essentially did when it ordered the boys placed with their aunt in care following the month hearing,the relevant statute directs the court to authorize continued visitation with the parents unless it finds by a preponderance of the evidence that visits would be detrimental to the physical or emotional of the child,subd.c c see also cal.rules of court,rule b b iii when court orders foster care after month hearing,court must continue visits unless visitation would be detrimental,with no burden of proof specified for finding of detriment.in sum,although the statutes governing the period following termination of reunification services contemplate continuing parental visitation absent a finding of detriment,there is no indication that such a finding must be made by clear and convincing evidence.
mother and father direct this court to no cases addressing the termination of parental visitation on a section petition filed after reunification has ended and foster care has been ordered much less holding that the burden of proof on such a petition is by clear and convincing evidence,and we are aware of none.in an analogous situation,in re manolito
