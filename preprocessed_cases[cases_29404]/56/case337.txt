discussion 
tyrone contends the petition did not allege sufficient facts to justify jurisdiction under section,subdivision b.he asserts there were no allegations of how had suffered,or was at substantial risk of suffering,serious physical harm or illness as a result of one incident of domestic violence,which did not occur in presence.
a dependency petition must contain a concise statement of facts,separately stated,to support the conclusion that the child upon whose behalf the petition is being brought is a person within the definition of each of the sections and subdivisions under which the proceedings are being instituted,subd.f.there is no requirement,however,that agency regurgitate the contents of the social worker report into a petition.in re alysha th.the statute merely requires the pleading of essential facts establishing at least one ground of juvenile court jurisdiction.id.at.notice of the specific facts on which the petition is based is fundamental to due process because it enables the parties to properly meet the charges.in re jeremy d,in re christopher th,purpose of petition is to give parents adequate notice of allegations against them.
because tyrone makes a facial challenge to the petition,we apply the rules applicable to a demurrer.in re nicholas th,in re kaylee th.thus,we construe the facts in favor of the petition to determine whether agency sufficiently alleged that was at substantial risk of serious physical harm as a result of the parents failure or inability to adequately supervise or protect her,subd.b.
a petition filed under section,subdivision b requires proof that t he minor has suffered,or there is a substantial risk that the minor will suffer,serious physical harm or illness,as a result of the failure or inability of his or her parent to adequately supervise or protect the minor.in re alysha,supra,th at.as grounds for jurisdiction,the petition here alleged the parents placed at substantial risk of serious physical harm because they periodically exposed her to violent confrontations,meaning on more than one occasion.contrary to tyrone argument,the petition was not limited to one incident of domestic violence.instead,it identified the reasons for court intervention by specifying parental conduct that contributed to the need for protection.in re robert d,fn.the petition described the risk of harm to by including facts that tyrone allowed heather in the family home despite knowing she was using drugs,and he engaged in an argument with heather that resulted in shoving and punching her and stepping on her neck.although was not present during the september incident of domestic violence,the petition can be read broadly to show that the type of violent conduct in which the parents engaged on that date constituted a failure to protect from the substantial risk of encountering the violence and suffering serious physical harm or illness from it.in re heather th.
for pleading purposes,the allegation of these facts was sufficient to withstand a challenge to the legal sufficiency of the petition.see in re stephen d,in re th,allegations of mother failure or inability to protect minor from father past violence in older children presence and his failure to obtain treatment provided sufficient detail to confer notice of agency concerns as to substantial risk of harm.tyrone had sufficient notice of the specific facts on which the dependency petition was based to enable him to respond to its allegations.in re jeremy,supra,d at
