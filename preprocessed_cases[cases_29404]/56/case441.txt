the department found amy siblings had fallen behind on their immunizations and concluded their safety could not be assured in the home of mother and father and placed them with maternal grandfather.
the next day,may,amy was examined at citrus valley medical center by james liu who assessed amy condition as failure to thrive due to low calorie intake most likely due to mother and father lack of exclusive breast feeding knowledge liu indicated a child being exclusively should be fed every two hours.however,mother had been amy every three to four hours.liu noted amy development was delayed as she was not able to turn,a skill which is normally attained during the second month.liu recommended metabolic testing and indicated amy could be discharged but for the hold imposed by the department.after amy condition stabilized due to a change in diet and feeding regimen,she was placed in foster care.
