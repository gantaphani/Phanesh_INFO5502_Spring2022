father appeals from the juvenile court findings at the review hearing that reasonable reunification services were provided to him and that active efforts were made to prevent the breakup of the indian family.we reverse and remand.
background 
in may,the mendocino county department of social services the department filed a welfare and institutions code section petition with respect to.born.born,and.born collectively,minors.the petition alleged minors mother,mother,had substance abuse and mental health issues rendering her unable to care for minors,and that father whereabouts were unknown the detention report stated mother and minors were enrolled members of the hopland band of pomo indians the tribe.at the detention hearing,mother informed the court that father was minors father,she and father married in,and they were still married although mother had filed for divorce in.the last she had heard about father whereabouts was that he was incarcerated in florida,who was present at the hearing,told the juvenile court she would like to have contact with father if the department were able to locate him.the juvenile court detained minors,declared the case governed by the indian child welfare act icwa et,and directed the department to try to contact father.the department subsequently located father in a florida jail and he requested counsel and services.
at the september,jurisdiction hearing,the department social worker testified father had felony convictions for forgery in,burglary in,possession of a firearm in,and possession of marijuana and cocaine in,for which he had been sentenced to one year in jail.she further testified father was now out of jail.father counsel submitted certificates indicating that while incarcerated father had completed substance abuse classes and a dog training program.the juvenile court sustained an amended allegation as to father that he has a pattern of criminal behaviors that includes a arrest and conviction in that severely impairs his ability to care for and protect his children.
a september disposition report stated father spoke to the department social worker in early september.father,then years old,first smoked marijuana when he was and began using methamphetamine and heroin when he was about.he reported us ing hard drugs off and on for years.he and mother were romantically involved for years.he was currently living in florida with his parents and was unemployed.the report further stated as to father it is not in the children best interest to offer family reunification services as he does not have a close relationship with his three daughters who,by his own admission,he has seen in more than five years nor spoken to in at least two years.additionally father has engaged in criminal activity nearly his entire adult life,which would endanger his children.i do not,however,feel it would be detrimental to the children for them to have supervised telephone contact with father.the department did not recommend bypassing services and the social worker advised father she like him to attend narcotics anonymous meetings and parenting classes in his area and asked that he look into what resources may be available to him,in addition to the social worker looking into available services.no case plan was attached to the report.at a hearing prior to disposition,father counsel objected that the department asking father to identify services was not appropriate.that the job of the social worker.there no case plan.this needs to be done in a case plan for specific services in florida need to be provided.the juvenile court agreed,noting the department stated it was looking into services and perhaps by the continued hearing they can specifically identify those services and make specific referrals.
prior to the disposition hearing,the department filed a case plan.as to father,the case plan listed two objectives show that you know age appropriate behavior for your children and do not break the law.avoid arrests and convictions.a description was provided for the first objective complete a series of parenting classes which will be identified by yourself the social worker,who is to approve classes you may identify.additionally,regularly participate in classes groups which will support your sobriety,such as or meetings.the case plan provided for minors to have one weekly supervised telephone visit with father,upon their request.
at the october,disposition hearing,father counsel objected to the case plan as insufficient for him being out of state.i talked to county counsel and the social worker about identifying specific parenting classes,the name of the program in florida.and that needs to be formulated and put in his case plan.right now it just identify a parenting class with your social worker input,take it and participate in a sobriety program.it does call for him to have a drug treatment assessment,random drug testing anything of that nature.the juvenile court adopted the department recommendation that father be provided with reunification services,but continued the hearing with respect to father case plan to allow the department to submit a more specific case plan that includes services that will assist the father in reunifying and consider how visitation should look,given it between california and florida at this point.
on november,the department filed an updated case plan as to father.for the objective involving age appropriate behavior for minors,the case plan stated sign up and attend the duval county family preservation program fast program through family support services of north florida,and a ttend all aspects of the program counseling anger mgmt substance abuse treatment.domestic violence education with attendance.no contact information for the program was provided.the case plan also added a third objective to maintain relationships with minors,which provided for father to have weekly telephone visits,permitted him to write minors letters via the social worker,and allowed social media or video contact at the department discretion.
at the november,continued hearing,father counsel voiced several objections the identified program is very vague and does not indicate its length father had not been assessed as to his need for anger management and domestic violence services and the plan lacked drug testing and housing services.the department responded that the florida agency did not respond to the department requests for having a referral,what involved with their program,and noted father was on parole so he probably drug testing through them so we can probably get something through them.the department also stated father was not returning the social worker calls.at the conclusion of the hearing,the juvenile court directed father case plan be rerun with specifics as to what the counseling,how long that going to take place.is that a parenting component what the anger management is or if it simply like a parenting,discipline with confidence,that kind of thing certainly would be appropriate.substance abuse treatment,what it consists of,and include testing protocols.domestic violence education,simply be assessed to determine if there is a need and comply with the recommendation.add a housing component,provide appropriate housing and,to the extent that it not specifically addressed,parenting classes.i believe father has not been actively parenting his children for a period of time,and i believe that would benefit him to have classes to address their developmental needs and.special needs.so that will be the plan and if there any problems with the plan,any party can calendar it for a court hearing.no subsequent hearing was calendared prior to the review hearing.
in reports filed in advance of the review hearing,the department stated a new social worker was assigned to the case two weeks after the november hearing.the new social worker was told the previous social worker would be updating father case plan,but the previous social worker did not do so.on january,the social workers agreed that the new social worker would revise the case plan.the same day,the new social worker called father,informed him she would be sending a revised case plan,and discussed arranging a telephone visit with.and.later in january,the social worker called father and told him his new case plan was coming he requested it be emailed to him.on january,the department emailed father a copy of the case plan.
the case plan provided a telephone number for the duval county family preservation program fast program but otherwise provided no details about the content or length of the program under the objective to avoid arrests and convictions,the case plan directed father to contact hubbard house and enroll in the first steps program.a telephone number was provided but there was no information about the content or length of the program.the visitation objective remained the same as the prior version.drug testing was not part of the written case plan,although the department reports stated it was in the process of contracting with a florida provider and drug testing would begin after the review hearing.
father had one telephone call with.and.in january.although the call was supervised,the department provided no information about the call.father requested more calls but apparently none were arranged,although the department stated regular phone visitations would begin after the review hearing.father had contact with.on social media and phone calls initiated by.
on february,the department called father,who said he was not participating in services at this time.the social worker spoke to father again on february and march there is no evidence father participated in services prior to the review hearing.the department recommended continuing services to father.
at the april,review hearing,father counsel argued reasonable services were not provided,citing the delay in creating father revised case plan and the failure to provide drug testing or regular phone visitation.the department acknowledged the delay but argued it was reasonable given the circumstances that father was and that a new social worker was assigned in the middle of the case.the juvenile court found reasonable services had been provided.the court also found father had not complied with the case plan and the department made active efforts to prevent the breakup of the indian family,and ordered continued reunification services for father with weekly telephone visits.
discussion 
reasonable services 
father first argues no substantial evidence supports the juvenile court finding that he was provided with reasonable reunification services.we agree 
reunification services implement the law strong preference for maintaining the family relationships if at all possible.the department must make a good faith effort to provide reasonable services responsive to the unique needs of each family.t he plan must be specifically tailored to fit the circumstances of each family,and must be designed to eliminate those conditions which led to the juvenile court jurisdictional finding.the effort must be made to provide reasonable reunification services in spite of difficulties in doing so or the prospects of success.the adequacy of the reunification plan and of the department efforts to provide suitable services is judged according to the circumstances of the particular case.t he record should show that the supervising agency identified the problems leading to the loss of custody,offered services designed to remedy those problems,maintained reasonable contact with the parents during the course of the service plan,and made reasonable efforts to assist the parents in areas where compliance proved difficult.in re th.the standard is not whether the services provided were the best that might be provided in an ideal world,but whether the services were reasonable under the circumstances.in re,supra,th at.we review the reasonable services finding for substantial evidence.ibid.
we agree with father that the department failed to provide reasonable services.the initial case plan filed prior to disposition failed to identify any service providers and instead placed the burden on father to locate services.the november case plan identified one program but provided no contact information or instructions about how father could enroll in services.only in late january more than three months after the disposition hearing was father provided with contact information for two specific service providers.
despite taking more than half of the review period to develop,the belated case plan failed to address all of the problems leading to minors removal from father custody.father had recently been incarcerated for a drug offense,he admitted a long history of substance abuse,and the initial case plan included a direction to participate in sobriety groups.yet the january case plan did not identify sobriety or substance abuse treatment as an objective or include any assessment or services related to this issue.father was not drug tested once during the review period,despite the juvenile court direction at the november hearing that the case plan include testing protocols.similarly,father was living with his parents and the department provided no assessment of whether his housing was appropriate for minors,yet the case plan failed to include any housing services,despite the juvenile court direction that such services be included.
as for the services that were included in the case plan,the department provided inadequate information to determine whether they were responsive to the objectives of learning parenting skills and avoiding criminal activity although the juvenile court requested specifics about the content and length of identified programs,the only such information provided was a statement in the department report that the duval county program is designed to address development of children and typical behaviors.there was no explanation of whether the program also included domestic violence,anger management,or substance abuse components,as was indicated in the previous version of the case plan.nor was there any indication whether the department had assessed father need for domestic violence services,as the juvenile court had directed.the department provided no description of the hubbard house program and how it will help father avoid criminal activity.there is also no indication as to whether either of the identified programs will help father with parenting.special needs,despite the juvenile court direction that such services be included.it is the social worker job to maintain adequate contact with the service providers and accurately to inform the juvenile court and the parent of the sufficiency of the enrolled programs to meet the case plan requirements.amanda superior court th.the department did not do so.
finally,father was afforded only one telephone visit with.and.during the period,despite his requests for more and the case plan provision for weekly calls.visitation is a critical component,probably the most critical component,of a reunification plan.in re,supra,th at.the department offered no explanation below about why more phone calls were not set up.in this court,the department suggests the problem was father failure to stay in contact with the department.however,there is no indication the department tried to set up telephone visits in november or december.once the department began contacting father in january they communicated on several occasions,yet the department apparently made no attempt to set up any more telephone visits until the eve of the review hearing.the provision of a single visit during the review period was not reasonable.see christopher superior court th,finding reasonable services not provided where parent afforded two visits during period.
to be sure,as the department argues,father location out of state rendered the department ability to provide services more difficult.if the delay in preparing the revised case plan were the only problem,it might be excused by this factor.however,father location does not excuse the department failure to identify substance abuse and housing as service objectives,failure after three months of delay to provide information about the two identified programs,and failure to set up more than one telephone visitation with minors.
