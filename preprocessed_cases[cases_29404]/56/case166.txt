no one is very happy about the events that led to this litigation.a girl was arrested,searched,and handcuffed.her shoelaces were removed,and she was transported in the windowless rear compartment of a police vehicle to a juvenile processing center,where she was booked,fingerprinted,and detained until released to her mother some three hours later all for eating a single french fry in a metrorail station.the child was frightened,embarrassed,and crying throughout the ordeal.the district court described the policies that led to her arrest as foolish,and indeed the policies were changed after those responsible endured the sort of publicity reserved for adults who make young girls cry.the question before us,however,is not whether these policies were a bad idea,but whether they violated the fourth and fifth amendments to the constitution.like the district court,we conclude that they did not,and accordingly we affirm.
it was the start of another school year and the washington metropolitan area transit authority wmata was once again getting complaints about bad behavior by students using the university metrorail station.in response wmata embarked on a undercover operation to enforce a policy with respect to violations of certain ordinances,including one that makes it unlawful for any person to eat or drink in a metrorail station.code b.zero tolerance had more fateful consequences for children than for adults.adults who violate b typically receive a citation subjecting them to a fine of to.id.district of columbia law,however,does not provide for the issuance of citations for offenses to those under eighteen years of age.instead,a minor who has committed what an officer has reasonable grounds to believe is a delinquent act may be taken into custody.id.a.committing an offense under district of columbia law,such as eating in a metrorail station,constitutes a delinquent act.id.the upshot of all this is that enforcement of b entailed the arrest of every offending minor but not every offending adult.
the undercover operation was in effect on october,when ansche hedgepeth and a classmate entered the station on their way home from school.ansche had stopped at a restaurant on the way and ordered a bag of french fries to go.while waiting for her companion to purchase a,ansche removed and ate a french fry from the bag she was holding.after proceeding through the,ansche was stopped by a plainclothed metro transit police officer,who identified himself and informed her that he was arresting her for eating in the metrorail station.the officer then handcuffed ansche behind her back while another officer searched her and her backpack.pursuant to established procedure,her shoelaces were removed.upset and crying,ansche was transported to the district of columbia juvenile processing center some distance away,where she was fingerprinted and processed before being released into the custody of her mother three hours later.
the policy was not,it turned out,carved in stone.the negative publicity surrounding ansche arrest prompted wmata to adopt a new policy effective january,allowing wmata officers to issue citations to juveniles violating b.see deposition of michael taborn at.zero tolerance was also not a policy for the ages.effective may,wmata adopted a new written warning notice program,under which juveniles eating in the metro are neither arrested nor issued citations,but instead given written warnings,with a letter notifying their parents and school.only after the third infraction over the course of a year may a juvenile be formally prosecuted.wmata written notice memorandum at.
on april,ansche mother tracey hedgepeth brought this action as ansche next friend in the united states district court for the district of columbia.the complaint was filed under and named wmata,its general manager,the arresting officer,and the district of columbia as defendants.it alleged that ansche arrest violated the equal protection component of the fifth amendment,because adults eating in the metro were not arrested.the complaint also alleged that the arrest was an unreasonable seizure under the fourth amendment.the complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief against the enforcement policies leading to ansche arrest,and expungement of ansche arrest record 
on for summary judgment,the district court ruled in favor of the defendants.hedgepeth washington metro.area transit,d.addressing the equal protection claim,the court applied the highly deferential rational basis test,id.at,because it found that age is not a suspect class,id.at,and that there is no fundamental right to be free from physical restraint when there is probable cause for arrest.id.at.the court then ruled that both the district policy for minors and wmata policy survived rational basis review.id.at.the district court next rejected ansche fourth amendment claim,relying on atwater city of lago vista,d,for the proposition that i f an officer has probable cause to believe that an individual has committed even a very minor criminal offense in his presence,he may,without violating the fourth amendment,arrest the offender.d at quoting atwater,at.at.given that it was undisputed that ansche had committed the offense in the presence of the arresting officer,the district court concluded it was without discretion or authority to reject the standards enunciated in atwater,despite the minor nature of the offense and the harshness of the response.d at.hedgepeth now appeals.
we are confronted at the outset with two jurisdictional objections.first,ansche complaint seeks only prospective relief and even in the absence of wmata change in policy we are not willing to indulge the assumption that she will violate code b in the future and thereby again be subject to the policies about which she complains.this suggests the lack of an ongoing case or controversy under article iii.see city of los angeles lyons,d plaintiff subject to illegal arrest procedure lacked standing to seek prospective relief because he made no showing that he was likely to be arrested and subjected to illegal procedure again littleton,d past exposure to illegal conduct does not in itself show a present case or controversy regarding injunctive relief.
second,wmata argues that its new policy for juvenile offenders renders the case moot.there is no need for the court to assess the legality of the policy to which ansche was subjected,wmata argues,because that policy a combination of a rule for minors and enforcement is no longer in effect.
the answer to both objections is found in the precise relief sought by ansche.in the complaint,ansche sought not only declaratory and injunctive relief with respect to the and policies,but also the expungement of her arrest record.second am.compl.c.she clarified in her summary judgment papers that this last request included a judicial declaration deeming her allegedly unlawful arrest a detention.see memorandum in support of motion for summary judgment,at.such an order would relieve ansche of the burden of having to respond affirmatively to the familiar question,ever been arrested on application,employment,and security forms.this court has approved such relief in the past.see carter district of columbia,tatum morton.ansche accordingly has article iii standing,and her effort to secure such relief has in no way been affected by wmata policy change 
this action is justiciable with respect to both the district of columbia and wmata.although each tries to blame the other,ansche alleges that neither defendant policies alone would suffice to cause the alleged violation but for wmata policy,there likely would have been no enforcement of b against ansche but for the fact that district of columbia law did not authorize citations to minors,the enforcement of b would not have required ansche arrest machesney larry bruni,ordinarily when two tortfeasors jointly contribute to harm to a plaintiff,both are potentially liable to the injured party for the entire harm internal quotation marks omitted.
by the same token,it appears that both wmata and the district would be implicated in the relief that confers standing and defeats mootness.ansche was arrested by a wmata officer and detained and processed in a district facility.records concerning the episode have been generated by both wmata and the district.see transit police event report at metropolitan police delinquency report at.if redress in the form of an order of expungement and a declaration that ansche arrest was a detention were appropriate,such an order would properly run against both wmata and the district.
ansche first contends that her arrest violated the equal protection component of the fifth amendment.see bolling sharpe.adults eating in the metrorail station during the undercover operation could be,and almost uniformly were,given citations similarly situated minors could only be and were subjected to the far more intrusive invasion of arrest.during week,adults violating b at wmata facilities were issued citations,whereas fourteen juveniles were arrested.wmata answers to interrogatories at.
the first step in analyzing ansche claim that this disparate treatment violated equal protection is to determine the proper level of scrutiny.strict scrutiny demands that classifications be narrowly targeted to serve compelling state interests and is reserved for suspect classifications or classifications that burden fundamental rights.intermediate scrutiny requires that classifications be substantially related to important governmental interests it is applied to classifications.under rational basis review,a classification need only be rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.see kimel florida bd.of regents,d.
ansche argues for heightened scrutiny strict scrutiny or,more plausibly,intermediate scrutiny for two distinct reasons first,classifications based on status as a minor are and second,her arrest burdened her fundamental right to be free of physical restraint by the government.the district court correctly held that neither theory supported heightened scrutiny.
ansche acknowledges that the supreme court has said repeatedly that age is not a suspect classification,gregory ashcroft,d citing cases,and instead has analyzed equal protection challenges to classifications under rational basis review.she argues that those cases are distinguishable,however,because they concerned classifications discriminating against the elderly,as opposed to the young.youth,according to ansche,bears many of the hallmarks of a suspect classification a history of discrimination,immutable characteristics,and political disenfranchisement.see lyng castillo,d.thus,she concludes,there should be heightened scrutiny of distinctions burdening the young,even if there generally is not of distinctions based on age.
this court has noted in passing that youth is not a suspect classification.see united states cohen,en banc see also hutchins district of columbia,en banc plurality opinion.other circuits have reviewed classifications based on youth under a rational basis standard.see stiles blunt,cir douglas stallings,cir williams city of lewiston,cir.we agree with the conclusions of these circuits.
although ansche is correct that the supreme court cases applying rational basis review to classifications based on age all involved classifications burdening the elderly,see ramos town of vernon,cir,she has presented us with no persuasive reasons to conclude that classifications burdening children should be treated differently.heightened scrutiny is reserved for classifications based on factors that are so seldom relevant to the achievement of any legitimate state interest that laws grounded in such considerations are deemed to reflect prejudice and antipathy.city of cleburne cleburne living center,d.youth is not such a factor young age is quite often relevant to valid state concerns,as the constitution itself attests.see const.art.i,minimum age for house of representatives id.minimum age for senate id.art.ii,minimum age for president.minimum age requirements for voting,marriage,driving,drinking,employment,and the like can not be dismissed as reflecting prejudice and antipathy toward the young.youth is not so seldom relevant to legitimate state concerns that we should assume that any law singling out the young is probably the result of animus.youth is more often relevant than old age,which we know does not trigger heightened scrutiny.
nor are the characteristics that define the young markedly more obvious or distinguishing than those that define the old.in fact,the characteristics are simply opposite sides of the same coin age.youth is also far less immutable than old age minors mature to majority and literally outgrow their prior status the old can but grow more so.
ansche does point to one relevant difference between old age and youth political power.older americans can vote children can not.a finding of political powerless ness,ness,lyng,at.at,however,even if defined solely in terms of voting rights,is not enough to trigger heightened scrutiny.compare city of cleburne,at.at applying rational basis scrutiny to distinctions based on mental retardation with id.at.at marshall,concurring in part and dissenting in part observing that in most states the mentally retarded can not vote.political powerlessness is also not measured solely in terms of access to the ballot box,for the broad array of laws and government programs dedicated to protecting and nurturing children combined with the large numbers of voters who are parents or otherwise concerned about children belies the argument that children and their needs can not attract the attention of the legislature.see id.at.at.we are rightly skeptical of paternalistic arguments when it comes to classifications addressing adults,see,mississippi university for women hogan,d,but the concern that the state not treat adults like children surely does not prevent it from treating children like children.wmata haste to abandon its challenged policy in the wake of adverse publicity confirms that the interests of children are not lightly ignored by the political process.
for all these reasons,we conclude that classifications based on youth like those based on age in general do not trigger heightened scrutiny for equal protection purposes.
ansche alternatively argues that her equal protection claim is subject to heightened scrutiny because the challenged classification burdens a fundamental right.it has been pointed out often enough that,in considering such a claim,much turns on the level of generality at which the asserted fundamental right is defined.compare hutchins,at plurality opinion we think that juveniles do not have a fundamental right to be on the streets at night without adult supervision.with id.at rogers,concurring in part and dissenting in part the contested right should be defined more abstractly first without regard to age,and second without regard to the manner in which it is exercised.
ansche defines the right at issue as the right to freedom from restraint,see zadvydas davis,d and foucha louisiana,d plurality opinion,a right burdened by the defendants policies compelling the arrest of minors for trivial offenses.the defendants,not surprisingly,define the right at issue far more narrowly for the defendants,the asserted right is the right of a minor to be free from arrest when there is probable cause,if the arrest is pursuant to a policy that precludes less intrusive enforcement options.see district br.see also id.at alternatively defining right as the right to eat within the public transit system.
we think the proper degree of generality lies somewhere between the two extremes offered by the parties.like the district court,we think the right at issue in this case is the right of freedom of movement when there is probable cause for arrest.unlike the defendants proposal,this definition does not depend on the challenged classification minority status itself.unlike the plaintiff proposal,it does not ignore the plainly pertinent fact that we are dealing with a conceded violation of a valid law,a fact that historically has carried implications for the asserted right of free movement.the plaintiff goes so far as to cite the magna carta in claiming the fundamental freedom against being taken or imprisoned,see reply br.quoting magn
