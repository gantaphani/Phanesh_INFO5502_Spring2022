for the reasons that follow,we affirm the judgment of the appellate court.
background 
phyllis is the mother of and because the children putative father,fred depriest,has been incarcerated for the majority of the children lives,phyllis has maintained sole responsibility for raising the children.
in november,the state filed a petition for adjudication of wardship under section of the act ilcs west,alleging that the children were abused because phyllis inflicted physical injury and created a substantial risk of physical injury to the children other than by accidental means and neglected because their environment was injurious to their welfare since it exposed them to physical harm.following a temporary custody hearing,the department of children and family services dcfs was awarded temporary custody and the children were placed in a relative home.
in january,the state filed an amended petition.in this petition,the state removed the allegations of abuse and neglect and alleged,instead,that the children were dependent under section c of the act because they lacked remedial or other care necessary for their through no fault,neglect,or lack of concern by their parents at an adjudicatory hearing,phyllis stipulated to the facts alleged in the amended petition.in return,the state moved to withdraw the original petition,which motion the trial court granted.thereafter,the trial court found that the allegations of the petition brought under section c had been proven and found the children dependent.the dependency finding was based on the following facts had extensive behavioral problems and adhd,was verbally and physically abusive,and ran away from home phyllis lacked stable housing,had trouble maintaining adhd medication,and was overwhelmed with parenting.
in april,following a multipart dispositional hearing,the court found phyllis unfit based on its finding that she had a very unstable lifestyle and had been evicted numerous times she had an unrealistic understanding of financial issues she lacked parenting skills she repeatedly violated court orders in connection with visitation she repeatedly lied and she failed to accept responsibility for her poor decisionmaking.the children were again found to be dependent and made wards of the court.custody and guardianship were removed from phyllis and placed with dcfs.phyllis was advised that she must cooperate with dcfs to remedy the situation,and she must comply with the terms of the service plans to correct the conditions or risk termination of her parental rights.
in december,the state petitioned to terminate phyllis parental rights.at a permanency hearing in july,the court found phyllis unfit on each of the grounds alleged by the state 
she failed to make reasonable efforts to correct the conditions that were the basis for removing the children 
she failed to make reasonable progress toward her children return within nine months after the dependency adjudication and 
she failed to maintain a reasonable degree of interest,concern,or responsibility as to the welfare of her children.
thereafter,a hearing was held.after reiterating its previous findings that the children were dependent and phyllis was unfit,the circuit court determined it was in and best interests to terminate phyllis parental rights.an order terminating phyllis parental rights was entered on august.
phyllis appealed and the appellate court reversed,with one justice dissenting.the appellate court held that the plain language of section c prohibits the termination of parental rights when children have been adjudicated dependent under the provision.justice cook dissented,arguing that section c was ambiguous and,therefore,the court should consider the statute purpose of protecting children best interests,and it was in and best interests to terminate phyllis parental rights.
we granted the state petition for leave to appeal under rule.
a parent right to raise his or her biological child is a fundamental liberty interest.in re.as such,a proceeding to involuntarily terminate a parent rights is a drastic measure.in re,at.in illinois,the authority to involuntarily terminate parental rights is purely statutory and the scope of the court authority is defined by the juvenile court act and the adoption act.in re,at.these acts contain strict procedural requirements that embody illinois policy that favors parents superior right to the custody of their own children.see in re,d.when a court exercises its authority,it must proceed within the confines of that law and has no authority to act except as that law provides.people brown.a court is not free to reject or expand its statutory authority despite the desirability or need for such action.citation.in re jaime.any action the trial court takes that is outside the statute stricture is void.in re jaime,at.
section of the act defines the circumstances under which a child is deemed neglected or abused.section defines the circumstances under which a child is deemed dependent.section provides four bases for finding a child dependent.subsection c,as noted above,is at issue in the case at bar.prior to,the text of subsection c provided 
those who are dependent include any minor under years of age 
c who is without proper medical or other remedial care recognized under state law or other care necessary for his or her well being through no fault,neglect or lack of concern by his parents,guardian or custodian,provided that no order may be made terminating parental rights,nor may a minor be removed from the custody of his or her parents for longer than months,pursuant to an adjudication as a dependent minor under this subsection c.ilcs c west.
in,the legislature amended subsection c,adding at the end of the paragraph the following language,unless it is found to be in his or her best interest by the court or the case automatically closes as provided under section when a child turns or under given circumstances of this act.ilcs c west.
the appellate court found that the phrase unless it is found to be in his or her best interest modifies the prohibition against removing a child from the custody of his or her parents for longer than months,but does not modify the phrase no order may be made terminating parental rights.justice cook,in his dissent,argued that the phrase unless it is found to be in his or her best interest,grammatically,could modify both the prohibition against removing a child from the custody of his or her parents for longer than months and the provision that no order may be made terminating parental rights.
prior to the amendment,the plain language of subsection c was interpreted as prohibiting termination of parental rights following a finding of dependency under that provision.see in re,d,in re,d.the state,in its brief to this court,concedes this point,admitting that,under the preamended statute,parental rights could not be terminated following a determination of dependency under subsection c,although parental rights could be terminated if a finding of dependency was made under the other dependency subsections of.
the question in the case at bar is whether subsection c of section,as amended,prohibits the state from seeking termination of parental rights.this is an issue of statutory interpretation.specifically,we must determine whether the phrase unless it is found to be in his or her best interest,which was added to the statutory provision in,modifies only the phrase prohibiting the removal of a child from the custody of his or her parents for longer than months,as the appellate court majority held,or whether it also mod
