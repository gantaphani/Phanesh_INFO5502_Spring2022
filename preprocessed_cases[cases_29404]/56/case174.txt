when a minor within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court is committed to the california department of corrections and rehabilitation,division of juvenile justice,the juvenile court is required to indicate the maximum period of physical confinement.welf,subd.c.in setting that confinement period,which may be less than,but not more than,the prison sentence that could be imposed on an adult convicted of the same crime,the court must consider the facts and circumstances of the crime,subd.c.
this case presents two issues first,must the juvenile court orally pronounce the juvenile maximum period of confinement,or will a written statement of that period suffice our answer the latter is sufficient.second,must the record show that the court complied with section,subdivision c,by considering imposition of a confinement than the adult might be justified by the facts and circumstances of the crime or crimes committed by the juvenile our answer on a silent record,as is the case here,we will presume that the juvenile court performed its statutory duty.
the probation report describes the incident leading to julian wardship as follows on june,police officers,responding to a reported carjacking in the parking lot of a fast food restaurant in the city of salinas,in monterey county,found two male victims who said they had been assaulted by the occupants of another car.the victims car had been taken,and was later found abandoned nearby.
an hour later,during a routine traffic stop,police officers detained a car near the fast food restaurant.in the car were julian and five other persons,some of whom fit the description of the carjackers.radio speakers from,and keys to,the victims stolen car were found inside the detained car.the officers brought the six suspects to the restaurant parking lot.there,the suspects were shown to witnesses of the carjacking.julian was identified as the one who had kicked and punched both victims.
on july,in return for dismissal of the carjacking count,julian admitted committing two counts of assault against separate victims by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury,subd.a each count was subject to a criminal street gang sentence enhancement,subd.b.
by a dispositional order of august,the juvenile court declared julian to be a ward of the court under section and,rejecting the probation officer recommendation for a commitment to the division of juvenile justice formerly the california youth authority,the court ordered julian committed to the monterey youth center.on february,after julian tested positive for cocaine use in violation of his probation,he was expelled from the monterey youth center.this led to the filing of a supplemental petition on february,alleging two probation use and failure to satisfactorily complete the youth center program.the next day,at a detention hearing on that supplemental petition,julian admitted the probation violations.
on february,at a dispositional hearing on the supplemental petition,the juvenile court concluded that julian was too far entrenched in gangs and the criminal lifestyle to be rehabilitated through locally available services.it then committed him to the division of juvenile justice.the court did not state the maximum confinement that julian would face,did not mention the maximum term that an adult would face for the same offenses,and did not indicate its consideration of the crimes facts and circumstances that might justify a shorter confinement.but on a preprinted form judicial council forms,form,as,the court checked a box beside this printed text the child is committed to the department of corrections and rehabilitation,division of juvenile justice,and form,commitment to the california department of corrections and rehabilitation,division of juvenile justice,will be completed and transmitted.
two days later,on february,the juvenile court signed the required cal.rules of court,rule preprinted commitment form judicial council forms,form,as.as sustained petitions the form listed the two felony assault offenses,subd.a plus applicable gang enhancements,resulting in a maximum confinement period of ten years.to that were added two months for a prior offense of fighting in a public place,subd,a misdemeanor.following the form printed text maximum period of confinement,the court inserted years months,which the probation officer had indicated was the maximum period of confinement for an adult convicted of the same offenses.
julian appealed,asserting that the juvenile court erred in its disposition.he contended the court should have orally pronounced the maximum period of confinement he would face,and the court should have determined whether the facts and circumstances of his crimes warranted a maximum confinement period shorter than the adult maximum prison term for the same offenses.the court of appeal rejected these claims.it held that the juvenile court was not required to orally pronounce the maximum period of confinement that julian would face.it also held that,although the record did not expressly indicate the juvenile court was aware of its discretionary power to impose a maximum confinement period shorter than the adult maximum,its awareness of that power must be presumed,thus compelling the conclusion that the juvenile court had considered a lesser confinement period.this conclusion was contrary to the one reached by the court of appeal in in re jacob th,d,which had held that if the record was silent as to a juvenile court consideration of a facts and circumstances confinement period,the reviewing court would presume that the juvenile court had failed to consider such a period.
in this case,the attorney general advised the court of appeal that julian prior misdemeanor charge of fighting in a public place had been dismissed,reducing the maximum adult term for his offenses to years,and that the principal and subordinate terms for the current two assault offenses had been incorrectly stated on the commitment form.although a maximum adult term of years for the two assaults was correct,the attorney general noted that julian confinement period had been incorrectly apportioned between the principal and the subordinate terms for those assaults,each carrying a gang enhancement correctly calculated,the adult maximum term of imprisonment for the first assault and gang enhancement was eight years,and the maximum term of imprisonment for the second assault and gang enhancement was two years.given those errors,the court of appeal remanded the matter to the juvenile court so it could complete an amended commitment form.
recognizing the conflict between this case and in re jacob,supra,th,d concerning the sufficiency of a juvenile court record that is silent as to the appropriate confinement period based on the facts and circumstances of the crime,we granted review to resolve that conflict.
we begin our analysis with a brief overview of the statutory scheme governing commitments to the division of juvenile justice.
the jurisdiction of the juvenile court extends to persons who are under years of age when they violate any law defining a crime,subd.a.after conducting an investigation,a probation officer may refer a juvenile matter to the prosecuting attorney,but no wardship action can commence until the prosecutor has filed a petition on the people behalf,subd.c,subd.a.the petition states what penal laws were violated and describes the offenses as either felonies or misdemeanors,subd.f.
a bifurcated hearing is then held.at the first jurisdictional hearing the juvenile court decides whether the petition concerns a person described in section.in re eddie cal th,d.the alleged offense or offenses must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt supported by evidence legally admissible in the trial of criminal cases.
at the second dispositional juvenile court hears evidence on the question of the proper disposition to be made of the minor.a wardship determination must be made before the minor can be removed from the physical custody of a parent or guardian.in re eddie,supra,cal th at,d.
at the dispositional hearing,the juvenile court must consider the social study submitted by the probation officer.wards ma
