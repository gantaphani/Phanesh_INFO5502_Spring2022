locked vehicle 
minor first contends that there is insufficient evidence to convict him of burglary,arguing that the vehicle was not locked within the meaning of penal code section.because a window of the vehicle was partially open,minor claims that the vehicle should not be considered locked and that a burglary of an unlocked vehicle could not occur without a show of force.we disagree.
section of the penal code defines burglary to include entering a vehicle when the doors are locked with intent to commit grand or petit larceny the element of locked doors has occasionally been a subject of appellate cases.people allen th,d gaining access to a vehicle trunk by opening an unlocked passenger door and lifting a trunk latch was not considered entering a locked vehicle in re young th,d entering headlamp housings of a vehicle to steal the headlamps is not a burglary,even if the vehicle is locked in re lamont d.chains wrapped and hooked across a trailer door were not sufficient to consider the vehicle locked because they were simply unhooked without using force or breaking a seal people woods d.reaching into a vehicle with a window open five and inches and removing items was not a burglary even though the doors were locked people malcolm d.entering a vehicle by opening a wind wing with a broken latch,reaching in and unlocking doors,was considered entering a locked vehicle people blalock d.forcible entry into a locked trunk was sufficient for burglary whether or not the passenger doors were locked people massie d.a semitrailer was considered locked when the doors were secured by a metal clip that required breaking a seal in order to open the door people toomes d,entering a locked trunk for the purpose of theft,when all other doors were also locked,satisfied the elements of burglary people burns d,even though window was broken,without testimony or other evidence that the vehicle had been locked,there can not be a finding of burglary.
the common law element of breaking has never been an essential element of statutory burglary in california.people allen,supra,th at,d.burglary from a vehicle is the lone exception,requiring that the doors of a vehicle be locked.yet,neither forced entry in the usual sense of the word nor use of burglar tools are elements of automobile burglary.in re charles d.the key element of auto burglary is that the doors be locked.in in re charles,the court considered the vehicle locked based upon testimony that the owner habit was to lock his car,even though there were no signs of forced entry.id.at.in burns,on the other hand,there was evidence of forced entry broken glass,but no evidence that the car had been locked therefore there was no burglary.people burns,supra,d at.
the requirement of locking as an element of vehicular burglary has been interpreted to mean that where a defendant used no pressure,broke no seal,and disengaged no mechanism that could reasonably be called a lock,he is not guilty of auto burglary.citations.in re young,supra,th at,d.therefore,because auto burglary can be committed only by entering a locked vehicle without the owner consent,it is only accomplished by altering the vehicle physical condition at worst,by smashing a window,at best,by illegally unlocking it.these extremes,as well as other possible types of forcible entries,necessarily involve unlawfully altering the vehicle locked state.people mooney d.
in considering the legislative intent underlying the locked doors element of auto burglary,the toomes court found the purpose of the statute is to make it a more serious offense to break into the interior of a car than to merely steal something from it.people toomes,supra,d at.the state policy has been to construe a penal statute as favorably to the defendant as its language and the circumstances reasonably permit.people woods,supra,d.people malcolm,supra,d.see also keeler superior court cal d,superseded by statute on another ground as stated in wilson kaiser foundation hospitals d,fn.in other words,w hen an accused is charged with an offense defined in terms subject to two reasonable constructions,the construction favorable to the defendant is ordinarily adopted.people malcolm,supra,at.such interpretation does not mean,however,that the language of the statute must be stretched and strained beyond the limitation of reason.citation.ibid.
therefore,w e must use a liberal and commonsense approach to ascertain if a particular act constitutes a vehicle burglary within the confines of penal code section.citation.this criminal statute is to be construed flexibly in light of the legislative objective to make it more serious to break into the interior sections of locked cars than merely stealing from them.citations.people allen,supra,th at,d.
the question of whether a car with locked doors and open windows should be considered locked for purposes of penal code section requires just such a approach.two cases have dealt specifically with this question.
in people malcolm,supra,d,the vehicle doors were locked,but a wind wing lock was broken,preventing the wind wing from being locked.id.at.the defendant pushed open the wind wing,reached in with his arm and unlocked the door,entered the car and removed items.ibid.the court held that f or all intents and purposes the car in question was locked.by mere happenstance,one wind wing was faulty and could not be tightly secured,thereby allowing the defendant to gain entrance into the car.we are convinced that the auto burglary statute should be construed flexibly with the principal objective of discouraging the social evil which that statute was designed to prevent.id.at,fn.omitted.
in people woods,supra,d,a police officer used his private vehicle as a decoy.id.at.he placed a coin purse and camera on the seat,locked the doors,and rolled one window down five and inches.ibid.the defendant walked by,reached in t
