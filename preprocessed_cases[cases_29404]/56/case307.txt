background 
in,a jury convicted rainey of first degree murder,committed during an attempted robbery and with personal use of a firearm.the trial court sentenced him to lwop under penal code section,subdivision b 
the facts as stated in our unpublished opinion affirming the judgment of conviction are as follows on halloween night,october,year old koupou saechao was twice shot in the back while in front of his aunt apartment building in north richmond.the aunt heard two gunshots,and then saechao came to the door and collapsed in her arms.saechao said a black guy shot him.saechao died four days later,on november.the police arrested year old appellant on november.appellant is african american.appellant initially denied involvement in the shooting,then said that he and year old donald tried to rob saechao and donald shot the victim when a patdown found nothing to steal.ultimately,after talking with his mother at the police station,appellant confessed that he was the one who shot saechao.when speaking to the police,appellant denied being a member of a gang,or participating in the shooting as a gang initiation.appellant trial defense was that he was guilty of no more than manslaughter or second degree murder because he shot the victim as part of a gang initiation,not a robbery,and suffers from developmental limitations that impede his ability to premeditate.people rainey,nonpub.opn.at pp.
at the sentencing hearing,the prosecutor stated the people would concede that the driving force of this action did appear to be donald however,rainey is the man who pulled the trigger.and i think it is extremely significant that he pulled the trigger twice.and it was that act and that act alone that resulted in the death of the victim in this case.defense counsel,on the other hand,argued the fact that there was somebody else as the driving force behind this crime is significant in that there was a crime of tremendous planning,premeditation,not a whole lot of thought on clyde rainey part that he did walk out onto those streets with the evil intent of killing somebody that night and his response is consistent with the problems that he had throughout his life that were almost never addressed,that he had remedial schooling,was placed in remedial schooling in the grade,that he was failing out of school,that he was developing a drug and alcohol problem,that he had severe learning disabilities and intellectual impairment,nobody ever addressed those issues.and it seems justice would be fully done if this young man was able to earn the opportunity to ask the parole board sometime in the future whether he been rehabilitated or not.
the trial court observed rainey had been under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court on many,many occasions.and while rainey may not have intended to go on a mission of killing that night,he knew when he was given a gun and knew what he was doing and he knew the danger involved.
on appeal,rainey argued the trial court erred in failing to order a competency hearing his waiver of his right to remain silent was unknowing his confession was coerced evidence of the surreptitious monitoring of his police station conversation with his mother was wrongly admitted the court erred in instructing the jury to report juror misconduct and the court erred in instructing the jury on the principles of when the doctrine was not specifically charged.people rainey,nonpub.opn.at.we rejected these claims,and affirmed the judgment.ibid.the california supreme court denied rainey petition for review on may.
on june,rainey filed the instant petition for writ of habeas corpus.we issued an order to show cause and granted his motion for appointment of counsel nunc pro tunc the attorney general filed a written return,and rainey thereafter filed a traverse.the parties declined to request oral argument.
discussion 
eighth amendment in juvenile context 
in roper simmons,d.roper,the unites states supreme court held imposing the death penalty on juvenile offenders older than years of age but younger than years,is cruel and unusual punishment precluded by the eighth amendment.in graham florida,d,graham,the high court extended the constitutional limitations on juvenile punishment,holding the eighth amendment forbids the sentence of life without parole for a juvenile offender who does not commit homicide.
most recently,in miller,the supreme court held any sentencing scheme that mandates life in prison without possibility of parole for juvenile offenders is also forbidden under the eighth amendment.miller,supra.at.the court reasoned graham and roper and our individualized sentencing cases alike teach that in imposing a state harshest penalties,a sentencer misses too much if he treats every child as an adult.to recap mandatory life without parole for a juvenile precludes consideration of his chronological age and its hallmark features among them,immaturity,impetuosity,and failure to appreciate risks and consequences.it prevents taking into account the family and home environment that surrounds him and from which he can not usually extricate himself no matter how brutal or dysfunctional.it neglects the circumstances of the homicide offense,including the extent of his participation in the conduct and the way familial and peer pressures may have affected him.indeed,it ignores that he might have been charged and convicted of a lesser offense if not for incompetencies associated with youth for example,his inability to deal with police officers or prosecutors including on a plea agreement or his incapacity to assist his own attorneys.citations.and finally,this mandatory punishment disregards the possibility of rehabilitation even when the circumstances most suggest it.id.at.
the court added,g iven all we have said in roper,graham,and this decision about children diminished culpability and heightened capacity for change,we think appropriate occasions for sentencing juveniles to this harshest possible penalty will be uncommon.that is especially so because of the great difficulty we noted in roper and graham of distinguishing at this early age between the juvenile offender whose crime reflects unfortunate yet transient immaturity,and the rare juvenile offender whose crime reflects irreparable corruption.citations.although we do not foreclose a sentencer ability to make that judgment in homicide cases,we require it to take into account how children are different,and how those differences counsel against irrevocably sentencing them to a lifetime in prison.miller,supra,at,italics added.
under california law,t he penalty for a defendant found guilty of murder in the first degree,in any case with one or more special circumstances found to be true,who was years of age or older and under the age of years at the time of the commission of the crime,shall be confinement in the state prison for lwop or,at the discretion of the court,years to life,subd.b.courts have interpreted section,subdivision b to mean lwop is the statutorily identified presumptive punishment for a or year old special circumstance murderer,unless the sentencing court,in the exercise of its discretion,finds good reason to impose the less severe sentence of years to life.people ybarra th,d people guinn th,d.
recently,california appellate courts have addressed direct appeals by juvenile offenders contending their lwop sentences under section,subdivision b,are unconstitutional under miller,and have reached differing dispositions.some courts have affirmed the lwop judgment,reasoning the record showed the trial court did not presumptively impose lwop,but rather exercised informed discretion in imposing that sentence.see,people gutierrez th,d,noting does not require a mandatory lwop sentence and vests sentencing courts with the discretion to sentence the defendant to a term of years to life with the possibility of parole,review granted,other courts have vacated the lwop sentence and remanded for resentencing,reasoning that in applying the judicially recognized presumption that lwop is the appropriate term for a or year old defendant,the sentencing court failed to exercise its discretion in the manner required by miller.see,people moffett th,d,review granted,people siackasorn th,d,review granted.
miller applies retroactively to cases on collateral review 
rainey seeks the benefit of miller by way of habeas relief.we therefore first address whether miller applies retroactively to cases on collateral review.
retroactivity is assessed under the test enunciated in teague lane d.teague.see in re gomez cal th,d,gomez applying teague and concluding cunningham california d.applied on collateral review to judgments final before it was decided but after blakely washington d.was decided.
in teague,the supreme court held that in general new constitutional rules of criminal procedure will not be applicable to those cases which have become final before the new rules are announced.citation.lambrix singletary.a holding constitutes a new rule within the meaning of teague if it breaks new ground,imposes a new obligation on the states or the federal government,or was not dictated by precedent existing at the time the defendant conviction became final.teague,supra,at emphasis in original.graham collins,d.
teague recognized two exceptions to the new rule principle the first exception permits the retroactive application of a new rule if the rule places a class of private conduct beyond the power of the state to proscribe citation,or addresses a substantive categorical guarante e accorded by the constitution,such as a rule prohibiting a certain category of punishment for a class of defendants because of their status or offense.citations.graham collins,supra,at.more recently,the high court has clarified that new rules falling within the first teague exception are more accurately characterized as substantive rules not subject to teague bar.schriro summerlin,fn.d.schriro beard banks,fn.d.same.in schriro,the court explained new substantive rules apply retroactively because they necessarily carry a significant risk that a defendant stands convicted of an act that the law does not make criminal or faces a punishment that the law can not impose upon him.schriro,supra,at.
the second exception to teague bar on retroactivity is for watershed rules of criminal procedure implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding.citations.beard banks,supra,at.the second teague exception is limited in scope and applies only to a small core of rules requiring observance of those procedures that are implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.citations.ibid.observing we have yet to find a new rule that falls under the second teague exception.
teague also made clear that if one petitioner gets the benefit of a new rule,then the rule should apply retroactively to others similarly situated,as any other approach would be inequitable.teague,supra,at.t he harm caused by the failure to treat similarly situated defendants alike can not be exaggerated such inequitable treatment hardly comports with the ideal of administration of justice with an even hand.citations.ibid.thus,the court stated it would simply refuse to announce a new rule in a given case unless the rule would be applied retroactively to the defendant in the case and to all others similarly situated.id.at implicit in the retroactivity approach we adopt today,is the principle that habeas corpus can not be used as a vehicle to create new constitutional rules of criminal procedure unless those rules would be applied retroactively to all defendants on collateral review through one of the two exceptions we have articulated.
in view of teague statement to the effect equal justice requires that when a new substantive rule is applied to a habeas petitioner in a case announcing the new rule,the rule must be applied retroactively to all who are similarly situated teague,supra,at,the procedural posture of miller,itself,supports its retroactive application.as the supreme court of iowa observed in state ragland iowa ragland,miller involved the companion case of jackson hobbs.see miller,at.at pp.miller was a direct appeal,but jackson involved a petition for habeas corpus brought after the conviction had been affirmed on direct appeal.see id.nevertheless,the supreme court specifically held the new rule applied not only to the defendant in miller,but also to the defendant in jackson on collateral review.see id.at.at,d at.the court directed that the defendant in jackson be given an individualized hearing.see id.there would have been no reason for the court to direct such an outcome if it did not view the miller rule as applying retroactively to cases on collateral review.we also recognize that the dissent in miller suggested the majority decision would invalidate other cases across the nation.see id.at.at,d at roberts,dissenting.again,the dissent would not have raised this concern if the court did not believe its holding applied to cases on collateral review.ragland,supra,at.
we agree with this analysis that the united states supreme court application of the rule announced in miller to the habeas petitioner in the companion case demonstrates the high court announced a new substantive rule of law and intended the rule to apply retroactively to all who are similarly situated.teague,supra,at.
this conclusion is bolstered by the fact decisions in both lines of cases miller relied on in announcing the bar on mandatory lwop sentences for juveniles have been applied with retroactive effect.see,in re sparks cir,noting the supreme court decision in atkins virginia d,barring the execution of the mentally retarded has been given retroactive effect,citation,as has the court decision in roper,barring the execution of juvenile offenders see also songer wainwright,noting that lockett ohio,d,fn.omitted t he eight and fourteenth amendments require that the sentencer not be precluded from considering,as a mitigating factor,any aspect of a defendant character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death has been given retroactive effect.the iowa supreme court made the same point in holding miller applied retroactively,stating the practical observation of the treatment of the underlying authority of miller is instructive.if a substantial portion of the authority used in miller has been applied retroactively,miller should logically receive the same treatment.ragland,supra,at.
furthermore,miller held the eighth amendment prohibits the imposition of an lwop sentence upon a juvenile offender unless the sentencing court considers the offender chronological age and its hallmark features among them,immaturity,impetuosity,and failure to appreciate risks and consequences,as well as the offender family and home environment and the circumstances of the homicide offense,including the extent of his participation in the conduct and the way familial and peer pressures may have affected him.miller,supra.at.thus,the miller rule constitutes a new substantive rule,and is not subject to teague retroactivity bar,because it prohibits a certain category of punishment lwop for a class of defendants juvenile offenders convicted of homicide because of their status chronological age and its hallmark features or offense.penry lynaugh,d,abrogated on other grounds by atkins virginia,supra.in short,the miller rule prohibiting the imposition of an lwop sentence on a juvenile offender absent a consideration of the juvenile chronological age and its hallmark features miller,supra.at pp.applies retroactively because it necessarily carr ies a significant risk that a defendant faces a punishment that the law can not impose upon him.schriro,supra,at.
we therefore conclude mil
