in this matter of first impression,we determine whether welfare and institutions code section further references are to this code unless stated otherwise,operative january,alters the method for determining the maximum term of confinement in the california youth authority cya.we find that,in light of the present language of section,the maximum term of a minor confinement must be discretionarily determined by the juvenile court based on the facts and circumstances placing the minor before the court,not to exceed the maximum time prescribed by adult sentencing law.
procedural and factual background 
minor carlos,the appellant,confronted the victim about a prior altercation.minor stabbed the victim and then pushed him into a nearby canal.minor fled.
the juvenile court adjudicated minor a ward of the court pursuant to section after minor admitted a felony violation of penal code section,subdivision a,assault with a deadly weapon.the court committed minor to a juvenile detention center for days and placed him on probation.
subsequently,minor missed probation appointments,dropped out of school,failed to obey the directives of his guardian,and admitted using drugs.a section supplemental petition alleged violation of probation.minor admitted the allegations of the supplemental petition.on march,he was committed to cya.the juvenile court set the maximum term of confinement at four years,based solely on the maximum term an adult would face.
discussion 
statutory history 
the california supreme court has provided this historical backdrop 
before,both adult and juvenile felons were subject to indeterminate systems which gave courts or administrative agencies broad discretion to set each individual term of confinement on the basis of various factors,including the circumstances of the offense and the offender progress toward rehabilitation.the adult authority was at least obliged to set an adult felon term within the prescribed range for his offense.citation.on the other hand,juvenile felons,whether convicted in adult court or adjudged wards under the juvenile court law,had no such limit upon the time in which they might be confined.once obtained,the juvenile court wardship jurisdiction ended only when the offender reached or years of age.a cya commitment,once imposed,could extend until those ages were attained,or a uniform minimum period of confinement was completed,whichever occurred later.see welf,people olivas cal d,fns.
in,the legislature replaced the prior adult sentencing scheme with a comprehensive new law,the dsa determinate sentencing act.this new scheme set a limited number of alternative prison terms of definite duration,usually an upper,middle,and lower term,for each category of felony.it further provided for augmentation of a felon prison term by specified periods if his individual offense involved one or more statutory enhancements.
at the heart of the dsa were penal code sections,subdivision a and,subdivision a.section,subdivision a stated the general rule that when sentencing a felon to prison,the court must impose either the upper,middle,or lower term provided for the offense at issue,plus any other additional term required or permitted by law in the individual case.section,subdivision a explained in detail how consecutive sentences for multiple offenses,including specific enhancements,should be computed.
the year also produced two related developments in the law pertaining to juvenile offenders.first,in people olivas,supra,cal d,the california supreme court held that one convicted of a misdemeanor committed between the ages of and would be deprived of equal protection if held in cya confinement for a period longer than the maximum jail term for the same offense.olivas was narrowly concerned with the unequal treatment of convicted misdemeanants on the sole basis of youth,but it raised concerns that any inequalities between the maximum confinements of youthful and adult offenders might be constitutionally suspect.
second,the legislature amended welfare and institutions code sections and in a manner which might satisfy such constitutional concerns.see in re aaron d.in deference to the different purposes of the laws governing adult and juvenile offenders,the legislature did not create a determinate confinement scheme for juvenile wards like that applicable to adult felons through the dsa.however,the amendments did provide for the first time that any juvenile court order for an offender physical confinement,or for his commitment to cya,must expressly be limited in duration to the maximum term of imprisonment italics added for an adult convicted of the same offense or offenses.stats,ch.
the following year,the legislature again amended welfare and institutions code section to define,for juvenile confinement purposes,the phrase maximum term of adult imprisonment.stats,ch.the amendment stated the flat basic rule that the maximum term of imprisonment is the longest of the three time periods,the upper,middle,and lower dsa terms set forth in penal code section,subdivision a plus enhancements which must be proven if pled.italics added.moreover,under the amendment,the maximum term of imprisonment applicable to an aggregate d period of commitment or confinement for multiple offenses must be computed in accordance with penal code section,subdivision a.s ection,subdivision a sets forth the dsa basic scheme for consecutive adult felony sentences.in re jovan cal th,d.
the obvious purpose of the and amendments to welfare and institutions code section was to treat adult and juvenile offenders on equal footing as far as the maximum duration of their incarceration is concerned.citation.in re jovan,supra,cal th at,d.
an adult convicted of an offense can not be committed to prison for the maximum determinate term without a finding of aggravating circumstances.on the other hand,a minor committing an identical offense found true by the juvenile court may be confined for the maximum term without any additional findings by the juvenile court without violating principles of equal protection.this is so because a dults convicted in the criminal courts and sentenced to prison and youths adjudged wards of the juvenile courts and committed to the youth authority are not similarly situated.in re eric cal d.
once committed to cya,the minor actual term is governed by cya guidelines,within the statutory maximum.minors most often do not serve their maximum terms,but the statutory maximum may affect both parole eligibility and the extent to which actual confinement may be prolonged for disciplinary reasons.in re jovan,supra,cal th at,d.
section,subdivision c provides in pertinent part that if the minor is removed from the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian as the result of an order of wardship made pursuant to section,the order shall specify that the minor may not be held in physical confinement for a period in excess of the maximum term of imprisonment which could be imposed upon an adult convicted of the offense or offenses which brought or continued the minor under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.this subdivision goes on to describe that the maximum term of confinement is to be determined pursuant to penal code section,subdivision a,but without regard to the provisions of subdivision b requiring the consideration of mitigating and aggravating factors,and without regard to time for good behavior.subdivision c of section goes on to define physical confinement to mean placement in a juvenile hall,ranch,camp,forestry camp or secure juvenile home pursuant to section,or in any institution operated by the youth authority.
section pertains to commitments to cya.prior to january,the second paragraph of this section provided a minor committed to the department of the youth authority may not be held in physical confinement for a period of time in excess of the maximum period of imprisonment which could be imposed upon an adult convicted of the offense or offenses which brought or continued the minor under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.nothing in this section limits the power of the youthful offender parole board to retain the minor on parole status for the period permitted by section.
present statute 
senate bill reg.sess.amended section,operative january.the former two paragraphs were designated as subdivision a and subdivision b.changes,not pertinent to our discussion,were made to the first paragraph subdivision a.the second paragraph was rewritten and became subdivision b.what gives rise to the present issue concerns the addition of the second sentence in subdivision b.
section,subdivision b,now reads a minor committed to the department of the youth authority may not be held in physical confinement for a period of time in excess of the maximum period of imprisonment which could be imposed upon an adult convicted of the offense or offenses which brought or continued the minor under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.a minor committed to the department of the youth authority also may not be held in physical confinement for a period of time in excess of the maximum term of physical confinement set by the court based upon the facts and circumstances of the matter or matters which brought or continued the minor under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court,which may not exceed the maximum period of adult confinement as determined pursuant to this section.this section does not limit the power of the youth authority board to retain the minor on parole status for the period permitted by section,subd.b,italics added.
minor here claims that the amendment to section,while retaining the rule that the maximum term of confinement in cya may not exceed the maximum period of imprisonment which could be imposed upon an adult convicted of the offense or offenses which brought or continued the minor under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court,now allows for the juvenile court to set a maximum term of confinement in cya less than the maximum term for an adult based on a consideration of the facts and circumstances of the matter or matters that brought the minor before the juvenile court.he argues that the juvenile court failed to exercise this newly authorized power and imposed the adult maximum term of confinement without considering the particulars of the minor and the offense.he further contends that he was committed pursuant to a lack of informed discretion,thereby prejudicing his right to due process under the united states and california constitutions.
the people argue that the amendment to section merely clarifies existing juvenile court law and does not authorize the trial court to set a maximum term of confinement to cya that is less than the adult maximum term of imprisonment.
in construing a statute,our role is to ascertain the legislature intent so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.citation.in determining intent,we must look first to the words of the statute because they are the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.citation.if the statutory language is clear and unambiguous,the plain meaning of the statute governs.citation.people lopez cal th,d.
the people claim that the juvenile court judge has only two areas of discretion in setting the maximum term of confinement the judge may declare a wobbler offense to be a misdemeanor or a felony,and the judge may decide whether to aggregate terms when there are multiple counts or multiple petitions,subd.c.relying on the rule of statutory construction that this court should avoid construing one section in a manner that renders another section superfluous or inoperative and the rule that this court should adopt a construction which avoids conflicts between different statutory provisions,the people argue that section requires that the maximum term of confinement must always be the longest term of imprisonment prescribed by law.the people contend that to allow the court to set a maximum term of confinement that is less than the maximum term of imprisonment for a similarly situated adult would nullify section.
we disagree.section requires that a court may not order that a minor be held in confinement in excess of the maximum term of imprisonment which could be imposed upon an adult.section sets the upper limit for a term of confinement in all cases.allowing a trial court to impose a maximum term of confinement below the maximum term of imprisonment which could be imposed upon an adult pursuant to section,subdivision b does not,as the people suggest,nullify the rule of section because setting a minor term somewhere below the maximum term of imprisonment for an adult does not violate section,subdivision c,which sets the outer limit for a period of confinement.
we note the people have not offered any reason why the earlier version of section needed clarification in this area,nor have we found any case law or other authorities raising an issue in this area that calls for clarification.
this court is required,to the extent possible,to avoid adopting an interpretation that renders words surplusage.people loeun cal th,d.we should,if possible,give the words their usual ordinary import and accord significance to every word or phrase in a statute.kane hurley th,d.
section directs the juvenile court to determine the maximum term of imprisonment.by choosing the longest period of incarceration applicable to an adult offender without regard to mitigating or aggravating circumstances.subd.c.section retains this requirement but also requires the court to particularly set a maximum term of physical confinement in cya based upon the facts and circumstance of the matter which brought the minor under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.facts and circumstances of the matter have absolutely no bearing on the question of the maximum term of imprisonment that is determined pursuant to section.under respondent interpretation,the juvenile court,although expressly directed to consider the facts and circumstances of the matter,would have no authority to impose anything but the maximum term of imprisonment,which is found without any consideration of individualized facts and circumstances.we find that to adopt respondent position would be to render the amendment to section surplusage.this is a course we choose not to follow.thus,the amendment to section clearly sets forth a method based on the facts and circumstances before the court of determining the maximum period of confinement in cya,while retaining the requirement that the term determined by the court may not exceed the maximum period of imprisonment as determined by section.
the amendment to section does not nullify the requirements of section.as our historical discussion sets forth,the requirement in section was adopted to avoid equal protection concerns.these concerns remain and require the maximum time limitation rules contained in section.
further evidence that the language added to section is much more than a clarification of earlier law is found in the amendments to section made as part of the same legislation,senate bill reg.sess.section,dealing with the powers of the youth authority board formerly the youthful offender parole board when a minor has been committed to cya,was substantially altered by senate bill.of importance to our discussion is former subdivision b,now contained in current subdivision a.
former section provided in pertinent part 
when a person has been committed to the youth authority,the youthful offender parole board may 
a permit him his liberty under supervision and upon such conditions as it believes best designed for the protection of the public.
b order his or her confinement under such conditions as it believes best designed for the protection of the public,except that a person committed to the youth authority pursuant to sections or may not be held in physical confinement for a total period of time in excess of the maximum period of imprisonment which could be imposed upon an adult convicted of the offense or offenses which brought the minor under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court,or which resulted in the commitment of the young adult to the youth authority.nothing in this subdivision limits the power of the board to retain the minor or the young adult on parole status for the period permitted by sections,and.italics added.
