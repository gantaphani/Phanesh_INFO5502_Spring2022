many children who become dependents of our juvenile courts remain so when they are,at least chronologically,no longer children.the juvenile court has discretion to retain jurisdiction over a dependent until he or she attains the age of years welf,section,subd.a but until recently the utility of doing so was limited by insufficient funds to assist nonminor dependents.this situation changed dramatically on january,when provisions of the california fostering connections to success act cfcs act or act assem.bill reg.sess.assem.bill reg.sess.became operative,allowing california to take advantage of federal funding for extended foster care benefits for certain nonminor dependents who were under an order of foster care placement when they turned et see.the question presented here is,under this new statutory scheme,what rules,standards and procedures apply when a juvenile court is asked to terminate jurisdiction over a nonminor dependent who was not under an order of foster care placement at the time she turned 
appellant shannon,after years of foster care,was returned to her mother home not long before her birthday and abandoned by her mother shortly after she turned.the alameda county social services agency agency asked the court to terminate dependency jurisdiction pursuant to section,subdivision c,which generally governs continued supervision of dependents in home placements and requires termination of jurisdiction unless the court finds that grounds for assumption of jurisdiction exist or will likely exist absent court supervision.shannon argued that section,as revised by the cfcs act,governs the termination issue for all dependents who have turned not,as argued by the agency,only section v nonminor dependents and requires the court to consider the best interests of the nonminor dependent in deciding whether to terminate jurisdiction.the trial court terminated jurisdiction,articulating its order under the section standard.we conclude that,except as otherwise specified in the statute,section applies to all nonminor dependents,and we remand for the trial court to reconsider termination of dependency jurisdiction under the appropriate standard.
dependency history 
shannon first became a juvenile dependent in,when she was years old.she and her three siblings were detained after their mother,hereafter mother was arrested and incarcerated when a large quantity of drugs was found in her home.after mother failure to comply with her case plan and a failed relative placement,the children were formally placed in foster care in august in july,mother reunification services were terminated in shannon case.
between august and may,shannon lived in a series of foster homes and briefly with her maternal grandmother.she had a series of permanent plans of foster care,initially with a goal of return home and later with goals of adoption or guardianship.on several occasions,shannon foster parents or grandmother requested her removal due to behavioral issues or shannon ran away from her placements.all plans for adoption and guardianship fell through.beginning in may,shannon permanent plans anticipated emancipation and independent living.a transitional independent living plan was prepared and repeatedly updated,and she was referred to independent living skill classes.shannon was diagnosed with depression and other mental disorders,and she took prescription psychotropic drugs and attended individual therapy.
throughout this period,mother continued to have problems with drug use and criminal violations,but she maintained contact with shannon.their continuing relationship seemed to interfere with shannon ability to form bonds with other adults.in july,the court authorized visits with mother and modified shannon permanent plan to include a goal of returning her to mother care.a september report,however,stated that mother had not cooperated with the agency attempts to investigate the background of her roommates,and later permanent plans anticipated shannon emancipation and independent living.
in may,shannon petitioned to change her permanent plan from foster care to reunification with mother.the petition stated mother has been clean and sober for at least years,has completed treatment,has one of her younger daughters in her care,now has stable housing that can provide suitable space for shannon,and wishes to provide full time care for shannon.shannon is spending a substantial amount of time with her mother and wishes to reunify with her mother.the court authorized a day trial home visit and referred mother and shannon for family therapy.in june,on the agency recommendation,the court returned shannon to mother home with family maintenance services because the day visit had gone well.shannon birthday was in september.
in november,the agency filed a status review report that recommended dismissal of dependency jurisdiction over shannon.the agency reported that shannon had been living in mother home since june.m other has reported that since the return of shannon to the home,there have been several verbal arguments between her and shannon wherein shannon has chosen to leave home and take respite at her friend home however,mother reports that she is always willing to have shannon in her home.the agency noted that mother has provided shannon with shelter and food and opined,there appears to be no detriment to dismissal at this time as the items on the petition are no longer true and shannon has reached the age of majority.shannon objected to the recommendation of dismissal and the court set a contested hearing for january.
in december,the agency asked the court to issue a protective custody warrant for shannon because mother had been arrested and later released on or about and is believed to be fleeing from the law.the residence of mother is vacated and her whereabouts are unknown.shannon was residing with her maternal great aunt,who as of kicked her out of the home t he aunt has stated that shannon is probably with some friends.the aunt does not know the whereabouts of the minor friend.the court issued the warrant.shannon appeared in court on january,and the warrant was withdrawn.
at the january,hearing,shannon counsel reported that shannon had none of the required documents that normally must be obtained before jurisdiction is terminated.the agency agreed to provide the former section see stats,ch,documents and the court set a hearing for january to review the agency progress doing so at hearings held on january,february,and april and in a june report,the court received updates on the collection of those documents,shannon application for medical benefits,high school graduation,referrals to transitional housing and other independent living services,and arrangements to remove shannon braces 
on june,shannon filed a written objection to the dismissal of jurisdiction and petitioned the court to maintain jurisdiction.citing in re robert th,robert,in re holly th,holly,and in re tamika th,tamika,she argued that the court could terminate her dependency jurisdiction only if the agency established that termination was in her best interest.shannon argued termination of jurisdiction was not in her best interest because she was in immediate need of support services from the a gency including mental health services,transportation assistance,and housing.shannon stated she was destitute and had been essentially homeless since before she turned.at an august hearing,she argued her situation was not typical of dependents under a family maintenance plan subject to review under section shannon has had to do so many things on her own that she would have had to do if she was actually in a functioning family maintenance situation t he statutes that are designed to help minors transition into adulthood are the statutes that the court should use in determining whether it is appropriate to dismiss her case.the best interest of the child is always at play in these cases 
the agency argued that section applied and there was no legal justification for continued jurisdiction over shannon under that statute c onditions do not exist which would justify initial assumption of jurisdiction,and are not likely to exist if supervision is withdrawn.this is the standard used to dismiss juvenile court jurisdiction under a family maintenance order,and thus the standard that should be relied upon by this court.the agency argued that section did not apply because shannon was not under a foster care placement order when she turned and thus was not eligible to become a nonminor dependent under section et.at the august,hearing,the agency further argued,the dependency statutes were not enacted to make sure that every child receive all of the benefits that some children receive i get that shannon is having trouble with transportation and places to stay and in her foreseeable future she wo have the therapist that she has had a relationship with.all of that does not mean,though,this court is to maintain its jurisdiction.
the court ruled for all of the reasons set forth in the agency trial brief and all of the arguments by the agency,which the court agrees with,that c onditions do not exist which would justify initial assumption of jurisdiction under section and are not likely to exist if supervision is withdrawn.the court terminated dependency jurisdiction over shannon.
ii.discussion 
legal standards governing termination of dependency jurisdiction 
the primary issue on appeal is which legal standard governed the juvenile court decision to terminate or continue jurisdiction over shannon at the august hearing,when she was formally under an order placing her in mother care and had already turned.we review this legal question de novo.ghirardo antonioli cal th.while a termination decision is usually reviewed for abuse of discretion robert,supra,th at,a court abuses its discretion when it applies incorrect legal standards flannery california highway patrol th.
shannon argues the court erred in applying the section legal standard.we agree.
invited error 
as a preliminary matter,we reject the agency argument that the trial court reliance on section was invited error.t he doctrine of invited error applies where a party,for tactical reasons,persuades the trial court to follow a particular procedure.the party is estopped from claiming that the procedure was unlawful.citations.in re jamie th.
the agency draws our attention to a form joint contested hearing statement that the parties filed in november,nine months before the hearing under review.in the statement,the parties identified the contested hearing as a section hearing and identified the disputed factual issues as conditions that gave rise to jurisdiction still exist continued supervision is necessary,which paraphrases the section standard.in june,however,when shannon formally objected to dismissal of jurisdiction and petitioned the court to maintain jurisdiction,she cited section and robert,supra,th,and she argued the best interest of the child standard governed the court decision whether to terminate jurisdiction.the agency argued in response that the legal standard was set by section and that section and the robert rationale did not apply,but the agency did not argue that shannon was estopped from disputing application of the section standard because of the joint contested hearing statement.again at the august hearing,shannon counsel argued the controlling legal standard was section and the best interest of the child,and the agency argued the controlling standard was section,without arguing estoppel.at the conclusion of the hearing,the court resolved the parties legal dispute in favor of applying the section standard and expressly adopted the arguments made by the agency in its briefing and at the hearing.
in sum,while shannon was dilatory in raising her argument that dependency jurisdiction could be continued in her case under section,nothing in the record indicates that she withheld the argument for a tactical reason,and the agency never urged estoppel in the trial court.moreover,there is no evidence of prejudice due to shannon delay by the time of the august hearing,the agency and the court were well aware that the governing legal standard was a disputed legal issue and that shannon contended section did not control.the agency had ample opportunity to dispute shannon legal position,and the court expressly resolved the legal dispute in the agency favor.there was no invited error.
termination of jurisdiction unrelated to dependent minor status 
turning now to the primary legal issue in this case,we review the distinct legal standards that govern a termination of jurisdiction for reasons independent of the minority status of a dependent child and b termination of jurisdiction because the dependent has reached the age of majority.
before the juvenile dependency statutes were substantially revised in and again in see in re marilyn cal th,dependency jurisdiction did not terminate before age unless a party established that supervision was no longer needed.t he juvenile court having properly asserted its jurisdiction the minor became subject thereto and the court jurisdiction continues until he reaches years of age or until the juvenile court becomes convinced on the evidence that the protection of the minor no longer requires supervision slevats feustal d,at which time it is the duty of the juvenile court to dismiss the proceedings.in re syson d.t he burden was on the person seeking a termination of the court jurisdiction to show cause,if he has cause,why the jurisdiction of the court over the minor should be terminated.former in re robinson d.in re francecisco d.
under the dependency scheme enacted in the,the standard for terminating dependency jurisdiction varies depending on the stage of the proceeding.in the early stages of a case,when services are being provided to the dependent child parents,there is a statutory presumption in favor of terminating jurisdiction and returning the children to the parents care without court supervision.under section,for example,when dependents are in the offending parent or parents care either because they were never removed or because they were removed and returned home,the court shall terminate its jurisdiction unless the social worker or his or her department establishes by a preponderance of evidence that the conditions still exist which would justify initial assumption of jurisdiction under section,or that those conditions are likely to exist if supervisions is withdrawn,subd.c italics added see bridget superior court th,applies where dependent returned home after an placement in re th,same in re gabriel th,same.similarly,under section,when dependents have been removed from their parents care but the parents are receiving reunification services,the court shall order the return of the child to the physical custody of his or her parent or legal guardian at the status review hearing unless the court finds,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the return of the child to his or her parent or legal guardian would create a substantial risk of detriment to the safety,protection,or physical or emotional of the child.the social worker shall have the burden of establishing that detriment,subds.e,f,italics added see in re marilyn,supra,cal th at at each review hearing prior to permanency planning,there is a statutory presumption that the child will be returned to parental custody.if the dependent is returned to the parent care under section,section governs at the next review hearing and,as noted ante,jurisdiction must be terminated unless the court makes the required finding.
after the parents services are terminated or if services have been denied,the case proceeds to permanency planning and the termination standards change.see in re marilyn,supra,cal th at o nce reunification services are ordered terminated,the focus shifts to the needs of the child for permanency and stability.at permanency planning,three general options are available to the court termination of parental rights and placement for adoption appointment of a relative or nonrelative as legal guardian for the dependent and placement in foster care,subd.b.if adoption is chosen,the court terminates its dependency jurisdiction once the adoption is completed,subd.a.if guardianship is chosen,the court must retain jurisdiction until the guardianship is established and may retain dependency jurisdiction during the guardianship with some restrictions on the court discretion in the case of relative guardianships.ibid.if foster care is chosen,the court dependency jurisdiction continues,subd.b,subd.d.
termination of jurisdiction related to dependent minor status 
dependency jurisdiction does not automatically terminate at age see in re th,and the decision to retain or terminate jurisdiction generally remains within the sound discretion of the juvenile court holly,supra,th at.since,the juvenile dependency scheme has specifically provided that t he court may retain jurisdiction over any person who is found to be a ward or a dependent child of the juvenile court until the ward or dependent child attains the age of years,subd.a see former,added by stats,ch,seiser kumli,cal.juvenile courts practice and procedure a at seiser kumli dependency jurisdiction ceases by operation of law when the dependent reaches the age of.before the dependency scheme was overhauled in the,case law indicated that the standard for terminating dependency jurisdiction did not vary based on the dependent age up to age jurisdiction continued unless a party proved there was no continuing need for supervision.see in re francecisco,supra,d at.
under the dependency scheme as enacted in the and before the enactment of former section in,there was little statutory guidance on how a court should exercise its discretion under section,and we can identify only one published decision that addressed the issue,robert,supra,th.see holly,supra,th at citing robert as only published decision on subject.dependents robert and michelle were placed with their grandparents in foster care so that the grandparents could receive monthly foster care benefits allowing them to care for the children.at a review hearing after both robert and michelle were past the age of majority and attending college,a social worker recommended termination of dependency jurisdiction in light of their success.the trial court instead continued jurisdiction over robert and michelle to help defray educational and living expenses and ensure continued medical coverage.robert,at pp.the trial court found that continued jurisdiction is necessary because conditions exist which justify jurisdiction under sections and,subdivision c.id.at.observing first that section had no application in the context of a foster home placement and that the court does not review the original basis for exercise of jurisdiction under in that setting,the court of appeal held that,absent any evidence of current or future threatened harm to the dependent,the juvenile court abused its discretion in extending jurisdiction.id.at pp.applying section,the court held that t his section declares what case law had previously determined that exercise of jurisdiction must be based upon existing and reasonably foreseeable future harm to the welfare of the child.citation.similar factors should come into play in determining whether jurisdiction should extend beyond the age of majority.robert,at.courts at the time,however,rarely continued jurisdiction past age due in part to the termination of federal funding for foster youth at age.see holly,supra,th at tamika,supra,th at fn.in re th.
former section 
in,the legislature enacted former section,which established procedural prerequisites to the termination of dependency jurisdiction at or after age.former,as enacted by stats,ch.the statute required agencies to provide dependents turning identification,a social security card,and other documents,and to help the dependents obtain health insurance,housing and admission to postsecondary schools or training programs.former,subd.b.the statute expressly allowed the court to continue jurisdiction if these procedural requirements had not been fulfilled as well as for other reasons.former,subd.c see holly,supra,th at pp.in holly,another division of this court held that the robert standard continued to govern the court discretion to continue jurisdiction for those other reasons.holly,at pp.two other cases have followed holly,holding dependency jurisdiction over a dependent who turns should continue unless it was proved that the dependent would face no existing or foreseeable risk of harm absent the supervision of the court,termination would be in the best interest of the dependent.see tamika,supra,th at,in re,supra,th at pp.addressing motion to reinstate dependency jurisdiction under,subd.b,for child in legal guardianship.although the dependents in each of these cases were either in foster care or under a guardianship at the time they turned,nothing in the language or reasoning of these cases suggests that,as the agency argues,the standard adopted in the cases applied only to dependents in such placements.in our view,the case law establishes that under former section the standard for terminating dependency jurisdiction at age was whether termination was in the best interest of the dependent,whether there was an existing or foreseeable risk of harm to the dependent if jurisdiction were terminated.
c.the cfcs act 
as noted ante,the cfcs act amended section et to take advantage of newly available federal benefits for certain dependent children who are under an order of foster care placement when they turn.see,supra,th at,subd.a.for purposes of the section et statutory scheme,section v defines a nonminor dependent as relevant here and referred to as a section v nonminor dependent as a foster child who is a current dependent child and who satisfies all of the following criteria he or she has attained years of age while under an order of foster care placement by the juvenile court,and is not more than years of age on or after january,he or she is in foster care he or she is participating in a transitional independent living case plan as described in section.italics added.section in turn specifies that the nonminor dependent must be employed or participating in an educational or training program or have a medical condition that prevents him or her from doing so,subd.b hereafter b.
the act also revised or added several statutes that govern termination or continuation of dependency jurisdiction at age and planning hearings for dependents for whom jurisdiction is continued past age.see,stats,ch,stats,ch,welf.the parties dispute the effect of these statutory changes on the trial court power or discretion to continue or terminate dependency jurisdiction over dependents who do not potentially qualify as section v nonminor dependents shannon argues that revised section applies to all nonminor dependents.we agree.
changes to section 
although the act amended section,that statute still provides that t he court may retain jurisdiction over any person who is found to be a ward or a dependent child of the juvenile court until the ward or dependent child attains the age of years,subd.a,italics added.section,subdivision b now further provides that o n and after january,the court shall have within its jurisdiction any nonminor dependent,as defined in section v,either general or dependency jurisdiction.italics added.section,subdivision b,therefore,is limited to section v nonminor dependents,whereas subdivision a of section is not.
section,subdivision c provides that a nonminor who exited foster care at or after age may,until age,petition the court to resume dependency jurisdiction over him or her pursuant to section,subdivision e hereafter section e,and the latter statute provides that a nonminor who attained years of age while subject to an order for foster care placement and whose dependency jurisdiction was terminated pursuant to section may,until age,petition for reinstatement of dependency jurisdiction.to qualify for such reinstatement,the nonminor must demonstrate he or she intends to satisfy the requirements of section b,subd.e ii,a iv.that is,the nonminor must demonstrate he or she is potentially eligible for section v nonminor dependent status.thus,section,subdivision c applies to potential section v nonminor dependents 
in sum,revised section,subdivision a allows the court to continue its jurisdiction over any nonminor dependent until age section,subdivision b requires the court to maintain at least general jurisdiction over a section v nonminor dependent until age and section,subdivision c and section e allow potential section v nonminor dependents to petition for resumption of dependency jurisdiction until age.
changes to section 
section establishes requirements for termination hearings the statute variously includes references to a nonminor,dependent nonminor,nonminor dependent,as defined in section b,and nonminor dependent as described in section v.the agency argues that the overall statutory scheme indicates that all nonminor and dependent nonminor references in section are implicitly if not explicitly limited to section v nonminor dependents.in opposition,shannon invokes the canon of statutory interpretation that w here different words or phrases are used in the same connection in different parts of a statute,it is presumed the legislature intended a different meaning.citation.briggs eden council for hope opportunity cal th.again,we agree with shannon.
section as revised by the cfcs act has six relevant subdivisions,each of which is applicable to a specified class of nonminor dependents.section,subdivision a applies to a nonminor without qualification and provides that a dependency court may not terminate jurisdiction unless a hearing is conducted pursuant to the section.subdivision a would therefore at least facially apply to all nonminor dependents,whether or not in foster care.
section,subdivision b again applies to a nonminor without qualification and provides that at any hearing to determine whether to terminate jurisdiction,the court must follow certain procedures.again,dependents subject to this subdivision necessarily are nonminor dependents.the further subparagraphs within subdivision b repeatedly refer to the dependent nonminor or the nonminor,referencing the nonminor who is the subject of the termination hearing,any nonminor who is subject to a termination hearing.
the agency argues that certain provisions in section,subdivisions b and b,necessarily imply that subdivision b applies only to section v nonminor dependents.we disagree.section,subdivision b requires child welfare departments to submit a report on whether continuing dependency jurisdiction is in the nonminor best interest and,if it recommends continued jurisdiction,to include in the report a transitional independent living case plan for the nonminor.the agency notes that section defines transitional independent living case plan as a plan that is applicable only to section v nonminor dependents,subd.y hereafter y.however,we reject the agency argument that the entire subdivision must,therefore,apply only to section v nonminor dependents.first,section definitions do not apply to the entire cfcs act,as agency incorrectly contends.they apply only to the article that contains section,which does not include section.for the purposes of this article,the following definitions shall apply see statutes comprising of welf,div,part,ch.second,even if we were to assume that the section y definition controlled the meaning of transitional independent living case plan in section,we would agree with shannon that the statutory scheme is better harmonized by construing this language to mean that the report must include the case plan if applicable.see in re th,construing cfcs act to permit appointment of successor guardian when guardian for nonminor dependent dies after dependent turned to avoid conflict with statutory purpose.otherwise,there would be no distinction between the nonminor referenced in section,subdivision b and the nonminor who meets the definition of a nonminor dependent as described in section v in section,subdivision c,contrary to the canon of statutory interpretation that different terms in the same statute are presumed to have different meanings 
section,subdivision b requires an agency that is recommending termination of jurisdiction to assist the nonminor in meeting or maintaining eligibility for section v nonminor dependent status,specifically by meeting the requirements of section b.the agency argues that this provision necessarily implies that section,subdivision b applies only to section v nonminor dependents.particularly in light of the fact that section,subdivision a does not limit the nonminor s entitled to a termination hearing,we conclude a more natural reading of the statute is that,for every dependent facing possible termination of jurisdiction at age,the child welfare department must prepare a report on the termination issue and include information relevant to whether the dependent can establish eligibility for extended foster care payments under section et 
in sum,despite references to the section et statutory scheme,we conclude that section,subdivision b,by its plain language,applies to any nonminor dependent facing a termination hearing.
section,subdivision c expressly applies to a nonminor who meets the definition of a nonminor dependent as described in section v and requires the court to continue jurisdiction unless it makes certain findings,subd.c.the plain language of this subdivision indicates it applies only to section v nonminor dependents,and later references to the nonminor clearly referring back to the section v nonminor dependent who is the subject of subdivision c.
section,subdivision d applies to a nonminor who can not be located and allows the court to terminate dependency jurisdiction but requires it to maintain general jurisdiction until the nonminor reaches the age of.again,the plain language of this subdivision indicates it applies only to a subset of nonminor dependents,those who can not be located,and subsequent references to the nonminor in the subdivision refer back to a nonminor within this subset.the last sentence of section,subdivision d a nonminor may petition the court pursuant to subdivision e of section to resume dependency jurisdiction at any time before attaining years of age appears to refer to a nonminor without qualification,but as noted ante the provisions of section e apply only to nonminors who are potentially eligible for status as section v nonminor dependents.the reference to section e in this subdivision of section makes sense because nonminors who could not be located when they turned are likely beneficiaries of section e.we reject the agency argument that the reference to section e supports its position that section applies exclusively to section v nonminor dependents.
section,subdivision e applies to a nonminor dependent who has attained years of age,any nonminor dependent and requires,before dependency jurisdiction is terminated,that the social services department provide certain documents and assistance to the minor or,in the case of a nonminor dependent who can not be located,verify that efforts were made to make the documents and assistance available to the nonminor.this subdivision incorporates the main procedural requirements of former section repeated references to the nonminor in the further subparagraphs of subdivision e are clear references to the nonminor dependent who is the subject of the subdivision,any nonminor dependent 
section,subdivision f requires the department to report its progress in completing the subdivision e requirements at the hearing closest to and before a dependent minor birthday and at every review hearing thereafter for nonminors,without qualification.because the nonminors at issue are subject to review hearings,they are necessarily nonminor dependents.we construe the latter part of this subdivision to apply all nonminor dependents without qualification.
in sum,the plain language of section indicates that the statute applies to all nonminor dependents,with the exception of subdivisions c and d,which are applicable to specific subsets of nonminor dependents for nonminor dependents who do not fall within one of those subsets,section requires the court to hold a hearing before terminating dependency jurisdiction,subds.a,b requires the department to verify that it provided the nonminor dependent with certain documents and assistance,subds.b,b,e,f,and requires the department to ensure the nonminor dependent presence at the hearing if possible,subd.b and report on whether it is in the nonminor best interests to remain under the court dependency jurisdiction,subd.b.this best interest standard suggests that the legal standard set forth in the robert,supra,th line of cases continues to govern the determination whether to terminate dependency jurisdiction for nonminors who do not fall within section v.
our interpretation is supported by court rules adopted by the judicial council to implement the cfcs act.california rules of court,rule which became effective july,applies to termination hearings for a nonminor dependent as defined in section v and a dependent of the juvenile court who is years of age or older and subject to an order for a foster care placement.rule a a,b.notably,rule indirectly recognizes that nonminor dependents who are not in foster care even when they turn might be eligible for a continuation of dependency jurisdiction nothing in the welfare and institutions code or the california rules of court restricts the ability of the juvenile court to maintain dependency jurisdiction or delinquency jurisdiction over a person,years of age or older,who does not meet the eligibility requirements for status as a nonminor dependent and to proceed as to that person under the relevant sections of the welfare and institutions code and california rules of court.rule a.
our interpretation is also consistent with the description of the cfcs act in a leading treatise on california juvenile law.seiser kumli,supra,to.the edition of the treatise includes three sections on terminating jurisdiction when child reaches age of majority existing law,extended foster care,and emancipation.id.at,to.the extended foster care section addresses continued jurisdiction for section v nonminor dependents.seiser kumli,at b,to see also id.at,to.the emancipation section addresses emancipation petitions filed pursuant to family code,section et and is not relevant here.seiser kumli,at c.the existing law section addresses continued jurisdiction for children aging out of the system who do not qualify for or want to participate in programs for nonminor dependents.seiser kumli,at a.in context,it is clear that the treatise existing law discussion applies to dependents turning who are not potential section v nonminor dependents.for such dependents,the treatise explains,the juvenile court may,in an appropriate case,maintain dependency over a child who has reached the age of majority,but not yet reached the age of years if the child has reached the age of majority,the child should be present at any hearing to terminate dependency jurisdiction at the hearing the agency must submit a report verifying section,subdivision e information,documents,and services have been provided to the child the burden of proof is with the agency when it is seeking to terminate dependency jurisdiction for a dependent child who has turned years of age i t must show termination of dependency jurisdiction is in the child best interest.tamika,supra,th at pp.seiser kumli,at a,to.thus,the treatise recognizes that jurisdiction may be continued beyond age for a dependent who is not an actual or potential section v nonminor dependent,and that the robert,supra,th best interest standard governs the termination decision in that context.
while the primary legislative focus of the cfcs act was clearly on making continued services and benefits available to juvenile court dependents in foster care who would otherwise age out of the system,we find nothing in the statutory scheme that withdraws the court preexisting power to extend dependency jurisdiction for nonminor dependents generally.significantly,a lack of federal funding to support the cost of providing services beyond age is not a proper basis for termination of dependency jurisdiction.see tamika,supra,th at fn,holding court erred by terminating jurisdiction in the absence of unusual circumstances so as to spare the agency the cost of extended foster care without federal financial assistance effective june,extending benefits to nonminor dependents or former dependents who received aid during and turned in,even if the county has provided aid using funds.we reject the agency argument that under section the court has no discretion to extend dependency jurisdiction to such nonminor dependents.
termination of jurisdiction in shannon case 
the agency argues that,even if section governed the decision whether to continue shannon dependency jurisdiction beyond age,the judgment should be affirmed because the trial court knew it had discretion to continue jurisdiction,exercised that discretion in terminating jurisdiction,and did not abuse its discretion in doing so.the record is at best ambiguous on these points.it is true that the evidence presented at the august hearing related primarily to shannon ability to obtain housing,health care,higher education,and financial assistance as a young adult facts relevant to termination of jurisdiction under rather than to mother availability and ability to support shannon at the time shannon turned or at the time of the hearing facts relevant to termination of jurisdiction under.moreover,the court repeated continuances of the termination hearing,which effectively continued dependency jurisdiction over shannon for several months,were based on matters relevant to section termination of jurisdiction the need to provide shannon with documentation and assistance in her transition to independent living.see,subd.e.on the other hand,the agency argued in its brief and throughout the hearing that only section was relevant,and the court articulated its decision under the section standard.we can not confidently conclude that the court understood and exercised its discretion under a section standard that the agency repeatedly urged the court to reject.
the agency also argues that the termination of shannon jurisdiction was harmless rendering a remand unnecessary because shannon was statutorily ineligible for the specific services she primarily cited in support of her request for continued jurisdiction,therapy and case management services through a particular clinic.there was evidence that these services would be covered by medical only if she was a section v nonminor dependent.although shannon appeared not to be eligible for federally supported extended foster care benefits but see extending certain services for persons who turned in,the absence of such eligibility is not an absolute bar to continuation of jurisdiction.see tamika,supra,th at fn,error to terminate jurisdiction due to lack of federal funding.in her reply brief,shannon notes that she continued to receive such services after she had turned and before the court terminated jurisdiction,and she suggests that other services may become available to her if jurisdiction were continued.on this record,we can not conclude that the court reliance on the wrong legal standard when it terminated jurisdiction over shannon was harmless.
iii.disposition 
the order terminating jurisdiction over shannon is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed in this opinion.
all statutory references are to the welfare and institutions code unless otherwise indicated.
for the purposes of this opinion,nonminor dependents are all persons who have reached the age of majority and over whom the juvenile court has dependency jurisdiction.as will be discussed post,the subset of nonminor dependents who are eligible,or potentially eligible,for extended foster care benefits as described in section,subdivision v section v are referred to as section v nonminor dependents.
shannon father had abandoned the family and his whereabouts were unknown.
at the january,hearing,shannon counsel said,we are not contesting the dismissal once those documents that are required are provided.the agency,however,did not argue in the trial court and does not argue on appeal that shannon thereby waived her argument that jurisdiction should have been continued even after the documents were provided.
