background 
a.the sij statute 
the immigration act of,codified at title united states code section,sets forth a procedure for classification of certain aliens as special immigrants who have been declared dependent on a juvenile court.superior court th.congress created this classification to protect abused,neglected,and abandoned unaccompanied minors through a process that allows them to become permanent legal residents.citation.a minor who obtains sij status may become a naturalized united states citizen after five years.citation.in re th,see a.
in,as a result of congressional concern that visiting students were abusing the sij process,and amended the sij statute to limit the beneficiaries of this provision to those juveniles for whom it was created,namely abandoned,neglected,or abused children citation.perez olano gonzalez,fn.that amendment required a state court determine whether a minor seeking sij status was eligible for foster care due to abuse,neglect,or abandonment and a dependent of a juvenile court or committed or placed with a state agency.see eddie superior court th.at issue here is an amendment to the sij statute under the william wilberforce trafficking victims protection reauthorization act of tvpra,d,stat.tvpra replaced the requirement of foster care eligibility with a requirement that reunification with or both parents not be viable due to abuse,neglect,abandonment.tvpra also made minors who had been placed in the custody of an individual or entity appointed by a state court eligible for sij status.eddie,at.as a result of the removal of the foster care requirement,state courts may now make sij status findings whenever jurisdiction can be exercised under state law to make care and custody determinations,and are no longer confined to child protection proceedings alone.citation.leslie superior court th,leslie.
while the federal government has exclusive jurisdiction with respect to immigration citations,state juvenile courts play an important and indispensable role in the sij application process.citation.under section a j and its implementing regulations codified at code of federal regulations part,state juvenile courts are charged with making a preliminary determination of the child dependency and his or her best interests,which is a prerequisite to an application to adjust status as a special immigrant juvenile.the sij statute affirms the institutional competence of state courts as the appropriate forum for child welfare determinations regarding abuse,neglect,or abandonment,and a child best interests citations.citation.leslie,supra,th at,quoting in re mario,mario.
the predicate state trial court findings now required under the sij statute,as revised by tvpra,are that the minor is dependent upon a juvenile court or committed to,or placed under the custody of,a state entity or other individual or entity the minor can not be reunified with one or both parents due to abuse,neglect,abandonment or a similar basis found under state law,and it is not in the minor best interest to be returned to his or her country of origin.a j see also c.a superior court with jurisdiction to make child custody determinations under california law has the authority and duty to make sij status findings if the evidence before it supports those findings.superior court,supra,th at code civ,subds.a,b.after a state court makes sij status findings,the minor must include that order in his or her sij petition to the department of homeland security.see a j iii d.
procedural history 
in the trial court 
pursuant to a plea agreement,israel admitted a misdemeanor violation of receiving stolen property,subd.a.the underlying facts are not relevant to the narrow issue of law before us at the february,disposition hearing,the court declared wardship and returned israel to his mother home,subject to conditions of probation.at the time of disposition,israel requested that the court make sij status findings.in a declaration submitted with his request,israel stated that he was born in mexico in,came to the united states in with his older brother,and lived in alameda county with his mother.he also asserted that he had no memory of his father,who continued to live in mexico he had only very limited telephone contact with his father his family had not received any physical or emotional support from his father and his care in mexico before coming to the united states had been provided by a grandmother who passed away in january.israel said he would have no place to live if he were returned to mexico and his father would not provide for him.the court requested additional briefing,focused on questions not at issue here.
at a hearing on may,the trial court considered the briefing submitted and the argument of counsel the court found that israel father,who remained in mexico,had abandoned him.however,relying largely on a decision of the nebraska supreme court in re erick erick,the trial court interpreted the or both language of section a j as prohibiting sij status findings if return to a custodial parent remained feasible.
israel and amici curiae argue that section a j provides for sij status findings if reunification with either parent is not viable due to abuse,neglect or abandonment.the parties agree that no reported california decision has yet addressed this issue.
the people initially argued in support of the trial court statutory interpretation,contending that section a j was ambiguous as the nebraska supreme court found in erick,and that the legislative history failed to support israel contention that inability to reunify with either parent would trigger sij status eligibility.however,by letter to this court,dated december,the people withdrew their argument,citing,among other things,materials posted on the uscis web site stating that residence in the united states with a nonabusive parent would not disqualify a minor from sij status consideration.the people now take the position that it would be inappropriate for a state attorney general to urge an interpretation of federal immigration policy in a manner that would contradict with information provided by the federal agency tasked with enforcing such policy.
in response to the people letter,israel moved on december,for summary reversal.although this court has the power to entertain a motion for reversal in an appropriate case people browning d,we did not find this to be such a case and denied the motion.as discussed post,the trial court interpretation of the sij statute was not patently unreasonable in the first instance and summary reversal would have abdicated our responsibility to provide de novo analysis of what appears to be a potentially significant and recurring issue of first impression 
ii.discussion 
we deal only with a question of proper interpretation of the current sij statute,specifically the meaning of the statute or both language.where the question presented is one of statutory interpretation on undisputed facts,our review is de novo.shirey los angeles county civil service com.th.
a reviewing court fundamental task in construing a statute is to determine the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the statute.courts begin this task by scrutinizing the actual words of the statute,giving them their usual,ordi
