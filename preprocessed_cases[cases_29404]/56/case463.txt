the minor,ramon,has been before the juvenile court on nine separate petitions.the most recent petition resulted in a sentence in custody.ramon argues that the court should have ordered him to serve the commitment in a juvenile facility rather than county jail.while this issue is moot,at the request of the parties and because it is likely to recur,we shall opine on it before dismissing this part of the appeal.
ramon further claims that as to prior adjudications,the court failed to declare on the record whether the offenses were felonies or misdemeanors,and while this is purely a technical error,this argument has merit.with the exception of one provision,which we shall order slightly modified,we reject his final claim regarding his probation terms.we therefore affirm the court orders,but remand for the limited purpose of declaring on the record whether the prior adjudications were felonies or misdemeanors.
ramon ramon was years old in october.on october,a first amended petition was filed,alleging that ramon committed criminal threats,count one aggravated assault,subd.a,count two participation in an unlawful street gang,subd.a,count three,and vandalism,a misdemeanor,subds.a,b,count four.the petition also alleged that counts one and two were committed for the benefit of a street gang,subd.b.
on the same date,ramon admitted the truth of the petition as to counts one and three,and the enhancement,admitting participating in and committing the offense for the benefit of the barrio pobre street gang.the court dismissed the remaining counts and the enhancement.ramon was adjudicated a ward of the court,received credit for time served,and was released on probation subject to certain terms,including the condition that he not associate with gang members or be present in known gang areas.
from through june,ramon was in and out of custody and continuously on probation.six additional petitions were filed.his offenses during the periods he was out of custody,all of which he admitted,included burglary,vandalism,and numerous probation violations,including violation of the gang terms.at the hearing on each petition,ramon was ordered to comply with all prior probation terms.ramon turned in october.
by the spring of,ramon was out of custody after serving days in a juvenile facility for probation violations.on three occasions between may and june,ramon was stopped by police in barrio pobre territory.on may,the police responded to a call in the early morning at the corner of lincoln and laxore,where it was reported that gang members were loitering and causing a disturbance.one of the responding officers,chris cooper,knew the area to be part of barrio pobre territory.when he arrived,he made contact with ramon and two individuals who were with him,brian and edwin alarrazabal,who cooper recognized as barrio pobre gang members.as he approached,brian alarrazabal threw down a switch blade,which cooper retrieved.
on june,anaheim police officer jason states responded to a call at lincoln and laxore,an area he knew to be part of barrio pobre gang territory.states found ramon with the alarrazabal brothers and another individual outside of a liquor store.they had formed a semicircle around two men,who reported that they had been approached and asked their gang affiliation.
ramon identified himself to states as knuckles,said that he had just gotten out of juvenile hall,and identified himself as a member of the barrio pobre street gang.he said his moniker was due to his reputation as a fighter and he was proud to be a member of the gang.when states asked why he had approached the men,ramon responded that he did not like racial epithet in his neighborhood.
when contacted by his probation officer about the june incident,ramon acknowledged that he was with barrio pobre gang members in gang territory at the time.he was admonished to refrain from such activity in the future.
on june,however,anaheim police officer mark brydges contacted ramon at the intersection of embassy and laxore,and area he knew to be barrio pobre territory,with three other individuals.ramon was attempting to hide at the time.ramon identified himself as knuckles,and when asked by the officer,he acknowledged he was on probation with gang terms in effect.
on june,the ninth petition,which is the subject of the instant appeal,was filed.the petition alleged eight paragraphs of probation violations.at the probation department recommendation,ramon was detained at the county jail pending further proceedings.
ramon and his mother testified at the subsequent hearing.he admitted that after being released from juvenile hall,he frequently went into barrio pobre territory.he claimed that he went there to visit his daughter,who lived nearby with her mother.
on july,at the hearing conclusion,the court made true findings as to four of the alleged probation violations,all of them regarding ramon association with gang members in gang territory.the court ordered ramon committed to the custody of the probation department for placement in juvenile hall or an appropriate facility for days,with credit for the days already served.as ramon was being held in county jail,he requested the court to place him in juvenile hall,but the court denied the request.ramon now appeals.
discussioncommitment to county jail 
ramon argues that the court erred by keeping him in county jail pending the hearing on the ninth petition and for committing him to county jail thereafter.he argues that the juvenile court lacked authority to commit him directly to county jail because he was under age at the time.on july,at the time of the initial detention hearing in the instant matter,ramon,who was years and some eight months,was being housed in the county jail.counsel did not object,and submitted on the issue of detention.
at the july,hearing,after the court found several of the allegations true,ramon counsel asked that ramon be committed to juvenile hall.counsel argued that a juvenile facility would better be able to ensure that ramon received his medications,and stated that there had been problems with the medication in jail.the court stated that such medication requests were commonplace and directed counsel to draw up a boilerplate order for ramon to receive his medication while in custody.the court then ordered ramon to serve days in custody,ordering him into the care of the probation department for commitment to juvenile hall or the appropriate facility the minute order states that the court denied ramon request to serve his commitment in juvenile hall.
ramon argues this was improper.ramon is now out of custody,and the parties agree that although the issue is technically moot,this court should nonetheless opine on the issue.because this issue is one of public interest and likely to recur in the future,we exercise our discretion to do so.in re jody d.to do so,we must examine and harmonize a number of statutory provisions.
under welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b in part minors under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court as a consequence of delinquent conduct shall,in conformity with the interests of public safety and protection,receive care,treatment,and guidance that is consistent with their best interest,that holds them accountable for their behavior,and that is appropriate for their circumstances.
subdivision e of that section states punishment,under that section,means the imposition of sanctions and does not include retribution.permissible sanctions for minors include a number of options,including fines,community service,limitations on the minor liberty as a condition of probation or parole,commitment to a detention facility such as juvenile hall,or commitment to the department of corrections and rehabilitation,division of juvenile facilities.
section is part in a series of statutes controlling the custodial segregation of adults and juveniles.subdivision a states,in relevant part notwithstanding any other law,in any case in which a minor who is detained in or committed to a county institution established for the purpose of housing juveniles attains years of age prior to or during the period of detention or confinement he or she may be allowed to come or remain in contact with those juveniles until years of age,at which time he or she,upon the recommendation of the probation officer,shall be delivered to the custody of the sheriff for the remainder of the time he or she remains in custody,unless the juvenile court orders continued detention in a juvenile facility.
under section,subdivision a whenever a person has been adjudged a ward of the juvenile court and has been committed or otherwise disposed of as provided in this chapter for the care of wards of the juvenile court,the court may order that the ward be detained in the detention home,or in the case of a ward of the age of years or more,in the county jail or otherwise as the court deems fit until the execution of the order of commitment or of other disposition.
several cases have examined these provisions.in in re jose th,d jose,the minor was at the time of his offense and turned shortly before disposition.he was placed on probation and ordered to serve days in county jail.id.at,d.the sixth appellate district found this improper,noting that section,subdivision e listed the various options for sanctions,which did not include county jail.section,subdivision a,was intended to permit detention in county jail only until disposition and did not expand the range of appropriate dispositions set forth in section.id.at,d.older cases see,in re kirk d.expressly forbade the placement of a ward in county jail,and while those cases had been at least partly superseded by statutory amendments,the court believed that if the legislature intended for disposition options to include county jail for wards over the age of,section would have included such an option.
finally,the court noted the problems posed by wards over the age of.we sympathize with the dilemma of the juvenile court searching for an appropriate disposition for an ward.we understand the alternatives are limited,and vary from county to county.we also recognize that there may be circumstances in which an ward might prefer a county jail commitment to an alternative in the juvenile system.nonetheless,the parties can not,by stipulation,create statutory authority where none exists.we are constrained by the express language of the applicable statutes to hold that the juvenile court is not authorized to commit a ward to county jail.the juvenile court is a creature of statute,and remains unique and different from the adult court system.should the legislature see fit to expand the range of dispositional alternatives to include county jail for wards,they will do so.it is the province of the legislature and not the courts to enact changes in the court custodial disposition alternatives.clearly,any change in current law must be addressed by the legislature.until then,the juvenile court is bound by those dispositional alternatives specified in welfare and institutions code section,subdivision e.jose,supra,th at,d,fn.omitted.
in re kenny th,d kenny,was another decision of the sixth appellate district,and also addressed a ward who was years old.id.at,d.because of the ward age,the probation office recommended the ward be committed to the county jail.ibid.apparently mindful of the holding in jose,the juvenile court committed the ward to juvenile hall for a period of days,but added he will then be committed to the county jail id.at,d.reiterating its earlier ruling that a ward years of age can not be committed directly to the county jail,kenny concluded the disposition was unauthorized since it was for all practical purposes,a county jail commitment.id.at,d.the fact the juvenile court did say that the ward was committed to juvenile hall was of no moment because t o accept this procedural subterfuge as proper would be to condone an unauthorized disposition by the juvenile court.ibid.
the factual situation was somewhat different in in re charles th,d charles,a decision of the third appellate district.the ward in charles was at the time he violated the terms of his probation.id.at,d.when he was taken into custody,the probation department obtained a juvenile court order placing him in county jail pending the detention hearing.at the hearing,the court found a prima facie case the ward had violated probation and ordered detention continued in the county jail.the ward eventually admitted two allegations that he had violated his probation terms,and the court ordered him continued as a ward and to serve a period of confinement in an authorized facility after which jurisdiction would be terminated.ibid.
the court first addressed the propriety of continued jurisdiction over a ward who becomes an adult.the court found that such jurisdiction was appropriate and necessary to effect the intent of the legislature.in re charles,supra,th at,d.the court also interpreted section with regard to predisposition detention.the court interpreted the juvenile court order as implicitly declining to exercise its authority to order the ward continued detention in a juvenile facility.the only flaw in the court order is that section requires a ward to be detained in a county institution established for the purpose of housing juveniles before he may be delivered to the custody of the sheriff.in other words,the court should have ordered appellant to be detained in a juvenile facility and,upon recommendation of the probation office,immediately transferred to county jail.id.at,d.the court found,however,that the ward was not prejudiced by this shortcoming.
with respect to the disposition,the court agreed with the essential holding of kenny and jose that a court could not commit a ward over the age of directly to county jail.the court stated,however,that it does not follow that the court can not commit a ward years of age or older to a juvenile detention facility with the understanding that,because the probation officer so recommends,the ward will be delivered to the sheriff for confinement in county jail pursuant to section.such a disposition is not a procedural subterfuge to condone an unauthorized disposition by the juvenile court.kenny,supra,th at,d.it is a legitimate application of the statutory scheme that allows the ward to be housed in a juvenile detention facility until the age of,at which time he or she must be delivered to a local adult facility unless the court orders continued detention in the juvenile facility.citation.in re charles,supra,th at,d.
thus,the real disagreement between charles and the sixth district cases,kenny and jose,is not with regard to the holding that a juvenile court can not commit an ward to county three cases agree on that point.their disagreement is based on the question of whether a ward can be transferred to an adult facility after he or she turns,in accordance with the section.
and so we come at last to the case at bar.at the time of detention,ramon was taken directly to county jail.this was improper.under the procedure discussed in charles,ramon should have been initially placed in a juvenile facility.at that time,the probation department could have obtained an order moving him to county jail under section or section,subdivision a,pending disposition.t he court may order that in the case of a ward of the age of years or more,in the county jail or otherwise as the court deems fit until the execution of the order of commitment or of other disposition.like the court in charles,however,we agree that ramon suffered no prejudice as a result of this impropriety.
placement in county jail for days at disposition is a different question.jose,kenny,and charles all agree that a court can not commit an ward directly to county jail,and we agree this is the proper interpretation of the current statutes.we agree with the jose court,which said we are constrained by the express language of the applicable statutes to hold that the juvenile court is not authorized to commit a ward to county jail.the juvenile court is a creature of statute,and remains unique and different from the adult court system.should the legislature see fit to expand the range of dispositional alternatives to include county jail for wards,they will do so.it is the province of the legislature and not the courts to enact changes in t
