background 
factual summary 
in march,dfs received the first of many hot line calls alleging bass was battering and starving her five children,rodney,catina,and triplets,larry,gary,and jerry.dfs investigated various abuse and neglect reports and visited the bass home however,dfs never deemed the hot line reports warranted local law enforcement notification or removal of the children from the home.on august,dfs received a hot line call in jefferson city,missouri.the caller reported scratches were seen on larry chest bass was starving her children as punishment bass had locked rodney in the basement the children were searching through trash cans for food all five children appeared dehydrated and malnourished with sunken eyes and protruding ribs and the children were so weak they could not drink from a glass without assistance.the hot line information was faxed immediately to kansas city,missouri,where a dfs employee screened the information according to mdss protocol and determined a family assessment and services approach rather than an investigation was warranted.
johnson was assigned to perform a family assessment that day on the bass family.johnson went to the bass home,where she met bass boyfriend,tony dixon dixon at the front gate.dixon told johnson bass was working and the children were not at home.johnson told dixon to have bass call her.the following day bass called johnson at work,and johnson returned to the bass home to perform a family assessment.during her visit,johnson talked to bass,and interviewed three of the children,ronald,catina,and jerry.johnson did not see or interview larry and gary.bass told johnson that,due to their behavioral problems,larry and gary lived with their natural father.the children also told johnson that larry and gary were living with their father.dixon,however,told johnson that larry and gary were out of town visiting their grandparents.johnson recognized the discrepancy and recorded dixon seemingly contradictory statement on the family assessment form.johnson also noted bass was to contact johnson if larry gary returned home.at no time did johnson verify larry and gary whereabouts.
johnson spent an hour in the bass home.she confined her visit to the living room,which she observed to be very clean.johnson smelled food cooking on the kitchen stove.bass denied ever punishing her children by locking them in the basement or by withholding food from them.the children told johnson that bass took good care of them.the children denied bass withheld food,locked them in the basement,or otherwise abused them.bass attested that johnson assured bass she would with another visit in two weeks.the family assessment form does not indicate any intention to,nor did johnson follow up with the family.
following her home visit,johnson determined no social services were needed,and she concluded the bass children were safe,despite never seeing larry and gary.johnson turned in her family assessment report without completing a mandatory safety assessment.by a form letter dated september,johnson informed bass dfs was not opening a case because we agreed during our discussion that your family is not in need of services.two weeks later,johnson supervisor,rosa,reviewed the report and completed the safety assessment,thereby certifying the bass home was safe,without ever being in the bass home or seeing the bass children.
two months after dfs closed the bass file,bass forced larry and gary to submerge their feet and lower legs into scalding bath water,causing severe burns.on october,kansas city police,fire,and emergency medical technicians responded to a call made from the bass home.state bass.upon arrival,emergency personnel observed bass kneeling on the living room floor near larry,who was lifeless,emaciated,and naked except for a pair of socks.after paramedics declared larry dead,they proceeded upstairs,where they discovered gary,emaciated and lying on a mattress.en route to the emergency room,the paramedics removed gary socks and discovered burns on his feet and lower legs,several gangrene toes,and multiple abrasions on his back.despite intensive medical treatment,gary died two days later.id.at.
to ascertain their causes of death,autopsies were performed on the boys.at death larry measured inches and weighed pounds gary measured inches and weighed pounds.id.the autopsies revealed the boys died from starvation and thermal burns to their legs and feet.the autopsy reports classified both deaths as homicides.id.
the state of missouri indicted bass with two counts of murder,four counts of armed criminal action,eight counts of child abuse,and two counts of endangerment.id.at.the state also indicted dixon,who pled guilty to child abuse and endangerment charges,and was sentenced to twenty years.a jury convicted bass of two counts of murder,four counts of armed criminal action,and six counts of child abuse.the trial court sentenced bass to eight consecutive life sentences and to four additional sentences.id.the missouri court of appeals affirmed bass convictions.id.at.
as a result of the prosecutions,authorities learned bass and dixon had deceived johnson about larry and gary whereabouts.on august,larry and gary were not living with their natural father,nor were they visiting their grandparents.instead,sometime before johnson arrived,bass and dixon locked larry and gary in the basement,bound their hands and feet together with rope,and gagged their mouths with socks.bass and dixon threatened the other three children with starvation and beatings if they told johnson the truth about their brothers treatment or their whereabouts.
procedural history 
following the criminal convictions,forrester filed this lawsuit,contending johnson and rosa noncompliance with mandatory procedures violated larry and gary federal due process rights as well as state law.johnson and rosa moved for summary judgment,arguing they are entitled to qualified immunity because forrester can not prove any violation of clearly established constitutional rights.johnson and rosa further claim they owed no duty to larry and gary because the boys were not in state custody.
the district court analyzed the plain language of sections and of the missouri revised statutes and determined these statutes clearly establish certain rights for children and families who enter the missouri social services system through reports of abuse or neglect.the district court identified these rights as being the right to have reports of abuse investigated by division employees,when the report indicates a possible violation of certain criminal laws,or indicates that the child is in danger of physical harm or threat to life the right to have the appropriate law enforcement agency contacted and provided a description of the report,and to have division employees request the assistance of the local law enforcement agency and the right to preventive and protective services to prevent abuse or neglect.additionally,the district court determined these statutory sections assign dfs employees the duties of updating the information system and maintaining records,and observing directly,within hours,a child reported to be in danger of serious physical harm.
flowing from these statutory duties,the district court reasoned the plaintiffs had a property interest in the rights conferred by sections and,specifically in the right to an investigation of the report that their mother was abusing them,and the right to preventive and protective services provided by the state.in a footnote,the court noted johnson and rosa owed the plaintiffs the initial protective service of contacting law enforcement and requesting their assistance in the investigation of the case.
in analyzing the substantive due process claims,the district court found the plaintiffs had a property interest in their right to a child abuse investigation,as well as a liberty interest in bodily integrity and,naturally,a fundamental right to life.the court expounded 
melissa johnson should have known that proceeding to conduct a family assessment of the bass case despite knowing the report called for an investigation would deprive plaintiffs of their clearly established right to a child abuse investigation melissa johnson and kimberly rosa should have known that making material omissions and false statements on the evaluation form and closing the bass case prematurely would deprive plaintiffs of clearly established rights to an investigation and to preventive and protective services.defendants therefore are not entitled to qualified immunity on plaintiffs substantive due process claims.
the district court denied summary judgment on the federal due process claims,but granted summary judgment on the state law claims because the defendants had engaged in discretionary acts and were entitled to official immunity.forrester does not appeal the dismissal of his state law claims.
ii.discussion 
we must determine whether johnson and rosa failure to comply with mandatory procedures outlined in sections and constituted procedural and substantive due process violations protected under the fourteenth amendment.for purposes of this appeal,we assume johnson and rosa failed to perform their mandated statutory duties by not conducting an investigation directly observing larry and gary bass within hours of the hot line call contacting law enforcement,providing a detailed description of the abuse report,and requesting law enforcement assistance with an investigation and providing preventive and protective services.
rosa and johnson appeal the district court denial of summary judgment,finding rosa and johnson are not protected by qualified immunity.generally,we do not have jurisdiction to decide an appeal arising from the denial of summary judgment however,under the collateral order doctrine,an order denying qualified immunity is immediately appealable.behrens pelletier,d beck wilson,cir.
qualified immunity 
we review de novo a denial of qualified immunity.mccoy city of monticello,cir.rosa and johnson are entitled to qualified immunity unless their alleged conduct violated clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person in their positions would have known.harlow fitzgerald,d.the law is clearly established if it gives the defendant officials fair warning that their conduct violated an individual rights when the officials acted.hope pelzer,d.
in saucier katz,d,the supreme court framed the threshold question taken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury,do the facts alleged show the officials conduct violated a constitutional right if no constitutional right would have been violated were the allegations established,there is no necessity for further inquiries concerning qualified immunity.on the other hand,if a violation could be made out on a favorable view of the parties submissions,the next,sequential step is to ask whether the right was clearly established.id.the relevant,dispositive inquiry in determining whether a right is clearly established is whether it would be clear to a reasonable offic ial that her conduct was unlawful in the situation she confronted.id.at.officials do not lose their qualified immunity because of a mistaken,yet reasonable belief,nor do officials lose their immunity because of a reasonable mistake as to the legality of their actions.id.at.mccoy,at.guided by these principles,we now proceed to analyze whether sections and of the missouri statutes create property or liberty interests protected under the fourteenth amendment.
procedural due process 
the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment guarantees that n o state shall deprive any person of life,liberty,or property,without due process of law.const.amend.xiv.property interests protected by due process are not created by the constitution but,rather,are created and their dimensions are defined,by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law.cleveland bd.of educ.loudermill,d citation omitted.the supreme court has ruled a state failure to protect an individual against private violence simply does not constitute a violation of the due process clause.deshaney by deshaney winnebago county dep t of soc,d.
attempting to sidestep deshaney,forrester argued,and the district court agreed,the due process claims in count i are not based on the due process clause,but instead are based on missouri child protection statutes that confer on abused and neglected children an entitlement to receive investigative as well as preventive and protective services.deshaney expressly declined to consider whether the relevant child protection statutes gave the plaintiff an entitlement to due process protection.id.at.as such,we agree deshaney does not expressly control the procedural due process claims.
our analysis begins by examining first whether the child protection statutes at issue confer any protected interests.only if we find a protected interest do we examine whether the deprivation of the protected interest was done in accordance with due process.see.dep t of corr.thompson,d.in board of regents roth,d,the supreme court defined a property interest as an interest a person has already acquired in specific benefits.the court explained that to have a property interest in a benefit,an individual claiming the interest must have more than an abstract need or desire or a unilateral expectation of it.he must,instead,have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.id.at.
a liberty interest arises when a state imposes substantive limitations on official discretion.olim wakinekona,d.we determine whether a state law creates an enforceable liberty interest by examin ing closely the language of the relevant statutes and regulations.thompson,at.t he most common manner in which a state creates a liberty interest is by establishing substantive predicates to govern official,and,further,by mandating the outcome to be reached upon a finding that the relevant criteria have been met.id.at.citation omitted.the court also articulated a requirement that statutes and regulations must contain explicitly mandatory language,specific directives to the decisionmaker that if the regulations substantive predicates are present,a particular outcome must follow,in order to create a liberty interest.id.at.in sum,the use of explicitly mandatory language,in connection with the establishment of specified substantive predicates to limit discretion,forces a conclusion that the state has created a liberty interest.id.
sections and charged dfs personnel with the duties of receiving reports of child abuse and neglect,and determining whether a family assessment and services approach or an investigation should be employed to respond to the report.see.supp.in cases in which a child abuse report,if true,would constitute a crime or attempted crime against the subject child or children,the statutes required dfs personnel to conduct an investigation,contact the appropriate law enforcement agency,provide law enforcement with a detailed report,and request its assistance.id.the statutes also mandated that,within hours of receiving such a report,dfs personnel must initiate a thorough investigation,including direct observation of any subject child or children reported to be in danger of serious physical harm or threat of life.id.furthermore,the statutes required dfs personnel to provide protective and preventive services to the subject child or children and to others in the home.id.
we have not considered previously whether these challenged missouri child protection statutes bestow upon reportedly abused children a property or liberty interest in social services.we have,however,previously considered an identical issue in the context of a minnesota child welfare statute and related procedural regulations,and determined they neither bestow a property interest in social services,nor create a constitutional liberty interest in due process.doe hennepin county,cir myers morris,cir,abrogated on other grounds,burns reed,d.the minnesota statute at issue in both of the minnesota a reporting duty on individuals with knowledge of child abuse or neglect,and investigative and duties on law enforcement authorities and social service agencies that receive child abuse reports,as well as duties on local welfare agencies to offer protective social services.see myers,at citing.ann.west and supp.
in myers,we concluded the minnesota child welfare statute,at most,establishes guidelines to be followed as a matter of state law and neither confers nor embodies any right.id.the following year,in doe,we noted that,although the plaintiffs desired or even expected the social services set forth in the minnesota statute,they ha d no legitimate claim of entitlement.doe,at.we explained in doe that in order to have a legitimate entitlement,the benefit must be specific,clearly definable,and we provided several examples of clearly definable benefits,including public assistance,social security income,and unemployment benefits.id.in contrast to these specific benefits,we explained the provision of minnesota statutorily defined social services is qualified by the considerable discretion placed in the hands of those who administer it.id.at.we also noted the lack of specificity of the minnesota statute.id.
the minnesota statute examined in doe and myers is not identical to the missouri statutes relied upon here,and the facts in doe and myers,both of which involved the emergency removal of children from parental custody following reported child abuse,are converse to those before us.nonetheless,we conclude the legal reasoning employed in these earlier cases should apply.similar to the minnesota statute,sections and of the missouri statutes codify procedures for administering the state child protection system,the telephone hot line,and the central registry.sections and contain explicit mandatory language,an investigation is required when a child abuse report,if true,would constitute a crime or attempted crime against a child notification of law enforcement,with a request for assistance,and direct observation of the child within hours are also required under the same circumstances and social services must be provided to the child and family.
despite explicit language requiring dfs officials to comply with certain procedures,the statutes contain no substantive predicates expressly limiting the discretion of dfs officials by mandating the outcome to be reached upon a finding that the relevant criteria have been met.see thompson,at.citation omitted.the statutes do not mandate the particular substantive outcomes of required investigations,law enforcement notification and intervention,direct observation of subject children,and the provision of social services.see,supp.nor do the statutes define mandatory social services,or dictate how,when,or for how long these social services must be provided.instead,the statutory language simply mandates particular preliminary actions be undertaken and authorizes the provision of social services,thereby leaving the particular substantive outcome in each case to the sound discretion of trained social workers and law enforcement officers.see id.
we agree with the second circuit ruling that where an administrative process does not require specific substantive outcomes,but merely authorizes and directs particular actions and remedies,the administrative process does not create entitlements subject to constitutional protections under the fourteenth amendment.see sealed sealed,cir.other circuits,analyzing similarly drafted child welfare statutes,have reached this same conclusion.see doe dist.of columbia,declaring process alone does not give rise to a protected substantive interest by codifying procedures for investigating child abuse and neglect reports,has not assumed a constitutional obligation to protect children from such abuse and neglect tony childers,cir ruling procedural rights only give plaintiffs an expectation that a certain procedure will be followed,and declaring a n expectation that some sort of action will be taken is not enough a plaintiff must have an expectation that a particular result will follow from a particular,required action.doe milwaukee county,cir rejecting a procedural due process claim for failing to investigate child abuse,finding no entitlement in such procedures,and ruling the procedures themselves are not benefits within the meaning of fourteenth amendment jurisprudence.
recently,in a case filed by children alleging abuse while in foster care,a recognized exception under deshaney,the second circuit ruled that the detailed and comprehensive procedures for investigating potential child abuse mandated by state law,standing alone,create no independent substantive entitlements,whose deprivation might trigger application of the due process clause.sealed,at.the second circuit reasoned that e levating a procedure to the status of a constitutionally protected liberty or property interest,would make process an end in itself rather than a requirement whose constitutional purpose is to protect a substantive interest in which the individual has a claim of entitlement.id.at citation omitted 
thus,based on the plain statutory language and court precedent,we hold sections and of the missouri revised statutes,which were in effect in august,did not create specific,constitutionally protected property or liberty interests in investigative,preventive,and protective social services.finding no protected interests,we need not decide what,if any,procedural process was due.
substantive due process 
forrester also claims the failure of johnson and rosa to comply with statutory procedures violated larry and gary substantive due process rights to bodily integrity and their fundamental rights to life.while deshaney does not control forrester procedural due process claims,deshaney squarely forecloses his substantive due process claims.declaring a state has no general duty to protect individuals from abuse committed by private actors,deshaney,at,the supreme court acknowledged a state may owe an affirmative duty to protect individuals when they are placed in state custody,or when the state acts affirmatively to create the danger to which the individuals become subject.see id.at.burton richmond,cir.as dfs never placed larry and gary in state custody,the special custodial relationship theory does not apply.
alternatively,forrester advances a danger theory,contending johnson and rosa affirmative acts of jointly filing the bass family assessment report with material omissions and false representations rendered larry and gary,as well as their siblings,more vulnerable to continued child abuse and ensured preventive and protective social services would not be provided to the bass family.in freeman ferguson,cir,we recognized the deshaney analysis establishes the possibility that a constitutional duty to protect an individual against private violence may exist in a setting if the state has taken affirmative action which increases the individual danger of,or vulnerability to,such violence beyond the level it would have been at absent state action.
