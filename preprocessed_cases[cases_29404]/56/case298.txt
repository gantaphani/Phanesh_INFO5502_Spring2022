johnson proceeded to the security office on campus to call richmond police for help.when he arrived,sergeant russell of the richmond police department was present for a visit.russell told johnson to locate but not confront him.russell also advised johnson to determine where locker is located.
to follow up on identifying locker,johnson met with cso driscoll,the campus security officer who deals with student lockers.each year,driscoll the lockers and changes the combinations.while he does not assign lockers to individual students,driscoll had information about who was assigned to particular lockers.driscoll also is responsible for supervising the cleaning out of school lockers during the year and handling repair of jammed lockers.when driscoll noticed the assigned locker of,he told johnson that was not the locker he hangs around.driscoll related he had seen several times in the area of locker number.on the day of the reported shooting,driscoll had observed with his girlfriend in front of locker.the couple was facing the set of lockers but driscoll was not able to determine which one,if any,they might be using.this behavior seemed suspicious to driscoll.the incident occurred when students were required to be either in class or at lunch but not in the hall area where was seen.
during their conversation,driscoll advised johnson that richmond high students often shared their assigned locker with other students who were not assigned to that locker for the purpose of concealing contraband such as drugs and other items not permitted on campus.the cso were familiar with this behavior at the school.
driscoll and johnson along with russell went to the area of locker to see if weapons were present.when opened,locker contained a couple of books,but nothing else.russell then told driscoll to check the adjacent lockers because the student had frequented the area of.shortly,driscoll opened,which was next to.a backpack was found in it and,when removed from the location,the security officers noticed the butt of a shotgun.

discussion 
recent events have demonstrated the increased concern school officials must have in the daily operation of public schools.sites such as columbine,sandy hook elementary,and virginia tech have been discussed in our national media not because of their educational achievements,but because of the acute degree of violence visited on these and other campuses hostility often predicated on killings with firearms.during the school year,students,staff,and others died in a violent event in,percent of students in grades nine through twelve reported being threatened or injured with a weapon on school property at least one time according to the national center for injury prevention and control,a division of the center for disease control cdc,in,there were nonfatal victimizations at school among students through years of age.in,percent of the students in grades nine through did not attend school within days of the cdc survey because they felt the school,or their way to or from school,was unsafe.also,percent of the same group reported being threatened or injured with a weapon on school property one or more times in the past months before the survey we must be cognizant of this alarming reality as we approach our role in assessing appropriate responses by school administrators to campus safety issues.
education is perhaps the most important function of government.brown board of education.as such,government has a heightened obligation to safeguard students whom it compels to attend school.the special need for an immediate response to behavior that threatens either the safety of schoolchildren and teachers or the education process itself justified the court in excepting school searches from the warrant and requirement,and in applying a standard determined by balancing the relevant interests.new jersey,conc.opn.of blackmun.of course,it is a given that students do not shed their constitutional rights at the schoolhouse gate.tinker des moines independent community school district.yet the primary duty of school officials is the education and training of young people.a state has a compelling interest in assuring that the schools meet this responsibility.without first establishing discipline and maintaining order,teachers can not begin to educate their students.in re randy cal th,randy.after all,all minor students are required to be in school.and all students and staff of public primary,elementary,junior high,and senior high schools have the inalienable right to attend campuses which are safe,secure and peaceful.cal,subd.f italics added.among the ways school districts achieve this is by having security departments in the school to enforce the rules of the state and school district,randy,supra,cal th at.
to properly employ the balance between the privacy interests of public school children with the important need to maintain order and discipline in schools today,the accommodation does not require rigid adherence to the requirement that searches be based on probable cause to believe the subject of the search has violated or is violating the law.instead,the validity of a search on school property should depend on the reasonableness of the official conduct to deal with the particular school problem,supra,at.events calling for discipline are frequent occurrences and sometimes require immediate,effective action.goss lopez.therefore,school administrators and security personnel need to have a certain degree of flexibility in school disciplinary procedures,supra,at.
in normal situations,any search or seizure requires an individualized suspicion of criminal activity.brinegar united states.without such,the search is not reasonable and violates the fourth amendment.randy,supra,cal th at.however,the fourth amendment protections are rooted always in reasonableness individualized suspicion triggers reasonable inquiry by the police in the usual case.yet over time,the reasonableness of any search must be reflective of a balance between the particular intrusion on a person fourth amendment interests against its promotion of legitimate governmental interests.vernonia school district acton,acton.neither a warrant nor probable cause is inevitably required when special needs exist beyond the normal need for law enforcement to make the warrant and requirement impracticable.griffin wisconsin,italics added.this special needs rationale has allowed the supreme court to require drug testing of customs officials at the border national treasury employees union von raab,von raab and railway workers skinner railway labor executives,skinner.
the reasonableness assessment based on special needs has been deemed appropriate in public schools by the supreme court.we have found such special needs to exist in the public school context.there,the warrant requirement would unduly interfere with the maintenance of the swift and informal disciplinary procedures that are needed,and strict adherence to the requirement that searches be based upon probable cause would undercut the substantial need of teachers and administrators for freedom to maintain order in the schools.acton,supra,at,citing,supra,at.
of course,there is the need to recognize and consider individual student rights in this review.against the strong governmental interest or special need in the public school arena,the courts have developed the need to focus not on individualized suspicion,but on the circumstances triggering administrative action and whether the execution is arbitrary,capricious,or for the purpose of harassment.randy,supra,cal th at.while randy involved only the detention of a student in a public school,its reasoning has been adopted in campus search cases as well.in re sean th,in re th,see also,in re latasha th.
in our case,the administration and its security staff at richmond high school faced a report from an identified student who overheard that,the previous day,one of the school students,shot another person on a bus after school.the student reportee demonstrated concern over the incident and was interviewed by cso sanders and also cso johnson.this information triggered two responsible initiatives by the school security officers.the first was to determine if was on the school property with a weapon.the second was to inspect lockers that could be used by to conceal such an item.neither step by the school would be considered inappropriate or unreasonable.each was narrow and focused,and based on the identity of and an area of the school he was known to frequent.
the belief that may have stored contraband in another person locker,in the context of the special needs doctrine,does not serve to preclude the action of school security.even if another student validly had the assigned use of a particular locker at the school,that fact did not make the official behavior here suspecting an alleged shooter also had access to the same lockers unreasonable.privacy concerns needed to be balanced against the official need to address school safety.the principles developed in,acton,and board of education of independent school district of pottawatomie county earls earls,as well as skinner and von raab,are authoritative precedent here because they also involve a proactive policy based on government obligations aimed at protecting students,travelers,and our national borders,not hindsight reflection.
this assessment of reasonableness requires judicial review of its quality and the behavior by school officials at the outset of official reaction.t he legality of a search of a student should depend simply on the reasonableness,under all the circumstances,of the search.determining the reasonableness of any search involves a twofold inquiry first,one must consider whether the action was justified at its inception,citation second,one must determine whether the search as actually conducted was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place,citation.under ordinary circumstances,a search of a student by a teacher or other school official will be justified at its inception
