this appeal involves two age children whom a superior court found adoptable and freed for adoption.welf.reaching this decision proved elusive for approximately months.this was due in part to the fact the children were indian,and the court proceeded according to the indian child welfare act icwa et.respondent tulare county health and human services agency agency placed the children with extended family members for the purposes of adoption but,within a matter of months,the relative caregivers asked the agency to remove the children from their care.the agency was able to successfully move the children and place them in an indian foster home specifically interested in adoption.however,eight months later and on the eve of a new section hearing for the children,their former relative caregivers,prompted by the indian tribe,asked to be reconsidered for adoptive placement.by that point,however,moving the children yet again would have been detrimental because each child suffered from an attachment disorder.
their mother,who is an enrolled member of the tule river tribe tribe,and the tribe appeal from the termination of parental rights on numerous grounds.joining in one another briefs,appellants contend there was insufficient evidence to support the court adoptability and findings and that the court erred by either not applying a new statutory exception to termination for indian children or not ordering the children change in placement.
california recently revised and recast portions of the code that address indian child custody proceedings by codifying into state law various provisions of icwa,the bureau of indian affairs guidelines for state courts of the interior,bureau of indian affairs,guidelines for state courts indian child custody proceedings.guidelines,and the state rules of court.stats,ch.since several of appellants contentions raise questions of first impression about these recently enacted amendments,we publish our decision.having reviewed the law and the record in this case,we affirm.
procedural and factual histories 
in july,when the children in this appeal were one and two years of age,their mother gave birth to a child.paramedics arrived at the mother home to find the newborn in the mother pants with the umbilical cord still attached.brought to a hospital to separate the baby from the mother,both the mother and the newborn tested positive for methamphetamine.although the mother knew or reasonably should have known she was pregnant,she continued to use drugs and was unable to provide regular care for the children,subd.b.the father was incarcerated,awaiting trial on a murder charge,and could not arrange adequate care for them,subd.g.
at an august detention hearing,the tulare county superior court found that icwa applied based on the mother membership in the tribe.shortly thereafter,the tribe records specialist verified that neither the children nor their newborn sister were enrolled members of the tribe however,their mother was an enrolled member.the tribe icwa specialist attended the hearings in this case,commencing at a september,hearing in which the trial court exercised its dependency jurisdiction over the children.
initially,the social worker assigned to the case was unaware of any available indian foster homes in the area.also,relatives whom the agency first considered for placement withdrew their request.consequently,the agency placed the newborn with one foster family qualified to provide for infants and her older sisters,the children here,with another foster home.unfortunately,less than a month after their detention,the children were placed in a second foster home after one of them suffered severe burns in the first foster home.as the dispositional hearing approached,the mother provided two additional names of family members whom she wished the agency to consider for placement.her first choice was an extended family member whom she believed was a tribal member as well as a foster parent.the agency contacted the relative,who was an enrolled member of the tribe,and his wife in august,inquiring if they could take all three siblings into the relative home.although the couple,and,were foster parents,they were only licensed to accept two children.the would need an exemption or a new license to receive all three sisters it is undisputed on appeal that the other relative whom the mother suggested did not meet placement requirements.
later in september,the court adjudged the children and their newborn sister juvenile dependents and removed them from parental custody in the process,the court made two findings that active efforts were made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the indian family and that these efforts proved unsuccessful and the continued parental custody of the children and their newborn sister was likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to them.within a matter of days,the agency placed the sibling with the relative caregivers.the children meanwhile remained in their foster home where they did well and were happy and healthy.
over the next six months,the mother did not comply with any component of her reunification case plan.it appeared she might still be abusing methamphetamine.she was a no show for more than random drug tests.she also canceled or never attended out of scheduled visits with the children.meanwhile,the father was incarcerated in a unit where no services were available to him and contact visits were not permitted.under these circumstances,as well as the fact there was no substantial probability that either parent would reunify within another six months and all three sisters were under the age of three when they were removed,subd.a,the agency in a march status review report recommended the court terminate reunification services and set a section hearing to select and implement permanent plans.
the agency in the meantime conducted an adoption assessment for all three sisters,a copy of which it attached to its status review report.it found each was adoptable due to her young age,minimal to no issues,and the commitment of one caregiver to adopt.the were committed to adopting the sibling and were willing to consider adopting all three sisters.according to the assessment,consideration was being given to placing the children,who remained in a foster home,in the home depending on space being available.
as the status review hearing approached,the tribe,through its tribal chairman,wrote the court asking to intervene in the dependency and to recommend that the court return the children to the mother care and order guardianship,rather than adoption,for the sibling.on the date originally set for the review,the court advised the tribe icwa coordinator it could not accept the tribe ex parte documentation and that the tribe should file a motion to intervene.the court also ordered the agency to provide narratives to all counsel and the tribe.it then continued the hearing.
the tribe consequently filed a motion to intervene,in which it also petitioned to invalidate,subd.e any orders which were not in compliance with its resolution the resolution,which was attached to the tribe motion,declared that the tribal council traditionally opposed legal adoption of our native children,recommended guardianship for the sibling,and preferred placing all three sisters with the,the relative caregiver for the sibling.according to a march minute order,the court was inclined to grant the motion to intervene,but otherwise would deny all motions without prejudice.no reporter transcript of this hearing was transcribed and filed with the appellate record.it also granted a request by the tribe attorney for a short continuance to prepare for the status review hearing.according to the appellate record,the tribe did not subsequently file a new petition to invalidate.
eventually,the court conducted its status review in april.again,a reporter transcript of the hearing has not been transcribed and filed with the record.on the issue of reunification services,the court found reasonable services had been offered to both parents,and they failed to participate and make substantial progress.in addition,because there was no substantial probability that either parent would reunify within another six months and all three sisters were under the age of three when they were removed,subd.a,the court terminated reunification services.the court also set a section hearing to select and implement permanent plans and gave the parents notice of their writ remedy,subd.l cal.rules of court,rule.
the minute order for the april hearing also stated 
as to the tribe request to place the children in an icwa indian child welfare act home the agency is to follow the law pertaining to icwa and if a change in placement is required,the agency is to follow the law.agency is to advise the court as to the status of placement at the next hearing.
in its report for the section hearing scheduled for august,the agency addressed the status of the children placement.their foster mother was hospitalized in june for a brain aneurysm which created a need to change the children placement.the agency solicited family names for placement purposes from the relative caregivers for the sibling and from the tribe icwa coordinator.eight relatives were separately assessed and were found,for different reasons,not to meet licensing requirements.the icwa coordinator had not provided the agency with the names of any individuals or families who could meet the licensing requirements.as a result,the agency placed the children in another foster home until a permanent placement could be identified.although the department believed the children were adoptable,it requested more time to locate prospective adoptive parents who were relatives or otherwise met icwa placement preferences.
at the same time,the agency reported the children sibling was adoptable and identified the as the sibling prospective adoptive parents.the agency noted the relative caregivers,who met icwa placement preferences,were committed to raising the sibling.in urging the court to terminate parental rights for the sibling,the social worker reported termination would not interfere with the child relationship to her older sisters because she was not raised with them and they had only begun to become acquainted.
again,the record does not contain a reporter transcript of the first section hearing.according to a minute order for the august hearing,the court continued the matter in the sibling case for an icwa affidavit.with respect to the children,the court found termination would not be detrimental,but no adoptive parent had been identified and the children were difficult to place because they were part of a sibling group that should stay together.the court identified adoption as the permanent plan goal and directed the agency to make efforts to locate an appropriate adoptive family.it continued the children section hearing until january.
in the interim,specifically late september,the agency placed the children,along with their sibling,in the home of the toward a goal of adoption.at some point,these relative caregivers applied with licensing to have all three children placed in their home.when that application was approved,the relative caregivers agreed to have the children move into their home.meanwhile,the court apparently terminated parental rights as to the sibling and later still granted an adoption petition by the relative caregivers.
soon after this fourth placement change for the children,the agency requested the children be assessed to determine if they had an attachment disorder.although the children shared a close relationship,they also fought and scratched one another.a clinical psychologist with synchrony of visalia,synchrony apparently found the children had issues and developmental delays,particularly in terms of communication.in turn,referrals were made to central valley regional center for a developmental evaluation and a play therapist.the purpose of play therapy was to help determine why the children fought and to understand the nature of their communication delays.the play therapist would then make referrals for other services as appropriate.
regrettably,the relative caregivers decided in late november not to pursue adoption of the children.the agency reported the children developmental and emotional needs were beyond the relative caregivers capabilities.nonetheless,the relative caregivers were committed to providing the children with a home and therapeutic services until a prospective adoptive family could be identified.the relative caregivers were then in the process of adopting the sibling.
the children social worker believed they might be adoptable again,after services were in place for at least six months and assuming they exhibited progress in terms of speech,language,interpersonal skills,and other developmental tasks.in the meantime,the agency recommended the court select foster care as the permanent plan for the children until a prospective adoptive family could be identified.
although the continued section hearing for the children in january was reported,no reporter transcript was transcribed and filed with the appellate record.according to a minute order from the january hearing,the court found the children were not adoptable b ased on behavioral issues and sibling group factors.the court identified the children permanent plan as a planned permanent living arrangement with the relative caregivers along with a goal of adoption.the court also granted the tribe request to intervene.
four months later,the agency placed the children in a prospective adoptive home which met icwa placement preferences.although the tribe had been unable to provide the names of eligible tribal families for placement purposes,the agency identified what it described as an foster family who wished to adopt the children.as the record would later reveal,one of the foster parents was a registered member of the cherokee nation.after transition visits in april,the agency moved the children from the home of their relative caregivers to that of the current caregivers in.
the current caregivers were aware of and understood the neglect the children had suffered,as well as the multiple placements they endured,both of which contributed to the children behavioral issues.the agency also reported that the former relative caregivers obtained educational resources for the children,gave them a safe and stable home,and helped them improve their developmental skills,until the new prospective adoptive family could be located.the agency recommended that the court set a new section hearing to establish the permanent plan of adoption for the children.
the court in turn followed the agency recommendation and set a new section hearing for the children.although the mother filed a notice of intent to file a writ petition challenging the setting order,she filed an inadequate petition which this court dismissed.case no.v.superior court.
in preparation for this third section hearing,the agency submitted a written assessment of the children adoptability as well as a preliminary assessment of their current caregivers eligibility and commitment to adopt.according to the agency analysis,the children were likely to be adopted because they were young and,although they still had emotional and behavioral problems,their current caregivers had not wavered from their commitment to raise the children as their own.the agency also mentioned that one of the current caregivers was a registered member of the cherokee nation and meets icwa eligibility.further noting the sibling had been adopted by the relative caregivers,the agency added that both families remained in contact in the interests of maintaining a relationship and their common american indian ancestry.
in her form acknowledgment of receipt of notice for the section hearing,the mother checked a box indicating she did not agree with the agency recommendation.although she also checked a box on the form indicating her interest in being present at the hearing,she was absent for both the evidentiary hearing and the further hearing at which the court announced its decision.
on the november date set for the section hearing,the matter needed to be continued because the father,who by then was incarcerated in state prison,had not been transported for the hearing.counsel and the tribe icwa coordinator also represented that the former relative caregivers wished to be reconsidered for placement.the court remarked that these relatives should contact the social worker and in turn directed the agency to evaluate the situation as well as submit a memo regarding placement for the continued hearing date.
in its december memo,the agency recommended against changing the children placement once more.
the reason the children were moved was at the request of and.several times between and,telephoned the adoptions team leader,kathleen trevino asking when and how quickly we could locate another home for the children.stated that she had changed her mind about adoption of the children for the following reasons she and her family wanted to relocate to south dakota,they had to attend a wedding and make moving arrangements they did not want conflict with the tribe because two of her young adult children,enrolled with this tribe,would continue to live in porterville and she did not want them to experience any ill effect of anticipated conflict with the tribe she stated that she anticipated a two to three year struggle with the tribe and she did not want to remain in california past she decided that she could not commit to the long term care of the children regarding their attachment disorder issues and their developmental needs.
the current caretakers had transition visits prior to the placement of the children,and accepted the children with the commitment to the children long term care.the current caretakers meet icwa requirements and remain very much committed to the permanency of raising the children as their own.this writer is not recommending a change in placement and does not support a change in placement.
in this writer professional opinion,moving the children would exacerbate their attachment disorder issues.they are currently in their fifth placement and another move would be emotionally harmful to them.
the children continue to receive therapeutic services from synchrony and their therapist supports the children remaining with their current caretakers.a copy of their statement is attached.
the statement from synchrony included the following 
as you know,the children were first seen in our offices on november the results were that the second oldest child was given the diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder rad and the oldest child was also given the diagnosis of being at risk for an attachment disorder anxious attachment.
both children began treatment at synchrony on treatment for the girls has included family therapy and individual therapy to address their attachment related diagnoses.due to the fact that their early mental health evaluation and diagnoses were given while in a previous placement and under different circumstances an updated evaluation is currently underway.the preliminary results of this update are that both children do suffer from reactive attachment disorder.upon completion of this updated evaluation further detail will be available.
in cases of rad,if not intervened upon effectively the condition follows a continuing course.at this point it is recommended that in addition to both children continuing to receive mental health services that every effort is made to keep their home environment consistent.further,children with rad,including these children required caretakers who are loving,accepting of the girls current level of functioning,are responsive to their special needs,do not engage in control battles,and who provide appropriate supervision and discipline instead of punishment.the current caregivers have demonstrated they are consistently providing this type of stable home environment.the current caregivers have further demonstrated their dedication to these girls and motivation to learn by regularly attending treatment sessions and engaging in parental education about how to care for rad children.
it is recommended that the children remain in their current placement placed as of for the above stated reasons but even more importantly because of the significant psychological progress the girls have made while in this placement.they have been making important strides in their attachment potential and are growing in their secure attachment with the current caregivers.if these children were to be moved,it would be detrimental to their development and integration of a healthy sense of self and safety in the world.moving these girls would reinforce their negative inner pattern of relating to self and others,exacerbating their attachment disorders,significantly decreasing the chance of recovery and healing.
also attached to the memo was an indian child welfare affidavit from icwa expert ricardo carrillo.in the summary and recommendation portion of his affidavit,carrillo offered his opinion that the continued custody of the children by their biological parents was likely to result in serious permanent emotional or physical damage to the children,subds.e f see also welf,subd.c.carrillo added 
the father is incarcerated in state prison and the mother is homeless and can not be found.she may be considered a successful failure at treatment and services offered.she has lost custody of four children to date,has failed to comply or successfully engage in drug or mental health treatment dating back to october of.it is the recommendation of this evaluator that the children be permanently placed in a safe and secure home and not moved from that home.the traumatic symptoms have the possibility of resolving with natural development and a safe and secure attachment from the caretakers.
meanwhile,the former relative caregivers and the icwa coordinator submitted letters to the court favoring change in placement.one of the relative caregivers even emailed the court.since none of these documents were offered,let alone admitted into evidence,we do not detail their contents here.
eventually,the court conducted an evidentiary section hearing on january.the day before the hearing,the icwa coordinator submitted the declaration of,one of the former relative caregivers.the agency also submitted another updated report emphasizing its position that the court should select a permanent plan of adoption for the children.
in his declaration,which the court received into evidence,explained 
i am related to the children as their first cousin twice removed.my paternal aunt,who died this year,was the minors.
when we were initially contacted by the agency as a placement option,it was in august,and we were asked if we could take all three siblings,into our home.because we were only licensed to take two children into our foster home,only the sibling was initially placed with us.when our application to have three children placed in our home was approved,we agreed to have the children move into our home.the children were placed with us on or about september.
after securing services to assist the children with behavioral and emotional issues,we planned to adopt all three of the siblings.we had also been planning our move to south dakota for some time prior to their placement with us and intended to move after our son wedding on june.when the tribe and the girls family learned of our intention to move to south dakota,they contacted us and let us know that they were upset and concerned about the move.the tribe icwa coordinator let us know that the tribe would oppose an adoptive placement of the children with us in south dakota because the maintenance of the girls ties with their mother,extended family and tribal community was in the girls best interest and there was still hope that the mother might reunify with the children.tribe icwa coordinator informed us that the tribe would agree to our adopting the sibling if we would relinquish our intention to adopt the children.at that time,the tribe anticipated opening a foster care facility on its reservation and intended to have the children placed there.we agreed and the sibling adoption was finalized in march of.
although we were anticipating a slow transition of the children out of our home,to be finalized before our move in june,the girls current foster parent asked social worker maria kallai for a speedier transition,and the girls were removed from our home on or about may.
since completing our move to south dakota,we have contacted the agency social worker and the current foster parents of the children to request sibling contact for our adopted daughter,but they have each denied our requests.although the three siblings did not live together immediately after their removal from their biological mother,they did live together in our home for eight months and established a close sibling relationship during that time.we believe it is in all three siblings best interests to have contact and visitation and would like this court to affirm its prior finding of august,that sibling visitation was in the children best interest and order contact by phone and mail for the siblings as well as visitation when we visit california,as we intend to do regularly.
we have taken steps to promote a strong identity for our adopted daughter as an indian child and would do the same for the children if they were placed with us.for example,in rapid city,the sioux san hospital,an indian health services provider,operates a number of culturally appropriate programs and services for indian children and families,such as youth and family services infant to five head start program,in which our adopted daughter is enrolled.we also regularly attend pow wows,which our adopted daughter participates in as a jingle dress dancer.i also maintain ties with the tribe and my extended family who live on or near the tribe reservation.
we were recently contacted by tribe icwa coordinator who stated that the tribal council had reconsidered its prior decision to oppose placement of the children with us in south dakota in light of delays in the establishment of the tribal foster care facility and their desire not to have the children adopted outside of the extended family and the tribe.
my wife and i strongly desire to have the children placed with us on a permanent basis under whatever permanent plan is deemed best for the children by the tribe and the court.we believe this placement would be in the girls best interests because it would reunite them with their youngest sister,to whom they grew attached while they lived with us,as well as us,who had established a positive and loving relationship with the children.
in its update report,the agency reported 
the purpose of this report is to emphasize to the court that the permanent plan of adoption by the current foster parents remain the same.
the current foster parents accepted placement of the minors with the plan of adoption.
although the children have attachment disorder related issues,they have been receiving mental health services and their foster parents have been central to and participated in therapeutic services.the children have exhibited,albeit slowly,improvements in their behaviors and in the attachment process.
the foster parents meet icwa eligibility requirements and the initial placement match was made with this criterion in mind.
the former foster parents,and,now of minot,south dakota,asked the agency in early to move the children because they,and,did not want to wait through the adoptions process,they wanted to move in the spring of to south dakota,they expected that the tribe would contest their interest in adopting the children,and they did not want to battle the tribe because two of their young adult children remained in porterville and and did not want those two children,who are enrolled with the tribe,to experience future conflict.
in this writer opinion,the children are healthy,and are attaching to their new caretakers.the caretakers are committed to the plan of adoption and to whatever the future holds.the current caretakers have and continue to work diligently with the children and their mental health provider on improving the children emotional.to move the children again would contribute to significant emotional harm to these children and would be detrimental to the children and hurtful to the commitment by their caretakers.
at the start of the january,hearing,the court received into evidence the agency three reports filed in november,december,and january,including attachments.as previously noted,it also received declaration into evidence.it granted as well the agency request for judicial notice of the entire case file the parties further stipulated to the court receipt into evidence of the indian child welfare affidavit,subject to.
the tribe counsel then the icwa expert,carrillo,regarding his conclusions.asked what was in the best interest of the children,carrillo testified 
that they be in a safe and secure environment.these children have been placed multiple times.they have developmental difficulties.they need the secure attachment to be placed someplace safe for the long term since their parents ca take care of them.
in response to further questions by the tribe attorney,the icwa expert testified he had not had any contact with the children former relative caregivers because that was not part of his evaluation.
the only opinion i render is that the children are in a foster placement right now and how they are doing right now in that foster placement.i can not render any opinion about anybody else.
the icwa expert added 
no,i can not render an opinion about the former relative caregivers.i can tell you that the children have suffered severe attachment disorders because they have not had a consistent relationship where they can develop.they were born drug exposed.they have nightmares.they have difficulty talking and communicating.they are very clingy in their relationships.so whoever they are going to be with they need to be placed somewhere on a permanent basis with somebody who cares about them and certainly who can attend to them.i do know if the former caregivers are the people that can do that for them.i do know them.
no further evidence was submitted on the matter.
during closing arguments,the tribe counsel argued that termination of parental rights in the children current placement was not in their best interests because termination and adoption by the current caregivers would substantially intervene with the children connection to family and because the tribe had identified guardianship as the desired permanent plan.
the tribe counsel went on to argue against placement with the current caregivers,claiming it was not the tribe preferred placement for the children.the tribe preferred placement was with the former relative caregivers.in the tribe view,the agency had not shown good cause to maintain the children current placement because neither the opinion of the synchrony staff nor the icwa expert considered whether the children removal for placement specifically with the former relative caregivers would be detrimental to them.
the attorney for the tribe also represented that his client acknowledged regret that the children were removed from the former relative caregivers home.the tribe also purportedly always opposed termination of parental rights for the children.in our way and custom,you ca terminate parental rights ever.counsel further criticized the current caregivers for allegedly not demonstrating a willingness to maintain tribal and family relationships for the children.
in conclusion,the tribe counsel represented that the tribe would support termination of parental rights for the sole purpose of attempting an adoption by the former relative caregivers if the court determined such a permanent plan better promoted the children best interests.alternatively,the attorney asked the court to consider guardianship as the culturally appropriate plan for the children and to follow the tribe placement preference.
the court then inquired of the tribe counsel if it was the tribe position,at the time placement was made with the current caregivers,that the agency did not comply with the icwa placement requirements.the attorney replied,no,it is not.
following additional argument by counsel for the other parties,the court took the matter under submission and continued the hearing to the end of january for its decision.this led to a flurry of activity by the agency and the tribe to submit additional evidence for the court consideration,including the agency motion to reopen the hearing.
at the further hearing on january,the court denied the motion to reopen and announced it would not consider any evidence filed after the january,evidentiary hearing the court then found the children adoptable,expressly finding that the current caregivers were committed to adoption and the former relative caregivers were willing to commit to whatever plan was deemed appropriate.t hus,despite the diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder,they are adoptable.the court also agreed with the icwa expert and found beyond a reasonable doubt that the children continued custody by the biological parents was likely to result in serious permanent emotional damage to the children.the court further adopted other recommended findings and orders as submitted by the agency.those findings included an finding,as required by icwa and section,subdivision a.
finally,the court addressed whether the agency complied with the icwa placement preference welf,and,if not,whether good cause existed for noncompliance.it observed it could find no authority for fixing the precise point at which the agency must comply,at the time of initial placement or when the court was selecting the permanent plan.the court found the agency did comply when it placed the children with the current caregivers and that the former relative caregivers chose,with the consent and at the apparent urging of the tribe,to relinquish custody of the children.if on the other hand the placement preference must be complied with at the time of the permanency hearing,the court found the preference had not been met and that good cause existed for the agency noncompliance.the court cited the letter from the synchrony staff and the opinion of the icwa expert.finding the children had extraordinary emotional needs,the court concluded there was good cause.
discussion 
adoptability 
appellants contend there was insufficient evidence to support the court finding that it was likely the children would be adoptable.according to appellants,the court solely and improperly relied on the willingness of the children current and former caregivers to adopt without considering whether the children were generally adoptable,what the impact of their emotional or behavioral problems was on the likelihood of their adoption,and whether the current caregivers could meet the children particular needs.
the adoptability issue at a section hearing focuses on the dependent child,whether his or her age,physical condition,and emotional state make it difficult to find a person willing to adopt.in re sarah th,d sarah.it is not necessary that the child already be in a potential adoptive home or that there be a proposed adoptive parent waiting in the wings.in re jennilee th,fn,d.
conversely,the existence of a prospective adoptive parent,who has expressed interest in adopting a dependent child,constitutes evidence that the child age,physical condition,mental state,and other relevant factors are not likely to dissuade individuals from adopting the child.in other words,a prospective adoptive parent willingness to adopt generally indicates the child is likely to be adopted within a reasonable time either by the prospective adoptive parent or by some other family.sarah,supra,th at,d.having reviewed the record as summarized above,we conclude there was substantial evidence to support the court adoptability finding.in re brison th,d brison.
substantial evidence of adoptability 
the children were young,three and four years old,and physically healthy.each child expressive and receptive language skills previously were diagnosed as delayed.however,each child was making progress through early intervention preschool programs.neither child received services with the central valley regional center.their current caregivers saw the children as very bright they just need the proper environment,avenue and skills to flourish.
the children also shared a close relationship with one another,although each child exhibited sibling rivalry and conflict.they sometimes fought over toys and were aggressive toward one another,requiring a high level of parental intervention and redirection.on the other hand,they played well with other children and were good meeting new people.
in addition,each child had been diagnosed since late with an attachment disorder.they received regular family and individual therapy and,in spite of the disorder,had made significant psychological progress while in their current placement,as well as important strides in their attachment potential.with the help of counseling and support groups,their current caregivers saw a bright future for the children.despite the children current emotional and behavioral problems,their current caregivers had not wavered from their commitment to raising the children as their own,advising the court,w e are committed to these girls.it an adjustment for everyone but i think we are all doing well.finally,not only were the children current caregivers committed to adoption,their former relative caregivers had made a request for adoptive placement.
given the children positive attributes,the progress they were making in overcoming their behavioral and emotional problems,as well as the current and former caregivers willingness to adopt them,the court properly could find that it was likely the children would be adopted,subd.c.to the extent appellants contend the trial court solely relied on the caregivers willingness to adopt in reaching its decision,we are not persuaded.the juvenile court reasoning is not a matter for our review.davey southern pac.cal.it is judicial action not judicial reasoning which is the proper subject of appellate review.el centro grain bank of italy.
further,appellants approach the question of the children adoptability by picking and choosing evidence from the record in support of their argument.this is not an approach we may follow on review.the power of an appellate court asked to assess the sufficiency of the evidence begins and ends with a determination of whether there is any substantial evidence,whether or not contradicted,which will support the conclusion of the trier of fact.brison,supra,th at,d.all conflicts must be resolved in favor of the respondent and all legitimate inferences indulged in to uphold the decision,if possible.we may not reweigh or express an independent judgment on the evidence.in re laura cal d,laura.
generally adoptable is not a required finding 
contrary to appellants claim,the law does not require a juvenile court to find a dependent child generally adoptable before terminating parental rights.all that is required is clear and convincing evidence of the likelihood that the dependent child will be adopted within a reasonable time.in re zeth cal th,d,subd.c.the likelihood of adoptability may be satisfied by a showing that a child is generally adoptable,that is,independent of whether there is a prospective adoptive family waiting in the wings.in re jayson th,d,disapproved on another ground in in re zeth,supra,cal th at,d.however,the case law also recognizes that the juvenile court may properly consider a prospective adoptive parent willingness to adopt as evidence that the child is likely to be adopted within a reasonable time.sarah,supra,th at,d.
no requirement of additional approved families 
case law does not require evidence of additional approved families who are available and willing to adopt the children.appellants reliance on cases such as in re jerome th,d jerome is misplaced.in jerome,the appellate court reversed an adoptability finding that it concluded was based on the willingness of a child stepfather to adopt him.the jerome court held that such evidence would not suffice because the adoption assessment failed to address the stepfather criminal and child protective services history,which was considerable,as required by section,subdivision b.jerome,supra,th at,d.although the jerome court observed there was no evidence of any approved families willing to adopt the child,appellants ignore the lack of any holding requiring this proof,as well as the factual dissimilarity between jerome and the present case.
caregivers ability to meet the children needs 
next,appellants claim of insufficient proof that the current caregivers could meet the children particular needs is not only factually incorrect but is based on a legally faulty premise.ignoring the children positive attributes and their former caregivers expressed desire to adopt,appellants claim the children could only be considered adoptable because a particular current willing to adopt.appellants go on to cite in re carl th,d carl for the proposition the trial court had no information from which to determine whether the current caregivers could meet the children particular needs.we disagree.
there was evidence,as required by statute,of the current caregivers capacity to meet the children needs.section,subdivision i d,mandates the following as part of the agency written assessment for purposes of a section hearing 
a preliminary assessment of the eligibility and commitment of any identified prospective adoptive parent or legal guardian,particularly the caretaker,to include a social history including screening for criminal records and prior referrals for child abuse or neglect,the capability to meet the child needs,and the understanding of the legal and financial rights and responsibilities of adoption and guardianship.
in its preliminary assessment under the subheading capability to meet child ren needs,the agency wrote 
the current foster parents have provided for the minors emotional and material needs since the children were placed in.they have been diligent in providing the children with educational and mental health services,and have a good support network.the current foster parents have demonstrated their capabilities to meet the minors multiple needs.
the november letter from the synchrony staff also supported this assessment by noting the significant psychological progress the girls had made while in this placement.a social worker update from early january revealed the current caregivers were central to and participated in the therapeutic services.
on appeal,appellants criticize the lack of specifics regarding whether the current caregivers had specialized training or prior experience raising children as well as the current caregivers apparent decision to discontinue play therapy for the children.this criticism appears to be an attack on the current caregivers suitability to adopt,which is not a proper subject of inquiry at a section hearing.in re scott th,d.
in any event,appellants criticisms do not take away from the substantial evidence supporting the court adoptability finding.there was no evidence that these children needed caregivers with specialized training or prior parenting experience.as for the play therapy which began in december,its purpose was to help determine why the children fought and to understand the nature of their communication delays,not necessarily to treat these problems.in turn,the play therapist would make referrals for other services.the evidence was undisputed that,by the summer of,the play therapy was no longer beneficial.further,the record is undisputed that the current caregivers were working with the synchrony staff to help the children with the bonding process and their attachment disorder issues,as well as help them decrease their behavior problems.
last,we disagree with appellants claim,pursuant to carl,that a greater showing was necessary.carl is so factually distinguishable from the present case as to be of little factual or legal significance.carl suffered severe disabilities to the extent that he would always require total care.although he was approximately eight years old,the child lived for most of his life in a convalescent hospital and had the emotional maturity of an infant.carl,supra,th at,d.at trial,the court confronted competing claims over whether he should be freed for adoption by a family who would him.
as the carl court observed,the appellate issue was very is the proper scope of the inquiry by the juvenile court in determining the adoptability of a child who will require intensive care for life carl,supra,th at,d.in resolving this issue,the appellate court observed that,where the child is deemed adoptable based solely on the fact that a particular family is willing to adopt him or her,the trial court may consider whether the family can meet the particular needs of the child.ibid.the carl court concluded the juvenile court sufficiently assessed the prospective parents ability to meet the child educational needs an inquiry into their specific educational plan was unwarranted.carl does not compel a different result in this case.
adequacy of the agency assessment report 
in a final effort to attack the court adoptability finding,appellants contend the agency assessment report on the children did not substantially comply with all of the statutory requirements for such a report in appellants view,the assessment did not provide enough specificity about the children contact with their parents,younger sibling,their extended family members,including their former relative caregivers and updated information on the final outcome of the children mental health evaluations and the older child individual education plan which were pending as the agency prepared their assessment in november.appellants also criticize the agency for not reporting on the former relative caregivers as prospective adoptive parents under section,subdivision c d and e.further,appellants argue the agency should have addressed in its assessment whether the current caregivers,as a couple,could jointly adopt the children.
notably,no one challenged the adequacy of the agency assessment on any grounds,let alone on the grounds appellants now raise.having failed to object to the assessment adequacy in the juvenile court,appellants have waived any such objection on appeal.in re brian th,d.in this regard,we distinguish appellants right to raise the sufficiency of the evidence to support the adoptability finding even though they did not argue the issue in the juvenile court.this is because it is the agency burden to establish a dependent child adoptability.see in re chantal cal th,d.to the extent appellants rely on in re valerie th,d valerie,in which the appellate court determined an assessment statutorily inadequate resulting in a conclusion that substantial evidence did not support an adoptability finding,they overlook the fact that the parties in valerie did challenge the assessment adequacy in the trial court.id.at,d.consequently,valerie does not persuade us to consider appellants criticisms for the first time on appeal.
ii.active efforts to provide remedial services 
appellants challenge the court icwa finding that active efforts were made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the indian family and that these efforts proved unsuccessful,subd.d welf,subd.a.specifically,they criticize the agency and the court for not placing the children with their relatives until september.they also contend that neither the agency nor the court took the tribe prevailing social and cultural standards into account when the former relative caregivers,supported by the tribe,once again requested placement at the section hearing.under these circumstances,appellants argue there was insufficient evidence to support the finding.
both icwa and now section,subdivision a,provide 
a party seeking an involuntary foster care placement of,or termination of parental rights over,an indian child shall provide evidence to the court that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the indian family and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful.
historically,courts in california have interpreted the finding as essentially undifferentiable from a finding.see,in re michael th,d michael.the phrase active efforts,construed with common sense and syntax citation,seems only to require that timely and affirmative steps be taken to accomplish the goal which congress has set to avoid the breakup of indian families whenever possible by providing services designed to remedy problems which might lead to severance of the relationship.letitia superior court th,d.
under the icwa,however,the court shall also take into account the prevailing social and cultural conditions and way of life of the indian child tribe.remedial services shall also involve and use the available resources of the extended family,the tribe,indian social service agencies and individual indian care givers.michael,supra,th at,d,citing guidelines.
now,with the legislature incorporation of icwa standards into our dependency law,it has endorsed the guidelines approach taken in michael with the following direction 
what constitutes active efforts shall be assessed on a basis.the active efforts shall be made in a manner that takes into account the prevailing social and cultural values,conditions,and way of life of the indian child tribe.active efforts shall utilize the available resources of the indian child extended family,tribe,tribal and other indian social service agencies,and individual indian caregiver service providers,subd.b.
to date there is no published caselaw interpreting section,subdivisions a and b.
preliminarily,we observe that the agency argues appellants have forfeited the right to complain on appeal about the time it took to place the children with their relative caregivers because they should have raised the issue in an earlier appeal or writ.to the extent appellants criticize the agency effort at the outset of these proceedings,we agree with the agency.the court made an finding as part of its order for foster care placement at the september dispositional hearing.neither the mother nor the tribe appealed that decision which is now final and no longer subject to our review.in re elizabeth d.appeal from most recent order entered in dependency matter may not challenge prior orders for which statutory time for filing appeal has passed.otherwise,we assume appellants may argue the issue because the court did not make another finding until it reached its decision to terminate parental rights.either way,appellants argument is not persuasive.
appellants fail to cite any authority for the proposition that,in order for a court to make an finding under section,subdivision a,it must consider,as part of or in addition to remedial services and rehabilitative programs,the issue of the indian child placement.no doubt placement of an indian child is an important issue.the united states supreme court,in mississippi choctaw indian band holyfield,d,described icwa placement preference as the most important substantive requirement imposed on state courts.however,icwa and now california statutory law address the issue of an indian child placement separately from the issue of active efforts.see d welf.following their lead,we distinguish the issue of placement from that of active efforts.
in any event,appellants ignore the fact that active efforts pertains to remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the indian family,subd.a.as a result,even if an active efforts finding under section,subdivision a should now be interpreted to include services related to placement,it also incorporates what we would otherwise refer to as reunification services.here,there is no suggestion by appellants that the agency failed to provide the mother with remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the family break up.unfortunately,she simply failed to participate in any meaningful way in the services she was provided.
in addition,as the former relative caregivers declaration disclosed,the agency could not place the children with them any earlier than it did.the relative caregivers foster care license did not permit them to care for more than two children.moreover,those relatives apparently chose to have the children sibling placed first with them.once the relative caregivers obtained a foster care license for three children,the agency placed the children with them.even if the former relative caregivers had not been licensed foster parents,they still would need to meet licensing standards for a foster family home,subd.d,subd.a.
here,there apparently was an issue over sufficient space in the former relative caregivers home.to the extent appellant mother contends the former relative caregivers home did not have to meet these standards,we disagree.the law exempting homes of extended family members of an indian child from licensing requirements under the community care facilities act health saf.code,subd.o does not support appellants contention.in even dependencies,homes of relative caregivers are exempt from such licensing requirements.health saf.code,subd.l.nevertheless,all of these homes must meet standards to assure a court of the appropriateness of the placement.see which refers to icwa placements as well as placements.
on this record,we are persuaded there was substantial evidence to support the trial court second finding.
iii.issue of detriment 
next,appellants claim that,because the tribe argued the children were indian children and,in its view,there were compelling reasons for determining parental rights termination would not be in their best interests,subd.c b vi indian child exception,the court erred by neither addressing this argument in its decision to terminate nor finding termination would be detrimental under the indian child exception.we disagree with both claims of error.
once reunification services are ordered terminated,the focus shifts to the needs of dependent children for permanency and stability.in re marilyn cal th,d.a section hearing is designed to protect these children compelling rights to have a placement that is stable,permanent,and allows the caretaker to make a full emotional commitment to the child.in re marilyn,supra,at,d.if,as in this case,the children are likely to be adopted,adoption is the norm.further,the court must terminate parental rights and order adoption,unless one of the specified circumstances in section,subdivision c,provides a compelling reason for finding that termination of parental rights would be detrimental to the child.in re celine cal th,d,celine.
the specified statutory,exceptions to the general rule that the court must choose adoption where be considered in view of the legislative preference for adoption when reunification efforts have failed.in re jasmine th,d.at this stage of the dependency proceedings,it becomes inimical to the interests of the minor to heavily burden efforts to place the child in a permanent alternative home.cynthia superior court cal th,d.the statutory exceptions merely permit the court,in exceptional circumstances in re jasmine,supra,at,d to choose an option other than the norm,which remains adoption.celine,supra,cal th at,d.
over the years,the list of statutory exceptions has grown.see celine,supra,cal th at,d.effective january,the legislature added the indian child exception,which provides 
vi the child is an indian child and there is a compelling reason for determining that termination of parental rights would not be in the best interest of the child,including,but not limited to 
i termination of parental rights would substantially interfere with the child connection to his or her tribal community or the child tribal membership rights.
ii the child tribe has identified guardianship,foster care with a fit and willing relative,or another planned permanent living arrangement for the child,subd.c b vi formerly,subd.c f.
to date,there is no published caselaw interpreting this exception.
no requirement for an expressed finding 
appellants theorize that,when a party raises a statutory exception to termination,a juvenile court must address that exception one way or another in its decision by expressly finding it does or does not apply.if a trial court does not expressly address an argued exception,appellants claim we may not imply a negative finding and instead should conduct an independent review of the record.here,appellants claim we should conclude that the indian child exception did apply and reverse the termination order.
although appellants cite numerous authorities in their argument,they do not cite any which support their position.they also do not recognize case law to the contrary.a finding of no detriment is not a prerequisite to the termination of parental rights.in re jasmine supra,th at,d.the legislature demands an express finding on the matter of detriment only when the trial court determines detriment exists and relies upon it to refuse to enter an otherwise proper termination order.in re jesse th,d jesse,subd.c b if court finds termination detrimental pursuant to any statutory exceptions,it must state reasons.otherwise,when the trial court issues a termination order,the appellate court will assume,in the absence of a contrary indication in the record,that the trial court considered the question of detriment and will imply,from the entry of a termination order,a negative finding on the question of detriment.jesse,supra,at,d alternatively,because an exception proponent bears the burden of proof on the exception,the reviewing court properly may assume the trial court was not persuaded by the evidence to find detriment.in re lorenzo th,d lorenzo.
here,although appellants assume the trial court ignored the tribe argument,there is no affirmative showing in the record to that effect.as a result,we will imply from the trial court decision to terminate that it did consider the matter jesse,supra,th at,d and rejected it,either because the court was not persuaded by the tribe argument or because it decided that termination would not be detrimental.again,the court rationale is not the subject of our review.davey southern pac,supra,cal.at.rather,the issue is whether the court abused its discretion in re jasmine,supra,th at,d by not finding the indian child exception applied.
b.the indian child exception 
as appellants contend,the indian child exception in section,subdivision c b vi,creates a exception to parental rights termination for an indian child.there is no general exception to termination for dependent children under section.in re barbara th,d.rather,the court considers whether termination would be detrimental due to one or more of the circumstances outlined in section,subdivision c b.see celine,supra,cal th at,d.
the indian child exception,however,now authorizes a court to consider whether there is a compelling reason for determining that termination of parental rights would not be in an indian child best interest.also,the indian child exception includes two reasons a court may find compelling one,if termination of parental rights would interfere substantially with the child connection to his or her tribal community or the child tribal membership rights,subd.c b vi i and two,if the child tribe has identified guardianship,foster care with a fit and willing relative,or another planned permanent living arrangement for the child,subd.c b vi ii.however,the subdivision does not limit the court to these two reasons.as the indian child exception states,there is a compelling reason for determining that termination of parental rights would not be in the best interest of the child,including,but not limited to the two articulated reasons,subd.c b vi,italics added.
in this way,as appellants point out,the indian child exception confers broader discretion to the court,in the case of an indian child,than it would otherwise possess at a permanency planning hearing to consider whether termination would be detrimental to an adoptable child.presumably,the reasons a court may find compelling under the indian child exception will somehow relate to the indian child membership in his or her indian tribe and connection to the tribal community,subd.a.the legislature,in section,subdivision a,has declared this as an interest of an indian child to be encouraged and protected in our view,the indian child exception is not so broad as to include any argument a parent or tribe may assert.to be clear,however,whether a compelling reason exists under the indian child exception is an issue committed to the trial court as the trier of fact and its discretion to resolve whether,on any statutory grounds,that termination would be detrimental to an otherwise adoptable child,subd.c b.
we now turn to the question whether the trial court abused its discretion in this case.as discussed below,we conclude that the trial court did not when it terminated parental rights.
in its closing argument,the tribe represented it would support termination of parental rights for the sole purpose of adoption by the former relative caregivers.otherwise,the tribe advocated that termination and adoption by the current caregivers was not in the children best interests under the indian child exception because they were indian children and termination would substantially intervene with the children connection with family.also,the tribe claimed it had identified guardianship as the appropriate permanent plan the tribe later added it had always opposed termination of parental rights because i n our way and custom,you ca terminate parental rights ever.
on appeal,appellants argue the trial court should have found that termination and adoption by the current caregivers would be detrimental for three reasons under the indian child exception.first,it would substantially interfere with the children relationship with their sibling second,it would substantially interfere with their connection to the tribal community and third,the tribe had identified guardianship as a more appropriate plan.
significantly,the tribe never argued the first two of these claims to the trial court.it neither claimed nor produced any evidence that termination would interfere substantially with either the children relationship with their sibling or their connection to the tribal community.at most,there was declaration that he twice tried to arrange contact and allegedly had no success.having not raised those issues and asked the trial court to exercise its discretion,appellants are not entitled to relief on those grounds.lorenzo,supra,th at,d.the trial court has no sua sponte duty to determine whether an exception to adoption applies if it is not raised by a party.in re rachel th,d.when,as here,the law does not require the juvenile court to act in a certain way,appellants bear the responsibility to care for their own interests by asking the court to exercise its discretion in a manner that is favorable to them and presenting persuasive evidence in that regard to the court.lorenzo,supra,th at,d.
under the circumstances,there was no need for the trial court to address the tribe argument that termination would interfere with the children connection with family.a child connection with family is not one of the statutory exceptions that applies to adoptable children in general.there are three statutory exceptions that reference a familial relationship where a parent has maintained regular visitation and contact with a child who would benefit from continuing that relationship,subd.c b i where termination would interfere substantially with a child sibling relationship,taking into account a number of factors,subd.c b v and the child is living with a relative who is unable or unwilling to adopt but still willing and capable of providing for the child through guardianship,subd.c a.in any event,the tribe never expanded on what it meant by the connection with family argument to even remotely suggest that it was arguing one or more of these circumstances.
in addition,the tribe did not introduce any evidence to support,much less compel,a detriment finding under one of these circumstances.at most,there was claim of a close sibling relationship which was controverted by other evidence.further,it appears from the tribe argument that it believed connection with family was a reason envisioned under the indian child exception.however,as previously discussed,reasons which may be compelling under the indian child exception should relate somehow to the indian child membership in his or her indian tribe and connection to the tribal community.in our view,a mere reference to connection with family will not suffice.
even assuming the court should have interpreted the tribe argument regarding the children placement to be a claim that termination and adoption by the current caregivers would interfere substantially with the children connection to their tribal community,we nonetheless conclude the court did not abuse its discretion.neither appellant introduced any evidence to support such a claim.instead,they argue there was no evidence the current caregivers took steps to promote the children connection to the tribal community.in making this argument,appellants lose sight that it was their evidentiary burden to establish that parental rights termination would interfere substantially with the children connection to the tribal community.see in re zachary th,d it is burden of proponent of exception to adoption to show that termination would be detrimental.the mere absence of evidence on that point does not prove appellants argument.
this brings us to appellants remaining argument that termination of parental rights would not be in the children best interests because the tribe identified guardianship as the appropriate permanent plan.the problem with this argument is one,the tribe also identified adoption as the children plan,provided their former relative caregivers could be the adoptive parents and two,although guardianship may have served the tribe interests,the court,in assessing the children best interests,was not compelled to agree with the tribe.
in light of the tribe identification of both adoption as well as guardianship as appropriate permanent plans for the children,the court may well have questioned the tribe rationale that,according to its custom and practice,parental rights should never be terminated.in addition,indian children or not,the children had a fundamental interest in stability and permanency.in re jasmon cal th,d,jasmon.adoption gives a child the best chance at a full emotional commitment from a responsible caretaker.celine,supra,cal th at,d.guardianship,while a more stable placement than foster care,is not irrevocable and falls short of the secure and permanent future the legislature had in mind for a dependent child.ibid.the tribe earlier role in bringing the children relative placement to a premature close and current request to change their placement yet again,notwithstanding the undisputed evidence of the children attachment problems,may similarly have persuaded the court that the tribe identification of guardianship did not coincide with the children interest in stability and permanence.under these circumstances,the court could conclude that the tribe identification of guardianship as a permanent plan for the children was not a compelling reason for finding that termination would be detrimental.
finally,appellants have joined the concept of adoption by the current caregivers with termination of parental rights in arguing detriment.in other words,they do not claim termination of parental rights,standing alone,would be detrimental to the children best interests.to the contrary,the tribe supported termination if the children former relative caregivers could adopt them.instead,appellants urge that termination of parental rights and adoption by the current caregivers would not be in the children best interests.however,the court focus at a section hearing is not upon who will adopt a dependent child but rather whether the child is likely to be adopted if rights are terminated,subd.c.if so,the court must terminate parental rights unless the court finds a compelling reason,pursuant to statute,for determining that termination of parental rights would be detrimental.ibid.we question but need not resolve here whether appellants may properly join the issue of termination with the question of who will adopt given the statutory scheme.
iv.placement 
regardless of which permanent plan the trial court selected,the tribe argued before the trial court that it should defer to the tribe placement preference and place the children once again with their former relative caregivers.since the court did not agree with the tribe preference,appellants contend the court erred.
as mentioned earlier,the court was uncertain whether compliance with indian child placement preferences must be evaluated as of when the children were placed with the current caregivers or when the court was selecting the permanent plan.if it was the former,the court found the agency did comply.if,on the other hand,the placement preference must be complied with at the time of the permanency hearing,the court found the preference had not been met but that good cause existed for their noncompliance.appellants challenge the court determination for insufficient evidence.fresno county of children and family services superior court th,d fresno county appellate court applies substantial evidence standard of review to trial court finding to overcome icwa placement preference.
california law for indian children is contained in section in large part,it restates the icwa provision in united states code section which mandates that preference in any adoptive placement of an indian child be given,in the absence of good cause to the contrary,a placement with a member of the child extended family other members of the child tribe and other indian families,subd.a see welf,subds.c h.also,the standards to be applied in meeting the placement preferences shall be the prevailing social and cultural standards of the indian community where the parent or extended family resides or with which they maintain social and cultural ties,subd.d welf,subd.f.
section also clarifies a number of points.first,preference shall be given to one of three preferred placements in descending priority order,subd.c.second,the court may determine that good cause exists not to follow the placement preference in accordance with subdivision e of section which permits consideration,where appropriate,of the child or parent preference,subd.h.third,a determination of the applicable prevailing social and cultural standards may be confirmed by the tribe or by the testimony or other documented support of a qualified expert witness knowledgeable in the tribe social and cultural standards,subd.f.fourth,section,subdivision j,adopts one of the rules established by this court in fresno county,supra,th at page,d,that the party requesting the preferences not be followed bears the burden of establishing the existence of good cause.to date,there is no published case interpreting section.
in this case,there were two available preferential placements for the children as defined by section and icwa.one was with the current caregivers,as another indian family for adoption purposes,subd.c.the other was the former relative caregivers,as members of the children extended family,subd.c.what neither section nor icwa addresses is the issue this case poses,namely how a court should proceed at a termination hearing involving indian children who are already in one preferential placement under section when a tribe asks to change that placement to another with greater priority.
we observe that,were this a child dependency matter,the court properly could refuse to consider a new relative placement request at a section hearing,subd.d.once a child has been removed from parental custody,the court shall reconsider relative placement whenever a new placement of the child must be made,subd.d.in other words,it is when a child placement needs to be changed,regardless of a request,that the court should once again give consideration to relatives.cesar superior court th,d.this approach acknowledges the child need for a stable placement.
at oral argument,appellants claimed there was a need to change of the children placement because the children behavior worsened while in the current caregivers home.the record does not support appellants claim that the children circumstances had changed for the worse so as to warrant their removal and reconsideration of a relative placement.instead,the record establishes that the children behavior,as well as their emotional,had improved,albeit slowly,while in the current caregivers home.
consequently,the issue remains,because this was an indian child dependency matter,how the court should proceed given that the children were in a preferential placem
