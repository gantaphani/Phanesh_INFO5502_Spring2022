factual and procedural background 
in april became a dependent of the juvenile court under section,subdivision b and was removed from parental custody based on findings patricia used heroin while pregnant with,and he was experiencing symptoms of drug exposure.the court placed in foster care and ordered reunification services for patricia,including individual therapy,parenting education,substance abuse treatment and a psychological evaluation.the court also ordered patricia to participate in the substance abuse recovery management system program.
during the next six months,patricia whereabouts were often unknown.patricia did not participate in individual counseling or parenting classes.she enrolled in several drug rehabilitation programs,but did not remain in any of them.for the first few months of reunification,patricia had supervised visits with three to four times a week.during some visits,patricia did not interact much with,and had to be told to read and talk to him.during other visits,she kissed and fed and changed his diapers.she stopped visiting when she moved to virginia.
at the review hearing,the court found reasonable services had been offered to patricia,but she had not made substantive progress with the provisions of her case plan and there was no substantial probability would be returned to patricia in the next six months.the court terminated services and set a section selection and implementation hearing.
patricia filed a section petition for modification,seeking to have the court place with her,or alternatively,order six more months of services.as changed circumstances,patricia alleged she had completed programs while incarcerated in virginia.patricia further alleged the requested modification was in best interests because it would allow him to continue bonding with her.the court summarily denied the petition,finding patricia did not make a prima facie showing of changed circumstances or best interests.
in an assessment report,the san diego county health and human services agency agency recommended adoption as permanent plan.social worker paul ruegg noted was adoptable because he was a cute,healthy and happy month old boy with a great disposition.there were many families willing to adopt a child with his characteristics.was developmentally on target and was scheduled to have a complete evaluation the following month.
additionally,current caregivers were committed to adopting him.had lived with these caregivers since he was a few days old,and he looked to them as his parents.the caregivers were a mother and her adult daughter living in the same home,who had adopted a child with special needs and also had other foster children.although there was a recent investigation regarding discipline of one of the children in the home,the caregivers were open and honest about the incident and none of the children were removed.the caregivers knew and loved and were meeting all his needs.
in ruegg opinion,the relationship patricia had with was not parental.ruegg believed terminating patricia parental rights would not be detrimental to 
at a contested selection and implementation hearing,patricia testified she was willing to do whatever was necessary to have back in her life.she had been incarcerated for five months after surrendering on outstanding warrants.while in jail,she participated in various programs,including one that addressed drug addiction.she asked the court to order a permanent plan other than adoption for 
the court asked agency to briefly reopen its case to clarify information about the many adoptive families available for.when ruegg indicated he did not inquire as to the specific number of available adoptive families,the court ordered a brief recess to allow ruegg to obtain that information.ruegg then spoke to agency adoption placement coordinator,who informed him that based on characteristics,including age,ethnicity,in utero drug exposure and lack of identified father,there were approved prospective adoptive families for 
after considering the evidence and hearing argument of counsel,the court found was likely to be adopted and none of the circumstances of section,subdivision c applied to preclude terminating parental rights.
discussion 
patricia challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the court finding is adoptable.she asserts is not generally adoptable based on his drug exposure,speech delays and the lack of information about his paternity the evidence as to prospective adoptive families was unreliable and inadmissible and there are legal impediments to the caregivers ability to adopt 
when reviewing a court finding a minor is adoptable,we apply the substantial evidence test.in re josue th,d in re lukas th,d.if,on the entire record,there is substantial evidence to support the findings of the juvenile court,we must uphold those findings.we do not pass on the credibility of witnesses,attempt to resolve conflicts in the evidence or weigh the evidence.in re casey,supra,th at,d in re th,d.rather,our task is to determine whether there is substantial evidence from which a reasonable trier of fact could find,by clear and convincing evidence,that the minor is adoptable.in re marina th,d.the appellant has the burden of showing there is no evidence of a sufficiently substantial nature to support the finding or order.in re th,d.
the court may terminate parental rights only if it determines by clear and convincing evidence the minor is likely to be adopted,subd.c.the statute requires clear and convincing evidence of the likelihood adoption will be realized within a reasonable time.in re zeth cal th,d,in re,supra,th at,d.in determining adoptability,the focus is on whether a child age,physical condition and emotional state will create difficulty in locating a family willing to adopt,subd.b in re david th,d.to be considered adoptable,a minor need not be in a prospective adoptive home and there need not be a prospective adoptive parent waiting in the wings.in re sarah th,d.nevertheless,the fact that a prospective adoptive parent has expressed interest in adopting the minor is evidence that the minor age,physical condition,mental state,and other matters relating to the child are not likely to dissuade individuals from adopting the minor.in other words,a prospective adoptive parent willingness to adopt generally indicates the minor is likely to be adopted within a reasonable time either by the prospective adoptive parent or by some other family.id.at,d.
substantial evidence supports the juvenile court finding is generally adoptable.although experienced symptoms of drug exposure at birth,he completed six weeks of treatment and began to grow and develop into a beautiful,happy and healthy baby.his positive characteristics make him adoptable despite his in utero exposure to heroin,slight speech delays and the absence of an identified father.in re carl th,d minor was not generally adoptable because he was completely developmentally disabled and required total care for life.the possibility may have future problems does not preclude a finding he is likely to be adopted.in re jennilee th,d see also in re helen th,d certainty of child future medical condition not necessary to find general adoptability.caregivers are aware of his challenges and nevertheless remain committed to adopting him.from this,a reasonable inference can be drawn that age,physical and emotional condition and other personal attributes are not likely to dissuade individuals from adopting him.in re sarah,supra,th at,d.
in determining adoptability,the court asked social worker ruegg to verify the existence and number of prospective adoptiv
