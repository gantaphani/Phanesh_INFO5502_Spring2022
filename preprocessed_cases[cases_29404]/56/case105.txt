this appeal requires us to examine the statutory sentencing scheme of the federal juvenile delinquency act,as applied to,who was adjudicated a juvenile delinquent at the age of.after repeatedly violating the conditions of her probation,was eventually placed by the district court in official detention until her birthday,essentially a term of approximately months.on appeal,contends her sentence was in error for the following reasons the district court utilized the wrong statute by imposing the sentence of official detention under rather than even if was the appropriate statute for sentencing a juvenile after revocation of probation,the district court incorrectly applied the statute by relying on age at the time her probation was revoked rather than her age at the time it was originally imposed and the district court abused its discretion in imposing an upward departure.we disagree with each of arguments and,therefore,affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
was adjudicated a juvenile delinquent at age after she admitted to committing the class b felony of burglary by entering an occupied residence at night with the intent to steal.specifically,on july,and two other individuals entered the home of a woman without permission,stole and destroyed some of the woman personal property,and caused structural damage to the home.another female physically assaulted the victim in her bedroom.
at the time of her original juvenile disposition in federal court,already had been charged with several tribal violations and had been adjudicated a juvenile delinquent in the sisseton wahpeton tribal court.on september,the district court imposed a term of approximately years probation until her,and a joint and several restitution obligation.on december,a petition to revoke probation was filed after violated the conditions of her probation by consuming alcohol,eluding law enforcement,stealing a police car,driving a vehicle with a revoked driver license,and escaping from custody.acting contrary to what it said was its better judgment,the district court continued on probation but extended it until she reached the age of february.
on october,a second petition to revoke probation was filed after,then age,absconded from glory house,a community treatment facility where she had been placed,and failed to notify her probation officer of her change in residence and employment within hours as required under the conditions of her probation.the district court revoked probation and imposed a term of official detention until birthday,february,a revocation sentence,as indicated,of approximately months.
ii.discussion 
we review the district court interpretation of the relevant statutes de novo.united states brings plenty,cir.here,based upon the provisions of c,the district court concluded it had the authority to sentence to a term of official detention of up to years.section c,as it existed at the time of revocation proceeding,provides as follows 
the term for which official detention may be ordered for a juvenile found to be a juvenile delinquent may not extend 
in the case of a juvenile who is less than eighteen years old,beyond the lesser of 
a the date when the juvenile becomes years old or 
b the maximum term of imprisonment that would be authorized if the juvenile had been tried and convicted as an adult or 
in the case of a juvenile who is between eighteen and years old 
a who if convicted as an adult would be convicted of a class a,b,or c felony,beyond five years or 
b in any other case beyond the lesser of 
i three years or 
ii the maximum term of imprisonment that would be authorized if the juvenile had been tried and convicted as an adult.
in united states,d,the supreme court construed the phrase the maximum term of imprisonment that would be authorized if the juvenile had been tried and convicted as an adult found in c b to mean the maximum length of sentence to which a similarly situated adult would be subject if convicted of the adult counterpart of the offense and sentenced under the statute requiring application of the guidelines,b.the court made clear that a sentencing court concern with the guidelines goes solely to the upper limit of the proper guideline range as setting the maximum term for which a juvenile may be committed to official detention,absent circumstances that would warrant a departure under b.id.at.see also united states juvenile,wl,at cir,unpublished when revoking a juvenile defendant sentence of probation,district courts have authority to resentence the juvenile to a term of imprisonment,but the term may not exceed the maximum term a similarly situated adult convicted of the same offense could receive under the guidelines.united states,cir this means only that a sentencing court may have to consider the guidelines to determine the upper limit of the sentence which can be imposed on a juvenile,on the basis of the sentencing range the guidelines provide for an adult.
the sentencing guidelines do not apply to juvenile offenders sentenced under the federal juvenile delinquency act.ussg,at.the requirement that a district court determine what the sentence for a similarly situated adult defendant could be in order to determine the upper limit of the juvenile detention does not require plenary application of the guidelines to juvenile delinquents.id.at.
here,the district court,relying on c a,concluded that the upper limit of the available period of detention for was years months,because she was at the time of the revocation and would have been convicted of a class b felony with a maximum statutory sentence of years if she had been convicted as an adult.however,the district court also did a guidelines analysis and concluded that before consideration of any grounds for an upward departure,a similarly situated adult defendant would have been subject to a guidelines imprisonment range of to months.the court also determined that an upward departure from that range was warranted to about a sentence,and used that figure to impose the revocation sentence on of detention until her birthday.
argues that the district court erred by applying instead of when revoking her probation.we respectfully disagree.as we have previously stated,and reaffirm now,is the starting point for determining a dispositional order in juvenile matters,at.the court,after finding an individual to be a juvenile delinquent,may suspend the findings of juvenile delinquency,enter an order of restitution,place the juvenile on probation,or commit her to official detention.a.subsection b establishes the maximum terms for which probation may be ordered and states that the provisions dealing with probation in sections,and are applicable to an order placing a juvenile on probation.b.these referenced sections relate to the granting,modifying,and revoking of probation for adult offenders.finally,under subsection c,the statute sets out the maximum terms for which official detention may be ordered.c.notwithstanding subsection b reference to which governs revocation of an adult offender probation,we conclude that the juvenile statutory sentencing scheme requires that the maximum terms of detention for juveniles found in subsection c must be applied and observed when ordering a juvenile into official detention as a probation revocation sanction.
our review of the record convinces us that the district court correctly looked at for its authority to enter a dispositional order requiring official detention and for determining its maximum length.the court did err,however,in its determination that it could enter an order of up to years of detention.the upper limit of detention for,under the supreme court holding in,was the guidelines sentence that a similarly situated adult defendant could have received,absent a departure authorized by b,but not to exceed years.because sentence of detention to her birthday is,as we determine infra,equal to the prison sentence which a similarly situated adult defendant could have received,the court error in thinking it could have given years of detention was harmless.we address,infra,further argument that the district court departure decision itself was erroneous.
