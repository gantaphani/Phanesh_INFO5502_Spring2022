plaintiffs and were minor children and years old,respectively at the time of the events at issue in this case.plaintiff angela bayer is their biological mother,and bruce bayer,angela second husband,is their stepfather.angela bayer had primary custody of the children,and the children biological father,gabriel zhanay,lived elsewhere and had visitation rights.according to angela bayer testimony,zhanay was allowed to take the children for visits for part of one day each month.
on friday,january,a telephone call was placed to monroe county children and youth services,reporting that and had been sexually abused by their biological father.on several prior occasions,the agency had received reports that the biological father was harming the children the parties dispute who made the january telephone call.defendants contend the bayers themselves reported that the children biological father had been abusing the children and was about to arrive at their home to exercise his visitation rights,while the bayers claim it was one of the children therapists who telephoned.at the end of that day,the children were placed in the custody of monroe county children and youth services.the parties dispute whether the police took the children into custody or whether bruce and angela bayer brought the children to monroe county children and youth services.the bayers were served with a notice of placement regarding protective custody signed by detective michael robson of the pocono regional police department.pursuant to that order,and were removed from the bayer home and placed in protective custody with monroe county children and youth services while the children biological father was investigated for alleged sexual abuse 
on monday morning,january,defendant heather dry,a caseworker at monroe county children and youth services,forwarded to attorney elizabeth weekes,the agency solicitor,information involving the alleged abusive conduct and the removal of the children from the bayer home,so that weekes could file an emergency petition in the monroe county court of common pleas on behalf of the agency to take protective custody of and the next day,tuesday,weekes filed the petition.that same day,monroe county court of common pleas judge margherita worthington signed an order continuing custody in monroe county children and youth services and scheduling a hearing for thursday,january.
on january,judge worthington held a hearing at which both biological parents,as well as the children,were present and represented by counsel.the parents agreed to a continuance until february,in the interim,the children remained in the custody of monroe county children and youth services and underwent psychological evaluation.angela bayer claims she was under duress when she agreed to the continuance.on january,monroe county children and youth services determined the sexual abuse case against the biological father was unfounded,and at the hearing on february,recommended the court return the children to the bayers custody.the court did so,finding that the agency custody over the children in the period from january to february had been necessary due to the allegations of abuse and had been in the best interests of the children.
on november,plaintiffs filed a complaint in federal court raising claims against defendants under various provisions of state and federal law.in earlier orders not at issue in this appeal,the district court dismissed many of those defendants and claims.in an order filed october,the court granted the remaining defendants motion for summary judgment in part,dismissing all such defendants save heather dry and her supervisor,sat bahl.the court also dismissed all claims against these two defendants except the claim under that these defendants,under color of state law,deprived plaintiffs of their fourteenth amendment right to procedural due process viewing the record in the light most favorable to plaintiffs,the court found that plaintiffs procedural due process rights were violated based on the failure to receive a hearing in a period which would satisfy due process.in the court view,this period extended no further than hours after the children were removed from their mother custody defendants interposed alternative assertions of absolute and qualified immunity,which the court rejected.
defendants filed a timely notice of appeal.they challenge only the district court rulings that they are not entitled to either qualified or absolute immunity with respect to plaintiffs fourteenth amendment procedural due process claims.
the district court exercised jurisdiction under.under the collateral order doctrine,confers appellate jurisdiction over the district court denial,at the stage,of defendants claim that they are entitled to absolute or qualified immunity,to the extent that denial turns on questions of law.walter pike county,cir citing mitchell forsyth,d see also id.noting that,in this context,we lack jurisdiction to consider whether the district court correctly identified the set of facts that the summary judgment record is sufficient to prove but we possess jurisdiction to review whether the set of facts identified by the district court supports a claim beyond the bounds of the immunity at issue quoting ziccardi city of,cir.

f irst,the court must determine whether the facts alleged show that the defendant conduct violated a constitutional or statutory right.if so,the court must then determine whether the constitutional or statutory right allegedly violated by the defendant was clearly established.if the court concludes that the defendant conduct did violate a clearly established constitutional or statutory right,then it must deny the defendant the protection afforded by qualified immunity.
williams bitner,cir citing saucier,at.subsequently,however,the supreme court in pearson clarified that the saucier procedure should not be regarded as an inflexible requirement.at.rather,t he judges of the district courts and the courts of appeals should be permitted to exercise their sound discretion in deciding which of the two prongs of the qualified immunity analysis should be addressed first in light of the circumstances in the particular case at hand.at.
applying saucier,the district court first found that,v iewing the entire record in the light most favorable to plaintiffs,plaintiffs procedural due process rights were violated based on the failure to receive a hearing in a period which would satisfy due process.although the third circuit court of appeals has not established a rule,the court noted that o ther circuits,and indeed other district courts in this circuit,have held that delay in proc
