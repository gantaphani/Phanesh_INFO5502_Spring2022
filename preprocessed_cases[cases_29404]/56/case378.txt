alma mother appeals from an order adjudging ashley born april a dependent of the court pursuant to welfare institutions code section,subdivision d specifically,mother argues that the court erred when it sustained a jurisdictional finding under section,subdivision j with respect to ashley based on the circumstances leading to the death of her brother,jose we affirm.
contentions 
mother claims that a sustained count under section,subdivision j requires as a necessary predicate a sustained count under subdivisions a,b,d,e,or i of section as to the dependent child sibling.because the court failed to sustain a count under any of those subdivisions as to jose,mother argues,the finding establishing jurisdiction over ashley under count j can not stand.
further,mother argues,even if a finding as to jose was not legally necessary as a predicate to the finding as to ashley under section,subdivision j,substantial evidence does not support the juvenile court finding that count j was true based on the facts in the record.

notice of appeal

discussion 
jurisdiction is proper 
mother contends that the trial court erred in sustaining count j of the section petition.however,mother does not challenge dependency jurisdiction based on the allegations sustained under counts a and b.
the sustained allegations against mother and father under counts a and b bring ashley within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.as long as there is one unassailable jurisdictional finding,it is immaterial that another might be inappropriate.randi superior court th,in re jonathan th,jonathan.
because mother does not challenge the court other jurisdictional findings,we need not consider mother challenge to the juvenile court decision to sustain count j.as set forth in in re alexis th,
when a dependency petition alleges multiple grounds for its assertion that a minor comes within the dependency court jurisdiction,a reviewing court can affirm the juvenile court finding of jurisdiction over the minor if any one of the statutory bases for jurisdiction that are enumerated in the petition is supported by substantial evidence.in such a case,the reviewing court need not consider whether any or all of the other alleged statutory grounds for jurisdiction are supported by the evidence.citations.
we will not reverse for error unless it appears reasonably probable that,absent the error,the appellant would have obtained a more favorable result.jonathan,supra,th at.because jurisdiction was proper on other grounds,mother can not expect a more favorable result,and we need not consider her appeal.
ii.the court did not err in sustaining count j 
though we need not consider mother arguments as to the propriety of count j,since jurisdiction of ashley was properly established under section,subdivisions a and b,even if we were to consider mother arguments,they would fail.
mother makes two arguments for reversal of the jurisdictional finding under count j.first,she argues that the court finding as to count j was legally infirm,because a sustained count under section,subdivision j requires as a necessary predicate a sustained count under one of the other subdivisions as to the child sibling next,she argues that,even assuming that the law permitted the court to assert jurisdiction over ashley under subdivision j,the facts do not support a finding that count j is true with respect to mother.we briefly discuss each of mother arguments below,and conclude that neither argument would prevail.
subdivision j of section does not require an express finding regarding the subject child sibling as a prerequisite to jurisdiction 
section,subdivision j,states that jurisdiction is proper if 
the child sibling has been abused or neglected,as defined in subdivision a,b,d,e,or i,and there is a substantial risk that the child will be abused or neglected,as defined in those subdivisions.the court shall consider the circumstances surrounding the abuse or neglect of the sibling,the age and gender of each child,the nature of the abuse or neglect of the sibling,the mental condition of the parent or guardian,and any other factors the court considers relevant in determining whether there is a substantial risk to the child.
on its face,subdivision j does not require that the court make an express finding under section as to the subject child sibling.where,as here,the abused or neglected sibling is deceased,the trial court need not sustain predicate findings on behalf of the deceased sibling.under these circumstances,it is sufficient that the juvenile court made an implied finding that the deceased sibling was abused or neglected as defined in one of the enumerated subdivisions of section.see in re elijah th,we conclude that the
