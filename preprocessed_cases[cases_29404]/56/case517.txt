lisa appeals from an order made by the juvenile court at the june,disposition hearing welf,denying her visitation and conjoint therapy with her son.since this appeal was filed,the juvenile court has restored monthly monitored visitation through a exit order and terminated its jurisdiction.the issues raised in this appeal are effectively moot.however,because the court finding of detriment and visitation order were not made in accordance with the proper standard,to avoid any possible collateral prejudice to lisa we reverse the challenged order denying visitation without a remand for further proceedings rather than simply dismiss the appeal.
factual and procedural background 
the los angeles county department of children and family services department detained from his mother on july,after a investigation,based on allegations of serious physical harm,subd.a and failure to protect,subd.b.before his detention split his time equally between lisa and his father,patrick c.according to,then years old,his mother had frequently struck him,grabbed him by the neck or chin and verbally abused him.was afraid lisa would hurt him more seriously if he was forced to stay with her he wanted to live exclusively with his father,his father girlfriend and her two daughters.allegations were largely substantiated by other family members and acquaintances,including his mother roommate.at the detention hearing the juvenile court ordered monitored visits for lisa and directed the department to provide both parents with referrals and to secure individual counseling for 
on july,the department filed an amended petition including additional allegations of physical and emotional abuse by lisa.the department also filed a report containing multiple witness accounts of unstable,violent conduct by lisa.in one instance lisa physically attacked patrick girlfriend,jackie,at jackie hair salon when lisa showed up unexpectedly and tried to drag into her car.in another instance recounted by lisa roommate,when locked the door to his room to escape his mother,she removed the door with a screwdriver and screamed at him for minutes while throwing things at him.the roommate,a counselor at a mental health center,described lisa as an unstable,unmedicated bipolar,who was more unstable than some of her most severe patients.the roommate coworker,who was coincidentally lisa,concurred,describing lisa as borderline,bipolar or narcissistic.the department also reported had refused to engage with his mother during a monitored visit that was terminated by the social worker when became extremely upset.
at the subsequent hearing the court ordered the department to facilitate visits between lisa and in a therapeutic setting.a week later,the court ordered lisa to undergo an evidence code section psychological evaluation focusing on lisa relationship with her son and his refusal to see her,as well as lisa own psychological health.
on september,the department filed an ex parte request seeking suspension of visitation between lisa and.the application was based on a letter from therapist,patricia correa,indicating his level of distress had escalated after each of the three previous monitored visits.had stated he did not want to have contact with lisa,a position correa viewed as justified,and had threatened to harm himself and lisa if forced to visit her.the court suspended visitation pending an evidentiary hearing.at the hearing both correa and the visitation monitor testified.according to the monitor,who acknowledged lisa conduct at the visits had been appropriate,had refused to engage with lisa and had stated repeatedly he did not want to see her.during the third visit,after left the room but was required to come back in,he sat on the floor behind the couch,banging his head on the wall and crying.the monitor corroborated correa view further visits would be detrimental and harbored a lot of anger he would need to work through before he could be expected to have a relationship with lisa.
after hearing the testimony of correa and the monitor,the court found by clear and convincing evidence continued visitation between and lisa would be detrimental to and suspended visitation.adjudication of the petition was continued to november.
on october,the psychiatrist retained to complete the evidence code section evaluation,timothy collister,submitted his report to the court.collister concluded,based on testing and interviews of lisa,patrick and,lisa psychological profile was within normal range distress was largely a product of the parents own conflicts and should be required to have regular visits with lisa.in a written response to the section evaluation,the department challenged collister characterization of lisa abuse of as mild and his conclusion patrick was contributing to anxiety.correa similarly disagreed with the evaluation conclusions,noting that,since visits had been suspended,was much happier and was receiving straight a in school.she believed would eventually be willing to try visits again if allowed to first work through his anger.nonetheless,in light of collister conclusions,the court granted the department discretion to allow visits between and lisa in a therapeutic environment.
the jurisdiction hearing on the amended petition began on november.two allegations were sustained the first relating to lisa use of inappropriate physical discipline,subd.a and the second relating to her emotional abuse of,subd.c.the court then considered visitation issues.correa reiterated her opinion it was premature to force to visit with lisa.pending completion of the hearing,the court suspended those visits.the court also granted patrick request that collister raw data be sent to a different psychiatrist for reevaluation.
at the continued hearing on december,collister testified regarding his conclusions,stating in part his opinion had been inappropriately allowed to control visitation,a position that was contributing to his turmoil.he also restated his concern patrick had fostered the conflict between lisa and,even though he acknowledged patrick concern might harm himself or commit suicide.nonetheless,he discounted patrick concerns based on his assessment patrick demonstrated personality disorder with paranoid traits.based on collister testimony,the court ordered a monitored therapeutic visit between lisa and 
two weeks later,on january,the department filed a section petition requesting the court suspend the order for a therapeutic monitored visit,citing correa concern the visit was not in best interest and would seriously undermine the progress he had made with her.the department submitted an interim report recounting opposition to the visit and his statement that no one believed how much his mother had hurt him.he stated he was happy with his father and his father new family.on january,the court denied the section petition and ordered therapeutic visitation be set up and implemented at the discretion of bruce derman.on march,the court also ordered conjoint therapy between lisa and under the direction of derman and,based on what the court understood to be the recommendation of derman,authorized the department to conduct a monitored visit between lisa and in a neutral location.
in a report dated april,however,the department advised the court derman had not recommended the department arrange a monitored visit between lisa and.in derman view such a visit would be absent his participation.instead,had made the request,having believed he would not have to talk to his mother if he opted for the monitored visit instead of conjoint therapy.in keeping with this request,the department recommended one experimental monitored visit in a neutral setting to be continued only at the recommendation of derman.
by all accounts,the experimental monitored visit was a disaster.the social worker reported lisa had been resistant and uncooperative during scheduling of the visit and had participated under protest.once inside the restaurant the neutral setting selected by,he had demanded lisa admit all the ways you hurt me and the names she had called him.although lisa tried to answer,rejected her attempts and asked to leave the restaurant after minutes.he refused to participate in any further visits,even if supervised by derman.had already participated in six conjoint therapy sessions with lisa and stated he no longer trusted derman could change his mother.based on age,intelligence and consistency,the department recommended visitation be suspended and return to individual therapy with correa.
meanwhile,patrick had submitted collister raw data to a different psychologist for interpretation and review.according to the second psychologist report,collister had misinterpreted and manipulated data.in particular,his assessments of patrick and mental states were flawed and unduly negative.this different assessment of patrick effect on was supported by derman assertion he had see n no evidence at this time there is any parent alienation being facilitated by the father 
at the april,hearing,after derman acknowledged conjoint therapy would be effective only if was willing to participate the court suspended conjoint therapy and set a date for the contested disposition hearing.
on june,the court heard extensive testimony from correa.according to correa,then almost years old,intelligent and articulate,was performing well at school and happy with his father family.he continued to state he did not want to see his mother and did not believe she had changed.nonetheless,correa perceived less hostility from and more willingness to discuss possible visitation in the future now that he was not being forced to engage with her.she expressed her opinion would be better equipped and more receptive to reestablishing a relationship with his mother as he aged.pushed at this point,he was likely to choose resistance and hostility.based on correa assessment,counsel requested the court find further visitation to be detrimental to.the department also requested that visitation be terminated.
based on age,derman ambivalent prognosis and correa testimony,the court found further visitation with lisa would be detrimental to and suspended visitation pending a review hearing set for september.the court also expressed doubt about the extent of lisa therapeutic progress and ordered lisa to continue individual therapy and to complete the parenting and anger management programs.lisa appealed.
while lisa appeal was pending,dependency case continued with periodic review hearings until march.at the hearing on that date,the juvenile court entered a exit order pursuant to section awarding sole legal and physical custody of to patrick,authorized monitored visitation between and lisa in a therapeutic setting at least once per month and terminated juvenile court jurisdiction 
contentions 
lisa contends the trial court erred in finding continued visitation with her would be detrimental to and,in essence,improperly permitted himself to preclude or veto visitation.she also contends the court erred in failing to order conjoint therapy and reasonable efforts were not made to avoid removal from her home.
based on the march,order restoring monitored visitation and terminating juvenile court jurisdiction,we asked the parties to advise the court whether the instant appeal has become moot.the department contends it has.lisa agrees the primary issues raised in the appeal are now moot,but urges us to decide the case nonetheless because of the possibility she will be prejudiced by the court finding of detriment and order terminating visitation in some collateral proceeding.
discussion 
the termination of juvenile court jurisdiction renders the case moot unless a potential exists for adverse collateral consequences 
as a general rule,an order terminating juvenile court jurisdiction renders an appeal from a previous order in the dependency proceedings moot.in re michelle th,d.however,dismissal for mootness in such circumstances is not automatic,but must be decided on a basis.in re kristin d.in re hirenia th,d in re yvonne th,d.
an issue is not moot if the purported error infects the outcome of subsequent proceedings.in re dylan th,d.in dylan the appellate court concluded the erroneous denial of visitation to an incarcerated parent jeopardized the parent interests in subsequent proceedings and declined to dismiss the appeal as moot,even though the parent was no longer incarcerated.id.at,d see also in re th,d servicemember appeal of court refusal to stay dependency proceeding not moot even though jurisdiction terminated because his rights had been adversely affected by award of sole custody to mother.
in this case,not only has the juvenile court terminated jurisdiction,but also,in its exit order,the court restored lisa right to monitored visitation with,the very relief she seeks by her appeal although the march,exit order would thus seem to doubly moot lisa appeal,lisa contends the finding of detriment upon which the challenged order denying visitation was based creates the possibility of prejudice in subsequent family law proceedings.lisa concern is highly speculative.however,in an abundance of caution and because dismissal of the appeal operates as an affirmance of the underlying judgment or order in re jasmon cal th,d,county of fresno shelton th,d,we consider the merits of her appeal.
the juvenile court order denying visitation is not supported by the necessary finding that visitation would jeopardize safety 
as we emphasized in in re th,d,visitation is a necessary and integral component of any reunification plan.citations.an obvious prerequisite to family reunification is regular visits between the noncustodial parent or parents and the dependent children as frequent ly as possible,consistent with the of the minor.id.at,d.t he power to decide whether any visitation occurs belongs to the court alone.accord,in re christopher th,d the juvenile court has the sole power to determine whether visitation will occur and may not delegate its power to grant or deny visitation to the department of social services.it is the juvenile court responsibility to ensure regular visitation occurs while at the same time providing for flexibility in response to the changing needs of the child and to dynamic family circumstances,at,d.
visitation orders made at the time of the dispositional hearing are governed by section.subdivision a a of that section provides,in order to maintain ties between the parent or guardian and any siblings and the child,and to provide information relevant to deciding if,and when,to return a child to the custody of his or her parent or guardian,any order placing a child in foster care,and ordering reunification services,shall provide as follows subject to subparagraph b,for visitation between the parent or guardian and the child.visitation shall be as frequent as possible,consistent with the of the child.subdivision a b provides,no visitation order shall jeopardize the safety of the child 
the juvenile court premised its order suspending visitation on its finding by clear and convincing evidence that further visitation with lisa would be detrimental to.in the words of the court,my best judgment is that i am very convinced it would be detrimental to him and not contribute to his or to his making progress in having a relationship with his mother.i do think i need to find that he act out or whether there will be a tantrum or flunking school to find detriment.you have to look at the person and the fact that he seems to have regressed in his willingness to consider that mother is changing.
detriment is a familiar standard in child welfare determinations but,as several courts have acknowledged,the notion of detriment is at best a nebulous standard that depends on the context of the inquiry.for example,in david superior court th,d,in which the court reversed a finding of detriment based on concerns a parent was too poor to afford housing and lacked appropriate parenting skills,the court explained,that standard,while vaguely worded to be sure,must be construed as a fairly high one.it can not mean merely that the parent in question is less than ideal,did not benefit from the reunification services as much as we might have hoped,or seems less capable than an available foster parent or other family member.rather,the risk of detriment must be substan
