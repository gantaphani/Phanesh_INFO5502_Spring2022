this appeal presents the issue of whether the indian child welfare act et icwa,applies when the minors presumed father in a juvenile dependency proceeding alleges that his adoptive father has ancestry in a federally recognized indian tribe.we hold that the icwa notice provisions do apply in these circumstances,and conditionally reverse the juvenile court order terminating parental rights so that notice of the proceedings may be given to the tribe in question.
background 
on june,the marin county department of health and human services department received a general neglect referral.in response,a department social worker and deputies from the county sheriff office conducted a welfare check of mother apartment.the deputies placed mother under arrest when she became combative,and the social worker took the children into temporary protective custody.several days later the department filed a petition under welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b.
at the hearing on july,the juvenile court sustained allegations that mother had failed to provide the children with appropriate shelter,in that the department had found her home to be in deplorable condition,hazardous to the children health,and unfit for human or animal habitation.both children had also been found to suffer from emotional and cognitive effects of neglect.the sustained allegations further stated that mother had failed to provide the children with adequate dental care,in that both were found to suffer from serious tooth decay and infection requiring treatment that included multiple cavity fillings,tooth extractions,and baby root canals.the court ordered placement for the children,and ordered reunification services for mother and for richard,whom the court found to be the noncustodial presumed father.
following a contested review hearing in late march,the court ordered the termination of reunification services for mother,and set the matter for the selection of permanent plans pursuant to welfare and institutions code section.mother filed a writ petition challenging the order,which this court denied by nonpublished opinion filed on june.superior court june,wl.
after a contested welfare and institutions code section hearing,the juvenile court found that the children were adoptable and determined that adoption was the best permanent plan for them.the court ordered that mother and richard parental rights be terminated and that the children be referred for adoptive placement.mother timely appealed.
ii.discussion 
mother contends the order terminating parental rights must be reversed because no notices were sent to the apache tribes pursuant to the icwa.
based on information provided by richard biological sister,the department jurisdiction report stated that the children had seneca and delaware indian ancestry and the icwa may apply.the department later reported in a july,submission to the court that it was in the process of notifying the seneca and delaware tribes.at the hearing,the court inquired of the parents and of the maternal and paternal grandmothers who were present at the hearing whether they knew if either parent had any other possible native american heritage.richard mother reported that richard was adopted and that his adoptive father was apache indian.the court made findings that the icwa may apply as some tribes had been identified and sent notices but had not responded,and that the apache tribes,identified july,will be noticed if required by law.the court apparently added the if required by law condition in light of a comment by minors counsel that notice might not be required since richard was not the biological child of the parent reported to have apache indian ancestry.
notices were subsequently sent to the delaware nation of oklahoma,cayuga nation of new york,tribe of oklahoma,seneca nation of indians,tonawanda band of senecas,and the sacramento area director of the bureau of indian affairs.the delaware nation of oklahoma,tribe of oklahoma,seneca nation of indians,and tonawanda seneca nation wrote back,stating that the children were not members or eligible for membership.no notices were mailed to the apache tribes.
at the review hearing in march,the court made a finding that the icwa did not apply.no objection regarding the department compliance with the icwa was made by mother or richard at that time.no icwa issue was raised in mother writ petition or by either parent at any other time before the present appeal.
procedural issues 
as an initial matter,we reject the department claim that mother waived the issue of icwa notice to the apache tribes by failing to raise it earlier.the department relies on in re pedro th,d pedro,which held that a parent can waive an icwa notice claim by failing to raise it in a timely appeal and then seeking to raise it for the first time in a later appeal.id.at,d.we agree with the view taken in in re marinna th,d,which questioned the conclusion reached in pedro and observed that it would be contrary to the terms of the icwa to conclude that parental inaction could excuse the failure of the juvenile court to ensure that notice was provided to the indian tribe named in the proceeding.in re marinna,at,d.similarly,the court of appeal in dwayne superior court th,d dwayne,rejected pedro and held that the juvenile court had a sua sponte duty to ensure compliance with icwa notice requirements since notice is intended to protect the interests of indian children and tribes despite the parents inaction.dwayne,at,d.we agree with in re marinna and dwayne that the parents failure to raise the icwa issue now before us does not prevent us from considering the issue on the merits.see also in re nikki th,d in re suzanna th,d.further,this is not a case in which a forfeiture may be found because the parents have raised a series of icwa issues in successive appeals after failing in each instance to raise the issue in the trial court.see in re th,d.
finally,although mother is not the parent with alleged indian heritage,she still has standing to raise the issue of icwa compliance.in re jonathon th,d.under section,any parent or the indian child tribe may petition to invalidate a placement or termination order for failure to comply with icwa requirements.
applicability of icwa 
the purpose and background of the icwa were explained as follows in in re junious d.junious the icwa was enacted to protect the best interests of indian children and to promote the stability and security of indian tribes and families by the establishment of minimum federal standards for the removal of indian children from their families and the placement of such children in foster or adoptive homes which will reflect the unique values of indian culture.the legislation was congress response to its findings that an alarmingly high percentage of indian families are broken up by the removal,often unwarranted,of their children from them by nontribal public and private agencies and that an alarmingly high percentage of such children are placed in foster and adoptive homes and institutions,subd.citations.id.at,fn.omitted.prior to the enactment of the icwa,surveys found that in states with large native american populations to percent of all native american children were removed from their homes and placed in foster or adoptive homes at one time during their lives,often because state officials disapproved of traditional native american practices,such as reliance on extended families,or opted to remove native american children due to alcoholism in disproportionate numbers compared to other populations affected by the disease.jones,the indian child welfare act handbook.
congress achieved the goals of the icwa,in part,by allowing indian tribes to take jurisdiction over or intervene in state court proceedings for foster care placement,termination of parental rights,preadoptive placement,and adoptive placement involving indian children,b,c junious,supra,d at.because the tribe right to assert jurisdiction over the proceeding or to intervene in such proceedings would be meaningless if the tribe has no notice that the action is pending see junious,at,section therefore provides in relevant part as fo
