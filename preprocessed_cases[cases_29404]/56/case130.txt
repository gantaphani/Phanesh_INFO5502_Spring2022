on june,a jury convicted eric washington of violating conspiracy,a,d armed bank robbery,and c using,carrying,or possessing firearm in furtherance of crime of violence.on appeal,washington contends that he is entitled to have his convictions reversed because the district court improperly admitted into evidence statements obtained in violation of miranda arizona,d washington was prejudiced when the judge admitted hearsay into evidence and washington was prejudiced as a result of prosecutorial misconduct when the government,in front of the jury,referred to his custodial status and to the judge ruling on a suppression motion.
on august,the district court sentenced washington to months imprisonment for the conspiracy and armed bank robbery convictions.washington appeals his sentence,claiming that it violated his sixth amendment rights.at the same time,the court also sentenced washington to a consecutive sentence for use of a firearm in violation of c.the government this part of the sentence,claiming that washington should have been sentenced to seven years because there was brandishing of a firearm in furtherance of the armed bank robbery.
we affirm the convictions,vacate the sentences,and remand for resentencing.
background 
the robbery 
on august,eric washington met with his,including andrew carter,derrick lindsey and joe earl alexander,to plan an armed bank robbery.according to the trial testimony,the conspirators discussed who would carry guns.the conspirators then drove to the united california bank in commerce,california.three of the conspirators entered and robbed the bank while washington acted as a lookout.janett guizar,a bank employee,testified that one of the robbers pointed a gun at her and ordered her to open a teller drawer.there also was testimony that one of the robbers pointed a gun at two other bank employees and ordered them to give him the money from their teller drawers.after the robbery,special agent peter taglioretti of the fbi obtained a videotape from the bank surveillance cameras and developed multiple photographs of the robbers.taglioretti contacted the bank employees and presented them with a of photospreads of the robbers.guizar identified washington from a photospread as the lobby lookout.another witness also identified washington from the photospread.at trial,guizar again identified washington.
washington interview 
on november,local police arrested washington for the robbery of united california bank.agent taglioretti and fbi special agent roberto basteris met washington upon his arrival at the fbi westwood office.taglioretti asked washington a series of background questions,including his name,date of birth,address,medical condition,gang moniker,and gang affiliation.
agent taglioretti then explained to washington the charges pending against him.agent taglioretti also advised washington about the opportunity to cooperate.washington responded by asking the agents about the source of their information.when taglioretti told washington that there were several people cooperating,washington asked for more information.taglioretti then read washington his miranda rights.washington responded by saying that he was willing to listen to the agents without an attorney present.taglioretti wrote agreed to listen atty present on an advisement form that washington then signed and initialed.
taglioretti then showed washington photographs of individuals in custody for the bank robbery and explained the information that law enforcement had about the robbery.washington stated i ca do no time but i know i am.taglioretti proceeded to show washington bank surveillance photographs,including a photograph of a robber standing outside the bank doors.when viewing one of these photographs,washington stated anybody can see that me in the picture.however,when taglioretti asked washington if he wanted to talk about his role in the robbery,washington responded by saying t hat not me in the picture.taglioretti commented that the photograph clearly showed washington,and washington then grinned and nodded his head in the affirmative.
washington motion to suppress 
on february,washington moved to suppress his statements.on may,the district court held a suppression hearing.washington testified at that hearing.he claimed that he did not say anything to the fbi about the photographs.he also gave conflicting testimony about whether he made any statements after he was advised of his miranda rights.washington testified that he could not clearly remember the interview because he was under the influence of alcohol and chronic at the time of the interview.however,during his testimony,washington acknowledged that he agreed to listen to the agents after they read him his miranda rights and that he signed a paper which said agreed to listen without an attorney present.
taglioretti testified that,before meeting with washington,he already had been informed of washington name,gang moniker,height,weight,and other background information,but needed to ask washington this information to ensure that law enforcement information was accurate.he also testified that he did not show washington the photos until after washington had agreed to listen to the agents without an attorney present.
the court denied the motion to suppress.the court reasoned that the questions were routine booking questions,that the statements were voluntary,and that washington had agreed to listen to the agents without an attorney present.
testimony of the cooperating witnesses 
during the trial,the government called two cooperating witnesses,derrick lindsey and joe earl alexander.both witnesses had entered into cooperating plea agreements with the government.before entering into the cooperating plea agreements,they met with government representatives and provided information to them,including identifying washington as one of the bank robbers.at trial,both witnesses testified that washington had taken part in the robbery with them.
in the course of alexander and,defense counsel asked questions suggesting that,because of their plea agreements with the government,the two men had colluded with each other to make up stories implicating washington in the bank robbery.
in closing argument,defense counsel argued that the witnesses tried to make their stories mesh.in particular,defense counsel argued that changed his story after the plea agreement as a result of discussions with alexander in the van on the way to the courthouse to enter his plea.
testimony of agent taglioretti 
at trial,government counsel asked taglioretti,did ever identify who,along with himself,robbed the bank in commerce and who did he identify defense counsel objected on the basis of hearsay.government counsel responded that the statements were prior consistent statements and therefore not hearsay.the court overruled the objection.in addition,when taglioretti testified about his interviews with alexander,government counsel asked taglioretti whether alexander had identified who had robbed the bank with him.defense counsel again objected on hearsay grounds and the judge again overruled the objection.taglioretti then testified that alexander had identified washington as one of the robbers.
during agent taglioretti testimony,defense counsel asked him and about what time was it that you finally read washington any miranda rights the government objected,stating objection,your honor.this is a matter we already litigated,and the court already denied the defendants suppression motion.defense counsel then responded 
your honor,i moving for a mistrial.there absolutely no reason for this lawyer to stand up in this courtroom and make those kind of representations in this court in front of the jury.it a clear violation of the court rules and its ethics.the fact that this court ruled on the voluntariness of my client statement does not take away from the issue of allowing these ladies and gentlemen to make a determination about the voluntariness of it and the accurateness of it.move for mistrial.
the court denied the motion for a mistrial,but instructed the jury to disregard the suppression ruling.
testimony of latrina newell 
washington called his girlfriend,latrina newell,as an alibi witness.she testified that she was with washington on the morning of the robbery.on redirect,defense counsel had the following exchange with newell 
q did you call and ask me about coming here to testify so you could tell what happened,and what happened on the day that eric was charged in the bank robbery 
q and did you do that way back when he was arrested in november right after he was arrested did you get on the phone and call me about coming in to testify 
a yes.and i got on the phone with the fbi and i asked him when his court date,and that i will come to court and testify for him.
q and did you say all the way back then 
a yes,from day when he was incarcerated.like when was there when he got arrested.
emphasis added.in response,the prosecutor had the following exchange with newell on 
q you know that washington,your boyfriend,has been in custody,in prison,for robbing a bank on august,correct 
a yeah.i was told by bank robberies sic.
q and you know that he been in jail for this charge since november correct 
q in those seven months between the august guess november,the seven months since november till now,you never called the fbi and told them that you knew that eric could not have robbed that bank,did you 
a yeah.i did talk to the fbis.i talked to the other ones.i never met them,i met the other fbis.
defense counsel never objected to these questions.
the jury verdict 
in the jury instructions for armed robbery,the judge instructed the jurors that they must find that defendants used force and violence or intimidation in taking the bank money and that the defendants intentionally made a display of force that reasonably caused brenda lopez,or others,to fear bodily harm by using a gun.
the jury convicted washington of violating conspiracy,a and d armed bank robbery,and c using,carrying,or possessing firearm in furtherance of crime of violence.
the motion for a new trial 
washington moved for a new trial on the grounds that the district court erred in admitting hearsay and that the government engaged in misconduct when it referenced the court ruling on the motion to suppress and when it referenced washington custodial status during the trial.the court denied the motion,concluding that the statements from the cooperating witnesses were prior consistent statements,that there was no prejudice as a result of the government reference to the suppression ruling,and that the government did not commit misconduct when it referenced washington custodial status because the defense already had introduced the fact of washington incarceration.
sentencing 
the district judge sentenced washington on august.over washington objection,the judge included a enhancement in the offense level because the robbery was of a financial institution.in addition,although washington objected,the judge calculated washington criminal history category using juvenile adjudications in which washington had not been afforded a jury trial.thus,even though washington had no criminal convictions as an adult,based on juvenile adjudications going back to the age of nine,when washington stole candy from other children,the judge concluded that washington had a criminal history category of based on the offense level and the criminal history category of v,the sentencing guidelines range was months.the judge declined to depart from the sentencing guidelines and sentenced washington to months for the robbery and conspiracy convictions.
washington and the government disagreed about the appropriate sentence for his section c conviction.the government contended that the judge should sentence washington to a minimum sentence for brandishing a firearm.washington took the position that he should not receive any sentence at all for the section c conviction because the jury had not found brandishing of a firearm and because the judge,not the jury,found that there was a crime of violence.the probation office recommended that the judge sentence washington to a sentence for using a firearm because the jury had not found brandishing.the judge sentenced washington to a consecutive sentence for the section c conviction.thus,the judge imposed a total sentence of months.
discussion 
washington november,statements and miranda 
washington contends that officers obtained his november,statements in violation of miranda arizona,d.whether a defendant was constitutionally entitled to miranda warnings is an issue of law we review de novo.united states crawford,cir en banc.we also review de novo the issue of whether a defendant waived his miranda rights.united states williams,cir.
once law enforcement officers take suspects into custody,the officers may not interrogate the suspects without first exercising certain procedural safeguards,including informing the suspects of their rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present.miranda,at.there is no question that washington was in custody at the time he made the statements at issue.the critical question,therefore,is whether the agents subjected him to impermissible interrogation.
for police statements to be considered interrogation,they must reflect a measure of compulsion above and beyond that inherent in custody itself.rhode island innis,d.voluntary statements are not considered the product of interrogation.id.the term interrogation means any words or actions on the part of the police other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.id.at.the test is an objective one the subjective intent of the police is relevant,but not conclusive.united states booth,cir.
a.the statements 
washington claims that the fbi agents interrogated him when they asked him what his gang moniker was.however,routine gathering of background biographical information,such as identity,age,and address,usually does not constitute interrogation.united states perez,cir holding that there was no interrogation and that miranda warnings were not required when court asked defendant his true identity because the questioning involved only routine booking information concerning the defendant identity,overruled on other grounds by united states cabaccang,cir booth,at concluding that questions relating to defendant identity and age were not likely to elicit an incriminating response.
the record in the instant case shows that agents routinely obtain gang moniker and gang affiliation information for the united states marshals and metropolitan detention center in order to ensure prisoner safety.the question regarding washington gang moniker therefore was a routine booking question 
washington argues that the question about his gang moniker was designed to elicit proof that,when the confidential informant stated that rock was involved with the bank robbery,the informant was talking about washington.washington therefore claims that the question was designed to elicit incriminating information that would link him to the robbery.taking washington theory to its logical conclusion,any time an informant uses a particular name to identify the person who committed a crime,it would be impermissible interrogation for the police to ask the suspect his name because confirming his identity would be incriminating.we reject this theory.asking about a nickname,even if it is for identification purposes,is no different from simply asking for a suspect name.questions about a person identity are not unconstitutional even if identification of the person may help lead to the prosecution of that person for a crime.see california byers,d finding no fifth amendment violation even though complying with request to identify oneself might provide a link in the chain of evidence needed to prosecute united states leal,cir the identification of oneself is not and thus not protected by the fifth amendment.
police routinely ask suspects their names after being told that the person committed a crime or after otherwise determining that a person is a suspect.thus,the question about washington gang moniker was routine gathering of background information,not interrogation.therefore,the statements obtained from washington prior to receiving the miranda warning were admissible.
b.the statements 
washington contends that all of the statements he made after receiving his miranda warnings were inadmissible because the agents obtained the statements in violation of his right to counsel and his right to remain silent.
the right to counsel 
a suspect subject to custodial interrogation has the right to consult with an attorney and the right to have an attorney present during questioning.miranda,at.the police must explain this right before questioning begins.id.if a suspect requests counsel at any time during the interview,questioning must stop until the suspect has a lawyer or the suspect reinitiates conversation.davis united states,d.if the suspect effectively waives the right to counsel after receiving the miranda warnings,officers are free to question the suspect.id.however,the suspect must actually invoke the right to counsel in order for officers to be barred from questioning the suspect.id.if a suspect merely makes an equivocal or ambiguous reference to an attorney,this is insufficient to require the cessation of questioning.id.at.united states younger,cir.
there is no evidence that washington asked for an attorney.washington said that he understood his miranda rights and was willing to listen to the agents without an attorney present.he also signed an advisement form that stated agreed to listen atty present.there is nothing in these statements that can be construed to be even an ambiguous request for an attorney,much less an unambiguous request for an attorney.thus,the agents did not violate washington right to counsel.
the right to remain silent 
washington takes the curious position that the fbi agents should have construed his statement,i agree to listen,to mean that the agents were not permitted to talk to washington.a suspect subject to custodial interrogation has the right to remain silent.miranda arizona,d.a person waives the right to remain silent if,after being informed of that right,the person does not invoke that right.see united states thierman,cir holding that defendant did not invoke right to remain silent when he asked can we talk about it tomorrow.
washington statement that he would listen to the agents can not possibly be construed as a request for the fbi agents not to speak to him or for him to remain silent.he simply did not invoke his right to remain silent.moreover,even when a defendant has invoked his miranda rights,this does not preclude officers from informing the defendant about evidence against him or about other information that may help him make decisions about how to proceed with his case.thierman,at.thus,it was not a violation of washington rights for the fbi agents to inform him of the evidence against him,and his comments in response were admissible.
ii.the admission of prior statements 
during the government examination of agent taglioretti,he testified that,during an early interview he had with alexander,alexander had identified rock as one of the bank robbers.agent taglioretti also testified that,during an early meeting he had with,had named rock as one of the people who robbed the bank with him and had told agent taglioretti that rock true name was eric washington.these statements by alexander and were made months before they entered into their cooperating plea agreements with the government and before they testified in court.
when agent taglioretti testified about these statements on the stand,defense counsel objected on hearsay grounds.the government responded to the objections by arguing that the statements were not hearsay according to rule d b of the federal rules of evidence because they were prior consistent statements offered to rebut a charge of recent fabrication,improper influence,or motive.the judge overruled the objections.
whether a district court correctly construed the hearsay rule is a question of law we review de novo.united states alvarez,cir.we review a district court decision to admit evidence as for an abuse of discretion.id.
rule d b of the federal rules of evidence provides that a statement is not hearsay if the declarant testifies at the trial or hearing and is subject to concerning the statement,and the statement is consistent with the declarant testimony and is offered to rebut an express or implied charge against the declarant of recent fabrication or improper influence or motive.not all prior consistent statements are admissible.the supreme court has made it clear that the consistent statements must have been made before the alleged influence,or motive to fabricate,arose.tome united states,d.
during alexander and testimony at the trial,defense counsel did accuse them of recent fabrication,improper influence,and having a motive to lie.in the course of cross examining alexander and,defense counsel asked questions suggesting that,because of their plea agreements with the government,the two men had colluded with each other to make up stories implicating washington in the bank robbery.
defense counsel also asked alexander and about opportunities for collusion.for example,defense counsel questioned about the fact that spoke to alexander on january,the day that they entered into their plea agreements.defense counsel specifically questioned about his opportunity to talk to alexander in the van that transported them between the jail and the courthouse.similarly,defense counsel questioned alexander about riding in a van with to the courthouse during the trial,but before his testimony.in closing argument,defense counsel argued that the witnesses tried to make their stories mesh.in particular,he argued that changed his story after the plea agreement as a result of discussions with alexander in the van on the way to the courthouse to enter his plea.
thus,at trial,defense counsel clearly was alleging that a motive to lie and improper influence arose at the time alexander and entered into plea agreements and were presented with an opportunity to collude with each other.the prior consistent statements this alleged motive to lie and improper influence.therefore,the district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the prior consistent statements.
iii.prosecutorial misconduct 
a.the prosecution reference to the suppression ruling 
washington contends that he is entitled to a new trial because the government engaged in misconduct when it referred to the district court denial of washington suppression motion in front of the jury.washington objected to the reference at trial,and the court denied his motion for a mistrial and his subsequent motion for a new trial.
as a general matter,we review claims of prosecutorial misconduct for harmless error when the defendant objects at trial.united states blueford,cir.when there are allegations of prosecutorial misconduct,we review for an abuse of discretion a trial court denial of a motion for a mistrial and denial of a motion for a new trial.united states murillo,cir.
the government concedes that it was error to reference the court denial of the motion to suppress washington statements,but contends that the reference did not prejudice washington.we agree.the government reference to the suppression motion was vague and not something that a jury would be likely to understand.the government made no reference to the voluntariness of washington statements,much less the reliability or veracity of those statements.it was defense counsel,not the government,who referred to voluntariness and accurateness before the jury.
moreover,the judge acted to prevent any prejudice.a judge prompt corrective action in response to improper comments usually is sufficient to cure any problems arising from such improper comments.see united states younger,cir holding that the prosecutor misconduct in referring to the court ruling was harmless because the court swift corrective action prevented the prosecutor improper comments from materially affecting the verdict united states mcchristian,cir.when washington counsel objected to the government reference to the suppression ruling,the judge promptly instructed the jury to disregard the ruling.the judge also instructed the jury that arguments and statements by attorneys are not evidence and that questions and objections by attorneys are not evidence.in addition,the judge provided instructions that made it clear that the jury was responsible for evaluating washington statements,explicitly telling the jury to decide how much weight to give washington statements and to consider all the evidence about the statements,including the circumstances under which the defendant may have made it.we therefore hold that the error was harmless and the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying washington a mistrial and a new trial.
b.the prosecution references to washington custodial status 
during the trial,defense counsel did not object to the prosecution reference to washington custodial status.we review claims of prosecutorial misconduct for plain error when the defendant fails to object at trial.united states geston,cir.we find plain error only when there is error that was clear or obvious that affected substantial rights and that seriously affected the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.united states vences,cir.
washington compares the prosecution references to his custodial status during newell testimony to cases in which defendants were required to wear prison garb during their trials.when defendants are forced to wear prison garb to trial,jurors may speculate that the accused pretrial incarceration,although often the result of his inability to raise bail,is explained by the fact he poses a danger to the community or has a prior criminal record.estelle williams,d brennan,dissenting.this may create a subtle prejudice undermining the presumption of innocence.id.at.majority opinion.the constant reminder of the accused condition implicit in such distinctive,identifiable attire may affect a juror judgment and no state policy is served by compelling a defendant to dress in prison clothing before the jury.id.
as with prison garb,when a jury is informed that the defendant remained incarcerated while waiting for trial,this can undermine the presumption of innocence.however,the impact of referring to a defendant incarceration is not constant as it is with prison garb.moreover,although no state purpose is served by requiring defendants to wear prison garb in front of a jury,in washington case there was a state purpose for the reference to incarceration.although washington claims that the prosecution asked its questions in bad faith solely to place the fact of washington incarceration before the jury,the record indicates otherwise.there was an obvious and relevant reason why the prosecution mentioned that washington was in prison washington custodial status provided newell with an incentive to inform the fbi of washington alibi as soon as possible.the logical inference was that,if newell really had an alibi for washington,she would have gone to the fbi as soon as possible to make sure that he was exonerated and released from custody immediately.thus,the reference to the defendant custodial status is more relevant and less prejudicial than in the prison garb case upon which washington relies.
moreover,washington failure to object to the questions referencing his incarceration undermines his argument that he did not wish for the jury to know about his incarceration.the supreme court has concluded that,when a defendant does not make an objection to the court about wearing prison garb,this negates the presumption of compulsion necessary to establish a constitutional violation.estelle,at.the court reasoned,in part,that some prisoners wish to wear prison clothes as a defense tactic designed to elicit sympathy from the jury.id.at.
in the instant case,it appears that washington did want to make some use of his custodial status to support his case.in fact,newell,a defense witness,was the first person to raise the fact of incarceration.the defense sought to use the incarceration to its advantage in order to prove that newell immediately came forward with an alibi,but the defense now claims that the prosecution was not entitled to use washington custodial status to try to demonstrate that she did not come forward immediately.
as a general rule,prosecutors should not be encouraged to refer to a defendant custodial status because it may undermine the presumption of innocence.however,given the particular facts of washington case,we hold that there was not plain error.
iv.sentencing 
relying on the sixth amendment,washington challenges his sentence for the conspiracy and armed bank robbery convictions.the government washington sentence for the section c conviction,contending that the sentence should have been seven years because a gun was brandished during the robbery.
we review de novo the district court interpretation of the sentencing guidelines.united states nielsen,cir.we also review de novo the constitutionality of a sentence imposed under the sentencing guidelines.united states toliver,cir.
a.the section c sentence 
at sentencing,washington took the position that the sixth amendment prohibited the imposition of a sentence for his section c conviction.
in washington case,the jury instructions required the jury to find use of a firearm in furtherance of the bank robbery,but did not require the jury to find brandishing.based on these jury findings,the mandatory minimum sentence was five years,see c a,and the sentence under the sentencing guidelines was five years,see b.according to washington,imposing a sentence would have violated the sixth amendment because the sentence would have subjected him to a sentence higher than the sentence authorized by the jury verdict 
the district court apparently agreed with washington and sentenced him to a sentence for carrying or using a firearm during a crime of violence rather than a sentence for brandishing a firearm during a crime of violence.the government appeals,contending that a sentence for brandishing a firearm may be based on a judge finding of brandishing and that the judge erred by imposing only a sentence.we agree with the government.
in apprendi new jersey,d,the supreme court held that o ther than the fact of a prior conviction,any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury,and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.the court expressly declined to consider the implications of its ruling for cases concerning sentencing guidelines.id.at.a 
in harris united states,d,the petitioner challenged his sentence for brandishing a firearm because the question of brandishing had not been charged and submitted to a jury.the supreme court began its analysis by holding that the first paragraph of section c a sets out the elements of one complete crime and that the subsequent provision regarding brandishing is one of the sentencing factors for that crime,not an element of the crime.id.at.
the court then held that b asing a increase in the defendant minimum sentence on a judicial finding of brandishing does not evade the requirements of the fifth and sixth amendments.id.at.a plurality of the court reasoned that the sentence did not impermissibly deny the petitioner his right to a jury trial because,although the judge brandishing finding increased the mandatory minimum sentence from five years to seven years,this did not increase the sentence above the statutory maximum.id.at.the plurality determined the maximum sentence by looking only at section itself and did not consider the sentencing guidelines see id.at.since the statute itself did not provide a maximum sentence for use or for brandishing,looking only at the statute and not at the sentencing guidelines the theoretical maximum possible sentence for both use and brandishing was life imprisonment 
in united states booker,d,the supreme court held that it was a violation of the sixth amendment right to a jury trial for a judge to sentence someone to a term that exceeded the sentence authorized by the mandatory sentencing guidelines and the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict.in reaching that holding,the court expressly rejected the argument that,in determining whether a district court i
