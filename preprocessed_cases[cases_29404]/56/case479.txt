introduction 
luis appeals from a disposition declaring him a ward of the court under welfare and institutions code section based on his attempted second degree robbery,of a fellow high school student.after a contested hearing,the juvenile court found luis had committed the crime and placed him on probation.
luis claims there was insufficient evidence to support the finding that he had attempted a robbery,claiming instead that it was an attempted theft from the person,followed by a battery.he further claims that one of the conditions of he continue to take prescribed unlawful and must be stricken.we modify the judgment by clarifying that luis must continue to take only those medications prescribed for depression and social anxiety disorder.otherwise we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
on september,luis was caught on his high school campus with an ecstasy pill and cited for a misdemeanor violation of health and safety code section,subdivision a.he was taken to the office,where he was expelled from school.
while unsupervised,he wandered back onto campus and entered a restroom,where he encountered another student,colin,whom he had not known previously.he demanded money from colin,who told him he did not have any money.luis then told colin to empty his pockets.colin complied,pulling out a cell phone and an player.luis then demanded that colin give him the player,but colin refused,putting it back into his pocket.
luis then punched colin in the face.colin responded by attempting to tackle luis.the two boys fought,eventually moving out of the bathroom and onto the campus grounds.colin took luis to the ground at some point,and luis tried to get colin off of him.the fight continued until it was broken up by teachers and fairfield police officer larry banks,the school resource officer.colin sustained some superficial scratches and swelling as a result of the fight.luis did not obtain any property from colin.
officer banks escorted the boys to the office and questioned them separately.after colin told officer banks that luis had tried to rob him,the officer confronted luis with this accusation.officer banks told luis that colin said luis had attempted to take property from him by force.after waiving his miranda rights luis admitted that he had tried to rob colin because he needed money to repay some loans.he was taken into custody,and a section petition was filed the next day 
on october,following a contested jurisdictional hearing,luis was found to have committed an attempted robbery.at the dispositional hearing on november,luis was adjudged a ward of the court under section.he was placed on probation,but was allowed to remain in his parents home under the supervision of the probation officer.the terms of probation included,as pertinent to this appeal,that luis was to continue taking prescribed medications,as directed.more specifically,the juvenile court said,i want you to continue to follow the directions of your doctors and counselors and this includes the taking of medication as prescribed.
the probation department reports noted that luis had been diagnosed with depression and social anxiety disorder two years prior to the attempted robbery,that he had been in psychological counseling ever since,and that he was taking prozac and klonopin for his mental health conditions.luis met with his doctors on a monthly or basis to review his prescriptions and dosages.luis social anxiety disorder had led him to isolate himself,refusing to attend school or go out with his family.he believed he was not accepted by his peers,and that led to depression.both he and his father expressed the opinion that his mental difficulties contributed to his poor school performance.however,luis believes that his current medication is effective and has allowed him to excel academically.
discussion 
i.the evidence was sufficient to sustain a finding that luis committed attempted robbery.
ii.the condition of probation requiring luis to take all prescribed medications applies only to his continuing to take medications prescribed for depression or social anxiety disorder,and as so construed is lawful.
luis also claims the condition of probation requiring him to continue taking medications prescribed by his doctor is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad under both the state and federal constitutions.luis relied in his opening brief on a sixth district case which,he acknowledges,has since been ordered depublished by the supreme court.we therefore place no reliance on that case.
we note at the outset that defense counsel registered no objection to the medication requirement.whether the issue has been preserved for appeal is governed by in re sheena cal th,d,sheena,in which the supreme court concluded that the failure to object to a condition of probation does not necessarily avoid the normal rule of forfeiture on appeal simply because it involves a constitutional challenge on grounds of vagueness or overbreadth.id.at,d.a challenge on such grounds is forfeited by failure to object unless the error is one that is capable of correction without reference to the particular sentencing record developed in the trial court.id.at,d.in the latter circumstance,such a claim may present a pure question of law properly addressed on appeal,even if there was no objection below.ibid.
in sheena,the minor claimed for the first time on appeal that a probation condition prohibiting association with persons disapproved of by the probation department was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad because it did not convey to the minor knowledge of who was disapproved,nor did it require her to know that a person was disapproved before she could be found in violation of probation for associating with that person.cal th at,d.our supreme court resolved the minor claim on the merits because it was not necessary to review the underlying facts and circumstances,but only to consider abstract and generalized legal concepts.id.at,d.it held that the condition of probation was unconstitutionally vague,but that the defect could by rectified by modifying the condition so that it applied only to persons known by the minor to be disapproved of by probation.id.at,d.
luis claims that the medication requirement is vague and overbroad both on its face and as applied.unlike the defect in sheena,the alleged defects in the medication requirement here can not be determined or potentially corrected based on abstract and generalized legal principles.the court ordered luis to continue to take prescribed medications,not more broadly to take any and all prescribed medications.thus,the scope of the medication requirement,and its constitutionality,can be determined only in light of the facts and circumstances disclosed in the record regarding the medications that luis had been taking prior to the court order.under the holding of sheena,luis objection would appear to have been forfeited,despite his labeling it in part a facial challenge.
moreover,we are unwilling to reach the merits by finding that counsel failure to object constituted ineffective assistance,as luis urges us to do.the supreme court has repeatedly stressed that if the record on appeal sheds no light on why counsel acted or failed to act in the manner challenged,unless counsel was asked for an explanation and failed to provide one,or unless there simply could be no satisfactory explanation,the claim on appeal must be rejected.citation.people mendoza tello cal th,d.
the record shows that luis and his father agreed to the terms of the plan recommended by the probation department,although it is not clear whether they specifically agreed to the medication requirement still,luis cooperative attitude and the fact that he was already taking psychotropic medications on a voluntary basis,as well as his own assessment that the medications were helping him,may have influenced the attorney decision not to object.indeed,luis may have instructed his attorney not to object.see strickland washington,d the reasonableness of counsel actions may be determined or substantially influenced by the defendant own statements or actions.while it may have been the better practice at least to request clarification of the medication condition,counsel may have believed the scope of the medication requirement was evident in light of the probation report.on the record before us,we can not say that counsel conduct fell below an objectively reasonable standard of professional performance.
nevertheless,we are troubled by the breadth of the medication requirement as stated by the juvenile given too literal an it potentially implicates important constitutional rights.the underpinning of luis constitutional argument is that the medication requirement infringes on his right of privacy under the california constitution,which broadly guarantees to a competent,individual the freedom to choose to reject,or refuse to consent to,intrusions of his bodily integrity,and encompasses the right to refuse unwanted medication.in re qawi cal th,d,quoting conservatorship of wendland cal th,d,cal,art.i.
in addition,luis argues that he has a protected liberty interest under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment in avoiding the coerced administration of psychotropic drugs,citing williams cir,williams.williams,in turn,relied on cases decided by the united states supreme court involving forcible administration of certain psychotropic medications while a medication condition of probation may not be regarded as equivalent to forcible administration,williams found that the underlying threat of incarceration rendered a medication condition of supervised release sufficiently coercive to implicate the defendant protected liberty interest under the fourteenth amendment.id.at fn.it further found that increased procedural protections were warranted under the federal supervised release statute to protect that liberty interest.id.at.
in light of these claims,we elect to address the merits of luis claim despite his lack of objection below.people vera cal th,d,appellate court may excuse a failure to object where the claimed error affects a defendant fundamental constitutional rights.the fact that a party,by failing to raise an issue below,may forfeit the right to raise the issue on appeal does not mean that an appellate court is precluded from considering the issue.citation.generally,whether or not an appellate court should excuse the lack of a trial court objection is entrusted to its discretion.people williams cal th,fn,d.people abbaszadeh th,d see also sheena,supra,cal th at,fn,d,people ellison th,d.
in substance,luis concerns about the medication requirement are both practical and conceptual,his challenges both facial and as applied.first,he claims the condition is vague and overbroad on its face because,read literally,it would require him to take any and all medications prescribed by his doctor,including for instance,medication for toenail fungus,acne or allergies such a requirement,he contends,would be irrelevant to the crime he committed and would subject him to possible future incarceration without having any bearing on his future criminality.second,even if construed more narrowly,he contends the coercive requirement that he continue taking psychotropic medications on pain of incarceration impermissibly infringes on his privacy and liberty interests in bodily integrity and.
we agree with luis that if the medication requirement were intended to subject him to future incarceration for failing to treat his toenail fungus as prescribed by a doctor,it would be impermissibly to mention unreasonable and arbitrary.but there is no indication in the record that luis was taking prescribed medication to treat toenail fungus prior to the court disposition,and therefore no reason to believe the court order requiring him to continue taking prescribed medications would have such a broad impact.
even if such an interpretation of the literal language of the requirement were possible,the record shows that the court intended the medication condition to have a much narrower scope.as discussed hereafter,the probation condition must be construed as only requiring luis to continue taking medications prescribed by his doctors for depression and social anxiety disorder.
in light of the decertification of the sixth district case upon which he chiefly relied in his briefing,luis position on the liberty interest at stake is most strongly supported by williams,supra,which involved a college student who sent threatening to one of his teachers initially found incompetent to stand trial,williams was hospitalized and involuntarily medicated with antipsychotic drugs.once he regained his competency he continued taking the antipsychotic medications on a voluntary basis,although the record shows that they caused him to experience lethargy,blurred vision,and dry mouth,and they made him feel lousy and medicated.id.at.in light of these side effects,williams objected at sentencing to a continuing medication condition,indicating that at some point in the future he probably would want to discontinue the medication.id.at.
the judge nevertheless imposed a condition of supervised release requiring williams to take all psychotropic and other medications prescribed for him by physicians treating his mental illness.williams,supra,at fn.the propriety of this condition was appealed to the ninth circuit.
under the federal statutes,a condition of supervised release ordinarily must be reasonably related to one or more of the statutory factors deemed to advance the goals of supervised release.d see also a,a b,a c,a d specifying factors relevant to supervised release.in light of the significant liberty interest at stake in the context of coerced psychotropic medication,however,williams appears to demand a stronger nexus between the need for medication and the goals of supervised release,requiring that the medication condition be necessary for the achievement of those goals,not simply reasonably related to them.williams,supra,at,see also weber cir,weber a condition implicating a sufficiently weighty liberty interest must be reasonably necessary to the underlying goals of supervised release.
additionally,while acknowledging that imposition of most terms of supervised release do not require the court to articulate reasons on the record,williams concluded that requiring a defendant to take antipsychotic medications as a condition of supervised release requires an express finding that the condition involves no greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary for the purposes underlying the supervised release statute.at,quoting d.a condition of supervised release must meet that standard in all federal cases under united states code section d,but the additional requirement of compliance with that statutory provision appears to stem from the court belief that the supreme court forcible administration cases dictate such a result.at.
finally,williams required the sentencing court to develop a record before imposing a medication requirement.williams,supra,at.the court held that before a mandatory medication condition can be imposed at sentencing,the district court must make,findings that medication is necessary to accomplish one or more of the factors relevant to supervised release and must make an explicit finding on the record that the condition involves no greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary.id.at,quoting d.see also weber,supra,at requiring similar findings to support penile plethysmograph testing as a condition of supervised release cope cir,fn,cert.denied.d cope explaining that williams applies to any condition of supervised release that implicates a particularly significant liberty interest of the defendant,and this would include involuntary chemical castration,such as by use of.
there is a crucial difference,however,between this case and williams.although the condition under scrutiny in williams related to psychotropic medications,the defendant in that case was actually taking haldol,an older antipsychotic drug with significant adverse parkinson like side effects.williams,supra,at.indeed,the ninth circuit specifically limited its consideration of psychotropic medications to antipsychotic or neuroleptic drugs,any of the powerful tranquilizers as the phenothiazines used especially to treat psychosis and believed to act by blocking dopamine nervous receptors.citation.id.at,fn.see also cope,supra,at noting williams is limited to antipsychotics.the supreme court cases upon which williams relied also dealt exclusively with antipsychotic medications see fn.ante.luis cites no case applying the same procedural requirements to milder forms of psychotropic drugs,such as antidepressants and anxiolytics.
williams identified two major concerns that make the administration of unwanted antipsychotic medications a particularly severe invasion of personal liberty.williams,supra,at.first,the drugs tinker with the mental processes,citation,affecting cognition,concentration,behavior,and demeanor.while the resulting personality change is intended to,and often does,eliminate undesirable behaviors,that change also,if unwanted,interferes with a person,and can impair his or her ability to function in particular contexts.ibid.second,w hile the therapeutic benefits of antipsychotic drugs are well documented,it is also true that the drugs can have serious,even fatal,side effects,quoting harper,supra,at.
but all psychotropic drugs are not created equal.while antidepressants and anxiolytics no doubt tinker with the mental processes,there is no factual support in the record before us that the less potent psychotropic medications covered by luis condition of probation would impair luis ability to function,would produce wholesale personality changes,or would threaten side effects similar to those described in the federal cases cited ante.williams,supra,at.likewise,luis himself,in discussing his medications with the probation officer,reported no troubling side effects from his medications.thus,luis has not established that the invasion of his personal liberty is as significant as that involved in williams and similar cases.
we also find other significant differences between this case and williams that lead us to decline to adopt,in the context of this case,a blanket requirement of necessity for a medication condition of probation,explicit consideration of less restrictive alternatives,or,findings as a matter of federal constitutional imperative.first,we are dealing with a juvenile offender,not an adult.second,williams reached its conclusion about the required procedures under the federal statutes pertaining to supervised release,which of course do not govern our determination.third,to the extent williams called for independent medical evaluation,and to the extent such input is statutorily required in other contexts see,subd.a,that input was supplied in this case to the satisfaction of luis and his family by their own chosen doctors,who had independently prescribed psychotropic medication and would continue,under the condition of probation,to determine the medically appropriate course of treatment.fourth,and as noted above,there is no evidence in the record before us that the medications subject to luis condition of probation cause serious side effects comparable to those discussed in williams,nor do they implicate the invasion of bodily privacy and sexual function involved in weber,supra,and cope,supra.finally,because luis was already taking psychotropic medications for depression and social anxiety apparently had no objection to continuing to do so see fn.ante the aspect of involuntary administration of unwanted drugs does not come into play here.
the california legislature has given trial courts broad discretion to devise appropriate conditions of probation,so long as they are intended to promote the reformation and rehabilitation of the probationer,subd.j.there are three requirements for a probation condition to be invalid as an unreasonable exercise of discretion it must have no relationship to the crime of which the offender was convicted,it must relate to conduct which is not in itself criminal,and it must require or forbid conduct which is not reasonably related to future criminality.people olguin cal th,d.thus,even if a condition of probation has no relationship to the crime of which a defendant was convicted and involves conduct that is not itself criminal,the condition is valid as long as the condition is reasonably related to preventing future criminality.id.at,d.
in the case of juvenile offenders,the discretion is even broader.section,subdivision a provides when a minor is adjudged a ward of the court on the ground that he or she is a person described by section or,the court may make any and all reasonable orders for the care,supervision,custody,conduct,maintenance,and support of the minor,including medical treatment,subject to further order of the court.italics added.likewise,section provides in relevant part a when a minor is adjudged a ward of the court on the ground that he or she is a person described by section,the court may order any of the types of treatment referred to in section b when a ward described in subdivision a is placed under the supervision of the probation officer,the court may make any and all reasonable orders for the conduct of the ward the court may impose and require any and all reasonable conditions that it may determine fitting and proper to the end that justice may be done and the reformation and rehabilitation of the ward enhanced.
the california supreme court has acknowledged a distinction between the permissible scope of discretion in probationary sentencing by the juvenile court and that allowed for adults although the goal of both types of probation is the rehabilitation of the offender,j uvenile probation is not,as with an adult,an act of leniency in lieu of statutory punishment it is an ingredient of a final order for the minor reformation and rehabilitation.in re tyrell cal th,d,overruled on other grounds in in re jaime cal th,d.in light of this difference,a condition of probation that would be unconstitutional or otherwise improper for an adult probationer may be permissible for a minor under the supervision of the juvenile court sheena,supra,cal th at,d,see also in re frank d.this rule derives from the court role as parens patriae.
of course,the juvenile court discretion is not boundless.sheena,for example,involved a challenge to conditions of juvenile probation based on vagueness and overbreadth.sheena,supra,cal th at,d.under the void for vagueness constitutional limitation,a n order must be sufficiently precise for the probationer to know what is required of him,and for the court to determine whether the condition has been violated.people reinertson d.see also sheena,supra,cal th at,d.in addition,the overbreadth doctrine requires that conditions of probation that impinge on constitutional rights must be tailored carefully and reasonably related to the compelling state interest in reformation and rehabilitation.sheena,supra,cal th at,d,people th,d people delvalle th,d.if available alternative means exist which are less violative of the constitutional right and are narrowly drawn so as to correlate more closely with the purposes contemplated,those alternatives should be used.in re white d.
here,the trial court considered it wise to impose a continuing medication requirement because luis himself reported that he suffered from depression and social anxiety disorder,for which he was already taking medication that helped him to perform better in school.the probation department dispositional report recites,luis reported that his social anxiety disorder makes it difficult for him to interact with his peers.he reportedly becomes nervous and anxious,making it difficult to have normal social interactions.as a result,the minor believes he is not accepted by his peers,which has caused him to go into a state of depression.luis father feels this is the reason the minor was having difficulty in school.the minor concurred that he often cuts school to avoid having to deal with his peers.however,luis believes that his current medication is effective and has allowed him to excel academically.luis father reported that,after trying other medications,luis found that klonopin helped to control the anxiety and panic attacks associated with his diagnosed social anxiety disorder.the probation officer concluded th
