appeals,challenging two of the imposed probation conditions.one pertains to searching property.the other allows to travel in a car with minors only under certain conditions.although he did not challenge these conditions below,he contends that each of these conditions is unconstitutional on its face.we disagree and determine that forfeited his challenges here by failing to raise these issues in the juvenile court.

we caution,nonetheless,that our conclusion does not apply in every case in which a probation condition is challenged on a constitutional ground.as stated by the court in justin,we do not conclude that all constitutional defects in conditions of probation may be raised for the first time on appeal,since there may be circumstances that do not present pure questions of law that can be resolved without reference to the particular sentencing record developed in the trial court.citation.in those circumstances,t raditional objection and waiver principles encourage development of the record and a proper exercise of discretion in the trial court.citation.justin,supra,th at,fn.we also emphasize that generally,given a meaningful opportunity,the probationer should object to a perceived facial constitutional flaw at the time a probation condition initially is imposed in order to permit the trial court to consider,and if appropriate in the exercise of its informed judgment,to effect a correction.sheena,supra,cal t
