miguel father appeals from the juvenile court order removing his son,michael,from his custody.at the time the juvenile proceedings began,michael lived with his mother,maria mother,and father.father now lives elsewhere and is prohibited by a restraining order from any contact with michael other than in supervised visits.
father does not challenge the juvenile court jurisdictional findings and does not argue for any practical change in his access to michael.rather,father argues that the governing statute,welfare and institutions code section,subdivision c,does not permit removal from just one custodial parent because the court ordered michael to remain in mother custody with restrictions on father contacts,father claims that there was necessarily a reasonable alternative to removal and that the removal order therefore exceeded the juvenile court jurisdiction.
we disagree with father statutory interpretation and therefore affirm.
background 
michael was born in and was four years old at the time of the juvenile court proceedings.he lived with mother and father and three children from mother previous marriage to nicolas nicolas.
on october,the los angeles county department of children and family services department received a referral from the child abuse hotline concerning possible sexual abuse of michael older half sister,social workers and the police went to the family home that day to investigate.when interviewed,who was years old at the time admitted that father had touched her inappropriately on a number of occasions.the most recent inappropriate touching had occurred just a few days earlier when mother was in the hospital.
when questioned,mother admitted that she was in the hospital because father had pushed her into the bathtub while they were having an argument.she fell backward and hit the faucet.she suffered broken ribs and a broken vertebrae.mother also disclosed a previous incident in which father had thrown a lamp in her face.and her sister separately told a social worker that father had thrown a metal tool at mother about four to six months previously.
following the interviews,nicolas picked up michael three half siblings to stay with him.mother and michael left their apartment to stay in an emergency shelter.when father learned from mother that law enforcement officers were at the apartment speaking with,he refused to return home.the police officers gave mother an emergency protective order against father that was effective for seven days.
the department filed a petition concerning the four children on october.an initial detention hearing occurred the same day.the juvenile court released michael to mother and released the other three children to mother and to their father,nicolas.the court also extended the temporary restraining order against father until november.on november,the court again extended the restraining order until november,the date set for the adjudication hearing,because mother had been unable to serve father.
the department report filed before the november hearing stated that michael three half siblings continued to live with nicolas,and michael and mother lived at a friend house at an undisclosed address.the department had not been able to interview father,and he had not arranged any supervised visits with michael.mother had expressed interest in moving back to their original residence,and the department was exploring the possibility of mother doing so once it is verified that all of father belongings are out of the home and the locks have been changed.mother had recanted her statements about domestic violence,but she told the department that she had no intention of resuming a relationship with father.the department observed that mother prior statements were very detailed and concluded that it was likely that mother is now recanting the domestic violence out of fear due to father gang ties as previously reported by mother.
the department report recommended various findings for the court,including that c ontinuance in the home of father would be contrary to the child welfare.the department also recommended that the court find that c lear and convincing evidence shows that the child michael should be removed from the physical custody of father in that there is a substantial danger to the physical health,safety,protection,or physical or emotional of the child or would be if the child was returned home,and there are no reasonable means by which the child physical health can be protected without removing the child from the physical custody of the child father.
the department report attached the department prior detention report filed before the october,detention hearing,which included a section on reasonable efforts.that section summarized the steps the department took to prevent or eliminate the need for the child ren s removal from the home prior to the detention hearing.those steps consisted of the department interviews of the children and parents,unsuccessful attempts to contact father,investigation of the parents criminal histories,placement of mother and michael in an emergency shelter,and obtaining an emergency protective order.the detention report also recommended a permanent restraining order.
father made his first appearance at the november hearing and provided an address in apple valley the court continued the hearing to december.
testified at the hearing on december,and confirmed that father had touched her inappropriately in a sexual manner on multiple occasions.with respect to the alleged domestic violence,she testified that mother had told her at the first juvenile court appearance that father had pushed her into the tub.and because of that,she had her she hurt her spine.she also testified that she had seen father throw a tool at mother about three months earlier.the tool was like a wrench.it appeared to her that father wanted to purposely hit my mom with the tool,but my mom got to close the door on time.
at the conclusion of the hearing,the juvenile court stated that michael would be removed from his father.father counsel asked to be heard on that issue and requested either that michael not be removed from his care or we asking for unmonitored visits.the court denied the request.
following the hearing,the juvenile court ordered michael removed from father custody.the court found that s ubstantial danger exists to the physical or emotional health of minor s and there is no reasonable means to protect the minors without removal.the court also found that r easonable efforts have been made to prevent or eliminate need for minor removal from home.the court did not state the basis for that determination.
the court issued a permanent restraining order against father that precludes him from any contact with mother or michael or mother other children except for scheduled supervised visits with michael.the restraining order also states that father must move immediately from the family prior home.the restraining order expires on december.
discussion 
father statutory interpretation argument is an issue of law that we review independently.in re marquis th,d.our objective is to ascertain legislative intent,based in the first instance on the statutory language itself.ibid.however,we also keep in mind the context of the particular statute within the statutory scheme as a whole.given the complexity of the statutory scheme governing dependency,a single provision can not properly be understood except in the context of the entire dependency process of which it is a part.in re nolan cal th,d.
the governing statutes 
section,subdivision a provides that,when a minor is adjudged a dependent of the court,the court may limit the control to be exercised over the dependent child by any parent or guardian.however,a child may not be removed from the physical custody of his or her parents unless there is clear and convincing evidence of one of the circumstances specifically enumerated in the statute,subd.c.
the circumstance that the juvenile court found here is that t here is or would be a substantial danger to the physical health,safety,protection,or physical or emotional of the minor if the minor were returned home,and there
