the yolo county district attorney charged defendant william michael dalby with counts of aggravated sexual assault of a child under the age of,subds.a,a a counts,two counts of oral copulation of a child under the age of,subd.c counts,and one count of failure to appear on a felony charge while released on bail alternatively,the information charged defendant with three counts of continuous child sexual abuse of three of the four young,female victims,subd.a counts.
the jury convicted defendant of counts of violating section,one count of violating section,three counts of violating section,and one count of violating section.noting that the district attorney properly charged defendant with continuous child sexual abuse as an alternative to the individual sexual offenses,the trial court reversed defendant convictions of continuous child sexual abuse in counts,and.
the trial court sentenced defendant to a determinate term of six years in count,and eight months,or the middle term,in count.it sentenced him to consecutive terms of years to life in counts through,and through the total determinate and indeterminate sentence was years months.the court also imposed a restitution fine,subd.b and a parole revocation fine which was suspended.
defendant raises four issues on appeal the trial court refusal to instruct the jury with caljic no on alternative verdicts requires reversal of all counts except and the instruction on testimony of children under ten,caljic,was ambiguous and likely to be understood as unconstitutionally relieving the district attorney of his burden of proof the case must be remanded for resentencing to allow the trial court to consider concurrent sentences for the convictions under section which the court mistakenly believed to be mandatory under section,subdivision d and a sentence of years and months to life is cruel and unusual punishment within the meaning of the federal and state constitutions.
the united states supreme court decided blakely washington,d blakely the day after this case was submitted for decision.in supplemental briefing filed pursuant to our miscellaneous order,defendant argues blakely controls the question whether the trial court or the jury should have decided which of the alternative counts would convictions of counts of specific sexual offenses or the convictions of three counts of continuous child sexual abuse.he also maintains that the jury,not the trial judge,should have determined the facts warranting consecutive sentences under section,subdivision d or section.
we conclude the trial court erred in imposing what it believed to be mandatory consecutive sentences of years to life pursuant to section in counts through and through,and shall remand for resentencing.we affirm the judgment in all other respects.

discussion 
icaljic on alternative charges 
defendant asked the court to instruct the jury on alternative charges using caljic ed,which read,in relevant part 
the defendant is accused in count of having committed the crime of and in count of having committed the crime of.these charges are made in the alternative and in effect allege that the defendant committed an act or acts which constitute s either the crime of or the crime of.if you find that the defendant committed an act or acts constituting one of the charged crimes,you then must determine which of the crimes so charged was thereby committed.in order to find the defendant guilty you must all agree as to the particular crime committed,and,if you find the defendant guilty of one,you must find him her not guilty of the other.
the trial court refused to give the instruction,and explained as to,it true that counts through are allegations of violations of and it true that that statute says in subdivision c that it to be charged as an alternative to other offenses,but the only published case we have,and that is people valdez th,d valdez,says that in essence the jury should decide them all and it should state sic any offenses other than convictions,if there are any.and the crimes are not really alternative to one another.now,i did shepardize valdez.the prosecutor already pointed out that there were two cases that disagree with it.both of those cases have been granted review by the supreme court.no decision has been reached.i do know what we can make of that.but since this is the only published case on point,i am going to follow it.
the california supreme court decided people johnson cal th,d,johnson after defendant trial but before he was sentenced.johnson reversed valdez,supra,th,d,in part.it held that because section,subdivision c clearly mandates charging continuous child abuse and specific sexual offenses against the same child during the same period only in the alternative,prosecutors may not obtain multiple convictions in that circumstance.johnson,at,d.at sentencing,the trial court applied the remedy used in johnson and reversed defendant convictions of continuous child sexual abuse in counts,and.
on appeal,defendant contends we must reverse all counts except counts and because the trial court erred in refusing to instruct with caljic and failing to submit alternative verdicts to the jury.he cites the language of section,subdivision c and argues the legislature requirement that continuous child sexual abuse and specific sexual offenses be charged in the alternative necessarily implies that there be a verdict in the alternative and,by extension,a jury verdict in the alternative.defendant also maintains the trial court refusal to allow the jury to determine which of the alternative counts required conviction and which required acquittal violated his due process rights.as we shall explain,the trial court did not err in denying defendant request to instruct the jury in accordance with caljic.nor did the procedure followed by the trial court deny defendant his constitutional right to due process.
the parties briefs highlight three cases that shed some light on the issues raised by defendant valdez,supra,th,d johnson,supra,cal th,d,and people torres th,d torres.in valdez the prosecution charged and convicted defendant of continuous child sexual abuse under section and separate,specific lewd acts with the same child.valdez,supra,th at,d.the valdez court read section,subdivision c,as a bar to double punishment,not multiple convictions.as we explained,it held that section permitted prosecution for both continuous sexual abuse of a child and specific sexual offenses against the same child during the same period,and the sentences imposed on the lesser of the alternative crimes should merely be stayed.id.at,d.
the supreme court reached a different conclusion in johnson,where the prosecution had again failed to charge continuous child sexual abuse and the specific sexual offenses in the alternative.because the johnson court held that section,subdivision c barred multiple convictions,it approved a different of the specific counts.johnson,supra,cal th at,d.
in torres,supra,th at pages,d,another prosecution that did not charge the crimes in the alternative,the jury convicted defendant of continuous child sexual abuse and individual sexual offenses against the same victim during the same time period.the torres court examined the intent of the legislature in enacting section to determine the appropriate remedy for failure to plead the offenses in the alternative.torres,supra,at,d.it concluded that section,subdivision c gives the prosecutor maximum flexibility to allege and prove not only a continuous sexual abuse count,but also specific felony offenses commensurate with the defendant culpability,subject only to the limitation that the defendant may not be convicted of both continuous sexual abuse and specific felony sex offenses committed in the same period.it therefore is also appropriate,in deciding which convictions to vacate as the remedy for a violation of the proscription against multiple convictions set forth in section,subdivision c,that we leave appellant standing convicted of the alternative offenses that are most commensurate with his culpability.id.at,d,original italics.in torres,the trial court had imposed a longer aggregate sentence for the specific offenses and stayed execution of the sentence on the section violation.the appellate court concluded that the appropriate remedy was to reverse the conviction for violating section which carried the lower sentence.id.at,d.
this case differs from johnson,supra,cal th,d,and its progeny because the prosecutor did,in fact,charge continuous child sexual abuse under section in the alternative to the individual violations of section in the first instance.in johnson and torres,the courts approved or fashioned a remedy where there was no alternative charge and the jury found the defendant guilty on all counts.here,we consider for the first time the practical implications of the johnson decision at trial does section require the trial court to instruct the jury to render a verdict in the alternative pursuant to caljic,or does the statute authorize the trial court to decide which charges to reverse 
although the prosecutor must charge continuous child sexual abuse and specific sexual offenses in the alternative under section,subdivision c,we agree with the trial court that caljic should not be given in these circumstances.the instruction is designed to be given only when the defendant can not be legally convicted of more than one count because two or more counts are charged in the alternative.people crowell d,fn.crowell.thus,the trial court is required to instruct sua sponte with caljic where defendant is accused of stealing a vehicle and receiving the same stolen vehicle because he can not legally be convicted of both.people black d.see people jaramillo cal d.the instruction is appropriate where defendant is charged with both the greater offense of possession of methamphetamine for sale health,and the lesser offense of possession of methamphetamine health,subd.a.see people crone th,d.similarly,where defendant is charged with both attempted murder and assault with a deadly weapon and by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury,subd.a,the jury was properly instructed in accordance with caljic that these two counts charged only one crime,and if they found appellant guilty of one count,you must find him not guilty of the other.people lewis th,fn,d.
however,this court held that the trial court did not err in refusing to give caljic where defendant was charged in separate counts with burglary and receiving stolen property.people carr th,d carr.a burglary can be committed without committing a theft and theft is not a lesser included offense within burglary.people bernal th,d bernal.because the separate counts were separate crimes,there was no legal or factual bar to defendant conviction of burglary and receiving the property that he stole in the burglary.carr,supra,at,d bernal,supra,th at,d.
the california supreme court acknowledged in johnson that continuous sexual abuse and other sexual offenses,lacking certain common elements,do not stand in the relation of greater and lesser included offenses.johnson,supra,cal th at,d.valdez explained that they are not alternative in the sense that commission of one necessarily constitutes an acquittal of the other.valdez,supra,th at,d.we conclude that in this context it is incorrect to instruct a jury with caljic that it must find defendant not guilty of one of the charged offenses if it finds him guilty of the other.carr,supra,th at,d.
defendant nonetheless contends that because section requires the prosecution to charge continuous child sexual abuse and specific sexual offenses in the alternative,the legislature intended that the jury return alternative verdicts.nothing in the language or purpose of section supports this contention.moreover,there are significant practical and legal impediments to proceeding in the manner he suggests.
our role in construing a statute is to ascertain the intent of the legislature in order to effectuate the purpose of the law.citation.because the statutory language is generally the most reliable indicator of that intent,we look first at the words themselves,giving them their usual and ordinary meaning and construing them in context.citation.if the plain language of the statute is clear and unambiguous,our inquiry ends,and we need not embark on judicial construction.citations.if the statutory language contains no ambiguity,the legislature is presumed to have meant what it said,and the plain meaning of the statute governs.citations.johnson,supra,cal th at,d.however,if the initial steps in the process do not reveal a clear meaning,we apply reason,practicality,and common sense to the language at hand.if possible,the words should be interpreted to make them workable and reasonable in accord with common sense and justice,and to avoid an absurd result.halbert lumber,lucky stores,th,d.
section is ambiguous because it makes no reference to alternative verdicts or who decides whether defendant shall stand convicted of continuous child sexual abuse or the specific sexual offense or offenses charged in the information.given the practical realities we shall describe,it is entirely possible that the omission reflects the legislature intent to leave to the trial court the decision whether to provide the jury with alternative verdicts or,under the procedure followed in johnson,supra,cal th at,d,exercise its own discretion to resolve the matter after the jury renders its verdicts on all counts.defense counsel conceded at oral argument that there would be no constitutional problem if the legislature gave the trial judge discretion to decide which convictions should stand.in johnson,the california supreme court approved that approach as a remedy for the prosecution failure to charge in the alternative under section.johnson,supra,at,d.
the legislature enacted section in in response to the decision in people van hoek d,disapproved in people jones cal d.stats,ch.the van hoek line of cases had reversed convictions of resident child molesters based on generic testimony that was unspecific as to time and place.johnson,supra,cal th at,d.the legislature stated that its intent in enacting section was to provide additional protection for children subjected to continuing sexual abuse and certain punishment for persons referred to as resident child molesters by establishing a new crime of continuing sexual abuse of a child under circumstances where there have been repeated acts of molestation over a period of time,and the perpetrator either resides with or has recurring access to the child.stats,ch,italics added.t he legislature apparently was not seeking to multiply potential convictions or punishments for such offenders,but rather to subject them to certain punishment by lowering the unanimity hurdle against which many molestation prosecutions evidently had stumbled.johnson,supra,cal th at,d.section provided an insurance policy of sorts,a fallback position when the victim could not provide details regarding defendant abuse at trial.
experience demonstrates that not every prosecution under section involves generic testimony.where,as here,the evidence is specific enough to support jury verdicts convicting a defendant of both continuous child sexual abuse and separate,specific counts of sexual abuse,the only principled way for either a jury or trial judge to differentiate between the violation and the specific offense or offenses is by length of sentence.however,the jury is not privy to that information.indeed,it is instructed not to consider penalty when deciding an accused guilt or innocence.people shannon d,see caljic ed.to ask the jury to return alternative verdicts in cases alleging continuous child sexual abuse and specific acts of abuse in the there is no other basis for differentiating between the jury to speculate on penalty.
the legislature can not have intended the jury to unlawfully consider penalty in deciding whether to convict or acquit a defendant of the alternative counts.in any event,we will not condone such an absurd result by adding language to section to require the jury to return alternative verdicts.
defendant also contends the trial court decision to reverse his convictions under section does not meet the due process requirements articulated in hicks oklahoma,d hicks.unlike california,in oklahoma a convicted defendant was entitled to have the jury fix his punishment under statutory law.the court instructed the jury in accordance with the recidivist statute then in effect that if it found hicks guilty,it was required to impose a mandatory term.the jury returned a guilty verdict and imposed the mandatory term.id.at.at,d at.after hicks conviction,the oklahoma court of criminal appeals declared the mandatory sentence unconstitutional in another case.hicks unsuccessfully sought to have his sentence set aside as well.the oklahoma court of criminal appeals reasoned that the unconstitutional statute did not prejudice him because his sentence was within the range of punishment the jury could have imposed.the united states supreme court granted certiorari and vacated the judgment.it ruled there was a substantial possibility the jury would have returned a sentence of less than years had it been instructed correctly.id.at.at,d at.
in this case,defendant maintains that if the jury had been given the option of alternative verdicts,it may well have determined that the charges of continuous sexual abuse more accurately reflected the state of the evidence.he insists this was structural error subject to per se reversal.the principal flaw in defendant argument is that section does not state whether the jury or the trial court determines which of the alternative charges the defendant shall stand convicted.we already concluded the legislature could not have intended that the jury be required to make that determination.
caljic on children testimony 
the trial court instructed the jury with caljic ed on how to evaluate the testimony of a child under ten years of age.the instruction read 
in evaluating the testimony of a child ten years of age or younger,you should consider all of the factors surrounding the child testimony,including the age of the child and any evidence regarding the child level of cognitive development.
a child,because of age and level of cognitive development,may perform differently than an adult as a witness,but that does not mean that a child is any more or less believable than an adult.you should not discount or distrust the testimony of a child solely because he or she is a child.
when i use the word cognitive,that means the child ability to perceive,to understand,to remember and to communicate any matter about which the child has knowledge.
defendant acknowledges that courts have upheld caljic against the claim it confers special deference to a child testimony,thereby reducing the prosecution burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.see people jones th,d people gilbert th,d gilbert and people harlan d.at the same time,defendant contends that these cases glibly overlook serious problems inhering in the instruction loose and inconsistent use of language.he insists that the instruction is at least ambiguous and there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury understood the instruction in accord with an unconstitutional meaning.defendant challenge focuses on the first sentence of the second paragraph of the instruction.he complains the disclaimer of a substantial difference between children and adults is un true if age and level of cognitive development refers to the child ability to have perceived,understood,and remembered the events to which he is testifying in court.these matters go directly and fundamentally to the issue of the child credibility and not to the child capacity to conduct himself or herself in court as an adult.we reject defendant contentions.
first,there is no ambiguity in the instruction.reasonable jurors would understand that it refers to the child ability to perceive,understand and remember the events about which she was testifying in simply her capacity to conduct herself in court as an adult.
second,caljic does not suggest that jurors ignore other factors relevant to assessing credibility.gilbert,supra,th at,d.the child level of cognitive development is just one factor to be considered.caljic.moreover,we assess the correctness of a particular jury instruction in the context of other instructions read by the trial court.people musselwhite cal th,d.here,the jury was instructed with caljic,which lists all the factors relevant to witness credibility,including the ability to perceive and remember.
sentencing under sections and 
the jury convicted defendant of counts of violating section,which carries a penalty of years to life for each conviction,subd.b.the trial court imposed consecutive sentences pursuant to section,subdivision d,which reads 
a full,separate,and consecutive term shall be served for each violation of section,other than an assault with intent to commit mayhem,provided that the person has been convicted previously of violating section for an offense other than an assault with intent to commit mayhem,paragraph,or of subdivision a of section,paragraph,or of subdivision a of section,section,subdivision b of section,subdivision a of section,of committing sodomy in violation of subdivision k of section,of committing oral copulation in violation of subdivision k of section,or of committing sodomy or oral copulation in violation of section or by force,violence,duress,menace,or fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury on the victim or another person if the crimes involve separate victims or involve the same victim on separate occasions.
defendant points out that section is not an offense listed in section as subject to mandatory sentencing and can not be read into d without abusing the rules of statutory construction.he contends the case must be remanded to allow the trial court to consider concurrent sentences for his convictions under section which it mistakenly believed subject to the mandatory consecutive sentencing provisions of section,subdivision d.he acknowledges people jimenez th,d jimenez,which he says misapplies these rules to find that section is in fact within the provisions of d.we agree with defendant criticism of the jimenez analysis and conclude the trial court erred in sentencing defendant to consecutive terms under the mandatory provisions of section,subdivision d.
in jimenez,a jury convicted defendant of two counts of violating section,subdivision a,for committing forcible sodomy on a child under the age of years and more than years younger than himself.the court sentenced him to consecutive terms of years to life.jimenez,supra,th at,d.jimenez argued on appeal that he was convicted of violating section,not section,and therefore consecutive sentencing was not required.id.at,d.the appellate court rejected jimenez argument after construing sections and to effectuate what it determined to be legislative intent.id.at,d.
we quote the jimenez analysis in its entirety section was enacted in stats,ch,section followed in stats,ch.in enacting subsequent statutes,the legislature is presumed to be aware of existing statutes and judicial decisions.citation.
section and section serve two different objectives.subdivision d of section aggravates sex offenses involving multiple victims or multiple offenses.it was intended by the legislature to provide increased punishment for cases where defendant culpability is increased by the number and violence of his crimes.citation.section was enacted for a different purpose.it increases the penalties for enumerated sexual offenses where the victim is under years of age and the perpetrator is more than years older than the victim.thus,the legislature intended to aggravate punishment for forcible sexual offenses where the defendant culpability is increased by a substantial age disparity.
defendant correctly points out that section,subdivision d does not explicitly provide that it applies to violations of section.however,he makes too much of this omission,ignoring the fact that violation of section is one of the predicate offenses of section one committing a forcible sodomy offense with the prescribed age disparity violates section.when the jury found defendant had violated section under the circumstances presented here,it necessarily found he had violated section and he had done so by force or fear.thus,the factual predicate necessary to apply section,subdivision d was proved beyond a reasonable doubt.
it would be irrational to suppose the legislature intended that criminals who commit multiple violent sexual offenses would be exempt from the aggravated punishment prescribed by section merely because their victims happened to be children under age who were or more years younger than they.defendant does not proffer any decisional or historical support for his assertion that by enacting section the legislature created a separate sentencing scheme for violent sexual offenders who prey on a particular class of victims.he fails to account for the fact that characterization of section as such would work to the advantage of pedophiles by exempting them from the additional penalties that would ordinarily result when they commit multiple offenses or prey upon more than one victim.jimenez,supra,th at,d.
we disagree with the conclusion that it is irrational to suppose the legislature intended to exclude those convicted of violating section from the aggravated punishment prescribed by section because of the aggravated circumstances of the crime.jimenez,supra,th at,d.as the jimenez court observed,the legislature enacted section in,years after it adopted section.stats,ch,stats,ch.we,like the jimenez court,presume the legislature was aware of the mandatory provisions of section when it drafted the language of section.jimenez,supra,at,d.we also presume the legislature was aware that section,subdivision b provides for an aggravated sentence of years to life for each violation,and that section gave the trial court discretion to sentence multiple violations consecutively or concurrently.given this sentencing scheme,we conclude it was logical,not absurd,for the legislature to exclude violations of section from the mandatory provisions of section,subdivision d.there was no need to enhance what was already an enhanced sentence.for these reasons,we decline to amend section judicially to include violations of section in its mandatory provisions.
the trial court sentenced defendant to consecutive terms of years to life in counts to,to,and under a mistaken belief section made consecutive sentencing mandatory.we shall remand for resentencing to permit the court to exercise its discretion to sentence defendant either consecutively or concurrently on those counts.
sentencing under blakely 
applying the sixth amendment to the united states constitution,the united states supreme court held in apprendi new jersey,d apprendi that other than the fact of a prior conviction,any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the statutory maximum must be tried to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.id.at.at,d at.for this purpose,the statutory maximum is the maximum sentence that a court could impose based solely on facts reflected by a jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.thus,when a sentencing court authority to impose an enhanced sentence depends upon additional factual findings,there is a right to a jury trial and proof beyond a reasonable doubt on the additional facts.blakely,supra,at.at,d at.
defendant argues the trial court denied him his right to jury trial under apprendi and blakely by reversing his continuous child abuse convictions in counts,and,and sentencing him on the specific counts of child sexual abuse and ruling that consecutive sentences were warranted under section,subdivision d or sections and.we consider and reject each argument in turn 
sentencing on the alternative counts 
we already rejected defendant contention that the trial court should have instructed the jury in accordance with caljic and allowed it to determine which of the alternative counts defendant should stand specific counts of child sexual abuse or the three counts of continuous child sexual abuse in his supplemental brief,defendant contends that the trial court decision to sentence defendant on the individual counts can not be turned into a sentencing technique to avoid sixth amendment implications or cure the lack of a jury determination.he maintains that blakely imposes the requirement of a jury determination even if the decision is deemed a sentencing procedure.
defendant bases his blakely claim on the fact the trial court election to sentence defendant on the specific counts of child sexual abuse results in a sentence greater than the statutory maximum sentence on the counts of continuous child sexual abuse which were reversed.he argues if the trial court chooses the counts of conviction resulting in the higher sentence,then the higher sentence has been chosen predicated on a finding of guilt for one set of counts and innocence or for another.if the higher sentence imposed does not exceed the statutory maximum for the higher sentence itself,it does exceed the statutory maximum of the lower sentence,and this increase in punishment would not be possible without the findings of acquittal and conviction.
the principal difficulty with defendant argument is that the jury found defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt on the specific counts of child sexual abuse and on the three counts of continuous child sexual abuse.that was all the trial court needed in order to sentence on either.defendant had notice by virtue of the express statutory language that guilty verdicts on the counts of violating section subjected him to a term of years to life on each count,and that the guilty verdicts on the three counts of violating section subjected him to a term of up to years on each count,subd.b,subd.a.he also had notice before sentencing,based on the decision in johnson,that he could not stand convicted of both continuous child sexual abuse and the specific acts of child sexual abuse.here,as in johnson,reversal of the three counts of continuous child sexual abuse was simply a remedy employed by the court to effectuate the holding that under section,subdivision d,the prosecution could not obtain convictions on the alternative counts.see johnson,supra,cal th at,d.contrary to defendant suggestion,the court did not base its reversal of the counts of continuous child sexual abuse on a finding of innocence or.
here,the record makes clear that the trial court did not rely on any additional factual findings in electing to sentence on the specific counts.compare blakely,supra,at pp.at,d at.nor was defendant sentenced without notice beyond what the law allowed.id.at.at,d at.accordingly,the trial court decision to sentence defendant on the specific counts of child sexual abuse,rather than the three counts of continuous child sexual abuse,did not violate the rule of apprendi and blakely.
consecutive sentences 
defendant also argues the trial court had no power to impose consecutive sentences,either for the failure to appear or for the counts of section,in the absence of a jury determination of the facts warranting the imposition of the consecutive sentences.original italics.we already concluded that the trial court mistakenly believed that section,subdivision d made consecutive sentencing mandatory on defendant convictions of vi
