appeals from juvenile court orders finding that he committed first degree burglary and declaring him to be a ward of the court.he argues that the court wrongly admitted expert testimony about a palm print implicating him in the burglary and that there was insufficient evidence to sustain the burglary finding.we disagree and affirm.
factual and procedural background 
on october,marlene left her antioch house at after making sure the doors and windows were locked.when she returned at that afternoon,she found mail strewn about in the entryway and hallway and a bedroom window open.she realized that something was wrong and called the antioch police.jewelry,money,ipods,and a camera were missing,and someone had unplugged her television and stereo equipment and moved a television and other electronic equipment next to the back door.
antioch police officer blair benzler responded to marlene call.he identified the open bedroom window as the burglar likely point of entry.the window was accessible only from the house backyard,and it was not visible from the street.the glass in the window was unbroken,but the screen was cut.several smudges and fingerprints were on the glass.benzler suspected that the burglar avoided breaking the glass by forcing the window past the locking mechanism.he lifted several prints from the window,including a palm print on the outside of the glass.at the time of the burglary,marlene lived alone and did not know 
a week after the burglary,was arrested in an unrelated matter and fingerprinted.
in mid,a fingerprint examiner with the contra costa sheriff department crime laboratory,stephanie souza,examined the palm print from marlene window.she submitted the print to a computerized search on a state database of fingerprints.after the search generated possible matches,souza compared the palm print taken from marlene window with prints taken at the time of his unrelated arrest and concluded that the palm print was.
in january,an antioch police officer questioned about the burglary.denied any knowledge of it and claimed to have no memory of being near marlene house in.
about five months later,the contra costa county district attorney filed a petition under welfare and institutions code section,subdivision a seeking to have declared a ward of the court.the petition alleged that had committed one count of first degree burglary by entering a house with intent to commit larceny and a felony,subd.a.before the jurisdictional hearing,moved to exclude souza testimony.he contended that this testimony would be improper under people kelly cal d,kelly because there was no longer general acceptance of fingerprint comparison in the relevant scientific community.id.at.in support of his motion,submitted two affidavits from research scientists and a copy of a presentation by the honorable harry edwards on a report by the national academy of sciences edwards,the nas report on forensic sciences what it means for the bench and bar may,edwards presentation conference paper discussing national academy of sciences report,all of which questioned the reliability and validity of fingerprint comparisons for identification purposes 
the jurisdictional hearing took place in the spring of.the court heard souza testimony while taking the motion to exclude it under advisement.souza testified that in identifying the print from marlene window as,she used the ace v analysis,comparison,evaluation,verification method.the first step of the ace v method analysis is to determine whether the print is sufficiently detailed to be usable for comparison purposes.the next step comparison is to compare the print to another known print.the third step evaluation is to evaluate and deduce whether the prints match based on their similarities and differences.the final step verification is to have another analyst verify the conclusion.
souza testified that,in accordance with this method,she determined that the palm print from marlene window was usable,selected comparison points on the print,and submitted the print to a search on a california department of justice fingerprint database.this search generated potential matches in alameda and contra costa counties,ranked according to how closely they matched the print souza submitted.was ranked first on the list of potential matches.souza then compared the palm print taken from marlene window with prints taken at the time of the unrelated arrest.she explained that her laboratory required examiners to find at least eight points of similarity and no unexplainable discrepancies before making an identification.she identified points of similarity between the print taken from marlene window and print taken at the time of the unrelated arrest,and she determined that they matched.two other fingerprint examiners verified her conclusion.copies of the palm print from marlene window and prints were introduced into evidence.
the defense souza at length.souza acknowledged that fingerprint comparison is subjective,that there is no established error rate,and that no studies suggest that the process is infallible.she testified that she was familiar with research critiquing the ace v method and that she was aware of various cases in which fingerprint comparison resulted in false identifications.
in its case,the defense argued that it would have been unlikely for to have been near marlene house at the time of the burglary.it pointed out that walked to school,which was only miles from his home,and that marlene house was miles from his home and miles from his school.the defense also pointed out that was not marked absent from school on the day of the burglary and had signed a contract setting his school hours as to 
at the close of evidence,the court denied the motion to exclude souza testimony after hearing argument on it and then sustained the burglary allegation.at the dispositional hearing,the court declared to be a ward of the court and placed him at the orin allen youth rehabilitation facility for nine months.
discussiona.the kelly rule does not apply to fingerprint comparison testimony.
argues that souza testimony was inadmissible because it failed to satisfy kelly,supra,cal d.while a trial court decision to admit expert testimony generally is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard,we review de novo any conclusions of law on which the trial court ruling rests.sargon enterprises,university of southern california cal th,d.we conclude as a matter of law that the ace v method of fingerprint comparison is not the type of scientific technique governed by kelly.thus,we affirm the trial court admission of souza testimony because does not argue that the evidence should have been excluded for any reason other than its failure to satisfy kelly.
in kelly,the california supreme court adopted the rule of frye united states frye governing the admissibility of expert testimony that relies on a new scientific technique.kelly,supra,cal d at.when a party seeks to introduce evidence relying on a new scientific technique,kelly requires the party to show general acceptance of the new technique in the relevant scientific community as well as the witness qualification as an expert and use of the correct scientific procedures in employing the technique.ibid.these requirements,which we shall refer to as the kelly rule,apply in juvenile court because they arise out of rules of evidence established by the evidence code and by judicial decision.welf.
the primary purpose of the kelly rule is to protect the jury from techniques which,though new,novel,or experimental,convey a misleading aura of certainty.people stoll cal d.this danger arises when techniques seem scientific and infallible,but actually are not.people webb cal th,d.the kelly rule is intended to forestall the jury uncritical acceptance of scientific evidence or technology that is so foreign to everyday experience as to be unusually difficult for laypersons to evaluate.people venegas cal th,d.because the inventions and discoveries which could be considered scientific have become virtually limitless,the determination whether expert testimony relies on a scientific technique is made in light of this narrow common
