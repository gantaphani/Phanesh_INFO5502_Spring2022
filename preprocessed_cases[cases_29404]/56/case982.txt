appellant,jimmy,was years old when his cousin reported to family members that jimmy had sexually abused her.jimmy mother took both children to a hospital,where the police were called.a detective from the special victims squad arrived and arranged for jimmy,his mother,his cousin,and the cousin mother to be taken to a child advocacy center.
after initially being placed in separate rooms,jimmy and his mother sat together in a waiting room while the detective interviewed the cousin and her mother.the girl described an incident of sexual abuse that had occurred earlier that evening.she added that she was afraid of jimmy because he had sexually abused her one afternoon four months earlier.
the detective took jimmy and his mother to a juvenile interview room,where she explained the allegations against him and read miranda warnings to jimmy in english and to his mother in spanish,according to their preferences.the version of the miranda warnings that the detective read to jimmy,designed for use with juveniles,explains each of the rights in simple language.each time one of the rights was stated,jimmy responded,without hesitation,that he understood the right the same was true of his mother.jimmy mother also reread the warnings herself and both jimmy and his mother signed the miranda waivers.
the detective asked jimmy mother,in spanish,for permission to speak with him alone,adding that children sometimes do not feel comfortable talking to a detective in front of a parent.the mother did not respond immediately,but after jimmy consented to talk with the detective alone,the mother agreed,and left the juvenile interview room.
the detective told jimmy that he should tell her exactly what had happened,adding that,if he did so,he would get some help,if he needed it.as the detective later recalled the conversation,she indicated that he would be able to get psychiatric or counseling help,if necessary faced with his cousin accusations regarding the earlier incident,jimmy admitted to sexual contact with his cousin.the detective told jimmy to write what he had done in his own words,gave him pen and paper,and left the room.in a handwritten statement,which he composed while alone in the interview room,jimmy admitted to a series of sexual contacts with his cousin.
jimmy and his mother were reunited,and he read his confession to her.at this point,according to jimmy mother,she understood her son to say that the detective had told him that she would help him only if he wrote a statement admitting to sexual conduct.the mother and the detective exchanged words,with the detective insisting that she had simply told jimmy to write down in his own words exactly what he had done.jimmy was then arrested.
a juvenile delinquency petition was filed in family court,supported by a sworn statement of jimmy cousin.when the presentment agency gave notice that it intended to introduce his confession,jimmy moved to suppress the statement.following a suppression hearing,family court denied the motion.
following a hearing,family court ruled that jimmy had committed acts that,if committed by an adult,would have constituted the crimes of criminal sexual act,criminal sexual act,sexual misconduct,unlawful imprisonment,course of sexual conduct against a child,attempted sexual abuse,and attempted sexual abuse.family court adjudicated jimmy a juvenile delinquent and placed him on probation for months,conditioned on cooperation with sex offender counseling.
at the appellate division,jimmy argued,among other things,that the presentment agency had not met its burden of proving the voluntariness of his confession.the appellate division modified family court order by dismissing the sexual misconduct and unlawful imprisonment counts,but otherwise affirmed,rejecting jimmy voluntariness challenge.we granted jimmy leave to appeal and now affirm.
when a police officer takes a child under the age of into custody for juvenile delinquency,the officer must immediately notify the parent or other person legally responsible for the child care,or if such legally responsible person is unavailable the person with whom the child resides,that the child has been taken into custody family court act.the child must be advised of his miranda rights and,if the parent or other person in loco parentis who was notified of the arrest henceforward parent is present,that person must be similarly apprised family court act.
recognizing that special care must be taken to protect the rights of minors in the criminal justice system,new york courts carefully scrutinize confessions by youthful suspects who are separated from their parents while being interviewed.in people bevilacqua,we held that the continuous,unusual,and deliberate isolation of an from potential avenues of assistance from his family or other supportive adults required suppression,as a denial of the right to counsel people bevilacqua,see also people kern,dept people ventiquattro,dept.similarly,in people townsend,we ruled that a confession must be suppressed if it was obtained from a child under the age of after the police ensured by means of deception and trickery that the child parents would not take steps to retain a lawyer people townsend.
in light of these statutory and common law principles,we reiterate that,when a parent is present at the location in which a child under the age of is being held in custody,the parent must not be denied an opportunity to attend the custodial interrogation people mitchell,n emphasis added.in practical terms,this means that the parent of the child has the right to attend the child interrogation by a police officer,and should not be discouraged,directly or indirectly,from doing so.the better practice for the interviewing officer or detective is to inform the parent that the parent may attend the interview if he or she wishes.of course,a parent may choose not to be present when a child is being interviewed,but the police should always ensure that the parent is aware of the right of access to his or her child during questioning.if a parent is asked to leave,the parent should be made aware that he or she is not required to leave.
the advantages of having a parent present during custodial interrogations are many.a parent may help a child understand the miranda warnings,so that the child can consciously and voluntarily choose whether to waive or to exercise his constitutional rights to remain silent,to have an attorney present at his questioning,and to have an attorney provided for him without charge if he is indigent.as we have noted,juveniles charged with delinquency may not fully understand the scope of their rights and how to protect their own interests.they may not appreciate the ramifications of their decisions or realize all the implications of the importance of counsel mitchell,at.if the child chooses to waive his rights under miranda,the parent who is present at questioning is able to monitor the interrogation lest the police engage in coercive tactics.in short,t he emotional and intellectual immaturity of a juvenile creates an obvious need for the advice of a guardian at an interrogation from which charges of juvenile delinquency may ensue in re,dept.
however,it does not follow as a matter of law that a child confession obtained in the absence of a parent is not voluntary.neither the family court act nor our precedent interpreting that statute give a child under years the absolute right to the presence of a parent during interrogation.in fact,the family court act expressly contemplates the possibility that the police may be unable to contact the parent of a child in custody,despite every reasonable effort family court act,or that a notified parent may be unable or unwilling to be present at the location of custody see family court act.moreover,whether a confession was,beyond a reasonable doubt,voluntary is a mixed question of law and fact see people scott,and is to be determined from the totality of circumstances people tankleff,quoting people williams.
because voluntariness is a mixed question of law and fact,our review is limited to deciding whether the appellate division finding is supported by evidence in the record.in the present case,jimmy and his mother were not so isolated from one another at the child advocacy center as to affect the likelihood that his confession was voluntary.jimmy mother accompanied him to the center,and mother and son had an opportunity to talk there,when they were waiting together alone in the waiting room.jimmy mother was present during the waiver of his miranda rights.both jimmy and his mother agreed to his being questioned outside his mother presence,and there is no evidence that jimmy asked for her during the questioning nor were jimmy whereabouts concealed from his mother.
the detective took care to read a version of the miranda warnings that explains the rights in simple language.both jimmy and his mother responded unhesitatingly when asked whether they understood each right waived.although jimmy was doubtless tired,there is no evidence that he asked for food or water and was denied it.finally,nothing in jimmy handwritten confession suggests that it does not express his own recollections.
the detective promise of help did not give rise to any substantial risk that the jimmy might falsely incriminate himself family court act b i.there is no evidence in the record that the detective promise would have deceived jimmy into thinking that if he confessed he would escape unprosecuted or unpunished people holland.rather,there is evidence in the record that the detective told jimmy that if he was truthful and told everything that had happened,he would receive psychiatric help or counseling if needed.jimmy was not offered an incentive to lie there is no attraction in making a false confession and receiving psychiatric assistance relating to a crime one did not commit.
the dissent,while acknowledging the validity of jimmy initial waiver dissenting op at,relies on a novel theory that the validity of the waiver was vitiated by police misconduct that occurred after the waiver id.at any representation in the course of the interrogation tending to impair the interrogee understanding of the consequences of his or her continuing waiver must be deemed to invalidate the waiver and render the product of consequent interrogation inadmissible.the dissent does not suggest that jimmy was tricked or coerced into his initial waiver,or that jimmy later invoked his rights and failed to waive them a second time.nor does the dissent adopt the theory actually advanced by misconduct following the valid waiver rendered his subsequent confession involuntary.rather,the dissent suggests that,due to misconduct by the police,jimmy stopped understanding his rights and thereby them.
the two cases that the dissent cites in support of this theory,moran burbine and united states anderson f,actually contradict it.in moran,the defendant argued that police misconduct following his valid miranda to an attorney who sought to intervene in defendant vitiated that waiver.but the supreme court found that idea untenable as a matter of both logic and precedent at.similarly,in anderson,the district court found that trickery retroactively undermined a miranda waiver,making it impossible to find that defendant voluntarily waived his rights,but the second circuit held otherwise though the trickery premise is correct,the district court conclusion respecting the impossibility of a waiver is not at.the second circuit then appropriately addressed whether the trickery had rendered defendant confession involuntary id.at.in accordance with moran and anderson,we hold that,since jimmy miranda rights were validly waived and never,the issue is voluntariness,not waiver.
we conclude that there is evidence in the record supporting the findings of the lower courts that the presentment agency met its burden of proving the voluntariness of jimmy inculpatory statement beyond a reasonable doubt.this mixed question of law and fact is therefore beyond our further review.
accordingly,the order of the appellate division should be affirmed,without of jimmy anonymous,a person alleged to be a juvenile delinquent 
lippman,chief judge dissenting 
the majority has set forth with commendable clarity what the law of this state requires when a parent of a child under the age of is available for and wishes to be present at the child interrogation by a police officer the parent has the right to attend the child interrogation and should not be discouraged,directly or indirectly,from doing so majority opn at.and,with equally commendable clarity,the majority has explained why such attendance is advantageous to the child and ultimately to the sound administration of justice the parent can help the child understand the miranda warnings and monitor any subsequent interrogation to deter and,if necessary,bear witness to any official overreaching.as the majority notes,we have previously recognized that juveniles lack an adult knowledge of the probable cause of their acts or omissions and are least likely to understand the scope of their rights and how to protect their own interests people mitchell,and,in view of the acknowledged emotional and intellectual immaturity of juvenile s,the majority now appropriately reiterates that there is an obvious need for the advice of a guardian at an interrogation from which charges of juvenile delinquency may ensue majority opn at,quoting matter of michelet,dept internal quotation marks omitted.
it is not disputed that respondent jimmy mother was available and wished to be present during her son interrogation,and it is clear that her exclusion was not in accord with what the family court act requires in such circumstances.the majority,however,declines to suppress jimmy confession on this ground.while i agree that the exclusion of a parent from the interrogation room should not invariably dictate the suppression of a subsequently obtained juvenile confession,i can not agree that the exclusion of the parent in this case,when viewed in the context of the ensuing interrogation,should be deemed benign.indeed,the tactic employed by the detective once the mother had been excluded can not be viewed except as having vitiated the waiver of rights essential to the admissibility of jimmy confession.
although presented practically as an afterthought by the majority,it would appear crucial to the decision of the respondent suppression motion that,after the mother complied with the detective request to leave the room,the detective,upon encountering resistance from jimmy,represented to him that he could be helped if he confessed.the detective testified i told him he needs to tell me exactly what happened and this way if he needed some help,we would try to get him some help.when pressed as to what sort of help she had been referring to,the detective elaborated,i explained to him that he would have to come to court and the lawyer that he would get t here would try to get him help.when asked whether she meant that jimmy could get help from a lawyer if he made a statement,the detective replied t he help i was telling him was if the lawyer can help him out,get him some help.in other words,if he needed to see someone,you know,whether it was a psychologist or counseling with regards to what he had done.upon being requested to clarify whether she had suggested to jimmy that if he confessed,he would get help from a lawyer in court,the detective said,i told him to write what he did in his way in his own words and i says maybe they can get you some help.when she was again requested to state whether she had indicated that the availability of a lawyer depended upon jimmy giving a confession,she answered i not sure if i said lawyer.i could have said it.i not sure.shortly after these representations were made,jimmy made an admission.he was then told that he would have to write everything that he said he did on paper because it was right what he did.jimmy complied,delivering a written statement to the detective at am.the thirteen had by then not eaten,or been offered food,in over seven hours and had been without sleep since the early morning of the previous day.
the threshold issue in judging the admissibility of jimmy custodial confession in this era is not,as it would have been before miranda,whether under the tota
