a jury convicted tony lessie of second degree murder,subd.a and found true allegations that during its commission lessie had intentionally and personally used and discharged a firearm,proximately causing great bodily injury and death to a person,subd.a,subd.d the trial court sentenced lessie to prison for a total term of years to life.
lessie sole contention on appeal is that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress his pretrial admissions made during two interviews on september and,which were allegedly obtained in violation of his rights under miranda arizona,d miranda.lessie,who was years old at the time of those interviews,essentially asserts that because people burton cal d,burton,which specifically holds that a minor request to consult with a parent made at any time prior to or during questioning,must in the absence of evidence demanding a contrary conclusion,be construed to indicate that the minor suspect desires to invoke his fifth amendment privilege,is still binding authority in california,the trial court failure to follow this per se rule of burton,instead of determining under the totality of the circumstances test of fare michael,d fare and people hector th,d hector that he did not invoke his miranda rights to remain silent or ask for an attorney by requesting to speak to his father before he was read those rights during questioning at the first police station interview,constitutes reversible error.alternatively,lessie contends that even under the totality of the circumstances standard of fare and hector there was insufficient evidence to support the court determination that his request to call his father was merely to notify him of his arrest.lessie further asserts that because his request to talk to his father at the first interview invoked his right to counsel,his admissions at the second interview the next day at juvenile hall were required to be suppressed under edwards arizona,d edwards.
we agree with the reasoning and conclusion in hector that the holdings of burton,supra,cal d,and fare,supra.are reconcilable and both demand consideration of the circumstances surrounding a minor request to speak to a parent to determine whether that request constitutes an invocation of the right to remain silent or a request for an attorney.hector,supra,th at,d.accordingly,we determine that under the totality of the circumstances test of those cases that lessie knowingly and voluntarily waived his miranda rights and did not invoke them by requesting to speak to his father during the first police interview on september.consequently,because lessie did not invoke his right to counsel at that time,the second interview the next day did not violate the edwards rule.we therefore conclude that the trial court properly denied lessie suppression motion and affirm the judgment.
background 
lessie does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury verdict and findings he fired the gun that killed rusty seau on june,in oceanside,california.rather,the facts pertinent to our discussion of his appellate issues come from the suppression motion documents,the transcripts of the custodial interviews on september and,and the record of the hearing on the matter.
in limine,lessie filed a motion to exclude his pretrial statements made during interviews that took place on september,and december,on grounds the arresting detectives willfully deprived him of his statutory right under welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b to make telephone calls to his father and attorney within one hour of being taken into custody and continued to question him after he invoked his right to remain silent by asking to call his father.the people filed opposition and a countermotion to admit lessie statements,asserting lessie had knowingly,intelligently and voluntarily waived his miranda rights at both his first and second interviews,and claiming there was no statutory violation of the notice requirements of welfare and institutions code section because lessie had been arrested at a family member home and his indication he wanted to call his father was not an invocation of his miranda rights based on the totality of the circumstances test set out in fare,supra.and hector,supra,th,d.
at the hearing on the matter,the parties clarified that the motion would only pertain to the statements from the september and,interviews,and the prosecutor called the detective who had arrested lessie to testify about the timing of various admonishments and lessie requests to talk to his father.
oceanside police detective kelly deveney testified that lessie was arrested on september,around,at the home of his aunt and uncle in hemet,california.deveney first talked with lessie about minutes after his arrest as he sat in the back of the police car.at that time,she identified herself and told him he was under arrest for from his probation officer,a warrant issued by probation,and that he was being transported back to oceanside.she also told him that once they got to oceanside he could make as many phone calls as he wanted to whomever he wanted.and then i told him i understand your aunt and uncle know that you in custody is there anyone else we need to notify and he said yes,his father.lessie did not have his father telephone number with him.
after an approximate hour and a half transport from hemet to the oceanside police department,lessie was placed in an interview room that was being recorded digitally and via vhs tape.deveney had viewed the tape and explained it showed lessie sat there for the first to minutes with his hands underneath his shirt before oceanside police detective gordon govier arrived with breakfast for him.deveney estimated another or minutes passed before she and govier arrived in the room to begin the first interview,which was later transcribed.deveney recalled that at that time she told lessie a phone number for his father had been located and asked him if he wanted her to make the call to his father advising that lessie was in custody,or if he wanted to make that call himself.lessie told her he wanted to make the call.deveney then continued with the process.
on,deveney said that lessie had been given a telephone to call his father before the interview ended when he actually asked to talk to his father for a minute and the officers took a break and gave him a nextel,a cellular phone.upon looking at the transcript of the interview,deveney clarified that the request to talk to his father came at page of the transcript,and that lessie had continued talking up to that point in time.the videotape showed lessie then making several telephone calls,not just one to his father.
the parties then submitted the matter on the transcript of that interview which showed that after some initial small talk and deveney query as to whether lessie wanted the detectives to make the call to notify his father,deveney again asked lessie whether he wanted to call his father himself in response to lessie reply that he would like to be the one to call his father.when lessie responded,deveney said,okay.so in the meantime,we just got to fill out these papers.you go by tony lessie,right after deveney asked more general questions concerning lessie age,height,weight,birth place,school,work and father name and address,the following exchange took place.
deveney okay.lessie because you under age,you only sixteen,and because you in our facility,i have to read you your rights.alright.so,it no big deal but i have to by law.you have the right to remain silent.do you understand that can you say yes 
lessie yeah.
deveney any statements you make may be used as evidence against you.do you understand that 
lessie yeah.
deveney okay.you have the right to the presence of an attorney,either retained or appointed free of charge,before and during questioning.do you understand that 
lessie yeah.
deveney so you understand those rights 
lessie yeah.
deveney then asked several more general questions regarding lessie appearance and clothing before asking him if his father worked or whether she would be able to reach him at home.lessie explained that the detective had the cell phone number for his father.deveney proceeded to then question lessie about knowing a man named black jack,at whose house the detectives had found two birth certificates in lessie name.after admitting that both certificates were his,lessie proceeded to give his family background,explaining that his name had been changed after his birth when his grandparents adopted him that he originally grew up in oceanside before moving to perris,california,and then came back to oceanside to live with his father after he got in trouble in school there and that he left his father house after fighting with his sister and went to stay with james turner black jack,whom he knew through a friend.lessie knew that turner was involved in some fraudulent dealings like identity theft,but denied that he was also involved in them.he claimed he left turner home because of the identity scams and went up to hemet to live with his relatives.
lessie also told deveney that he had violated his probation when he got into the fight with his sister,that his probation officer was evil,and that the last time he had violated probation,he had been locked up,having to do four months out of six.after talking some more about the fraud schemes and whether turner cousins had also been involved in them,deveney then questioned lessie about his awareness of gangs in oceanside and whether he knew that turner was involved in a gang.when lessie explained that that was one reason he was done with turner and his whole crowd,deveney told him that that was good because there were rumors turner and his cousin were around when that other shooting happened in june.a kid over by the back gate got killed.
when lessie immediately asked,you talking about rusty,the interchange between deveney and lessie turned to whether lessie was with turner that day when a crowd of youths,many gang members,was on the street fighting before rusty was shot.after lessie claimed he had nothing to do with the fight or shooting,deveney asked him whether he would be surprised to know that some people in your family have said that you told them about your involvement in the incident.
when deveney then asked whether there was a good reason lessie had become involved in the incident,lessie stated,w ell to just scratch everything,to just come clean with it i was there,i was,i was there and i was the shooter.but the thing that happened was that if i did shoot,i was going to,you know what i saying,get hurt by the other people.lessie explained that it was like an initiation thing.so like if i did do this,they were going to get me.he further explained that the incident stemmed from an earlier incident that day when he and turner and some people got into a disagreement about turner girlfriend at a vons store.they were to meet the other people on the block where the shooting occurred.after picking up some other people,lessie was given a gun in the car,taught how to shoot it and told he would be the one to use it.when they arrived at the block and found that the other people did not want to fight,turner saw seau walking down the street,started jumping him,and when he ran,ordered lessie to shoot him.lessie shot twice at seau when turner walked toward him after again ordering him to shoot.when lessie claimed that turner then shot the gun at least two more times,deveney told him that witnesses saw only one person shooting who afterwards ran back to the car with the gun still in his hand.lessie conceded,y eah,i shot,and nodded that he was the only shooter.
when deveney then asked whether lessie was all right or needed a break,lessie said,i would like to talk to my dad.before deveney left the room to allow lessie to compose himself,lessie asked,c an i make a phone call to my dad deveney replied,yes,you can.i going to bring a cell phone into you and you can use it.in fact you can use it while we taking the break okay.do you have the number or do you want me to bring you the number when lessie said he needed the number,detective govier told him o kay,we be right back.
after a long pause,lessie asked to use the bathroom and deveney advised him that they were getting him a nextel,a phone,we charging it up so you can call your dad in privacy.okay.after another pause,deveney told lessie that while they were getting the phone ready,they were going to ask him a couple of quick questions before leaving him alone to have whatever conversation he wanted with his father.after getting clarification as to who was in the car with lessie that day,that he was the only shooter,and a description of the events in reference to a diagram of the crime scene,deveney told lessie,o kay.let me go see what going on with that phone.we got your number for your dad.
moments later,the detectives returned with the nextel and attempted to call lessie father for him,but the number they had did not work.during that same time,when the detectives asked lessie about the family members he had talked to about the shooting,lessie said he had talked with his aunt,uncle,and dad.when a working number for his father could not be found,lessie asked to call his cousin for his dad number.the detectives then left lessie alone to make his calls.
the transcript reflects that during the first call,lessie left a voice mail message for his father,telling him he was in jail and to call him back at that number as soon as he got the message.during the second call to an unidentified person,lessie asked whether the person had heard from his dad and for his dad phone number.after telling the person he was in jail for murder and explaining about some of the witnesses,lessie told the person,b ut i gon na talk to you later,i about to go try to get in contact with my dad.lessie tried a third call but there was no answer.
the transcript of the september,interview with lessie at juvenile hall revealed that the detectives initiated that interrogation to obtain more details about the vons incident and the shooting after again advising him of his miranda rights and offering to notify his father of his next court date in vista.lessie expressly acknowledged he understood his rights and wanted to talk to the detectives.he also indicated he had talked with his father since their last interview.during the second interview,which lasted minutes,lessie described in fuller detail the people and events leading up to the shooting.lessie maintained that the only reason he shot the gun at seau was because he was scared and turner was telling him to do it.lessie felt sick when he heard that seau had died and had called his dad to let him know about it.his dad had told him to turn himself in,but lessie did not do so because he did not want to go to jail for something he did want to do near the end of the interview,deveney explained to lessie that he would get his attorney the next day in court and later helped lessie again get in contact with his father.
after considering the evidence and arguments of counsel,which were basically directed to the questions of whether a violation of welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b required suppression of lessie statements at the first interview and whether his request to call his father at that time was a per se invocation of his right to remain silent,the court denied lessie motion to suppress.in doing so,the court noted that although it shared some concerns with defense counsel about the delay in getting a telephone to lessie after saying he wanted his dad called and wanted to be the one to make the call,which was probably at a minimum a technical violation of this welfare and institutions code provision,it disagreed that suppression was a remedy for that.even though hector,supra,th,d did not directly deal with that statute,the trial judge found such case very instructive in saying that under federal law,the request for a parent simply is not a miranda violation and should not result in the suppression of a statement.and i find that case controlling in this context.and under hector,and the united states supreme court case fare,supra,i just do think the exclusionary rule is applicable in this context.
nor did the trial judge see any whatsoever between the defendant statement that he
