delinquent minor albert timely appeals from an order committing him to the department of corrections and rehabilitation,division of juvenile facilities djf he contends insufficient evidence supports the finding that he was competent the most recent sustained petition filed against him was a louisiana petition that precludes a djf commitment he was misadvised about the possible consequences of his admission and the juvenile court abused its discretion by committing him to the djf.
as we shall explain in the published portion of this opinion,part ii a of the discussion,the term any petition as used in welfare and institutions code section which limits commitments to djf based on the nature of the most recent offense alleged in any petition,does not encompass delinquency petitions as the minor claims.in the remainder of the opinion,we reject the minor other claims of reversible error.we shall affirm.
background 
the minor was made a ward at age based on his may,admission to second degree robbery,after which a petition alleging residential burglary and knowing receipt of stolen property was dismissed with the understanding those charges could be used at disposition.the minor was sent to live with his father in louisiana under the supervision of the probation department.
two sustained louisiana petitions followed,alleging simple burglary,simple criminal damage,and disturbing the peace.on may,louisiana authorities closed the minor case and returned him to his mother in california.
a notice filed under section on august,alleged several violations of probation vops.see in re greg cal th,describing vop procedure.a second vop was filed the following week,alleging the minor had committed two residential burglaries.
on january,proceedings were suspended,and after three evaluations including one by kevin dugan the parties submitted the matter on september,and the minor was found incompetent and referred to determine if he was intellectually disabled and to design an appropriate placement plan.
on january,the probation department sought a warrant because the minor had absconded after threatening his mother with a shotgun the day before.on february,the minor was detained.he was later released to his mother.
on may,another vop was filed,alleging the minor threatened a school official,among other acts.later that month,a notice was filed alleging a violation of electronic monitoring restrictions.another notice and a vop replicating the charge of threatening a school official were filed on june.a superseding vop was filed on june,adding that the minor possessed a loaded firearm at school,and related allegations.later,a superseding june,vop was filed.
on july,counsel again expressed a doubt about the minor competence.this time,dugan report rejected his diagnosis of mild mental retardation and incompetency and concluded the minor had been malingering.after a contested hearing held september to,the juvenile court twiss,found the minor to be competent.
meanwhile,in july,the probation department filed a report stating the minor was classified as a gang member and had had six formal incident reports while in custody further he was sophisticated and dangerous and had failed on home supervision and electronic monitoring in the past.
a second superseding vop was filed on october,but the minor was not present due to a behavioral issue triggered when his counsel suggested continuing the case for two weeks,and the arraignment was postponed.
on november,the minor admitted he committed a residential burglary in,and the juvenile court dismissed the remaining vop charges with the stipulation that they could be used for dispositional purposes.these included another residential burglary,criminal threats with personal use of a firearm in january,subd.a,attempting to deter a peace officer by threats in may,attempting to resist another officer by threats later in may,and possessing a loaded handgun at school in june,subd.a.
on november,yet another vop was filed,alleging the minor had assaulted another resident of his detention facility.
at a hearing on december,the juvenile court oros,ordered a day diagnostic evaluation see,after two unreported conferences with counsel,and after the minor counsel argued for a level b referral the november vop was dismissed with the understanding that it could be used at disposition.the court found the minor eligible for djf placement.the minor opposed a djf commitment,due partly to the louisiana cases,arguing that his most recent offense committed in louisiana was an admission to a non b offense.
at the dispositional hearing on march,the juvenile court boulware eurie,committed the minor to djf for up to five years.the minor timely appealed.
discussion 
icompetency 
the minor raises various challenges to the competency finding.
at the competency hearing,dugan testified in a manner consistent with his report that the minor was malingering.he noted that the minor would change from cooperative and communicative to hostile,so that standard testing could not be completed.he had spoken with aida fuchs,at the alta regional center,who had reported on the minor progress,and learned the minor was not making a good faith effort to avail himself of the services he had been receiving.his testing results reflected a poor effort he had initially improved and then,after demonstrating progress,he tested below the level expected if the test taker were randomly guessing.this notably deteriorating score after demonstrating consistent pattern of increasing a competence in learning was unexpected.
after a break in the hearing,the minor refused to return to court and was using profanity.the minor claimed the prosecutor,the judge,and dugan were conspiring against him.the next court day,the minor returned to court.
dugan again testified the minor was malingering.he based this opinion on disparities in an iq test he had administered in indicating mild mental retardation,and his later evaluation in which the minor did well when he wanted to.at the evaluation he had found the minor to be incompetent,partly also based on a finding of paranoia.the minor now had the ability to understand the charges and the nature of the proceedings,and the ability to cooperate with counsel,if he wanted to.he was not incompetent.dugan applied a presumption of competency in forming his opinion.
christopher white,a special education teacher who performed competency training including at the alta regional center working with intellectually disabled children,had helped develop the program in.he had worked with the minor beginning january.through testing,he determined the minor could learn.when the minor was in custody,he continuously regressed and blamed the regression on his incarceration.he used specific terms like regress and comprehend,terms which white had not used with him,and then immediately claimed not to know what the terms meant despite the fact that he had used them accurately.the minor told white he had spoken to another of white clients in custody about competency,and the other client had been making real good progress and then just stopped also.the minor then regressed so that his testing fell below random answering.
the juvenile court twiss,and the parties assumed the burden of proof rested with the minor to show incompetency by a preponderance of the evidence.the court found the minor had a condition within the meaning of section specifically,a relatively low functioning level coupled with developmental delay and developmental immaturity.but the court credited dugan testimony that the minor was competent.it found dugan had in essence repudiated his opinion,and in any event with the passage of time the minor was now competent,because the preponderance of the evidence did not show the minor either lacked the ability to consult with counsel or lacked the ability to understand the nature of the charges or the proceeding.
discussion 
burden of proof as to competency 
the minor initially contended there was no presumption of competency in delinquency cases,and a minor does not bear any burden to prove incompetency.as the minor concedes in a supplemental brief,our supreme court has decided these issues adversely to the minor.in re cal th.we are bound to follow that precedent.auto equity sales,superior court cal d.
presumption of continued incompetency 
the minor contends that because in this case he previously was found to be incompetent,a presumption of continued incompetency should have been applied,requiring the people to prove he had been restored to competency.we disagree,and add that the court failure to apply any such presumption did not result in prejudice in this particular case.
the minor claim is based on an analogy to the criminal competency statutory scheme,which provides that a defendant found incompetent may receive a certificate of restoration of competency,and this certificate the presumption of competency if competency is later challenged.see people rells cal th,rells.the minor notes the absence of any provision for certification of restoration of competency in the juvenile competency statutes,and argues this means once he was found incompetent,he should have been presumed incompetent at the later competency hearing,and therefore a new hearing is required in this case.
the argument fails to persuade for three reasons.
first,as we explain,the absence of a certificate of restoration of competence has no effect on the burden of proof in criminal cases,according to the very authority relied on by the minor.instead,even where no such certificate has been filed,the mere passage of time compels a return to court for a hearing where the criminal defendant still bears the burden of proof if he claims to remain incompetent.rells,supra,cal th at.
penal code section,subdivision b formerly subd.b provides that after months of treatment after a finding of incompetency,a defendant shall be returned to court for a hearing pursuant to section.penal code section,subdivision f,setting forth the procedures for a criminal competency hearing,provides for a presumption of competency.penal code section,subdivision a requires that the order committing the defendant for treatment shall provide that the defendant be returned to court when a certificate of restoration of competence has been issued.
in construing these statutes,our supreme court has held as follows f or a hearing on a defendant recovery of mental competence,penal code section,unlike penal code section,does not establish,expressly,a presumption that the defendant is mentally competent unless he is proved by a preponderance of the evidence to be otherwise.we believe,however,that it does so impliedly.the presumption that the defendant is mentally competent unless he is proved by a preponderance of the evidence to be otherwise is applicable at a trial of the defendant mental competence,in spite of the fact that it may run counter to any doubt expressed by the court and supported by the opinion of his own counsel.this presumption is applicable as well at a retrial of the defendant mental competence,which is mandatory when the defendant has been committed for months and remains so without a certificate of restoration to mental competence filed by a specified mental health official,in spite of the fact that it is inconsistent with his apparent non recovery of mental competence.therefore,in our view,this presumption should be understood to be applicable at a hearing on the defendant recovery of mental competence,where it conforms in fact with the certificate of restoration filed by the specified mental health official.rells,supra,cal th at.
thus,whether or not a certificate of restoration has been issued,a criminal defendant eventually will be returned to court for a new competency hearing at which he or she will again bear the burden of proof.this undermines the minor analogy,as does authority subsequent to rells.after discussing rells,our supreme court in in re stated because the presumption of competency applies in a wardship proceeding,the party asserting incompetency bears the burden of proving the minor is incompetent to proceed.in re,supra,cal th at p.we infer no exception for minors previously found incompetent in this passage.
second,after competency training for the minor was underway,it was minor counsel who again declared a doubt about competency,and therefore the minor properly bore the burden of proof,again.in accordance with general motion practice,the party seeking the finding of incompetency bears the burden of proof.see rells,supra,cal th at people lopez th,o n all motions the burden is on the moving party.
third,the trial court found dugan disavowed his earlier opinion of incompetency,because he now and onward believed the minor was a malingerer.thus,any presumption claimed by the minor was undermined because the original finding was shown to be based on the faulty assumption that the minor was providing reliable information when tested for competency.no prejudice appears.see people leonard cal th,error in criminal competency hearing harmless where the hearing that was conducted protected the defendant right not to be tried or convicted while incompetent.
sufficiency of the evidence of competency 
in challenging the sufficiency of the evidence of competency,the minor initially argued for an independent review standard of review.in a supplemental brief,he concedes we must review a juvenile court finding of competency under the substantial evidence test.see in re,supra,cal th at.we view the record in the light most favorable to the juvenile court determination.id.at.where,as here,the juvenile court has found the minor to be competent,we must ask whether the weight and character of the evidence of incompetency was such that the juvenile court could not reasonably reject it.id.at.
the minor asserts the evidence showed he was incompetent,but in making this argument he details the evidence in the light most favorable to him.the juvenile court certainly could rationally credit dugan current opinion corroborated by white testimony that the minor was a malingerer,and that dugan opinion had been based on the incorrect assumption that the minor had been sincerely cooperating in the psychological and other evaluations.
the minor concedes,as he must,that dugan report found the minor was competent and was simply unwilling to participate in services and unwilling to cooperate with his attorney.but he argues dugan testimony was less decisive and clouded with uncertainty.we disagree.although dugan testified he could not be certain that the minor was malingering,he strongly suspected malingering.he added that because the minor understood the nature of the proceedings and had the ability to cooperate with counsel,the minor was not in competent.he testified he could not be percent certain,but he was confident in his opinion that the minor was malingering.the minor cites no authority for the implied proposition that absolute certainty is required in such matters.
the minor misinterprets a passage of dugan testimony,contending he testified his report indicating malingering and competency rather than a test result which was a component of his report indicating incompetency was invalid.however,it is clear that dugan was referring to the test result indicating incompetency when he answered i saying it possesses questionable enough validity that i no longer consider that assessment to be a realistic and credible assessment of this minor cognitive ability.he went on to explain that the test was invalid because the minor was a malingerer and therefore the data the minor presented and any conclusions derived therefrom were suspect.thus,in context,dugan testimony did not undermine his report concluding the minor was malingering and not incompetent,but supported it 
the minor also misinterprets a passage of white testimony,asserting the witness directly testified the minor ability to comprehend was still unknown.the cited testimony was that white had not yet evaluated the minor ability in that regard,as he had a certain training regimen and had not yet progressed to the comprehension part of the competency training.on redirect,white testified the minor was answering questions quickly,without thinking about them.he also testified the minor was,in fact,capable of learning,plotted to regress after learning what the word meant,and had intentionally regressed while in custody after he had spoken to another minor about competency issues.thus,viewed favorably to the juvenile court finding,white testimony supported dugan view that the minor was malingering.
in sum,viewed in the light favorable to the juvenile court finding,ample evidence shows the minor was competent to undergo an adjudication hearing,and was malingering to thwart the juvenile proceedings.
djf commitment 
for several reasons,the minor contends his djf commitment was improper.we address his claims separately,and reject each of them.
whether the louisiana petition can contain the most recent offense 
section,stated in the negative,provides in part that a ward shall not be committed to djf if,inter alia,he or she c is adjudged a ward of the court pursuant to section,and the most recent offense alleged in any petition and admitted or found to be true by the court is not described in subdivision b of section.his most recent offense alleged in a ca petition was robbery there is no dispute that this was a qualifying section,subdivision b offense.
the parties also agree the minor was the subject of a more recent louisiana petition alleging acts that would not fall within section,subdivision b if committed in california.the minor contends the most recent louisiana charge is the most recent offense alleged in any petition within the meaning of section,and therefore he may not be committed to djf.we are not persuaded.
the key language of section,subdivision c is the most recent offense alleged in any petition and admitted or found to be true by the court.italics added.the parties dispute the meaning of any petition and the court as those terms are used in this section.
a ny is broad and generally means all or every.california grocers department of alcoholic beverage control th,conc.opn.of duarte.the section use of any lends some support to the minor claim that any petition means any delinquency petition,that is,any petition wherever filed.
a petition under section means a section petition,not a vop notice.in re cal th,in re greg,supra,cal th at in re,supra,th at.however,as we will explain,section refers to petitions alleging state or federal crimes committed in california there is no basis for california to exercise jurisdiction over crimes committed in.when we consider the delinquency scheme as a whole,as we must,we conclude the minor proffered candidate of meaning is not a plausible meaning,so as to raise a true ambiguity.see alameda county flood control water conservation dist.department of water resources th.
t he goal of statutory construction is ascertainment of legislative intent so that the purpose of the law may be effectuated,and that we should construe a statute in the context of the entire statutory system of which it is a part,in order to achieve harmony among the parts.people shirokow cal d,see in re cal th.therefore,we review other sections of the delinquency law that may bear on the meaning of the words petition and court as used in section.
section provides in part each superior court shall exercise the jurisdiction conferred by this chapter,and while sitting in the exercise of such jurisdiction,shall be known and referred to as the juvenile court.the court referred to is a california court.see cal,art.vi.section provides in part juvenile court proceedings to declare a minor a ward of the court pursuant to section are commenced by the filing of a petition by the prosecuting attorney,subd.c,italics added.the reference to section negates the idea that a proceeding based on louisiana law would be deemed commenced by the filing of a petition under this statute.see also cal.rules of court,rule petitioner,in section and proceedings,means the probation officer or prosecuting attorney.
in turn,section provides in part except as provided in subdivision b listing particularly serious crimes,any person who is under years of age when he or she violates any law of this state or of the united states or any ordinance of any city or county of this state defining crime other than an ordinance establishing a curfew based solely on age,is within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court,which may adjudge such person to be a ward of the court,subd.a,italics added.plainly,the court referenced is the juvenile court,which is a department of each california county superior court.see.
section specifies the contents of a wardship petition commencing delinquency proceedings in a california juvenile court.section requires that any petition alleging that the minor is a person described by section shall specify as to each count whether the crime charged is a felony or a misdemeanor.italics added.again,the referenced statutes refer to california proceedings under section,not any proceeding.
as stated by our supreme court,albeit in another context no section case begins until the prosecutor files a petition under that statute on the people behalf.in re eddie cal th,italics added.in a juvenile court hearing which is based upon a petition that alleges that the minor upon whose behalf the petition is being brought is a person within the description of section,the prosecuting attorney shall appear on behalf of the people of the state of california,subd.a,italics added.these passages again plainly reference the california cases.
ultimately,after an admission or contested hearing,if the court has found that the minor is a person described by section or,it may order and adjudge the minor to be a ward of the court,subd.b.this usage of the court,too,plainly references a california juvenile court.california juvenile court law does not apply to any person who violates a law of another state defined as a crime and is at the time of the violation under years of age,or who subsequently flees into the state of california.seiser kumli,cal.juvenile courts practice and procedure,jurisdiction.
accordingly,we do not believe the minor candidate of meaning of section,subdivision c plausibly accounts for the statutory language,when the statutory scheme is viewed as a whole,rather than in isolation.but even assuming without finding that there is any ambiguity to resolve,we would apply the venerable rule that statutes do not apply extraterritorially absent an explicit legislative indication.however far the legislature power may theoretically extend,we presume the legislature did not intend a statute to be operative,with respect to occurrences outside the state unless such intention is clearly expressed or reasonably to be inferred from the language of the act or from its purpose,subject matter or history.sullivan oracle cal th.
the minor emphasizes the purposes of section were to reduce the number of delinquents housed in state facilities to end litigation,save money,and achieve better results for youthful offenders,by limiting djf commitments to the more serious delinquents.see in re greg,supra,cal th at in re th.but while acting to achieve those purposes,the legislature,presumably aware of the statutes just described,and the presumption against extraterritoriality of state statutes see estate of mcdill cal d,in re eddie th,could have written section so as to encompass foreign delinquency petitions.it did not do so.
accordingly,we reject the minor claim that the louisiana petitions have any relevance to his eligibility for a djf commitment under section.
advisement as to consequences 
the minor contends his admission to the vop was invalid because he was not told he might be committed to djf,did not understand the consequences of his admission,and therefore his commitment is invalid.we disagree.
recently,in people cross cal th,a case involving a defendant stipulation that he had a prior conviction,our supreme court reemphasized that the direct penal consequences of a plea or admission must be explained to a criminal defendant,as a rule of procedure.similarly,a minor must be told the maximum possible confinement time he or she faces before a juvenile court accepts an admission to a section petition or section vop notice.see,in re gary d,where minor was misadvised about his maximum commitment,and promptly
