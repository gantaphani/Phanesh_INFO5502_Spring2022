this appeal presents the question of whether a minor who has been adjudicated delinquent in proceedings conducted under article v of the juvenile court act of hereinafter,the juvenile court act or act ilcs et west is considered a person convicted of a felony for purposes of the offense of escape as set forth in section a of the criminal code of hereinafter,the code or the escape statute ilcs a west.
background 
on the evening of december,defendant was a juvenile incarcerated at the audy home,a juvenile temporary detention center located in cook county.on that night,terrance willis,who was also a juvenile incarcerated at the facility,escaped from his cell and cut the throat of a detention center counselor.defendant was locked in his cell during the attack,but willis took the jail keys from the stricken counselor and opened defendant cell.according to eyewitness testimony,defendant then aided willis in shoving the counselor into a cell and locking it.defendant and willis were apprehended a short time later after they had fled in separate directions.
pursuant to the juvenile court act,the juvenile division of the circuit court of cook county held a hearing in connection with the december,incident.the court transferred defendant to the jurisdiction of the criminal division on december,on charges of attempted first degree murder,attempted escape,aggravated battery and aggravated unlawful restraint.the cause then proceeded to a jury trial on these charges.
to prove one of the elements of the attempted escape,that defendant was a person convicted of a felony at the time of the attempted state introduced a certified copy of a finding of delinquency entered by the juvenile court on august,that was based on an allegation that defendant had committed a robbery.the record shows that following a dispositional hearing on this delinquency adjudication for robbery,the juvenile court committed defendant to the department of corrections,juvenile division.consequently,defendant was incarcerated at the audy home on december,awaiting transport to the department of corrections,juvenile division,when the events that formed the present criminal charges took place.
defendant testified at his criminal trial that he was asleep at the time willis broke out of his cell on december,that defendant had no plan to escape,and that he was ordered out of his cell.he denied participating in putting the counselor in the cell,but instead claimed that he ran to the bathroom first and then to summon help for the counselor.
at the completion of his jury trial,defendant was convicted of the offenses of attempted escape,aggravated battery and unlawful restraint,but was acquitted of the attempted first degree murder count.the trial court sentenced him to five years in prison on the attempted escape charge to run concurrently with sentences of five years and three years imprisonment on the other two charges.
defendant appealed,and the appellate court reversed.d.the state conceded before the appellate court that defendant did not commit the substantive offenses of aggravated battery and aggravated unlawful restraint.instead the state argued that defendant was guilty of these charges on an accountability theory for his participation in the escape.because defendant accountability on these two charges depended on whether he was guilty of the escape attempt,the appellate court first examined the escape charge.it noted that the escape statute requires as an element of the offense that a defendant must be a person convicted of a felony or charged with the commission of a felony at the time of the offense.d at.it then concluded that defendant delinquency adjudication was not a conviction for purposes of the escape statute.d at.accordingly,the appellate court held that under the plain language of the escape statute,defendant could not be found guilty of the offense of escape as a matter of law.d at.we allowed the state petition for leave to appeal.a.
before this court,the state contends that the term conviction as defined in the code is ambiguous.according to the state,the code must be read in pari materia with various provisions of juvenile court act to find a legislative intent to punish a juvenile for any escape attempt from a penal institution specifically,the state points out that the term delinquent minor under the juvenile court act means any minor who prior to his or her birthday has violated or attempted to violate,regardless of where the act occurred,any federal or state law,county or municipal ordinance.ilcs west.moreover,proceedings under the act may be instituted for such violations,unless the act requires that the minor be prosecuted criminally.ilcs west.the state contends that section of the act requires that all escape attempts be prosecuted criminally,rather than in a juvenile proceeding.see ilcs west.according to the state,the appellate court interpretation of the escape statute would lead to an absurdity if an adjudication is not considered a conviction,because then a minor who attempts to escape from confinement following a juvenile adjudication would not be subject to prosecution under either the criminal laws or the juvenile court act.
the state argument raises a question of statutory interpretation,and the principles governing our analysis are well known.the construction of a statute is an issue that is reviewed de novo.in re michelle.courts should consider the statute in its entirety,keeping in mind the subject it addresses and the legislature apparent objective in enacting it.people davis.but our inquiry must always begin with the language of the statute itself,which is the surest and most reliable indicator of the legislature intent.people pullen.when the language of a statute is clear,it must be applied as written without resort to further aids or tools of interpretation.in re.furthermore,criminal or penal statutes are to be strictly construed in favor of the accused,and nothing should be taken by intendment or implication beyond the obvious or literal meaning of the statute.people laubscher.we can not,under the guise of statutory interpretation,remedy an apparent legislative oversight by rewriting a statute in a way that is inconsistent with its clear and unambiguous language.pullen,at.however,if the language of a statute is ambiguous,we may look to tools of as the doctrine of in pari ascertain the meaning of a provision.
the statute at issue here is the escape statute,which provides that a person convicted of a felony or charged with the commission of a felony who intentionally escapes from any penal institution or from the custody of an employee of that institution commits a class felony.ilcs a west.under the statute plain language,proof of a prior felony conviction is an element of the offense of escape in the present circumstances see people mccollum,d.the question before us,then,is whether a juvenile adjudication can be considered a felony conviction for purposes of this statute.the term conviction is specifically defined by the code in the general definitions contained in article ii see ilcs west and that definition governs our inquiry,as the words and phrases defined in article ii have the same meaning throughout the code as is designated in article ii unless the context clearly requires a different meaning ilcs west.section of the code states as follows 
conviction means a judgment of conviction or sentence entered upon a plea of guilty or upon a verdict or finding of guilty of an offense,rendered by a legally constituted jury or by a court of competent jurisdiction authorized to try the case without a jury.ilcs west.
under both the plain language of this statute and the various provisions of the juvenile court act cited by the state,juvenile adjudications are not mentioned as being included in the code definition of conviction.nor has any illinois case ever held that a juvenile adjudication constitutes a criminal illinois cases have specifically held that juvenile adjudications do not constitute convictions.see in re,people rankin,d.additionally,we emphasize that the escape statute requires a prior felony conviction,not merely a conviction.we simply do not believe that the term person convicted of a felony can be read to include juvenile adjudications under the plain meaning of the existing statutory framework at issue here,especially when the nature of such adjudications are closely examined in comparison with the statutory language.
the code definition of conviction has two basic parts,both of which must be satisfied for a conviction to take place.the first clause requires a judgment or sentence entered upon a plea of guilty or upon a verdict or finding of guilty of an offense.the second clause requires that any verdict or finding of guilty must be rendered by a jury or a court authorized to try the case without a jury.neither part of the definition has been satisfied under the facts of this case.
with respect to the first clause,we note that defendant was adjudicated delinquent on august,on an allegation of robbery.this is the predicate offense that is supposed to serve as his prior felony conviction for purposes of the escape charge.the juvenile court act,however,did not provide for a plea of guilty or a finding of guilty of an offense at the time that defendant was adjudicated delinquent on an allegation of robbery in august.nor did the act provide for a sentence.instead a minor named in a delinquency petition in was merely subject to an adjudicatory hearing,after which the juvenile court judge was to make and note in the minutes of proceeding a finding of whether or not the minor is delinquent.emphasis added.ilcs west.thereafter,the cause did not proceed to sentencing but rather to a dispositional hearing where the court was to determine whether it is in the best interests of the minor and the public that he be made a ward of the court.ilcs west.if the court determined that the minor should be made a ward of the court,it was then incumbent on the court to determine the proper disposition best serving the minor and the public.ilcs west.the kinds of dispositional orders that the court could enter were listed in section of the act.upon comparing the language of the juvenile court act in effect in with the code definition of conviction,it is clear that defendant juvenile adjudication did not satisfy the first part of the definition of conviction under the code because he was not found guilty and sentenced,but was instead adjudicated delinquent and then subjected to a dispositional order.
the juvenile court act was radically altered,however,after the date of defendant august,delinquency adjudication and after the alleged offenses were committed in the present case.the general assembly amended the act with public act,effective january.ilcs ann.et.the amendatory changes renumbered the sections and largely rewrote article v of the act to provide more accountability for the criminal acts of juveniles and,from all appearances,to make the juvenile delinquency adjudicatory process look more criminal in nature.compare ilcs et west with ilcs et west.for starters,the amendments provided a new purpose and policy section,which states in relevant part as follows 
it is the intent of the general assembly to promote a juvenile justice system capable of dealing with the problem of juvenile delinquency,a system that will protect the community,impose accountability for violations of law and equip juvenile offenders with competencies to live responsibly and productively.to effectuate this intent,the general assembly declares the following to be important purposes of this article 
a to protect citizens from juvenile crime 
b to hold each juvenile offender directly accountable for his or her acts.
c to provide an individualized assessment of each alleged and adjudicated delinquent juvenile,in order to rehabilitate and to prevent further delinquent behavior through the development of competency in the juvenile offender.as used in this section,competency means the development of educational,vocational,social,emotional and basic life skills which enable a minor to mature into a productive member of society.
d to provide due process,as required by the constitution of the united states and the state of illinois,through which each juvenile offender and all other interested parties are assured fair hearings at which legal rights are recognized and enforced.
to accomplish these goals,juvenile justice policies developed pursuant to this article shall be designed to 
b provide secure confinement for minors who present a danger to the community and make those minors understand that sanctions for serious crimes,particularly violent felonies,should be commensurate with the seriousness of the offense and merit strong punishment 
c protect the community from crimes committed by minors 
j hold minors accountable for their unlawful behavior and not allow minors to think that their delinquent acts have no consequence for themselves and others.ilcs west.
although proceedings under the act are still not criminal in nature even in the aftermath of the amendments and are to be administered in a spirit of humane concern for the minor and to promote his general welfare,the policy statement in section represents a fundamental shift from the singular goal of rehabilitation to include the overriding concerns of protecting the public and holding juvenile offenders accountable for violations of the law.in re.consistent with this end,the amendments changed some of the terminology of the act.the act now provides for a number of features common to a criminal trial.pertinent to our analysis are the following provisions.the legislature has now indicated an intent that the term trial replace the term adjudicatory hearing and be synonymous with that definition as it was used in the act.ilcs west.furthermore,the act now allows for a plea of guilty in a delinquency proceeding ilcs west,and if a trial is conducted,the court is required,at its conclusion,to make and note in the minutes of the proceeding a finding of whether or not the minor is guilty.emphasis added.ilcs west.if the court finds the minor guilty,the cause then proceeds to a sentencing hearing,where it is determined whether or not it is in the best interests of the minor or the public that he be made a ward of the court,with the possibility that if defendant is adjudicated a ward of the court,he could be committed to the department of corrections,juvenile division.ilcs,west.in sum,the act now provides for pleas of guilty,findings of guilty and which effectively tracks with the first clause of the term conviction as defined in the code.
these amendments support the notion that a juvenile adjudication in was not considered a sentence entered upon a plea of guilty or a verdict or finding of guilty of an offense.as previously mentioned,the changes to the juvenile court act did not become effective until january,several months after defendant juvenile adjudication.accordingly,they have no application here other than to illustrate that the legislature could have satisfied the first part of the statutory definition of conviction under the code if it had included the appropriate language to specify that an adjudication is a finding of guilty.but this would not end our analysis because even with the amendments to the juvenile court act,a juvenile adjudication still does not satisfy the second clause of the term conviction as defined by the code.
the second clause of the definition requires that the finding of guilt be rendered by a legally constituted jury or by a court of competent jurisdiction authorized to try the case without a jury.ilcs west.the juvenile court act plainly states that minors do not have a right to a jury trial unless it is specifically provided for in article v of the act.ilcs west.a juvenile proceeding based on an allegation of robbery,like the one at issue in the present case,is not one allowing for a right to a trial by jury under the act,and there is no indication that defendant was afforded the right to a jury trial on his delinquency adjudication.instead,the act requires the circuit court to conduct a bench trial on such juvenile adjudications.see ilcs west.this is all that is constitutionally required in juvenile delinquency proceedings.mckeiver pennsylvania,d.this is because a juvenile proceeding is not a criminal prosecution,within the meaning and reach of the sixth amendment.mckeiver,at.at,d at.nevertheless,juvenile adjudications can not be deemed criminal felony convictions under the code because the code definition of conviction requires that the finding of guilt be made by a court authorized to try the case without a jury,and the law does not authorize a felony conviction in the absence of a right to a trial by jury.both our federal and state constitutions preclude a criminal felony conviction without the right to a jury trial.specifically,the sixth amendment to the united states constitution states that i n all criminal prosecutions,the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial,by an impartial jury,amend.vi.similarly,our state constitution provides that i n criminal prosecutions,the accused shall have the right to have a speedy public trial by an impartial jury of the county in which the offense is alleged to have been committed.const,art.i.moreover,illinois courts have long recognized that the right of an accused to a trial by jury in a criminal felony case is absolute unless specifically waived and the defendant has been properly and adequately informed of his rights.people ex rel.swanson fisher,people cowart,d.
in duncan louisiana,d,the supreme court called the right to trial by jury in criminal cases fundamental to the american scheme of justice and held that the right applied to state prosecutions under the due process clause whenever the right would attach under federal law in a criminal case.a right to trial by jury is afforded criminal defendants to prevent oppression by the government.duncan,at.at,d at.as the court in duncan noted,
the framers of the constitutions strove to create an independent judiciary but insisted upon further protection against arbitrary action.providing an accused with the right to be tried by a jury of his peers gave him an inestimable safeguard against the corrupt or overzealous prosecutor and against the compliant,biased,or eccentric judge.if the defendant preferred the judgment of a jury to the more tutored but perhaps less sympathetic reaction of the single judge,he was to have it.duncan,at.at,d at.
we believe that when the code uses the phrase authorized to try the case without a jury ilcs west,it is referring to a situation where the defendant expressly waived his right to a jury trial if the case is one involving a felony offense.thus,we conclude that for a defendant to be deemed a person convicted of a felony within the meaning of the escape statute ilcs a west,he must have been afforded the right to a trial by jury on the predicate felony.the law does not authorize anything less.under the current legislative language employed in defining the term conviction in the code and in the absence of any clear language in the juvenile court act,we simply can not find that a juvenile adjudication is tantamount to a felony conviction for purposes of the escape statute.
even if we were to consider the escape statute to be ambiguous,as the state urges,we still would not find that the legislative intent,as expressed in various provisions of the juvenile court act,requires a different result.the policy that seeks to hold juveniles accountable for their actions and to protect the public does not negate the concept that rehabilitation remains a more important consideration in the juvenile justice system than in the criminal justice system and that there are still significant differences between the two,indicating that the ideal of separate treatment of children is still worth pursuing.mckeiver,at.at,d at.
more importantly,if we were to accept the state position,it would mean that juveniles would have the worst of both worlds,one in which,unlike their adult counterparts,they are denied a right to a jury trial,yet their adjudications are deemed prior criminal convictions for the purpose of criminal statutes that require a prior conviction as an element of an offense,all the while without the statute specifically identifying an adjudication as a prior conviction.see kent united states,d,there may be grounds for concern that the child receives the worst of both worlds that he gets neither the protections accorded to adults nor the solicitous care and regenerative treatment postulated for children.when the united states supreme court held in mckeiver that a jury trial is not guaranteed by the federal constitution in juvenile adjudications,it rested its holding mainly on the notion that juvenile proceedings are fundamentally different from criminal proceedings.mckeiver,at.at,d at.the plurality of the court noted that juvenile proceedings are undergirded by the ideal of rehabilitation rather than punishment.the plurality feared the possibility that if a jury trial were mandated in juvenile proceedings,it would put an effective end to what has been the idealistic prospect of an intimate,informal protective proceeding.mckeiver,at.at,d at.according to the plurality,a jury trial would not greatly strengthen the function and would,contrarily,provide an attrition of the juvenile court assumed ability to function in a unique manner.mckeiver,at.at,d at.the mckeiver plurality concluded by stating the following 
finally,the arguments advanced by the juveniles here are,of course,the identical arguments that underlie the demand for the jury trial for criminal proceedings.the arguments necessarily equate the juvenile at least the adjudicative phase of the criminal trial.whether they should be so equated is our issue.concern about the inapplicability of exclusionary and other rules of evidence,about the juvenile court judge possible awareness of the juvenile prior record and of the contents of the social file about repeated appearances of the same familiar witnesses in the persons of juvenile and probation officers and social to the effect that this will create the likelihood of to ignore,it seems to us,every aspect of fairness,of concern,of sympathy,and of paternal attention that the juvenile court system contemplates.
if the formalities of the criminal adjudicative process are to be superimposed upon the juvenile court system,there is little need for its separate existence.perhaps that ultimate disillusionment will come one day,but for the moment we are disinclined to give impetus to it.mckeiver,at.at,d at.
mckeiver reluctance to extend the right to a jury trial to juvenile proceedings and the absence of such a right in the juvenile court act is ample reason to reject the notion that the amendments to the act should be read to equate an adjudication with a criminal conviction in the present context.we are well aware that the amendments represent a shift from the singular goal of rehabilitation to include the overriding concerns of protecting the public and holding juvenile offenders accountable for violations of the law.in re.it is on this very the historical differences between juvenile and adult systems may no longer some commentators have criticized mckeiver and have urged that the right to a trial by jury be extended to juvenile proceedings.see hochberg,should juvenile adjudications count as prior convictions for apprendi purposes,mary,murphy,the use of prior convictions after apprendi,davis.but without the actual extension of the right to a trial by jury,it would be incongruent to hold that juvenile adjudications constitute criminal felony convictions as a matter of course or,as the state urges here,that they constitute convictions for purposes of a statute that requires as an element of the offense that the defendant be a person convicted of a felony.
the question before us is to be distinguished from the somewhat analogous issue of whether a juvenile adjudication is considered a prior conviction for sentencing enhancement purposes under apprendi new jersey,d.in apprendi,the court stated that o ther than the fact of a prior conviction,any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury,and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.emphasis added.apprendi,at.at,d at.the federal circuits are divided over th
