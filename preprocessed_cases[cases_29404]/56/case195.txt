welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b hereafter section b,as amended on march,by proposition entitled the gang violence and juvenile crime prevention act of,mandates prosecution in adult criminal court of minors who are at least years of age at the time they allegedly commit certain murders or sex offenses.in this case we consider whether a prosecution under section b may be initiated by grand jury indictment.we conclude a minor may be indicted under section b,and therefore affirm the judgment of the court of appeal.

ii.discussion 
section,subdivision a,sets forth a general rule that minors who commit crimes fall within the juvenile court jurisdiction manduley superior court cal th,d,manduley.section b is an exception to this general rule,providing any person who is alleged,when he or she was years of age or older,to have committed one of the following offenses shall be prosecuted under the general law in a court of criminal jurisdiction murder,as described in section of the penal code,if one of the circumstances enumerated in subdivision a of section of the penal code is alleged by the prosecutor,and the prosecutor alleges that the minor personally killed the victim.enumerated sex offenses,if the prosecutor alleges that the minor personally committed the offense,and if the prosecutor alleges one of the circumstances enumerated in the one strike law,subdivision d or e of section of the penal code,applies italics added.
petitioner does not contend that a juvenile may never be indicted,only that a prosecution under section b may not be initiated by indictment.see people aguirre d.no cases limit the authority of the grand jury to indict persons of any age,providing the offense has been committed or is triable within the county.in particular,she adopts the interpretation of section b in gevorgyan,which held the language alleged by the prosecutor and the prosecutor alleges refers solely to an information because an indictment contains the allegations of the grand jury,not the prosecutor.gevorgyan,supra,th at,d.the people argue that once an indictment is presented to the superior court it becomes the accusatory pleading of the prosecutor.
we agree with the people.the focus of welfare and institutions code section b appears to be on the circumstances alleged,not on who alleges them.indeed,as a practical matter,because the prosecutor represents the people in every criminal action whether initiated by indictment or information,he has a hand in making all such allegations,dix superior court cal d.in any event,we find persuasive the following portion of the court of appeal analysis 
to assess whether an indictment contains the allegations of the prosecutor,we first examine the role served by an indictment.the california constitution specifies that felonies shall be prosecuted either by indictment or,after examination and commitment by a magistrate,by information.cal,art.i.penal code section reads in pertinent part,t he first pleading on the part of the people in the superior court in a felony case is the indictment,information,or the complaint in any case certified to the superior court under penal code section.the people of the state of california are the plaintiff in every criminal proceeding,and the public prosecutor has the sole responsibility to represent the people of the state of california in the prosecution of criminal offenses.dix superior court,supra,cal d.accordingly,the first pleading by the prosecution in felony cases may be either an indictment or an information.witkin epstein,law ed.pretrial proceedings,italics added.
it is important to understand the role that the grand jury plays in the indictment process.the grand jury is a judicial body that is part of the judicial branch of government.mcclatchy newspapers superior court cal d.the role of the grand jury in an indictment proceeding is to determine whether probable cause exists to accuse a defendant of a particular crime.cummiskey superior court cal th,d.in this capacity,the grand jury serves as the functional equivalent of a magistrate who presides over a preliminary examination on a felony complaint.like the magistrate,the grand jury must determine whether sufficient evidence has been presented to support holding a defendant to answer on a criminal complaint.id.at,d.thus,the grand jury serves as part of the charging process in very much the same manner as does a magistrate in a prosecution initiated by complaint.
when the district attorney chooses to proceed by indictment rather than by information,the indictment itself must be draw n by the district attorney.however,a prosecutor who draws an indictment acts as more than a mere scribe.the prosecutor alleges the facts contained in the indictment and is bound by rule of the california rules of professional conduct,which prohibits prosecutors from institut ing or caus ing to be instituted criminal charges when the member knows or should know that the charges are not supported by probable cause.the public prosecutor is also specifically charged within his or her discretion to initiate and conduct all prosecutions.therefore,while the indictment may contain the allegations of the grand jury,it also contains the allegations of the prosecutor,who drafts the indictment and who is bound to exercise discretion to initiate the prosecution only upon such charges that the prosecutor knows are supported by probable cause.
not only does the indictment contain the allegations of the prosecutor when first presented to the grand jury,it also effectively contains the prosecutor allegations when returned by the grand jury and filed with the court.as noted above,the indictment is the first pleading of the prosecution charging the defendant with a crime.the prosecutor does not thereafter file a separate document containing the charging allegations against the defendant.
in light of the court of appeal foregoing analysis,once an indictment is filed in the trial court and the prosecutor carries forward a prosecution based on that pleading,the indictment necessarily contains the prosecutor allegations.indeed,the prosecutor has certain discretion regarding the indictment.he may seek to amend it,for example,to charge prior convictions not included in the indictment,without any further action on the part of the grand jury.he may also seek dismissal of the action in furtherance of justice,subd.a.
moreover,it appears section b does not come into play until after the indictment is filed in the trial court.section b provides that certain minors shall be prosecuted under the general law in a court of criminal jurisdiction.it then makes reference to the language at issue here regarding the prosecutor allegations.arguably,the time at which a minor is prosecuted under the general law in a court of criminal jurisdiction ibid.is following the filing of an indictment.that is because the trial court can not determine whether the allegations satisfy the section b criteria,and hence the minor is p
