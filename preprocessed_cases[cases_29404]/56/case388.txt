appellant neil appeals from an order granting respondents mary and scott to quash neil petition to establish paternity,obtain joint custody and reasonable visitation,pay child support,and for genetic testing.in that petition,neil sought to establish a relationship with twins born to mary while she was married to scott,who had accepted the children as his own.asserting his relationship with the children began in utero while he attended to mary neonatal care and sang or talked to the unborn children,and that mary and scott obstructed his ability to take them into his home,neil contends he has a constitutionally protected due process right to an opportunity to develop or continue his relationship with them.he asks this court to hold family code section,subdivision d of the uniform parentage act et,the upa and its related statutory scheme unconstitutional both facially and as applied to these facts on due process and equal protection grounds.he also challenges the constitutionality of section,subdivision b,requiring a court to reconcile conflicting paternity presumptions,when applied to presumed unwed fathers.
we conclude the family court correctly dismissed neil petition for lack of standing,and that,on these facts,dawn superior court cal th dawn defeats his claim to a due process opportunity interest in establishing a relationship with the children.we reject neil remaining contentions.accordingly,we affirm the order.
factual and procedural background 
on may,mary,who has been married to her husband scott since june,gave birth to twins.scott was present at the birth and has accepted the twins as his children.
in february,when the twins were ten months old,neil filed a petition to establish paternity and for an order awarding him joint custody and reasonable visitation,as well as genetic testing to determine his status as the children biological father.in his supporting declaration,he stated that from may to october,he and mary,both career sailors,had an affair while they were stationed in bahrain.he asserted they spoke of marriage and had agreed to marry each other.neil was also married at the time.according to neil,mary left for san diego in october and upon her return to bahrain,tests indicated she was pregnant with twins.he claimed she told him she had conceived in the middle to early part of september,and the children were his.
neil declared that from october until mary left bahrain in february,he took her to doctor visits and generally cared for her,and spoke,read and sang to the twins in utero.according to neil,after mary returned to san diego in february,she notified him that she and scott would be raising the children,and her husband name would be placed on their birth certificates.
mary moved to quash the petition.she argued neil lacked standing to pursue an action to determine the existence of a relationship under section,and would never prevail in his attempt to be deemed the twins presumed father that her husband was conclusively and rebuttably presumed to be the children father.in her supporting declaration,mary disputed many of neil assertions concerning the nature and extent of their relationship.she asserted that between october,and october,she and her husband resided together at their home and engaged in sexual relations on a regular basis,and thereafter,in november,she discovered she was pregnant.mary stated scott was involved in preparing for the twins arrival and birth,was present at their birth,chose their names with her,attended parenting classes with her,and visited the twins every day during the month they were in neonatal intensive care as a result of their premature birth,helping with their care including feeding and swaddling.scott name was placed on the children birth certificates.according to mary,scott was a dad and the twins primary caregiver at the time and did their feeding,changed diapers,bathed and dressed them,took them to doctors appointments,played and read to them,and was otherwise responsible for meeting their needs since birth.
neil opposed the motion to quash,in part arguing the marital presumption of paternity did not apply and the state had a compelling interest in establishing the paternity of children for purposes of their access to benefits,knowledge of family medical history and their emotional development.he argued public policy was best served by determining the children true paternity.neil challenged mary truthfulness and,in an accompanying declaration,set out additional details of their relationship and circumstances surrounding the date of conception,his involvement in the children prenatal care,his attempts to work out a child sharing arrangement,his conduct in holding the children out as his own to his family members,and his efforts to file a voluntary declaration of paternity.he asserted mary had admitted he was the children father and initially promised he would be involved with them,but later ended her contact,even returning christmas gifts he had sent them.he emphasized there were two intact families available to raise the children.neil wife and parents submitted declarations expressing their desire to help raise the children.
mary moved to strike most of neil declaration and much of his responsive submission 
the court granted mary motion quashing neil petition and ordering the action dismissed.it ruled neil had presented evidence that he held the children out as his own,but found it undisputed that he did not receive them into his home.the court found while his evidence showed he made reasonable,if not extraordinary attempts to receive the children into his home but was prevented by mary from doing so,such a theory of constructive receipt had been rejected by adoption of kelsey cal th.thus,it ruled neil could not establish presumed father status under section,subdivision d.finding the issue addressed by dawn,supra,cal th,the court disposed of neil argument that he was deprived of a constitutionally cognizable opportunity interest in developing a relationship with the children.
this appeal followed from the ensuing order dismissing the case.
discussion 
presumptions of paternity 
the upa with its various presumptions provides the framework by which california courts make paternity determinations.dawn,supra,cal th at said jegan th.under section,the child of a wife cohabitating with her husband,who is not impotent or sterile,is conclusively presumed to be a child of the marriage.the statute establishes what has been described as a conclusive presumption of paternity in a case of a child born to a wife cohabitating with her husband at the time of conception.dawn,cal th at,fn.this presumption is subject to challenges not applicable here,subds.b,c.
section describes presumptions of paternity that may be rebutted in an appropriate action by clear and convincing evidence,subd.a.under subdivision a of section,a man is presumed to be the natural father of a child born during,or within days after the termination of,his marriage to the child mother.dawn,supra,cal th at.this presumption does not require any proof of cohabitation rather,the only predicate is birth during a valid marriage or within days after the marriage termination.craig sandy th,craig.the section,subdivision a presumption may be challenged only by the child,the mother or a presumed father,subd.a dawn,cal th at craig,th at.
section,subdivision d creates a rebuttable presumption that a man is the natural father of a child if he receives the child into his home and openly holds out the child as his natural child.establishing presumed father status under this presumption requires a certain level of contact between the alleged father and child a putative father time spent with the child on alternate weekends has been held sufficient to constitute receiving a child into his home craig,supra,th at,citing in re richard cal d,as has daytime child care and one overnight stay each week in the putative father home.craig,at.any interested party may bring an action to determine the existence of a relationship under this subdivision,subd.b.
although more than one individual may fulfill the statutory criteria that give rise to a presumption of paternity,there can be only one presumed father.in re jesusa cal th.when two or more conflicting presumptions arise under section as when more than one man qualifies as a presumed father under them a court must reconcile these competing interests under section,and under that section the presumption which on the facts is founded on the weightier considerations of policy and logic controls.in re jesusa,at,quoting,subd.b.
further,section does not envision an automatic preference for biological fathers,even if the biological father has come forward to assert his rights.jesusa,supra,cal th at interpreting section,subdivision a.indeed if the legislature had intended that a man who is not a biological father can not be a presumed father under section,it would not have provided for such weighing,for among two competing claims for presumed father status under section,there can be only one biological father.jesusa,at.thus,a court is not bound by section to accord determinative weight to biology.jesusa,at superior court th.
rather,the core considerations are the integrity of the family and protection of the child well being,which require us to assess the existence and nature of the social relationship between a putative father and child.the paternity presumptions are generated by society interest in preserving the integrity of the family and legitimate concerns for the welfare of the child.the state has an interest in preserving and protecting the developed relationships which give young children social and emotional strength and stability.lisa superior court th,citing in re nicholas cal th.this court in particular recognizes that the constitutionally valid objective of our paternity laws is the protection of the child well being.craig,supra,th at,citing adoption of kelsey,supra,cal th at.i ncreasingly over the last three decades,our courts have resolved paternity disputes by looking to the existence and nature of the social relationship between the putative father and child.craig,at.we have given great weight to these social relationships,holding the relationship of a man who has lived with a child and treated the child as his son or daughter is much more important,to the child at least,than a biological relationship of actual paternity,citing in re marriage of freeman th.
ii.standing 
in quashing neil petition and dismissing the action,the family court did not make an express determination of the threshold issue of standing.that is of no moment,as standing is a question of law,particularly where,as here,it depends on statutory provisions conferring standing.th.
though neil argued below that he had standing to bring a paternity challenge under section,subdivision d,on appeal,he does not squarely argue he possesses standing under this provision or the upa to determine the existence of a relationship with the children.we conclude he does not.scott who is married to mary and has not only held out the children as his own but also has taken them into his home attains presumed father status under both subdivisions a and d of section.accord,dawn,supra,cal th at lisa superior court,supra,th at.by contrast,neil,who never married nor attempted to marry mary,and never received the children into his home despite considerable efforts to do so,can not attain presumed status under section.thus,even assuming neil qualified as an interested party under section,subdivision b see ante,fn,his action would appear neither to affect scott status as a presumed father under subdivision a of section nor to confer on neil presumed father status.dawn,at,fn.under these circumstances,the upa precludes neil from bringing a paternity action and from compelling mary and the children to submit to blood tests to resolve the question of biological parenthood.dawn,at lisa,at.
iii.constitutional challenges 
neil focus on appeal is his claim that the upa is unconstitutional to the extent it denies him an alleged the opportunity to establish or develop a relationship.neil argues he has a constitutionally protected liberty interest in that opportunity as a matter of substantive due process under the state and federal constitutions.he characterizes this case as one of first impression,claiming no other case presents the scenario where a man with his own extant marital family unit had a prenatal relationship with the children but was obstructed by the mother and her husband from taking them into his own home after their birth so as to prevent him from become a presumed father.pointing out dna analysis can now determine paternity with virtual certainty,neil asserts that a biological connection alone ought to be enough on which to base his right to assert or prove he has parental rights.
neil additionally contends his interest is protected by state and federal constitutional equal protection that unwed biological fathers should be entitled to the same rights and obligations as biological fathers.based on these arguments,he asks us to hold section,subdivision d unconstitutional both on its face and as applied to his circumstances on due process and equal protection grounds.he suggests we should also hold section,subdivision b unconstitutional on equal protection grounds as applied to him because,even if he were given presumed father status,the court could still find scott presumption controls under weightier considerations of policy and logic.
mary points out that neil did not raise his equal protection arguments or the constitutionality of section,subdivision b in the trial court.she responds that later authorities in re nicholas,supra,cal th and in re jesusa,supra,cal th hold biological paternity does not automatically rebut the section marital and nonmarital presumptions where two putative parents both have standing.she maintains neil was not deprived of a liberty interest because he does not have an existing relationship with the children.
dawn defeats neil claim of a constitutional due process liberty interest 
we conclude neil constitutional due process challenge is squarely resolved by the california supreme court decision in dawn,supra,cal th.in dawn,the mother became pregnant while separated from her husband and living with another man.dawn,at.after she became pregnant,the mother assertedly told others the baby was the alleged father and that they intended to marry,but several months later,she reconciled with her husband.id.at,dis,chin.thereafter,the alleged biological father filed a complaint to establish a parental relationship with the then unborn child,and completed a parenting course.ibid.a few months later,the mother gave birth to the child,and the child had resided with her and her husband since his birth.ibid.the alleged father attempted to,but could not,negotiate an agreement for child support and visitation with the mother and her husband.ibid.
the court first pointed out that under the upa,the mother husband was,rebuttably,a presumed father under section,subdivisions a and d,and the alleged biological father met none of the statutory conditions for presumed father status.dawn,supra,cal th at.it held the alleged biological father as neil here could not rebut the husband presumed father status because he lacked standing to bring the paternity action which precluded him from compelling the mother and child to submit to blood tests to resolve the question of biological parenthood.under the circumstances,section,subdivision a restricted standing to challenge the presumption of a husband paternity to the child,the child natural mother,or a presumed father.dawn,at.
the court then turned to the question of whether the alleged biological father had a liberty interest,protected as a matter of substantive due process,in being permitted to develop a parental relationship with his offspring.dawn,supra,cal th at.in order to reach that question,the court emphasized it was required to first make a careful description id.at,quoting washington glucksberg,of the asserted fundamental liberty interest.under the circumstances there,the alleged father sought constitutional protection for his interest in establishing a relationship with his child born to a woman married to another man at the
