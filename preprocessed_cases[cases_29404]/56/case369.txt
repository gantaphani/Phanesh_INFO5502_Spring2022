introduction 
and her brother,now and seven years old,respectively,have been dependents of the juvenile court system for more than four years.foster care was chosen as their permanent plan.primarily because of their behavioral problems,no foster care placement has been successful,and the children have been living at an emergency shelter group home for over one year.the orange county social services agency ssa,as well as other professionals charged with and ad,ultimately determined that they each stood a better chance of a foster care placement if they were placed separately.after a hearing,the juvenile court rescinded its earlier order requiring that and ad.be placed together.their mother,mother,appeals from the order permitting and ad.to be placed separately.the juvenile court did not err,and we therefore affirm.
mother also appeals from an order approving an application to administer psychotropic medication to ad.mother argues she was denied due process because of the short timeframe contained in california rules of court,rule c,for filing an opposition to the application.we disagree,and affirm the juvenile court order.we publish this opinion especially to call the judicial council attention to the need to amend this rule of court to change the filing date for an opposition to or a request for hearing on an application to administer psychotropic medication.
statement of facts and procedural history 
and,then six and three years old,respectively,were detained in december.the juvenile court sustained a dependency petition under welfare and institutions code section,subdivisions b and c.all further statutory references are to the welfare and institutions code.and ad.were removed from their parents custody,and family reunification services were ordered.following a section hearing,the juvenile court ordered a permanent plan of foster care for and,finding they were not adoptable and no one was willing to accept legal guardianship of them.
and ad.were placed at the new alternatives sibling assessment facility saf because there were no foster homes available to accommodate both of them.some placements had been ended by the foster parents because of and ad.behavioral issues.before the section hearing,the juvenile court had approved the administration of psychotropic medication to to deal with her physical and verbal aggression,severe tantrums,and head banging.behavior gradually improved,and,by may,she displayed few or no major behavioral issues.
however,continued having severe tantrums.during his tantrums,he would hit,kick,bang his head,and make statements such as,y ou just want me to die.ad.was periodically placed on observe status at saf,and twice attempted to assault saf staff members.when mother failed to visit and ad.between may and june,negative acting out behaviors increased,and ad.became aggressive,assaultive,and.ad.therapist recommended that the saf staff remain with him all day,and ad.was assigned a therapeutic behavior specialist due to his aggressive and defiant behavior.
after and ad.had been housed at saf for more than seven months,the saf staff and and ad.social worker,among others,agreed ssa should attempt to secure separate foster homes for the children.preplacement visits occurred between and a potential foster mother.and ad.appointed attorney objected to their potential separation,and mother requested a contested hearing be held before a decision was made on whether to place them separately.
in a postpermanent plan review report filed in august,pursuant to section,ssa reported that and ad.remained placed at saf.and ad.wanted to have their parents visit,and wanted to move into a foster home,but did not want to be adopted.ad.behavior was impeding an alternative placement option.although mother wanted to reunify with and,she failed to visit consistently.the aggressive and disruptive behavior displayed by both and ad.was connected to mother inconsistent visits.their therapist reported both and ad.experienced tantrums,aggression,noncompliant behavior,and negative behavior,all of which impaired their daily living activities and ability to learn and socially thrive.ad.also suffered from anxiety,and experienced symptoms of anxiety,fear,sadness,and sleep disturbances related to placement changes.
ad.special advocate casa reported he was currently the most depressed and emotionally unstable that she had ever seen him during the year and a half she had known him.the casa stated that ad.is a great kid who feels like no one wants him and is just looking for someone to spoil him with attention and love.the casa also reported that and ad.feed off each other by antagonizing each other,although would help ad.and talk to him when he became angry.
in review reports,ssa reported that mother cancelled visits and failed to appear for another visits with and ad.during the period from march through september.ssa also reported that preplacement visits with a foster family had gone well,and she was ready to be placed with the family,but no foster homes were available for,who continued to have significant behavioral issues.
casa reported that and ad.had a good relationship,they played well together,and enjoyed each other company.was preoccupied with the uncertainty of her situation and her relationships with others.ssa reported that wanted to move to a foster home,and said she was ok with moving away from ad.
at the review hearing,mother attorney objected to separating and,on the ground separation would be detrimental to both of them.however,and ad.counsel advised the court and the parties that ad.therapist had stated that while ad.originally opposed being separated from,ad.now agreed and understood that it might be appropriate for to have a different placement.during informal discussions,the substance of which was later agreed to on the record by the court and all counsel,the children counsel advised the court that therapist had also indicated it would be appropriate for her to have a separate placement.
the juvenile court found and ad.permanent plan of foster care remained appropriate,but rescinded an earlier order preventing their separation.the court also authorized monitored weekly sibling visits.
in a later review report,ssa reported that and ad.were still living at saf.potential foster parents had declined to accept her placement with them,because the order for sibling visits was too onerous for them.
on september,ad.was given a dose of a psychotropic medication,risperdal,on an emergency basis due to his increasingly dangerous and behavior.ad.behavioral difficulties had increased dramatically,and he was having major issues on a daily basis.ad.suffered tantrums that lasted three to five hours,displayed and assaultive behaviors,and had difficulty regulating his mood.on september,ssa filed an application seeking approval of the earlier administration of risperdal,and authorization to continue to administer it,to ad.to help control his behavior.the juvenile court granted the application,but requested that the doctor seek an alternative medication.neither party disputes that risperdal is a psychotropic drug,the administration of which is governed by section,and california rules of court,rule.
on september,ssa filed a report stating that the severity and frequency of ad.acting out behaviors had decreased since he began taking risperdal,although he had still engaged in several incidents of unsafe and assaultive behavior.
on october,mother filed an opposition to the application for administering psychotropic medication,arguing that ad.behavior had worsened because of the plan to separate him from mother felt the use of psychotropic medication was a drastic and potentially harmful measure.she specifically objected to the use of risperdal,due to the lack of studies regarding its use in children,and the potential of harm from the drug,due to her family history of diabetes,heart disease,high blood pressure,and stroke.mother requested that ssa pursue an alternative treatment method.
ssa filed another report before an october,review hearing.ssa stated that ad.psychologist opined the risperdal had subdued and mellowed,and had given him more moments of not being aggressive.the psychologist believed ad.showed progress because he was more needy,vulnerable,and emotional,rather than controlling and angry.saf reported a significant decrease in ad.aggression.
at the review hearing,mother counsel requested a hearing on mother opposition to ad.psychotropic medication regimen.mother claimed she did not receive notice of the application until september,making her opposition one day late.mother counsel also argued the requirement to file an opposition was unconstitutional.counsel stated the legislature has made it unreasonable for mother to make her concerns known to the court for having a hearing with the psychiatrist.so,we asking that the court waive the defect in the filing time and ask to set a hearing.
the juvenile court found mother opposition untimely,and also found the opposition failed to show any harm to ad.by the administration of risperdal.therefore,the court denied mother request without prejudice,subject to any concerns.the court ordered that a copy of mother opposition be submitted to ad.psychiatrist to ensure he was aware of the family medical history.
mother filed separate notices of appeal from the order permitting separate placements for and,and the order authorizing the administration of psychotropic medication to ad.
discussion 
permitting separate foster care placements 
mother challenges the juvenile court order permitting and ad.to be separated for purposes of foster care placements.
ssa argues mother appeal of this order is moot,because after entry of the order,mother stipulated that the separate placements of and ad.were necessary and appropriate.in support of this argument,ssa filed a request for judicial notice of a periodic review report signed by mother counsel,and the minute order from the periodic review hearing on february,and motions to augment the record on appeal and to take additional evidence of ssa addendum report for that periodic review hearing.
while postjudgment evidence is generally not admissible on appeal in re zeth cal th,it may be considered to determine whether it renders an issue moot on appeal in re josiah cal th.the evidence offered by ssa in support of its mootness argument is not the type of unambiguous stipulation that this court has previously found sufficient to dismiss an appeal as moot.in re dani th.mother did not sign the document ssa refers to as a stipulation,and has submitted a declaration stating she would never have stipulated that and ad.should be placed separately.under these circumstances,the purported stipulation does not unambiguously render the appeal of the separate placements order moot.we therefore deny the request for judicial notice,the motion to augment,and the motion to take additional evidence.
ssa also argues mother lacks standing to raise this argument on appeal because the juvenile court order affects and ad.rights,not mother.the cases ssa cites for the proposition that a parent lacks standing to challenge such placement decisions all predate the creation of the sibling bond exception to termination of parental rights an exception that a parent unquestionably has standing to argue,subd.c b v in re th.
contrary to ssa argument is a host of recent cases finding parents have standing in dependency cases to raise issues regarding placement and visitation.see in re esperanza th,before parental rights terminated,parent has standing to challenge juvenile court order regarding placement decisions in re valerie th,parent has standing to raise issues of sibling visitation that affect the applicability of the sibling bond exception to termination of parental rights in re th,after reunification services terminated,parent still has standing to challenge order removing child from relative placement.we conclude mother has standing to challenge the juvenile court order permitting and ad.to be placed in separate foster homes.
placement decisions in dependency proceedings are committed to the sound discretion of the juvenile court,and the trial court ruling should not be disturbed on appeal unless an abuse of discretion is clearly established.citations.in re stephanie cal th.
mother points out that,at the september,hearing at which the order was entered,the juvenile court did not admit into evidence any ssa report or casa report that stated separate foster home placements would be in and ad.best interests.the juvenile court,however,could consider and ad.lengthy history in the juvenile court system they were removed from mother custody more than three years earlier.the court was well aware of the many unsuccessful efforts to place and ad.in a foster home together and of the negative effect on them of their lengthy stay in saf,which is designed as an emergency shelter home,not a foster placement.see generally in re mickel th,juvenile court considers entire factual and procedural history of the case when considering section petition.
the juvenile court did not abuse its discretion in rescinding its earlier order that and ad.not be placed in separate foster homes.and ad.had been at the emergency saf placement for more than eight months,and ssa had been unable to find any foster placement willing to accept them as a sibling set.following a meeting between ssa social workers,ssa supervisors,saf supervisors,a casa supervisor,a court psychologist,and ad.therapeutic behavior specialist,it was decided by that group the best plan for and ad.would be to try to secure separate foster placements for them.within a day,a potential foster placement for had been identified.
the juvenile court refused to consider the request to change the placement order immediately,and instead opted to review the reports carefully and decide the issue at a later scheduled periodic review hearing.ultimately,after further reports were filed and the parties were able to argue the issue at the periodic review hearing,the juvenile court rescinded its order prohibiting and ad.separate placements.at that hearing,and ad.appointed counsel advised the court and the parties that ad.had told his therapist it might be appropriate for a.to have a different placement.this statement involves multiple layers of hearsay and would normally be inadmissible.but we can not ignore counsel role as and ad.guardian ad litem,charged not only with advocating for them but also with presenting their wishes to the court,subds.c,e.mother did not object to the court consideration of counsel unsworn statement on the ground of hearsay,and her counsel expressly acknowledged at the hearing that the therapist does believe it would be detrimental to place and ad.in separate placements.see in re heather d,unsworn testimony at juvenile court hearing may be evidence if the other side does not object.
mother is correct that section requires that siblings removed from their home and placed in foster care be placed together unless it has been determined that placement together is contrary to the safety or of any sibling,subd.a.that same statute requires the responsible agency to make a diligent effort to place siblings in the same foster care placement,but also requires that when this is not possible,ongoing and frequent interaction among siblings must be facilitated,subd.b.the record in this case shows that ssa made a diligent effort to place and ad.in the same foster home.when it was determined that requiring they be placed together was negatively affecting their placement options,the order allowing separate placements required weekly visitation between them.the juvenile court order did not violate the mandate of section.
the need to protect the sibling bond between and ad.by keeping them placed together directly conflicts with the need to find permanent homes for them.this conflict distinguishes this case from so many others that we review.we do not intend to minimize the potential negative effects of their separation.there is no perfect solution here.this case,therefore,is an excellent example of the abuse of discretion standard of revi
