hellgate adopted the iep designed by sparta in august.when hellgate personnel observed that the plan was not benefitting,it reduced speech therapy for a two and a period from august to september.jamie frost,the hellgate speech pathologist,disagreed with the need for two hours of weekly therapy provided for in the sparta iep.she stated that it caused to shut down and refuse to talk in the classroom.
parents also enrolled him in,a private preschool program,in august.parents informed that they were enrolling him at because they were concerned about autism.
on september,hellgate convened a meeting to develop a new iep for parents were present.at the meeting,hellgate personnel stated that they lacked sufficient information about educational needs to develop specific iep goals and objectives for him.before this meeting,the hellgate members of the iep team had read gold evaluation,but did not discuss it at the meeting.the iep team determined that should be evaluated by conducting classroom observations for approximately six weeks to assess his speech,language,behavioral,social,and preschool readiness skills.the iep team plan was set forth in a document entitled a diagnostic iep.the diagnostic iep reduced educational and related services from thirteen and a half hours to approximately five hours per week.it also reduced speech therapy from two hours per week to hour per week.mother signed the diagnostic iep.
on november,hellgate conducted a meeting to create an iep to replace the diagnostic iep.during this meeting,parents suggested to hellgate iep team members that might be autistic.the hellgate iep team referred the parents to missoula child development center cdc,where free autism testing could be performed with parental consent.on march,the cdc reported that exhibited behavior consistent with autism spectrum disorder,including significant ongoing speech and language deficits,motor skill deficits,mild cognitive deficits,and atypical behaviors.in response to the cdc diagnosis,the iep team reconvened on march.it revised the iep,incrementally increasing preschool instruction time from approximately five hours per week to twelve and a half hours per week by may.
the iep team reconvened on may,to develop iep for the school year and determine need for esy services.parents were present.the hellgate iep team members determined that did not require esy services.parents refused to endorse the proposed iep.they expressed their disagreement with the hellgate team members decision not to provide esy services.the parents did not sign the plan and did not enroll in hellgate in september.
appellants filed a request for an impartial due process hearing with the montana office of public instruction opi on or about september.an administrative due process hearing was conducted over the course of seven days in january and february.the due process hearing officer issued his findings of fact,conclusions of law,and order on april,denying appellants claim for relief.
appellants filed a complaint with the united states district court for the district of montana on may.the district court affirmed the hearing officer order.on january,appellants filed a timely appeal with this court.this court has jurisdiction under,as this is an appeal from a final judgment of a united states district court entered december.this is a civil action arising under the laws of the united states,namely the idea.the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to and i.
we review the district court findings of fact for clear error even when they are based on the written record of administrative proceedings.burlington,weyerhaeuser,cir gregory longview sch,cir.a finding of fact is clearly erroneous when the evidence in the record supports the finding but the reviewing court is left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.burlington,at.questions of law and mixed questions of fact and law are reviewed de novo,unless the mixed question is primarily factual.gregory,at.we review de novo the question whether a school district proposed individualized education program provided a fape.id.
the idea provides federal funds to assist state and local agencies in educating children with disabilities,but conditions such funding on compliance with certain goals and procedures.ojai unified sch.dist.jackson,cir.its goal is to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education that emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs and prepare them for further education,employment,and independent living.d a.the term free appropriate public education is defined as special education and related services that are provided in conformity with the individualized education program required under section d of this title.id.d.the term individualized education program is defined in the idea as a written statement for each child with a disability that is developed,reviewed,and revised in accordance with section d of this title.id.
a state must comply both procedurally and substantively with the idea.fed.way sch,cir citing bd.of educ.rowley,d.in determining whether hellgate denied plaintiff a fape,the court must engage in a inquiry.first,the court must examine whether the state complied with the procedures set forth in the act and,second,whether the individualized educational program developed through the act procedures was reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits.amanda ex rel.annette clark county sch,cir alteration in original quoting rowley,at.however,the court need not reach the question of substantive compliance if the court finds procedural inadequacies that result in the loss of educational opportunity,or seriously infringe the parents opportunity to participate in the iep formulation process,or that caused a deprivation of educational benefits.ex rel.vashon island sch,cir quoting amanda,at.here,appellants contend that hellgate failed to comply with both the procedural and substantive requirements of the idea.each argument will be addressed in turn.
compliance with the idea procedures is essential to ensuring that every eligible child receives a fape,and those procedures which provide for meaningful parent participation are particularly important.amanda,at.when the elaborate and highly specific procedural safeguards embodied in the idea are contrasted with the general and somewhat imprecise substantive admonitions contained in the act,we think that the importance congress attached to these procedural safeguards can not be gainsaid.rowley,at.furthermore,a school district must comply not only with federal statutory and regulatory procedures,but with state regulations as well state standards that are not inconsistent with federal standards under the idea are also enforceable in federal court.bd.of trs.of target range sch.dist,cir.
yet,as the ninth circuit has recognized,there is some leeway in the procedural requirements 
not every procedural violation,however,is sufficient to support a finding that the child in question was denied a fape.technical deviations,for example,will not render an iep invalid.on the other hand,procedural inadequacies that result in the loss of educational opportunity,or seriously infringe the parents opportunity to participate in the iep formulation process,or that caused a deprivation of educational benefits,clearly result in the denial of a fape.
amanda,at citations and internal quotations omitted.
appellants contend that ieps were not developed in compliance with the idea procedural requirements because the diagnostic iep was not valid and hellgate failed to meet its obligation to evaluate in all areas of suspected disability.as explained below,we are persuaded that the district court erred in determining that hellgate complied with the procedural requirements of the idea.we conclude that hellgate failure to meet its obligation to evaluate in all areas of suspected disability,including whether he is autistic,was a procedural error that denied a fape.thus,this court need not reach the question whether the diagnostic iep was valid.
appellants assert that hellgate failed to meet its obligation under the idea to evaluate when it referred parents to the cdc,for an autism evaluation,rather than arranging for an evaluation after being apprised of gold diagnosis.appellants do not object to the fact that the cdc conducted the evaluation it is undisputed that hellgate did not have personnel qualified to conduct an autism evaluation.rather,appellants maintain that hellgate failure to obtain the evaluation and to give parents notice that it would pay the cost of an evaluation,if any,violated the idea,a c.appellants contend that the hearing officer and the district court erroneously concluded that parents had the burden of obtaining the evaluation from the cdc.they also argue that hellgate failure to obtain a timely autism evaluation was fatal to the development and delivery of a fape during the school year.
a child must be tested in all areas of suspected disability.b.the evaluation includes gathering information that may assist in determining the content of the child individualized education program,including information related to enabling the child to be involved in and progress in the general curriculum,or,for preschool children,to participate in appropriate activities.b a.the local educational agency shall administer such tests and other evaluation materials as may be needed to produce the data identified by the iep team in order to determine the needs of the child.id.c.each local educational agency shall ensure that b any standardized tests that are given to the child ii are administered by trained and knowledgeable personnel.id.b b ii.in conducting or obtaining an evaluation,the school district shall ensure that the child is assessed in all areas of suspected disability.id.b c g.
as of september,hellgate iep team members were on notice that likely suffered from some form of autism.the record indicates that parents discussed gold evaluation with hellgate special education director in august.further,it is undisputed that by the time of the september iep meeting,hellgate personnel had reviewed gold evaluation.this evaluation was enclosed in file indicating that there was an autistic component to poor performance.
hellgate suggested to parents that they obtain a general evaluation of at the september,iep meeting.it referred parents to the cdc for general testing.hellgate contends that,despite this recommendation,parents failed to procure an evaluation from the cdc after the september iep meeting.the fact that hellgate referred the parents to the cdc shows that hellgate was mindful that an evaluation was necessary.thus,hellgate assertion that it did not suspect had autism prior to the november iep meeting,because parents had not raised it at a prior iep meeting,is not supported by the record.hellgate failed to meet its obligation to evaluate in all areas of suspected disabilities after becoming aware of gold diagnosis.
hellgate did not fulfill its statutory obligations by simply referring parents to the cdc.such an action does not ensure that the child is assessed,as required by b c.see also union sch.dist.smith,cir holding that a parent failure to secure an evaluation,even if the parents agreed to obtain it,does not excuse the school district obligation under the idea to secure such an evaluation.in union school district,the parents of the student failed to turn over portions of a report issued by a specialist that may have been relevant to the placement of the student.id.the court held that the failure of the parents to turn over portions of a specialist report can not excuse the district failure to procure the same information for itself.id.
a school district can not abdicate its affirmative duties under the idea,at.in,the school failed to ensure that the proper parties were involved in the iep meetings,as required by statute.id.
target range arguments that the parents are to blame because they left the iep meeting,did not file a dissenting report,and led the district to believe that the principal problem was transportation,are without merit.the parents had no obligation to file a dissent.
the act imposes upon the school district the duty to conduct a meaningful meeting with the appropriate parties.target range failed to do so.target range failed to fulfill the goal of parental participation in the iep process and failed to develop a complete and sufficiently individualized educational program according to the procedures specified by the act.
the failure to obtain critical medical information about whether a child has autism render s the accomplishment of the idea the achievement of a.amanda,at.in amanda,the school district withheld from amanda parents reports indicating possible autism.this court stated 
we hold that,by failing to disclose amanda full records to her parents once they were requested,in violation of b a,the district denied amanda a fape.the iep team could not create an iep that addressed amanda special needs as an autistic child without knowing that amanda was autistic.even worse,amanda parents were not informed of the possibility that their daughter suffered from disease that benefits from early intensive the fact that the district records contained test results indicating as much.not only were amanda parents prevented from participating fully,effectively,and in an informed manner in the development of amanda iep,they were not even aware that an independent psychiatric evaluation was recommended,an evaluation that amanda mother testified she would have had performed immediately.these procedural violations,which prevented amanda parents from learning critical medical information about their child,rendered the accomplishment of the idea the achievement of a.
