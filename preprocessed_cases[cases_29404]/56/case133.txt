petitioner jonah spent almost months in detention before he was sentenced to a term of confinement under the federal juvenile delinquency act fjda,et.the federal bureau of prisons bop calculates sentences for persons,including juveniles like jonah,remanded to its custody.pursuant to a policy,the bop refused to subtract from jonah sentence any of the months he spent in custody.the district court rejected jonah challenge to this policy.we hold that juveniles must receive credit for custody and accordingly reverse.
background 
on june,jonah was arrested after shooting at a law enforcement officer while on the salt river indian reservation.he was charged under,offenses committed within indian country,with assault with a dangerous weapon in violation of a,and with discharge of a firearm during a crime of violence in violation of c.in october,the district court transferred jonah,who was at the time of the incident,to adult status.we reversed in july,holding that because the district court did not obtain jonah juvenile records as required under fjda,it lacked jurisdiction to transfer him for prosecution as an adult.united states juvenile male,cir.after spending nearly months in custody,mostly while designated as an adult,jonah was finally sentenced pursuant to the fjda on june.he received months of custody plus another months of supervised release.
this appeal concerns the bop refusal to subtract any of the months of jonah confinement from his sentence.b provides that a defendant shall be given credit toward the service of a term of imprisonment for any time he has spent in official detention prior to the date the sentence commences the fjda does not expressly incorporate.however,before the bop consistently applied to juveniles when calculating their sentences under the fjda.see bureau of prisons,sentence computation manual old law pre,program statement,at july,available at http declaring that p resentence time shall be applied to a juvenile sentence the same as for an adult.
the bop reversed course in.a year earlier,a virgin islands district court,noting that the whole purpose of treating minors as juveniles is to take them out of the criminal process,concluded that a juvenile is not a defendant who serves a sentence for a federal crime within the meaning of.united states,d.the court held that the bop lacked the statutory authority to apply to juveniles.id.at.the bop revised its policy to accord with.it now refuses to credit juveniles with time served.see bureau of prisons,operations memorandum,at.
jonah filed a habeas petition pursuant to to challenge the bop current policy.rejecting a magistrate report and recommendation,the district court decided to follow.it reasoned that b applies only to a defendant who has committed an offense and has received a sentence of imprisonment.according to the district court,juveniles commit acts of juvenile delinquency,not offenses,and they receive a term of official detention,not imprisonment.hence b by its plain terms does not intersect with the fjda,and the bop can not grant juveniles credit for pretrial custody this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
we review de novo the denial of a habeas petition filed pursuant to.taylor sawyer,cir.whether a juvenile whose status is adjudicated under the fjda must receive credit against his or her sentence for time spent in custody is a question of first impression.we begin with a close look at the relevant statutes.
statutory background 
the first statute governs the calculation of sentences for adult offenders.congress first enacted what eventually became in.this statute,which was codified in part at,provided that a convicted defendant sentence shall commence to run from the date on which such person is received at the penitentiary,reformatory,or jail for service of said sentence act of june,stat.although the statute did not explicitly instruct the bop to credit convicted defendants with time spent in custody,federal courts,as a general practice,provide d defendants credit against their sentence for time spent in jail for lack of bail.stapf united states.
there was a exception to this general practice.for crimes that carried mandatory minimum sentences,courts believed that they lacked the statutory power to afford defendants credit.stapf,at.in,congress,both signaling its approval of the general practice and indicating an intention to make more universally applicable,amended the statute to eliminate this exception.section as amended provided that 
the attorney general shall give any person convicted of an offense in a court of the united states credit toward service of his sentence for any days spent in custody prior to the imposition of sentence by the sentencing court for want of bail set for the offense under which sentence was imposed where the statute requires the imposition of a minimum mandatory sentence.
act of,stat.
as the circuit noted,congress did not expressly make the amended applicable outside the mandatory minimum context because it assumed that a credit for presentence custody for want of bail would continue to be provided by sentencing courts as a matter of course.stapf,at.however,some courts misunderstood the amendment and held that credit was required under only for those defendants whose convictions carried mandatory minimum sentences.see sobell united states,cir bryans blackwell,cir.in part to correct this misunderstanding,congress again amended in to provide that any person convicted of an offense shall receive credit toward service of his sentence for any days spent in custody in connection with the offense or acts for which sentence was imposed,regardless of whether the sentence involved a statutory minimum.bail reform act of,stat.we observed shortly thereafter that,a s amended,section require s that the attorney general give credit in all cases of presentence custody.williams united states,cir emphasis added.
the final relevant change came eighteen years later when congress passed the sentencing reform act of.the statute repealed,see,stat,and replaced it with.see id.ch,stat codified at see also united states wilson,d discussing replacement of with.section provides,in relevant part 
a defendant shall be given credit toward the service of a term of imprisonment for any time he has spent in official detention prior to the date the sentence commences 
as a result of the offense for which the sentence was imposed or 
as a result of any other charge for which the defendant was arrested after the commission of the offense for which the sentence was imposed 
b.section substitutes official detention for custody,and it enlarges the class of persons who receive credit,but is otherwise quite similar to.see,wilson,at.holding that the attorney general must continue to compute the credit under b as he did under the former.
the second statute governs the treatment of juveniles.the federal juvenile delinquency act fjda was first passed in to remedy the unsatisfactory existing law that required juveniles to be treated and prosecuted in the same manner as adults,at.the statute furthers rehabilitative goals by removing juveniles from the ordinary criminal justice system and by providing a separate system of treatment for them.united states,cir.as originally enacted,the fjda provided,in pertinent part 
in the event that the court finds a juvenile guilty of juvenile delinquency it may commit the delinquent to the custody of the attorney general for a period not exceeding his minority,but in no event exceeding the term for which the juvenile could have been sentenced if he had been tried and convicted of the offense which he had committed.
act of june,stat.
congress revised the fjda in in the juvenile justice and delinquency prevention act jjdpa,stat.the jjdpa amended the provision governing juvenile sentencing to state 
c ommitment shall not extend beyond the juvenile birthday or the maximum term which could have been imposed on an adult convicted of the same offense,whichever is sooner,unless the juvenile has attained his nineteenth birthday at the time of disposition,in which case commitment shall not exceed the lesser of two years or the maximum term which could have been imposed on an adult convicted of the same offense.
id,stat.codified as amended at b.this provision was substantially revised in,when congress redrafted it to read as follows 
the term for which official detention may be ordered for a juvenile found to be a juvenile delinquent may not extend 
in the case of a juvenile who is less than eighteen years old,beyond the lesser of 
a the date when the juvenile becomes years old or 
b the maximum term of imprisonment that would be authorized by section b if the juvenile had been tried and convicted as an adult or 
in the case of a juvenile who is between eighteen and years old 
a who if convicted as an adult would be convicted of a class a,b,or c felony,beyond five years or 
b in any other case beyond the lesser of 
i three years or 
ii the maximum term of imprisonment that would be authorized by section b if the juvenile had been tried and convicted as an adult.
sentencing reform act of,stat,codified at c.
finally,the youth corrections act yca was passed in to make available for the discretionary use of the federal judges a system for the sentencing and treatment of persons under the age of years who have been convicted of crime that will promote the rehabilitation of those who show promise of becoming useful citizens,reprinted in.the yca shared the fjda emphasis on rehabilitation.compare dorszynski united states,d observing that the yca focused primarily on correction and rehabilitation,with united states juvenile,cir discussing the fjda rehabilitative purpose.if a court determined that a person under age should be classified as a youth offender,the yca authorized the court,in lieu of the penalty of imprisonment otherwise provided by law,to sentence the youth offender to the custody of the attorney general for treatment and supervision act of,reprinted in,the sentencing reform act of,which also revised the fjda,repealed the yca.see,a,stat.
interpretation 
with this backdrop in mind,we must decide whether congress intended to apply to juveniles.as always,we begin with the statute plain meaning.botosan paul mcnally realty,cir.if the statute terms are ambiguous,we may use canons of construction,legislative history,and the statute overall purpose to illuminate congress intent.see milne stephen slesinger,cir.
ordinarily we would give substantial deference to the bop interpretation of and the fjda.see hood,cir.we do not do so here for several reasons.first,the government did not argue for any such deference in its brief.second,the bop current interpretation of the statutes at issue contradicts its previous interpretation.see norfolk so.ry.shanklin,d affording no deference to an agency interpretation when it contradicts the agency own previous construction.finally,by its own admission,the bop changed its interpretation because of a judicial decision,not because its particular expertise led it to do so.
plain meaning 
the court held that the plain meaning of renders it inapplicable to juveniles 
categorically is not a defendant.is an adjudicated juvenile delinquent.while he is in official detention,he is not serving a sentence for a federal crime 
section applies to defendant serving a sentence imposed for the commission of an offense.offense is not an act of juvenile delinquency was committed to official detention under section as a juvenile whom the court found to have committed acts of juvenile delinquency.since he is not in official detention under a sentence after being found guilty of a criminal offense,section does not apply and he is not entitled to presentence credit.
d at.the district court in jonah case agreed with,concluding that a juvenile is not a defendant sentenced for an offense,and thus can not fit within the terms of.
p lain meaning,like beauty,is sometimes in the eye of the beholder.florida power light lorion,d.we disagree with the district courts in this case and in about the plain meaning of.because a successful prosecution under the fjda results in a civil adjudication of status,not a criminal conviction,united states doe,cir,a somewhat different vocabulary is sometimes used in the juvenile justice system.however,most of the terms that are so purportedly foreign to the fjda defendant,offense,and sentence are frequently used in connection with juveniles.the fjda distinguishes between juvenile delinquency and crime when it defines the terms,see,but it also conflates the two.for example,the fjda provides for federal jurisdiction over a juvenile alleged to have committed an act of juvenile delinquency if the attorney general certifies that the offense charged is a crime of violence emphasis added.another statute in title expressly defines offender as including a person adjudged to have committed an act of juvenile delinquency.e.
we also routinely refer to juveniles as defendants and to a juvenile term of detention as a sentence.see,united states leon,cir juvenile,at.in this very case the district court referred to jonah other acts of juvenile delinquency as offense s.juvenile male,at quoting the district court decision regarding transfer to adult status.even the bop refers to juveniles with vocabulary that,according to the court,should be reserved for adult offenders.see bureau of prisons,juvenile delinquents,program statement,at,stating that juveniles are sentenced under the fjda id.at defining juvenile in part as someone under who is convicted of a federal violation.
the district court understanding of the plain meaning of rests in large measure on our decision in united states doe,cir.in doe,we addressed whether a,which authorizes a term of supervised release to follow a term of imprisonment for a felony or a misdemeanor,applies to juveniles.because juveniles receive civil adjudications of status,not convictions for felonies or misdemeanors,we held that a does not authorize supervised release for juveniles.id.at.doe has limited instructive force.the distinction we had previously drawn between misdemeanor and felony,on one hand,and act of juvenile delinquency,on the other,rendered doe terms more unsuitable for use in the juvenile context than those at issue here.see united states,cir.moreover,congress subsequent adoption of legislation authorizing supervised release for juveniles,see century dep t of justice appropriations authorization act,stat,cautions against a reading of title as applied to juveniles.
finally,we note that,the predecessor of,contained a single express exception its custody credit did not apply to offense s triable by,military commission,provost court,or other military tribunal.see bail reform act of,stat,united states allen.when congress replaced with,it eliminated this express exception.the canon expressio unius est exclusio alterius supports the conclusion that congress intended to apply to all other categories of persons in federal custody,including juveniles,and that congress knows how to craft an exception when it intends one.section s elimination of only express exception suggests that the statute should have wider,not narrower,applicability.
we therefore conclude that the terms of do not unambiguously preclude its application to juveniles.we turn to other canons of construction to determine whether congress intends juveniles to benefit from its terms.

it is a rudimentary principle of construction that statutes dealing with similar subjects should be interpreted harmoniously.jett dallas indep.sch,d scalia,concurring.in,congress enacted a statute to regulate the transfer of prisoners in and out of the united states.act of,stat.codified at et.part of the transfer statute concerns the calculation of sentences for prisoners transferred to the united states.see.
