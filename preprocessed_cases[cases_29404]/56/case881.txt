welfare and institutions code section states in part that i n any case in which the minor is removed from the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian as a result of an order of wardship made pursuant to section,the order shall specify that the minor may not be held in physical confinement for a period in excess of the maximum term of imprisonment which could be imposed upon an adult convicted of the offense or offenses which brought or continued the minor under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.the statute then goes on to define maximum term of imprisonment.pertinent to this case is the sentence of section which reads if the court elects to aggregate the period of confinement on multiple counts,or multiple petitions,including previously sustained petitions adjudging the minor a ward within section,the maximum period of imprisonment shall be the aggregate term of imprisonment specified in subdivision a of section of the penal code.the issue presented to us in this case is when the court elects to aggregate the period of physical confinement on multiple petitions,including previously sustained petitions adjudging the minor a ward within section,must the court necessarily aggregate the period of physical confinement on all previously sustained petitions as we shall explain,in our view the answer is no.we hold that when the minor has as in this case exhausted his available confinement time on one or more previously sustained petitions,the court need not include those petitions when the court elects to aggregate the period of confinement on multiple petitions under section.
appellant was adjudged a ward of the court pursuant to section on six separate occasions.a petition filed on september,resulted in appellant admitting a violation of penal code section trespassing.a december,petition resulted in appellant admitting a violation of penal code section misdemeanor molestation and admitting to violating the terms of his probation.a july,petition resulted in appellant admitting another violation of penal code section.a september,petition resulted in appellant admitting a violation of penal code section misdemeanor attempted extortion and again admitting to violating the terms of his probation.an october,petition later amended on november,resulted in appellant admitting another violation of penal code section and again admitting to violating the terms of his probation.the sixth petition,filed on july,resulted in appellant admitting another violation of penal code section and again admitting to violating the terms of his probation.
at an august,dispositional hearing on the sixth petition,the court ordered appellant continued on terms of probation not to exceed his birthday.the court removed appellant from the custody of his mother,ordered placement and care of appellant to be vested with the probation department,ordered appellant to be delivered to juvenile hall pending placement,and made other appropriate orders.the court also set the maximum confinement time at one year,six months,less days credit for time served.
the court properly aggregated the period of physical confinement on previously sustained petitions 
the court method of computing the maximum confinement time after appellant sixth the july,petition was sustained is the topic of dispute on this appeal.the court elected to aggregate the period of physical confinement on multiple petitions,including previously sustained petitions.after appellant second the december,petition was sustained,the court had aggregated appellant available confinement time and had determined that to be one year and two months.appellant was then in and out of six different group homes,and exhausted his available confinement time by december,before the third the july,petition was filed.thus,after the sixth july,petition was filed and was ultimately sustained,the court concluded that there was no more available confinement time from appellant first two petitions.it aggregated the available confinement time from the last four petitions.following the dictates of penal code section,subdivision a and section,the court calculated the available confinement time as one year and six months by using the principal term of one year on the penal code section offense from the fourth sustained petition,and two months each from the third,fifth and sixth sustained petitions,the three,offenses 
appellant contends,however,that the court should have utilized all six sustained petitions in calculating his available confinement time after the sustaining of his current sixth petition.his argument is that all six sustained petitions involve offenses which brought or continued the minor under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court within the meaning of the second paragraph of section.therefore,he argues,section requires the court to utilize all of the offenses in the six sustained petitions in making the penal code section,subdivision a calculation of the aggregate term of imprisonment to be used as the maximum term of imprisonment in section,the maximum available period of physical confinement for the minor as a result of the sixth sustained petition.in our view,however,the flaw in appellant argument is that his conclusion does not logically follow his premise.he is correct that all six of his sustained petitions involve offenses which brought or continued him under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.but even an adult convicted of those very same six offenses would not be required to serve additional time on his first two offenses if that adult served his entire sentence on the first two offenses before being convicted of the subsequent four offenses.to require a minor to do so would appear to us to be ignoring the objective of section rather than adhering to its requirements 
in interpreting a statute,a court should seek to effectuate the intent of the law,acting in a reasonable fashion to give the statute a sensible construction in accordance with the purpose of the lawmakers,to promote rather than defeat the policy underlying the legislation.people superior court price d.consequently,we must look to the overall purpose of the statute,which,in this case,is to ensure that a minor is not held in physical confinement for a period in excess of the maximum term of imprisonment which could be imposed upon an adult for the same offenses,italics added in re james d.in re prentiss th,d.
in people olivas cal d,the court held that youthful misdemeanants may not be subjected to the control of the youth authority for any period of time in excess of the maximum jail term that might be imposed upon adult misdemeanants committing the same offense.to do so,the court concluded,would constitute a denial of equal protection in violation of article i,section,of the california constitution and the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution.people olivas,supra,cal d,fn.omitted.in response to olivas,the legislature in amended section to state in relevant part in any case in which the minor is removed from the physical custody of his parent or guardian as the result of an order or wardship made pursuant to section,the order shall specify that the minor may not be held in physical confinement for a period in excess of the maximum term of imprisonment which could be imposed upon an adult convicted of the offense which brought the minor under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.stats,ch.in in re aaron d,the court construed this language to mean that where,as here,the minor violates several provisions of criminal law by his repeated misconduct for which he is declared a section ward of the court,each and every criminal violation may constitute the offense which brings him under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court and may serve as a measurement of his physical confinement under the broad language of sections and without violating the basic precept of equal treatment of adult and juvenile offenders.in re aaron,supra,d at.in the legislature then essentially codified aaron and attempted to clarify section by changing the words the offense which brought the minor under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court to the offense or offens
