technology advancements have resulted in many high school students carrying smartphones,which have applications to record and upload videos to social media for immediate viewing by their peers.in this case,used his smartphone to surreptitiously record a fellow high school student,matthew,in a school bathroom stall while matthew was either masturbating or jokingly pretending to do so.the video,taken inside the bathroom,but about feet away from the bathroom stall,did not show matthew face,but did reveal his distinctive socks and shoes,which were visible in the gap between the stall wall and the floor.uploaded the video to his snapchat application with the caption,i think this dude is jacking off or some similar title.
intended the video to be funny and to get a laugh.but tragically,about two weeks later,matthew took his own life,stating in a suicide note,i ca handle school anymore and i have no friends.
the san diego county district attorney office filed a juvenile delinquency petition under welfare and institutions code section alleging engaged in an unauthorized invasion of privacy by means of a cell phone camera in violation of penal code section,subdivision j hereafter section j,a misdemeanor 
following a contested adjudication hearing,the court found true the allegation that violated section j.the court sentenced to probation on numerous conditions,including several restricting his use of social media.addressing,the court stated,we are going to come back in days.i going to see how you are doing.if i have any more problems with you,you are going into custody.
on appeal,first contends no substantial evidence supports the juvenile court finding that he had the requisite specific intent to invade matthew privacy as required by section j.specifically,contends matthew had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the bathroom stall because matthew distinctive shoes were visible under the stall wall and matthew was audibly moaning,which anyone in the bathroom could have heard.second,for the first time on appeal,also contends section j incorporates by reference the elements of the tort of invasion of privacy,and assuming that to be true,he asserts there is a newsworthy defense that immunizes him from criminal liability in this case.third,and also for the first time on appeal,contends that,as applied here,section j violates his first amendment rights.
we affirm.a student in a high school bathroom stall reasonably expects he will not be videoed and have that video disseminated on social media.matthew did not forfeit that right merely because his socks and shoes could be seen and his voice could be heard by others in the bathroom.matthew may have run the risk that people in the bathroom would tell others what they witnessed there.but that is a far cry from expecting his conduct would be electronically recorded and broadcasted to the student body.thus,main appellate argument fails because the right to privacy is not one of total secrecy,but rather the right to control the nature and extent of firsthand dissemination.shulman group w productions,cal th,shulman.the mere fact that a person can be seen by someone does not automatically mean that he or she can legally be forced to be subject to being seen by everyone.hernandez hillsides,cal th,hernandez.
contention that section j incorporates the tort elements of invasion of privacy is forfeited because his attorney took the exact opposite position in the juvenile court,asserting,this is not a tort case.this is a crime.in any event,even if not forfeited,the argument is unavailing because neither the text nor the legislative history of section j supports argument.we also conclude forfeited his claim that section j violates his first amendment rights because did not raise this constitutional issue in the juvenile court.people ervine cal th,constitutional claim forfeited because appellant did not properly raise it below people clayburg th,first amendment claim forfeited by failure to raise it below.
factual background 
in and matthew attended university city high school.at the time,was in grade,and matthew was in ninth grade.
on a friday afternoon,matthew and erik,friends since sixth grade,entered the boys restroom.the entrance doors to the bathroom were always kept open to deter vandalism however,people outside could not see the bathroom interior.inside,the bathroom has a row of five sinks along one wall,and eight urinals and two stalls on the opposite side.only one of the two stalls,the one farthest from the entrance,has a door.nevertheless,because of the way the room is configured,someone standing near the urinals or sink could only see the side of the doorless stall.
upon entering the bathroom,erik entered the far stall,the one with the door,and closed it.matthew went into the other stall,the doorless one,and remained standing,with his feet facing the toilet.matthew began making moaning sounds.erik did not think matthew was actually masturbating,but thought it was a joke because,as erik testified,matthew was like that.like,he would just mess around.
entered the restroom while erik and matthew were still inside their respective stalls.heard some noises coming from one of the toilet stalls,noises that sounded like somebody was masturbating.while standing near the bathroom sinks,about to feet away from the stalls,used his smartphone to record a video of matthew in the stall,making easily audible groaning sounds.did not make any noise or say anything to indicate he was there,and made no attempt to get anyone permission to take the video.
the video showed matthew distinctive socks and shoes,visible in the gap between the stall wall and the floor.did not see matthew face and he did not know who was in the stall he was recording.
when erik exited his stall,he did not see anyone in the bathroom except matthew,who was standing near a sink.erik and matthew did not discuss the matter and returned to their respective classes.
after leaving the bathroom,uploaded the video to his snapchat stories application with the caption,i think this dude is jacking off or some similar title.snapchat is a smartphone application that allows users to send pictures and videos not to exceed seconds in length to friends or followers.unlike other social media applications,videos uploaded to snapchat stories disappear after hours.thought the video was funny and he uploaded it to get a laugh.
while at the high school football game that friday evening,approached erik and another student,ezekiel asked erik if he was the kid in the rest room erik said he did not know what was talking about.logged into his snapchat application on his smartphone,and showed erik and ezekiel the bathroom video.ezekiel testified the video showed a person feet in one of the stalls and a noise,like if someone was masturbating.ezekiel recognized matthew as the person in the stall because matt always wore his black shoes with adidas socks,ankle socks.erik also recognized his own shoes in the video in the adjacent stall,and erik told that matthew was the person in the other stall.
three days later on monday,ezekiel told matthew,there a video of you that shows that you might be masturbating in the rest room.matthew replied that he was just joking around and trying to make people laugh.
it is not known how many people saw the video.told the police he had a lot of snapchat followers,but i t not like a million.because posted the video on snapchat stories,the video disappeared after hours.in dispositional hearing,matthew mother said that when matthew returned to school that monday,everyone was talking about him in the video.
approximately two weeks later,matthew committed suicide.in a handwritten note,mathew expressed his love for his family and stated,i have killed myself.i ca handle school anymore and i have no friends.i do like my life.matthew note also states,i been planning this for months now.
on the day of matthew funeral,confronted ezekiel and threatened to kick his ass if ezekiel did not stop telling people took the video.ezekiel reported the threat to school officials.
subsequently,the vice principal,together with basketball coach,and a san diego unified school district police officer,met with and ezekiel to address the issue of threat.after that issue was apparently resolved and ezekiel left the room,confessed he recorded and uploaded the video.said he made and uploaded the video because he thought it was funny that someone in the stall seemed to be masturbating.told police he felt terrible for what had happened,never intended the video to cause harm,and did not know who was in the stall when he took the video.
gave police his smartphone and consented to a search of its contents.however,police were unable to recover the video.later,with erik assistance erik saw the video on smartphone at the football game the district attorney office prepared a of the video,which the court received into evidence without objection.

matthew expectation of privacy 
reasonable expectation of privacy in a public restroom stall 
a violation of section j occurs only if the actor has the specific intent to invade the privacy of someone in a statutorily enumerated place,including a bathroom.contends no substantial evidence supports the court finding he violated section j because only recorded what matthew exposed to public view his feet through the gap between the stall wall and the floor,and the sounds matthew was making.citing tily,city of newport beach th tily,contends there is no right to privacy in what may be observed from common areas in public restrooms 
to begin with,article i,section of the california constitution explicitly deems privacy an inalienable right by stating,all people are by nature free and independent and have inalienable rights.among these are enjoying and defending life and liberty,acquiring,possessing,and protecting property,and pursuing and obtaining safety,happiness,and privacy.
the bathroom,including a public bathroom stall,is perhaps the epitome of a private place.contrary to assertions,for over years california case law has ensured that persons in a public toilet may reasonably expect they are not being secretly watched.for example,in britt superior court cal d britt,a police officer stationed himself above the ceiling of a department store men room,where he could peer through vents to see two men having sex in the toilet stalls below.although the stalls were enclosed by partitions and a door,the enclosures stopped approximately inches from the floor.id.at.the supreme court held the covert surveillance violated privacy rights,stating,man constitutionally protected right of personal privacy not only abides with him while he is the householder within his own castle but cloaks him when as a member of the public he is temporarily occupying a room including a toilet stall to the extent that it is offered to the public for private,however transient,individual use.id.at,italics added.
the supreme court subsequent decision in people triggs cal d triggs,disapproved on other grounds in people lilienthal cal d,footnote,is even more on point because it involved surveillance of conduct inside a public restroom stall with no door.the police officers in triggs entered the plumbing access area of a city park men room and used an overhead vent to observe oral copulation within a doorless stall.id.at.rejecting the argument that a person in a doorless public bathroom stall has no expectation of privacy,the court stated,the expectation of privacy a person has when he enters a restroom is reasonable and is not diminished or destroyed because the toilet stall being used lacks a door.id.at.
seeks to distinguish britt and triggs on the grounds that the observations in both those cases were made directly into a bathroom stall,whereas was viewing matthew conduct outside the stall,in the common bathroom area.however,in triggs,the court stated that the reasonable expectation of privacy in a public bathroom stall exists even if the interior of the stall might have been open to view from areas accessible to the public.triggs,supra,cal d at.
in his reply brief,cites the following cases as standing for the proposition there is no expectation of privacy when using a doorless public restroom stall people crafts d people heath d people roberts d people maldonado d people hensel d people young d and people norton d.however,in triggs,the supreme court cited these intermediate appellate court opinions not with approval,as suggests but rather with disapproval to the extent they incorrectly state that an occupant of a doorless restroom stall has no reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to conduct that could be viewed from a common area in the bathroom.triggs,supra,cal d at.
also relies on tily,supra,th,a case involving an adult entertainment business,where a city ordinance required an attendant to be stationed in the restroom to prevent specified activities.id.at.rejecting an argument that the ordinance violated patrons right of privacy,the court in tily stated,whatever individual sensibilities,there is no constitutional right of privacy in the restrooms of a place of public accommodation id.at.however,that passage,when read in context,refers to a hypothetical right of patrons to be alone in a public restroom to conduct illegal activities,and did not address the very distinct issue here,involving the right to not have one solitary activity within a bathroom stall surreptitiously recorded and then disseminated on social media.
reliance on in re deborah cal d is also unavailing.there,a juvenile took several department store items and a large plastic bag into a closed fitting room.a security officer stationed outside the room saw the defendant stuff merchandise into her bag from the gap above and below the fitting room door.id.at.the court concluded the defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy with regard to these events in plain view.however,deborah is also off point because it does not involve secretly recording a bathroom video with the intent to disseminate the recording on social media.
privacy expectations can be reasonable,even if they are not absolute 
even if matthew might otherwise have had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the bathroom stall,contends matthew waived that expectation by making loud obscene noises and by deliberately attracting public attention by making loud masturbation noises.we disagree.there are degrees and nuances to expectations of privacy.the possibility of being seen or overheard by others in the bathroom does not render unreasonable a student expectation that his conduct in a bathroom stall will not be secretly recorded and uploaded to social media.
the california supreme court has held that a person may have a reasonable expectation of privacy against electronic recording,even if the person expects conduct or conversation to be overheard by others.for example,in sanders american broadcasting companies cal th sanders,the plaintiff was employed as one of many telepsychics who gave readings to customers who telephone the employer number.each telepsychic took his or her calls in a cubicle,of which there were about in the large work area.id.at.the defendant,an investigative reporter with american broadcasting company,obtained employment as a telepsychic and secretly video and audiotaped her conversations with coworkers using a small hidden camera and microphone.id.at.the plaintiff in sanders sued for violation of privacy.much like argues matthew could have no reasonable expe
