in this juvenile dependency case,defendant and appellant juan father challenges the juvenile court jurisdiction and disposition orders.in particular,father argues the juvenile court erred in exercising dependency jurisdiction over his daughter priscilla daughter because she was not at substantial risk of serious physical harm and,even if she had been,father neither did nor failed to do anything to cause that risk of harm.because daughter was not abused,neglected,or exploited and father neither did nor failed to do anything to put daughter at any risk of harm,we conclude dependency jurisdiction was not proper here.

daughter arrived in the united states from el salvador in april,when she was years old.she came to the united states to live with father,who wanted daughter to have better opportunities than those available in her birth country.upon arrival in the united states,immigration services detained daughter for two months.she arrived at father home in los angeles in june.
daughter moved in with father and his family,which included his wife stepmother and four other children,ages one,two,and.this was a difficult transition for daughter.she had a tough time getting along with her new family,especially stepmother.daughter did not like doing chores or following the family rules.daughter often tested and broke the rules and was disrespectful.she did not want to dress modestly.she did not communicate comfortably with father,did not want to eat with the family despite being asked to do so,did not want stepmother to drive her to school despite being offered,and did not tend to her personal hygiene.

almost everyone interviewed by the los angeles county department of children and family services department,including daughter herself,indicated that daughter lied a lot.in fact,the reason the department filed a petition in this case was based on a story that daughter later recanted discussed below.in addition,daughter told her mother that father hit her,but later said he never did.she said her brother raped and sexually assaulted her in el salvador,but later admitted that was not true.she also said she wanted to return to el salvador,but later said she wanted to stay in the united states and live with her maternal uncle in texas.it is difficult to tell whether or when daughter told the truth.
father never abused daughter or any of the other children.father gave daughter an allowance and stated he would talk to daughter for hours and try to explain to her right from wrong.i never hit her but i would take things she liked like her computer,tv.at one point,in light of daughter troubling behavior and at her insistence,father investigated whether and how daughter could return legally to her mother in el salvador.he stated he wanted daughter either to stay with him or to return to her mother in el salvador because they are her parents and are responsible for her care.father believed his problems with daughter began when he told daughter her clothes were not appropriate for her age.she does like to be told what to do.she does like to be told to dress modestly.father acknowledged daughter had behavior problems and that it would take time to build a relationship with her.
stepmother never abused her children or daughter,although she slapped daughter face once when daughter was arguing with her.there were no injuries or marks as a result of that slap.stepmother reiterated many of the things father had reported,including that daughter was disrespectful,did not like the family rules,and did not like being told to dress modestly.stepmother said she had daughter best interests in mind and was concerned for daughter safety.daughter would leave the house early and return late from school.stepmother stated she tried to explain many things to daughter when she first arrived in the united states,but daughter refused to listen.stepmother acknowledged the difficulties of not being daughter biological mother.stepmother expressed surprise at many of the things daughter would say and,eventually,stepmother stopped trying to discipline her.according to stepmother,daughter said she hated stepmother because she had married father.stepmother also indicated she believed at times daughter acted out on purpose because she wanted to be sent back to el salvador.stepmother explained she and father had investigated whether and how daughter could return legally to el salvador.
october referral 
on monday,october,the department received a referral alleging daughter was at risk of abuse from stepmother and father.the referring party reported then daughter was late to school that morning because she had to walk to school and almost passed out from hunger when she arrived.according to the referral,daughter said she had not eaten since saturday,stepmother would cook for everyone in the home except for daughter,and stepmother would drive the other children to school but made daughter walk to school.daughter also said stepmother hit her on the mouth with a wooden spoon and busted her lip.but daughter indicated the incident had happened a week earlier so her lip injury had healed.daughter said father was aware of everything but refused to protect her.the referring party reported daughter appeared depressed and cried all the time because of the way stepmother treated her.
as a result of the october referral,a department social worker interviewed daughter,father,stepmother,and other family members.daughter admitted she had lied about not being fed and being forced to walk to school.she also admitted she lied about stepmother hitting her in the mouth with a wooden spoon.instead,both daughter and stepmother explained they had been arguing when stepmother slapped daughter in the face with her hand and there had been no injury.that was the only time stepmother hit daughter.there was no evidence of any type of abuse by anyone.the department referred daughter to therapy services and the family to counseling.the department did not immediately file a petition on daughter behalf.
first involuntary hospitalization december,to january,
almost two months after the october referral,on december,daughter was involuntarily hospitalized as a result of threats she made to her own safety.daughter told a department social worker she was home alone when she could take it anymore so she took a knife and left.she went to a neighbor house and asked for help.daughter told the neighbor she wanted to kill herself,although at some point she threw the knife away and never did hurt herself.the neighbor took daughter to a police station.at the same time,father was at the police station filing a missing persons report because he could not locate daughter.daughter was taken to a hospital because she had threatened to hurt herself.
at the hospital,daughter reported feeling depressed and suicidal.she said she had thoughts of suicide for the past months and thoughts of stabbing herself with a knife.daughter stated she felt stepmother overly disciplined her and there was tension between them.daughter also reported having nightmares and episodic flashbacks about sexual trauma as well as feeling antagonistic toward her stepsister.she also reported she was raped and sexually abused by both her brother and her stepfather in el salvador when she was nine and years old.
daughter was diagnosed with major depressive disorder,attention disorder,posttraumatic stress disorder,insomnia,and problems related to relationships,education,and social environment.on january,she was discharged from the hospital and released to father,who consented to starting daughter on medication.
second involuntary hospitalization january to january,
on january,the day after daughter was discharged from the hospital,father called the police because daughter was missing again.daughter told a department social worker that she left home that afternoon because stepmother had been mean to her,called her names,and laughed at her.father reported that daughter had climbed out her window.daughter went back to the same neighbor house,where she remained outside for some time.it is unclear whether father or the police picked up daughter from the neighbor home,but eventually,in the early morning hours of january,she was readmitted to the hospital because she threatened to hurt herself.
at the hospital,daughter stated she felt depressed and indicated she could not take it anymore and would rather end her life than have stepmother argue with her and yell at her.she reported that when she returned home from the hospital the day before,stepmother was angry,yelled at her,and accused her of lying.daughter said stepmother would never like her,made her feel unwelcome,and they would never get along.she said living with father made her want to take a knife and cut her wrists.she again reported being raped and sexually assaulted by both her brother and her stepfather in el salvador.both father and stepmother stated they wanted to help daughter and have her return home.father did not believe daughter would hurt herself,but believed she made those threats in order to get out of the house.father did not agree to voluntary removal of daughter,but wanted to work with her and start therapy services.
because daughter threatened to harm herself if returned to father and stepmother,the hospital would not release her to father.the department obtained a removal order from the juvenile court and the hospital discharged daughter to department custody.daughter received the same diagnosis as she had upon her last hospital discharge,with the addition of housing,economic,and other psychosocial and environmental problems.she was prescribed medication and placed with a foster parent.
january,petition and detention hearing 
on january,the department filed a welfare and institutions code section petition on behalf of daughter the petition alleged father was unable to provide appropriate care and supervision for daughter because daughter refused to return to his home and care.in its detention report,the department concluded the risk to daughter of future abuse under father care was high.as support for its conclusion,the department pointed to father conduct,which includes,but is not limited to,general neglect as evidenced by the fact that daughter reported does not make her feel welcomed at her home and father does not protect her.the department also referred to daughter threats to harm herself if forced to return home as well as her dislike of stepmother.the department explained father was willing to have services at home,but the department was unable to begin services because,one day after being discharged from the hospital,daughter was rehospitalized and then placed in foster care.the department reported daughter was happy and stable in her foster home.
at the detention hearing held the same day,counsel for father argued the juvenile court should return daughter to father care.counsel indicated father wanted to work together with daughter and was willing to have services in place at home.the juvenile court refused to release daughter and instead ordered her detained from father,with monitored visits and conjoint counseling when appropriate.the court also ordered no contact between daughter and stepmother.
april,jurisdiction hearing 
the jurisdiction hearing was scheduled for march.however,because the department had not properly served the mother in el salvador,the juvenile court continued the hearing to april.nonetheless,at the brief march hearing,daughter attorney reported that daughter was taking her prescribed medication and was feeling better.counsel also reported both daughter and father were willing to participate in conjoint therapy.the juvenile court ordered conjoint therapy to begin as soon as possible.
at the april,hearing counsel for father argued the juvenile court should dismiss the petition because there was no evidence father was unable or unwilling to care for daughter.to the contrary,counsel argued,the evidence demonstrated father was perfectly capable and willing to provide care for daughter and indeed wanted her in his home and was doing everything he could to care for her.counsel noted it was daughter who refused to return to father home and care.
at the hearing,counsel for daughter stated daughter wanted to develop,build,and mend her relationship with father.counsel acknowledged that would take time.however,counsel stated daughter possibly wanted to live with her maternal uncle in texas.according to counsel,daughter wanted to stay in the united states.counsel also reported daughter was happy in her foster home and was having no behavioral problems there.
in a report to the court,the department stated that in a march,interview,daughter continued to indicate she did not want to live with father and would use a knife to kill her self if forced to return.daughter believed stepmother did not want her there,called her names,and made her feel bad.daughter said she was happy in her foster placement,with no suicidal thoughts while there.her foster mother reported the prescribed medication helped daughter mood.
in a later interview,daughter told a department social worker that despite her earlier accusations,her brother had not sexually assaulted her in el salvador.however,daughter maintained that,although not rape,her stepfather had sexually assaulted her in el salvador when she was nine years old,but she never told her mother.she also stated she did not want to live with either father or her mother,but would consider living with her maternal uncle in texas.
the juvenile court sustained the petition as amended and found daughter to be a person described by section,subdivision b.the amended petition stated father is unable to provide appropriate care and supervision for the child due to the child refusal to return to the father home and care.the child has repeatedly threatened to harm herself if returned to the home of the father and the child physical is at risk in the home of father and on and,the child was involuntarily hospitalized for threatening to harm herself.such inability to provide appropriate parental care and supervision of the child by the father endanger s the child physical health and safety and place s the child at risk of physical harm,damage,and danger.the juvenile court made no findings with respect to father fault or lack of fault.
at the hearing,the juvenile court also considered father concern with respect to daughter medication.father was not opposed to the medication,but inquired about obtaining a second opinion.the juvenile court explained that a second opinion is part of the court procedure for approving medication for minors,and the court had already received a second opinion with respect to daughter medication.father also objected to daughter potential placement with her maternal uncle in texas.father believed it would not be in daughter best interest to live with her maternal uncle because he would let her do as she pleased and not supervise her.the court deferred any decision on placement with the uncle until the next hearing.
