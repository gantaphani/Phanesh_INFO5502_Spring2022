appellant kasaundra contends that in a situation where two or more welfare and institutions code section juvenile petitions charging a minor with criminal misconduct are filed under the same superior court case number,an order terminating jurisdiction issued by the judicial officer presiding over proceedings on two petitions requires proceedings on the other petition to cease.for the reasons discussed,we agree.
factual and procedural 
the three petitions 
appellant,born july,was brought before the juvenile court on three separate petitions,one filed may,petition one filed june,petition and one filed september,petition.
petition alleged that appellant had committed two counts of second degree robbery in violation of penal code section and personally used a knife,subd.b.according to the probation officer report,the crime involved an attempt to take bags of halloween candy from two by physical force and display of a knife tucked in appellant waistband.the petition was amended in june to allege misdemeanor grand theft,subd.c,through personal use of a knife.appellant admitted the allegations of the petition,as amended.
petition alleged that appellant committed battery,subd.a and vandalism,subd.a against her aunt and her aunt home.on july,both counts in the petition were sustained.
on august,the juvenile court aggregated the sentences on petitions and,and ordered appellant to participate in the camp community placement program for one year and four months.on january,appellant was furloughed from camp.on july,the court ordered the camp furlough release terminated on the ground there was no available relative with whom appellant could reside or who could supervise her.appellant was ordered suitably placed,and the probation officer was to evaluate the parents home for placement.on july,appellant was placed in her parents home.on october,appellant mother informed the court that appellant refused to come home and was living with her grandmother.the court in department issued a warrant for her arrest the october warrant.
a month earlier,on september,petition had been filed,charging appellant with attempted robbery,and assault with a deadly weapon again a knife by means likely to produce great bodily injury,subd.a.a warrant was issued for her arrest on that date by department the september warrant.
order terminating jurisdiction 
apparently,little was done to enforce either warrant in the ensuing years.appellant case came up for regular review in department,and by orders dated january,and january,the court ordered the october warrant to remain in full force and effect.the orders were in harmony with contemporaneous probation officer reports that pointed to the existence of petition and the september warrant to support the recommendation that the court retain jurisdiction for purposes of further proceedings on the october warrant and petitions and.
on january,however,the probation officer noted that appellant had remained in the community unsupervised for two years without being rearrested,and that her date of birth meant that she was years old and outside the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.based on those facts,the report recommended that the october warrant be recalled and juvenile court jurisdiction terminated.having reviewed and signed the report,by order dated january,the court in department recalled the october warrant,and checked the boxes on the form order entitled jurisdiction terminated and no outstanding warrants found in review of case file.the superior court case file was thereupon stamped jurisdiction terminated.
similar review procedures took place in department with respect to the september warrant.on september,and september,the court ordered that warrant to remain in full force and effect.then,on september,the probation officer recommended recalling the september warrant and terminating jurisdiction for the same reasons set forth in the january,report appellant age and the fact she had been in the community for two years without being rearrested.the probation officer recommendation was rejected in department.by order dated september,the court ordered the september warrant to remain in full force and effect.
nunc pro tunc order and motion to dismiss 
appellant was located and arrested in april,and brought to court to face charges on petition.in an order dated april,the court in department issued an order recalling the september warrant,and stating the minute order dated in is ordered amended nunc pro tunc by deleting x jurisdiction terminated.
petition was set for adjudication on may.at that hearing,the court granted a continuance so that the defense could prepare a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.at the hearing that followed,the court explained the way the system is set up,we have one court file for all of the minor cases,every new petition that is filed comes under one court number and that the court in department should have more closely considered what it was doing.the court expressed the belief that department terminated its own jurisdiction only since this case was not before them,even though they knew about it.the court further expressed the view that the court in department acted in excess of jurisdiction and that its termination of jurisdiction meant nothing in terms of an unanswered,unresponded to petition.the court gave defense counsel an opportunity to file a written brief.after briefing,the motion was formally denied,the court once again expressing the belief that the order made in the other court has no e ffect on this case whatsoever.
petition adjudication 
at the adjudication,the following evidence was presented prosecution witness phil williams testified that on april,he received a late night call from appellant to bring her food.williams had met appellant approximately two months previously and spoke with her frequently.he was then age and appellant was,although she had told williams she was.when he arrived at appellant house with food,another girl was there.appellant asked for money.williams refused,and she threw his wallet into the bedroom.when williams went to retrieve it,appellant and the other girl followed him.the two girls closed the door and placed heavy dressers in front of it.they threw bottles and other items at williams.appellant asked williams to strip.she picked up a knife and poked him with it on his neck,back,and arms.he was not injured.williams pushed the dressers away and got out of the room.appellant followed,and inflicted minor damage on williams car.
appellant,testifying on her own behalf,stated that she had known williams for about two or three months prior to the incident.he called her every day.he often gave her money or presents.he would occasionally try to hug or kiss her.appellant testified that on the night in question it was williams who pushed a dresser in front of the door when they were alone in her bedroom,and tried to engage her in sexual activity.specifically,williams indicated an interest in being penetrated by a candle appellant had carved into a phallic object.appellant attempted to comply,but was unsuccessful.williams grabbed at her,and she threw an object at him and ran away.
the court placed more credence on williams version of events.based on that testimony,the court concluded that there had been an assault with a deadly weapon,but dismissed the attempted robbery charge.appellant was committed to the california youth authority for four years.
discussion 
appellant contends that the january,order lawfully terminated juvenile court jurisdiction over her and precluded the adjudication of petition.appellant further contends that the court erred in issuing the nunc pro tunc order of april,which purported to correct the january,order by eliminating the words jurisdiction terminated.
we now turn to the question of whether the court in department could properly ignore the order terminating jurisdiction in department as having no e ffect on petition whatsoever.
