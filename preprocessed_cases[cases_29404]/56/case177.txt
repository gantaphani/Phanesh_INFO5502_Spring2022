in people wende cal d,we held that when appointed counsel in an appeal from a criminal conviction files a brief raising no issues,the appellate court must review the entire record to determine whether there are any arguable issues.in in re sade cal th,d,we held that such a review of the entire record is not required in an appeal like that in the present case from a juvenile court order affecting parental rights when appointed counsel for the parent files a brief raising no issues.we similarly held in conservatorship of ben cal th,d,that when appointed counsel in an appeal from the imposition of a conservatorship files a brief raising no issues,a review of the entire record is not required,but we added in a footnote the conservatee is to be provided a copy of the brief and informed of the right to file a supplemental brief.id.at,fn,d.
in the present case,appointed counsel for a parent whose parental rights were terminated by the juvenile court filed a brief raising no issues,but asked the court to permit the parent to personally file a supplemental brief.the court of appeal denied the request and dismissed the appeal.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the court of appeal did not abuse its discretion in denying the parent request to personally file an additional brief and properly dismissed the appeal.
on january,the juvenile division of the san diego superior court terminated parental rights to her sons,phoenix and dakota,and chose adoption as the permanent plan pursuant to welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b.filed a timely notice of appeal.her appointed counsel filed a opening brief that described in detail the procedural history and facts of the case but raised no specific arguable issues on appeal.rather,counsel asked the court of appeal to exercise its discretion to independently review the entire record on appeal to determine whether reversible errors were made.in addition,counsel requested that the court of appeal provide the opportunity to file her own supplemental brief within days.
the court of appeal decline d to review the record independently for error.the court concluded that it had inherent discretion to permit to file an additional brief in propria persona,but found no reason to allow it in this case.in a footnote,the court observed that the first,second,and fifth districts,as well as two divisions of the fourth district,allow a parent days to file a supplemental brief in propria persona.the third and sixth districts do not allow supplemental briefing.the court of appeal denied the parent request to personally file a brief and dismissed the appeal.we granted review.
discussion 
on appeal from a juvenile court order terminating parental rights,the parent has a statutory right to appointed counsel.in the present case,counsel was appointed to represent on appeal,but did not identify any issues to argue.both the united states supreme court and this court have considered in several contexts what procedures should be followed when counsel appointed to represent an indigent client on appeal concludes there are no arguable issues to raise.
more than years ago,in anders california,d,an attorney appointed by the california court of appeal to prosecute a criminal defendant first appeal as of right from a conviction for felony possession of marijuana determined that the appeal had no merit.the attorney filed a letter with the court that stated i will not file a brief on appeal as i am of the opinion that there is no merit to the appeal.i have visited and communicated with anders and have explained my views and opinions to him h e wishes to file a brief in this matter on his own behalf.id.at.the defendant asked the court to appoint another attorney,but the court declined.the defendant then filed a brief in propria persona.the court of appeal affirmed the judgment of conviction.id.at.
the high court ruled that anders had been denied his right to counsel,concluding that counsel bare conclusion,as evidenced by his letter,was not enough because this procedure was not an adequate substitute for the right to full appellate review available to all defendants who may not be able to afford such an expense.anders california,supra,at.the high court observed that california procedure did not furnish petitioner with counsel acting in the role of an advocate nor did it provide that full consideration and resolution of the matter as is obtained when counsel is acting in that capacity.id.at.the court in anders then described how appointed counsel and the court of appeal should have proceeded counsel should,and can with honor and without conflict,be of more assistance to his client and to the court.his role as advocate requires that he support his client appeal to the best of his ability.of course,if counsel finds his case to be wholly frivolous,after a conscientious examination of it,he should so advise the court and request permission to withdraw.that request must,however,be accompanied by a brief referring to anything in the record that might arguably support the appeal.a copy of counsel brief should be furnished the indigent and time allowed him to raise any points that he chooses the proceeds,after a full examination of all the proceedings,to decide whether the case is wholly frivolous.if it so finds it may grant counsel request to withdraw and dismiss the appeal insofar as federal requirements are concerned,or proceed to a decision on the merits,if state law so requires.on the other hand,if it finds any of the legal points arguable on their merits and therefore not frivolous it must,prior to decision,afford the indigent the assistance of counsel to argue the appeal.id.at,fn.omitted.
in people wende,supra,cal d,we followed the holding in anders that the appellate court must examine the entire record when appointed counsel in a criminal case determines there is no merit to the defendant first appeal as of right,but we diverged from the decision in anders by holding that counsel need not withdraw from the case.
wende was convicted of robbery.his appointed counsel on appeal filed a brief which set forth a summary of the proceedings and facts with citations to the transcript,raised no specific issues,and called upon the court to make a thorough review of the entire record to determine for itself whether there were any arguable issues.counsel also submitted a declaration stating that he had advised defendant of the nature of the brief,that he would send defendant a copy of the brief,and that he had informed defendant that the court would permit him to file a brief on his own behalf.counsel also stated that he was not requesting to withdraw but that he would advise defendant that he could move to have counsel relieved if he so desired.people wende,supra,cal d at.the court of appeal dismissed the appeal without conducting a review of the entire record.ibid.the people argued that the court of appeal was not required to review the entire record because,unlike in anders,the defendant had not filed a brief in propria persona.id.at.
we held that the court of appeal must conduct a review of the entire record whenever appointed counsel submits a brief which raises no specific issues or describes the appeal as frivolous.this obligation is triggered by the receipt of such a brief from counsel and does not depend on the subsequent receipt of a brief from the defendant personally.people wende,supra,cal d at.we further held that counsel was not required to seek leave to withdraw so long as he has not described the appeal as frivolous and has informed the defendant that he may request the court to have counsel relieved if he so desires.id.at,fn.omitted.this court reviewed the entire record and found no arguable issues.we declined to dismiss the appeal,stating in view of the fact that we have made a thorough review of the merits and have heard argument on the case,we deem it appropriate to affirm the judgment rather than dismiss the appeal as frivolous.once the record has been reviewed thoroughly,little appears to be gained by dismissing the appeal rather than deciding it on its merits.id.at.
we later considered in people kelly cal th,d,the obligations of the appellate court in a criminal case when appointed counsel files a wende brief,the defendant then personally files a letter or supplemental brief,but the court determines nonetheless there are no arguable issues.we held that the appellate court must address the defendant contentions in a written opinion we conclude that a decision affirming the judgment in a wende appeal disposes of a cause within the meaning of article vi,section,of the california constitution,and therefore must be in writing with reasons stated.because the defendant in a wende appeal has a right to file supplemental contentions,the court of appeal must consider these contentions in the course of disposing of the cause.therefore,to comply with the constitutional mandate,the opinion must reflect the defendant contentions and the reasons that they fail.id.at,d.we reasoned that when a court of appeal affirms a judgment in a wende appeal in which the defendant has filed supplemental contentions,the appellate court necessarily must have considered and rejected those contentions.in accordance with the constitutional requirement of reasons stated,such an opinion must reflect the contentions and the reasons that they fail,just as the opinion would reflect those points if they were raised by counsel.id.at,d.
in in re sade,supra,cal th at pages,d,however,we held that the procedures required in criminal appeals by our decision in wende are not required in an appeal from an order of the juvenile court affecting parental rights.sade arose from two appeals from indigent parents for whom counsel had been appointed.appointed counsel in each case filed a brief that summarized the procedural and factual history of the case but raised no arguable issues and asked the court to independently review the entire record on appeal for any arguable issue.id.at,d.in each case,counsel had advised the parent that he or she could file a supplemental brief with the court within days,but neither parent filed such a brief.id.at,d,see also,at,d.the court of appeal declined to conduct an independent review of the record in each case and dismissed the appeals as abandoned.we affirmed the judgment of the court of appeal.
although we recognized that an indigent parent has a fundamental liberty interest in the care,custody,and management of his child,and thus has a derivative liberty interest in the accuracy and justice citations of the resolution of his appeal,we also observed that the decision,which is adverse to the parent and is predicated on detriment he caused or allowed his child to suffer,is presumptively accurate and just.citation.in re sade,supra,cal th at,d.further,the child has an important liberty interest in a normal family home that may conflict with the parent interests.id.at,d.what the parent wants or needs is not necessarily what the child wants or needs.id.at,d.we observed there is little that can be as detrimental to a child sound development as uncertainty over whether he is to remain in his current home,especially when such uncertainty is prolonged.citation.id.at,d.we relied,in part,on the state interest in expediting juvenile proceedings,noting that p roceedings such as these must be concluded as rapidly as is consistent with fairness citation.a period of time that may not seem long to an adult can be a lifetime to a young child.citation.childhood does not wait id.at,d.
we recognized that there was a risk that dispensing with the prophylactic procedures required in criminal appeals by the decisions in anders and wende could lead to an erroneous resolution of the indigent parent appeal,but concluded as a practical matter,we believe that the chance of error is negligible.in re sade,supra,cal th at,d.we recounted that our consideration of the many cases that have come before us on petition for review reveals that appointed appellate counsel faithfully conduct themselves as active advocates in behalf of indigent parents.this causes no surprise the attorneys are enabled,and indeed encouraged,to effectively represent their clients ibid.we noted the statement of division one of the fourth appellate district of the court of appeal that in more than a decade the court had discovered,to the best of our present recollection,no unbriefed issues warranting further attention.citation.ibid.we concluded,therefore,that the value of applying the procedures required by our decision in wende in criminal appeals to appeals affecting an indigent parent parental rights were too slight to compel their invocation.id.at,d.
we thus held in sade that the court of appeal properly dismissed the indigent parents appeals.unlike in a criminal case in which an indigent defendant first appeal as of right remains a cause that must be resolved in a written opinion with reasons stated even after appointed counsel files a wende brief people kelly,supra,cal th,d,we held that the court of appeal could dismiss an indigent parent appeal if appointed counsel filed a brief raising no arguable issues.in re sade,supra,cal th at,d.
in light of our decision in sade,the parent in the present case,does not argue,and could not reasonably argue,that the court of appeal erred in denying her request that the court independently review the entire record for error.but relying upon a footnote in our decision in conservatorship of ben,supra,cal th,d,ben,argues that the court of appeal was required to permit her to personally file an additional brief.
we held in ben,supra,cal th,d,that the procedures required by our decision in wende do not apply to an appeal from the imposition of a conservatorship under the act welf,et.having concluded that the procedures described in our decision in wende did not apply,we offered the following guidance for the courts of appeal.if appointed counsel in a conservatorship appeal finds no arguable issues,counsel need not and should not file a motion to withdraw.instead,counsel should inform the court he or she has found no arguable issues to be pursued on appeal and file a brief setting out the applicable facts and the law.such a brief will provide an adequate basis for the court to dismiss the appeal on its own motion.ben at,d,fns.omitted.in a footnote,we added the conservatee is to be provided a copy of the brief and informed of the right to file a supplemental brief.id.at,fn,d.
we did not explain the basis for requiring that the conservatee in ben be permitted to personally file a supplemental brief,but chief justice george concluded in his dissent that the court relied upon its supervisory powers,observing that it appears that the majority has decided to exercise this court supervisory powers to impose upon the courts of appeal all of the procedures except the requirement that the appellate court review the record.id.at,d,dis.opn.of george.
the state interest in expediting juvenile proceedings in order to promptly achieve a permanent placement for the child causes us to reach a different conclusion in this case than we did in ben c.as we did in the conservatorship proceedings at issue in ben,we direct the court of appeal that appointed counsel for a parent in an appeal from an order of the juvenile court affecting parental rights who finds no arguable issues need not and should not file a motion to withdraw,but should inform the court he or she has found no arguable issues to be pursued on appeal,file a brief setting out the applicable facts and the law,and provide a copy of the brief to the parent.but unlike in the conservatorship proceedings at issue in ben,the court of appeal is not required to permit the parent to file an additional brief absent a showing of good cause.when an appellant is being held pursuant to a conservatorship under the act,it does no harm to permit the conservatee to file a supplemental brief.the delay that would result affects only the conservatee who has chosen to file an additional brief.the same is not true in an appeal like the one in the present case from a juvenile court order terminating parental rights where a child may be awaiting resolution of his or her status and is being denied a final,stable placement ben,supra,cal th at,d,dis.opn.of george,
