the juvenile court asserted dependency jurisdiction over an incorrigible teenager,precious,under welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b,and removed her from the custody of her mother,patricia mother 
in this case of first impression,we address the issue of whether the provision of section b providing for jurisdiction based on the parent inability to adequately supervise or protect the child requires that the parent be unfit or neglectful in causing serious physical harm to the child or a risk of such harm.we hold that,in light of the dependency statutory scheme and federal due process principles,parental unfitness or neglectful conduct must be shown in order to assert dependency court jurisdiction under that part of section b providing for jurisdiction based on the parent inability to adequately supervise or protect the child.because there was insufficient evidence of both unfitness and neglectful conduct in this case,we reverse the jurisdiction and disposition orders.
