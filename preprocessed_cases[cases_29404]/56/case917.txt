the people appeal an order granting the petition of manuel to seal his juvenile records pursuant to welfare and institutions code section on appeal the people contend the court erred by concluding amendments to section enacted in pursuant to proposition did not apply to preclude sealing of juvenile records relating to manuel penal code section,subdivision b offense in.the court concluded application of the amendment would violate the state and federal constitutions equal protection clauses and prohibitions against ex post facto laws.manuel argues there is no statutory basis on which the people may file an appeal of the order and we therefore should dismiss their appeal.because the people do not have a statutory basis on which to appeal the order,we dismiss the appeal.nevertheless,we treat the people appeal as a petition for writ of mandate and grant that petition.
factual and procedural background 
in july a section petition was filed charging manuel with two counts of committing a forcible lewd and lascivious act on a child under the age of,subd.b.manuel was years old in december at the time of the alleged acts.after manuel admitted one count,the court dismissed the other count and declared him a ward of the juvenile court.it granted him probation until his birthday or until earlier terminated by the court.he was placed in the custody of his mother.
in august the court terminated manuel probation and wardship.
in march manuel filed a section petition requesting an order sealing the records relating to his juvenile case.the probation department opposed manuel petition,arguing that proposition amendments to section,effective march,prohibit the sealing of records of persons who committed an offense listed in section,subdivision b,including a penal code section,subdivision b offense,if the person was years of age or older at the time of the offense.the district attorney also argued that section,as amended by proposition,prohibits the sealing of manuel records.
on may the court granted the petition,finding that the application of amended section to manuel case would violate the state and federal constitutions equal protection clauses and prohibitions against ex post facto laws.the court stayed its order to allow the district attorney to file a petition for writ of mandate challenging the order.
on august,after we denied the district attorney petition for writ of mandate,the court removed its stay 
on august the people filed a notice of appeal of the order sealing manuel juvenile records 
discussion 
ithe order is not appealable by the people under section 
the people brief contends their appeal is authorized by section,subdivision b,which provides that the people may appeal a n order made after judgment entered pursuant to section or.manuel argues that because the order in this case was not made after a judgment entered pursuant to either section or,section,subdivision b does not apply and the people appeal must be dismissed.
an appellate court has no authority to hear an appeal in the absence of appellate jurisdiction.in re almalik th,d.appeals from juvenile court orders and judgments are permitted only as provided by statute.the people right to appeal in juvenile court proceedings is conferred exclusively by statute.people superior court arthur d.it is settled that the right of appeal is statutory and that a judgment or order is not appealable unless expressly made so by statute.citations.the orders,judgments and decrees of a juvenile court that are appealable are restricted to those enumerated in section citations people chi ko wong cal d,disapproved on another ground in people green cal d,in re almalik,supra,at,d.
section provides 
a a judgment in a proceeding under section or may be appealed from,by the minor,in the same manner as any final judgment,and any subsequent order may be appealed from,by the minor,as from an order after judgment.pending appeal of the order or judgment,the granting or refusal to order release shall rest in the discretion of the juvenile court 
b an appeal may be taken by the people from any of the following 
a ruling on a motion to suppress pursuant to section even if the judgment is a dismissal of the petition or any count or counts of the petition.however,no appeal by the people shall lie as to any count which,if the people are successful,will be the basis for further proceedings subjecting any person to double jeopardy.
an order made after judgment entered pursuant to section or.
an order modifying the jurisdictional finding by reducing the degree of the offense or modifying the offense to a lesser offense.
an order or judgment dismissing or otherwise terminating the action before the minor has been placed in jeopardy,or where the minor has waived jeopardy.if,pursuant to this paragraph,the people prosecute an appeal of the decision or any review of that decision,it shall be binding upon the people and they shall be prohibited from refiling the case which was appealed.
the imposition of an unlawful order at a dispositional hearing,whether or not the court suspends the execution of the disposition.
c nothing contained in this section shall be construed to authorize an appeal from an order granting probation.instead,the people may seek appellate review of any grant of probation whether or not the court imposes disposition,by means of a petition for a writ of mandate or prohibition which is filed within days after probation is granted.the review of any grant of probation shall include review of any order underlying the grant of probation italics added.
section relates only to an order that changes or modifies a previous custody order 
an order changing or modifying a previous order by removing a minor from the physical custody of a parent,guardian,relative,or friend and directing placement in a foster home,or commitment to a private institution or commitment to a county institution,or an order changing or modifying a previous order by directing commitment to the youth authority shall be made only after a noticed hearing 
section allows a petition for termination or modification of a juvenile wardship if,inter alia,the juvenile is found to be unfit for treatment under juvenile court law regarding an alleged subsequent offense 
a where a minor is a ward of the juvenile court,the wardship did not result in the minor commitment to the youth authority,and the minor is found not to be a fit and proper subject to be dealt with under the juvenile court law with respect to a subsequent allegation of criminal conduct,any parent or other person having an interest in the minor,or the minor,through a properly appointed guardian,the prosecuting attorney,or probation officer,may petition the court in the same action in which the minor was found to be a ward of the juvenile court for a hearing for an order to terminate or modify the jurisdiction of the juvenile court italics added.
the people appeal challenges the court section order sealing manuel juvenile records.that order was not made after a judgment entered pursuant to section or,subd.b.the record does not contain any order or judgment changing or modifying manuel custody under section.on the contrary,the record shows manuel was placed in his mother custody and successfully completed his probation,presumably without any change in that custody.the record also does not contain any order or judgment disposing of a section petition to terminate manuel wardship based on a finding he was unfit for juvenile court treatment regarding a subsequent allegation of criminal conduct.on the contrary,the record shows manuel successfully completed his probation in this case and does not contain any document showing he committed a subsequent criminal act.therefore,the section order sealing manuel juvenile records is not appealable by the people under section,subdivision b.furthermore,our review of section,subdivision b shows that none of its other provisions apply in the circumstances of this case to allow the people to appeal the section order sealing manuel juvenile records.because section,subdivision b provides the exclusive basis for the people appeal of juvenile court orders and judgments,we are without jurisdiction to consider the people appeal of the section order people chi ko wong,supra,cal d at,in re almalik,supra,th at,d people superior court arthur,supra,d at.accordingly,we must dismiss their appeal.in re almalik,at,d.
we nevertheless treat the people appeal as a petition for writ of mandate 
although the people do not expressly request that we treat their appeal as a petition for writ of mandate,we nevertheless conclude they impliedly requested such treatment based on the district attorney earlier petition for writ of mandate prohibition which we denied incorrectly on the ground there was an adequate remedy by way of appeal.furthermore,we conclude the interests of justice support our treatment of this appeal as a petition for writ of mandate.
an appellate court has discretion to treat a purported appeal from a nonappealable order as a petition for writ of mandate,but that power should be exercised only in unusual circumstances.citation.arnaiz,county of san joaquin th,d.in juvenile wardship cases,t he test controlling the people entitlement to review by writ is derived from people superior court howard cal d.the test employs two criteria.first,the challenged trial court order must be an act in excess of jurisdiction.second,upon a careful balancing,the need to correct judicial errors prejudicing the people must outweigh the conflicting threat of harassment to the accused.the second criterion must be resolved against writ review whenever granting the writ would threaten defendant with double jeopardy.people superior court arthur,supra,d at.most courts have interpreted howard use of the phrase excess of jurisdiction as meaning any misinterpretation,misapplication or refusal to follow applicable constitutional,statutory or case law authority.in re richard d.a considerable line of authorities holds that the court failure to either properly interpret or follow the law is in excess of its jurisdiction and reviewable on the people petition for a prerogative writ citations.
because this case involves the issue of whether the trial court correctly interpreted and applied constitutional,statutory and case law in granting manuel section petition,there is a question whether the court acted in excess of jurisdiction as that phrase in howard has been interpreted.therefore,the first requirement for writ review is satisfied.furthermore,because section relates to the sealing of juvenile records,granting a writ of mandate in this case would not threaten manuel with double jeopardy.people superior court arthur,supra,d at.therefore,the second requirement is satisfied and there is no impediment to our consideration of the people appeal as a petition for writ of mandate.
to the extent civil writ considerations apply,we conclude the people have no plain,speedy,and adequate remedy at law to review the trial court order.in re albert d.furthermore,because we previously denied the district attorney writ petition on the incorrect ground there was an adequate remedy by way of appeal,it would further the interests of judicial economy to treat the appeal as a petition for writ relief rather than require the people to file another writ petition setting forth the same arguments made in their brief on appeal.ibid.also,the briefs and record before us contain in substance all the elements prescribed by rule of the california rules of court for an original mandate proceeding,and there are extraordinary circumstances justifying the exercise of our power to treat the appeal as a petition for writ of mandate.citations.angell superior court th,d.therefore,in the unusual circumstances of this case,we conclude we should reach the merits of the people appeal by treating the appeal as a petition for writ of mandate angell,at,d arnaiz,county of san joaquin,supra,th at,d morehart county of santa barbara cal th,d,people gallardo th,d people garrett th,d people gonter d.in re richard,supra,d at.people chi ko wong,supra,cal d at,in re albert,supra,at.olson cory cal d.
application of amended section does not violate the prohibition against ex post facto laws 
the people contend the trial court erroneously concluded that application of amended section to manuel petition for an order sealing his juvenile records would violate the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws.
article i,section,clause of the united states constitution states in part no state shall pass any ex post facto law article i,section of the california constitution similarly states that an ex post facto law may not be passed.we interpret the california ex post facto provision in the same manner as the federal provision.people castellanos cal th,d.in collins youngblood,d,the united states supreme court restated its interpretation of the ex post facto clause legislatures may not retroactively alter the definition of crimes or increase the punishment for criminal acts.id.at.a n ex post facto violation does not occur simply because a criminal defendant loses substantial protections citation,or suffers some disadvantage after the crime occurs.citations.people ansell cal th,d.ansell stated 
a substantial and disadvantageous change is prohibited only if it inflicts greater punishment,than the law annexed to the crime,when committed.citation.unless the consequences are penal in nature,defendants can not rely on statutes in existence at the time of the crime,or otherwise complain of oppressive retroactive treatment.citations.ansell,supra,cal th at,d,italics added in ansell.
castellanos noted t he method of analyzing what constitutes punishment varies depending upon the context in which the question arises.but two factors appear important in each case whether the legislature intended the provision to constitute punishment and,if not,whether the provision is so punitive in nature or effect that it must be found to constitute punishment despite the legislature contrary intent.castellanos,supra,at,d,fn.omitted.in determining whether a law is so punitive in either purpose or effect that it raises ex post facto concerns,the united states supreme court has considered such factors as whether the challenged law imposes an affirmative disability or restraint whether any such sanction has been historically regarded as punishment whether the law promotes the traditional aims of punishment,retribution and deterrence through means commonly used in criminal statutes,imposing culpability for proscribed acts and requiring scienter whether the law bears a rational connection to legitimate nonpenal aims and whether it appears excessive in relation to such aims.citations.ansell,supra,at,d.
in people acuna th,d,the court concluded a defendant who has been denied expungement of his conviction by an amendment to the penal code enacted after he pled guilty has not been subjected to an ex post facto law.id.at,d,fn.omitted.in acuna,the defendant pleaded guilty in to one count of committing a lewd act on a child under age in violation of penal code section,subdivision a and was granted probation.ibid.at the time of the defendant plea and sentencing,penal code section allowed him on completion of his probation to apply for expungement of his conviction.ibid.however,before completion of the defendant probation,penal code section was amended to prohibit expungement of penal code section convictions.id.at,d.on completion of his probation,the defendant moved for expungement of his conviction and the trial court denied the motion based on the amendment to penal code section.ibid.on appeal,acuna rejected the defendant contention that application of amended penal code section would violate the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws.id.at,d.it reasoned the legislature did not intend that statutory amendment to be punitive.ibid.rather,its legislative intent appeared to be public safety,stating our legislature has determined that public safety is enhanced if those having been convicted of child molestation are not able to truthfully represent that they have no such conviction.id.at.acuna also concluded that the statutory amendment nature and effect were not so punitive that it be considered punishment.ibid.even if expungement were permitted,acuna noted the defendant nevertheless would be required to register as a sex offender,would have to disclose his conviction in applying for a professional license or public office,and could not own or possess a concealable firearm.ibid.furthermore,under penal code section,subdivision a,his conviction could still be used as a prior conviction.ibid.acuna stated 
there is no doubt that being unable to expunge the defendant conviction places some burden on him.he can not truthfully represent to friends,acquaintances and private sector employers that he has no conviction.but such a representation from a person convicted of molesting a child might give the public a false sense of security.it is this false sense of security the statute seeks to eliminate.acuna,supra,th at,d.
accordingly,because the amended statute precluding expungement of penal code section convictions was not punitive in intent,nature or effect,acuna concluded the ex post facto clause did not bar its application to the defendant.ibid.
people ansell,supra,cal th,d,reached the same conclusion regarding an amendment to penal code section that precludes convicted sex offenders from obtaining certificates of rehabilitation.id.at,d.ansell concluded t he amendment does not impose punishment or otherwise implicate ex post facto concerns.we decline to invalidate this provision insofar as it withholds the certificate of rehabilitation procedure from convicted sex offenders who,like the defendant,committed their crimes prior to the amendment effective date.id.at,d.
people castellanos,supra,cal th,d,also rejected an ex post facto challenge of an amendment to penal code section that requires the defendant to register as a sex offender for certain crimes he committed before that amendment.id.at,d.castellanos concluded the legislature did not intend the registration requirement to constitute punishment.id.at,d.it further concluded the registration requirement was not so punitive in nature or effect that it must be regarded as punishment,despite the substantial burden it imposed on the convicted offender.id.at,d.
in granting manuel section petition,the trial court concluded that proposition amendments to section in did not apply to his commission in of a lewd act under penal code section,subdivision b because those amendments are punitive in nature and therefore their application would violate the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws.the court declined to follow the reasoning in acuna and instead relied on doe i otte cir,certiorari granted,d,which concluded alaska sex offender registration statute was punitive in effect and therefore violated the prohibition against ex post facto laws.the trial court also cited in re d,which concluded that section provisions for sealing juvenile records showed a legislative intent to protect juveniles from future prejudice.
we conclude the trial court erred by finding proposition amendments to section violate the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws.assuming arguendo that those amendments apply retroactively,manuel has not shown that the legislative intent of those amendments was to increase punishment or that their purpose,nature or effect is so punitive that they must be considered punishment for purposes of the ex post facto clause although manuel cites provisions from certain documents relating to the legislative history of proposition,none of those provisions support a reasonable inference that the legislative intent of the specific amendments to section was punitive proposition amendments to section are only part,and in our estimation only a minor part,of the overall provisions of that multifaceted initiative.proposition primary purpose is reflected in its short title,gang violence and juvenile crime prevention act of.manduley superior court cal th,d,citing ballot,primary,text of.although section of proposition refers to the desirability of eliminating confidentiality in some juvenile proceedings to hold juvenile offenders more accountable for their actions,it also refers to many other goals that are unrelated to section.manduley,supra,at,d.sections through of the initiative are related to criminal gang activity.ibid.in particular,s ection amends penal code section to add murder as a special circumstance permitting the imposition of the death penalty or a sentence of life without the possibility of parole.ibid.sections through of proposition amend portions of the three strikes law.ibid.sections and modify the lists of violent and serious offenses for which enhanced sentences are required.ibid.manduley describes proposition changes to the juvenile justice system as follows 
in addition to the revisions related to charging minors in criminal court and restricting juvenile court dispositions for certain minors,changes made by these sections,sections through include limitations on the confidentiality of juvenile criminal records,restrictions on the prehearing release of minors accused of specified offenses,and revisions to various procedures and evidentiary rules in juvenile wardship proceedings.manduley,supra,cal th at,d.
manduley discussion of the provisions of proposition shows that the initiative amendments to section were only a minor part of its overall provisions and objectives.id.at,d.except for general references to those amendments,manduley does not specifically discuss either their substantive provisions or their legislative purpose.id.at,d.in contrast,it specifically discusses the more substantive provisions regarding crime and the three strikes law,many of which are clearly punitive.id.at,d.therefore,although punishment for juvenile crime may be a major purpose of proposition,there is nothing in its language or legislative history that shows punishment was the legislative purpose of its amendments to section.
manuel also does not show that the purpose,nature or effect of the amendments to section is so punitive that they must be considered punishment for purposes of the ex post facto clause.the amendments do not impose an affirmative disability or restraint.people ansell,supra,cal th at,d.rather,they merely preclude existing juvenile records from being sealed and possibly destroyed.any indirect disability from the inability to have juvenile records sealed and possibly destroyed is a negative,not affirmative,disability.furthermore,inability to petition for sealing of juvenile records has not been historically regarded as punishment.ibid.punishment historically consists of imprisonment and fines,not an inability to have sealed records of a past offense for which such punishment has already been imposed and completed.also,contrary to manuel assertion,the inability to petition for sealing of juvenile records does not promote the traditional aims of punishment,retribution and deterrence through means commonly used in criminal statutes,imposing culpability for proscribed acts and requiring scienter.id.at,d.proposition amendments to section do not impose any culpability on juveniles for their past juvenile offenses much less for a current act of filing a petition to have a juvenile record sealed.those amendments do not appear to have any goal of retribution or deterrence.it is unlikely that a juvenile,when committing a section,subdivision b offense,subd.b forcible lewd act on a child under age,would be deterred by knowledge that if he or she is found to have committed such offense and is subjected to a juvenile court wardship that he or she may not be able to have related juvenile records sealed thereafter.also,the inability to have sealed juvenile records of a past offense can not reasonably be viewed as retribution for that past offense.furthermore,the amendments to section appear to bear a rational connection to legitimate nonpenal aims.id.at,d.the inability of juveniles to have their records of certain juvenile offenses sealed and possibly destroyed appears to serve regulatory purposes.although such juvenile records generally may not be disclosed to the public as manuel notes see et,those records nevertheless may provide useful information to persons authorized to receive disclosur
