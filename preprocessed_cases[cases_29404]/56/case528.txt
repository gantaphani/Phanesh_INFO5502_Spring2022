factual and procedural background 
in july,a petition was filed by the sacramento county department of health and human services the department concerning the nearly minor,alleging physical abuse by the minor mother and her boyfriend,and physical and sexual abuse by appellant.the petition was later amended to add an allegation that the minor was at substantial risk of suffering serious emotional damage,in part as a result of sexual abuse perpetrated by appellant.appellant,who is deaf,appeared with an american sign language interpreter throughout the proceedings.he denied he had abused the minor in any way.
the minor previously had been made a dependent of the juvenile court in,soon after his birth,based on severe physical abuse of his older sibling by the parents.the following month,the parents separated as a result of a domestic violence incident allegedly perpetrated by appellant.
during the previous proceedings,it initially was reported by the foster care agency that appellant became angry and aggressive on occasion,but it eventually was determined that appellant assertive gestures and rapid movements in american sign language possibly were being misinterpreted as aggressive or threatening.
in may,the minor was reunified with appellant,who eventually was granted sole physical custody.however,appellant was not able to reunify with the minor older sibling,who had been diagnosed with mental retardation and mild cerebral palsy,and appellant parental rights as to that child were terminated.
numerous referrals were received by the department in the ensuing years concerning abuse or neglect of the minor by his mother or appellant.according to the mother,she received full custody of the minor in following a family court hearing,after which the minor told her that appellant had beat him every day and had committed additional acts of sexual abuse.in,the minor made further disclosures of sexual abuse by appellant after an incident in which appellant tried to remove the minor from the mother property,and the family court visitation order was changed to require supervision by a licensed therapist.
the minor had been diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder,and exhibited temper tantrums,anxiety,fighting and aggression with his peers,enuresis and encopresis,and frequent nightmares involving appellant.numerous professionals had observed that the minor had severe behavioral problems due to his history of abuse and neglect in his family of origin.
at the jurisdictional hearing in the present proceedings,which was completed in january,the juvenile court dismissed the allegations of sexual abuse against appellant but concluded the minor was seriously disturbed and that it appeared this was the result of what had occurred while he lived with appellant.accordingly,the court sustained allegations that appellant had physically abused the minor between and,that the minor had suffered severe emotional damage,and that the mother was not able to properly care for the minor due to his severe emotional disturbances.
the dispositional hearing was continued numerous times and was not completed until july.in the meantime,the minor two half siblings and two stepsiblings were placed in protective custody in march after it was discovered that the step four and bruising on various parts of their bodies,and the seven year old reported appellant had hit and kicked her.in addition,it had been reported that appellant had been uncooperative,confrontational and intimidating with the visit supervisor during a visit with the minor,and he was no longer allowed to have visits at the minor placement.nonetheless,following testimony at the dispositional hearing,the juvenile court ordered reunification services for appellant,while denying services for the mother.the court set a review hearing for the following month.
pursuant to section,the department requested a rehearing on whether appellant should be granted reunification services,which was granted.
at the review hearing,which took place while the rehearing was pending,the juvenile court adopted the social worker recommendations and set the matter for a subsequent review hearing.appellant filed a notice of appeal.meanwhile,the minor was placed in the care of a woman with whom the mother had been placed when she was a minor,whom the minor considered his grandmother.
the rehearing of the dispositional hearing occurred in october and november.the social worker testified that she did not believe appellant had taken responsibility for physically abusing the minor or the minor siblings,as he had not admitted the abuse in either counseling or anger management sessions.the social worker also felt that appellant communications with her sometimes exhibited anger and aggressiveness.when questioned by the court about this assessment,the social worker had difficulty giving examples but testified she could feel appellant anger in his and based on his mannerisms and gestures.
appellant therapist testified that appellant was receptive to her suggestions as to how to improve visits with the minor and that she had observed a growth and change in him as the visits progressed.the therapist explained that there were some communication difficulties between appellant and her due to his deafness,but her training allowed her to recognize when this was occurring and to respond.she testified that appellant also had been very receptive to anger management treatment,had made progress in this area,and no longer had an anger control problem.although appellant continued to deny he physically abused the minor or his other children,the therapist did not feel this constituted a lack of progress because appellant was so willing to explore every aspect of his behavior and his philosophy and his moral judgment.the therapist explained that appellant and she talked about the abuse allegations,and because his answers were consistent,she took his word that he had not caused the injuries.she acknowledged that she did not attempt to ascertain what the court records established with regard to the abuse.
similarly,a psychotherapist who treated appellant as well as the service provider for his parenting class testified as to appellant positive participation.however,the psychotherapist had not addressed the physical abuse perpetrated by appellant because she was not aware that any allegations in this regard had been sustained against him.she was also unaware that appellant had reported he had been physically and sexually abused as a child,and appellant reported otherwise to her.
the psychotherapist also testified that appellant strong gestures were not alarming to her because almost all clients that she worked with from the deaf community are very emphatic with their hand motions and their emotions.for the same reason,the sounds that appellant made when communicating did not alarm her because she knew that members of the deaf community were not aware of how loud they are.
appellant testified that he had never abused any of his children but he was willing to cooperate with the department if he was offered reunification services.
following testimony,the court concluded the department had established that section,subdivisions b the minor or a sibling was previously removed due to physical or sexual abuse and the minor has been removed again as a result of physical or sexual abuse and b failure to reunify with a sibling and the parent has not made a reasonable effort to treat the problem that led to removal of the sibling applied as bases for denying appellant services.
the court also concluded appellant had failed to establish services would be in the minor best interests under section,subdivision c.the court noted there was no evid
