the people charged john with felony attempted burglary in a juvenile wardship petition.during proceedings in november,john counsel declared a doubt as to john competency and the court invoked welfare and institutions code section ordering suspension of proceedings and appointing an expert to evaluate john.the expert february report stated that john had an iq of and was not presently competent,but the court found the report lacking in detail.another expert was appointed to evaluate john,but a second report was never prepared for the court.meanwhile,john was involved in two alleged batteries at school which were not immediately charged.
on april,when the people offered to allow john to plead to three misdemeanors and drop the felony charge,john counsel asked the court leave to withdraw her doubt as to john competency.after john counsel and the court questioned john on the record,the court accepted john admissions and allowed john counsel to withdraw her doubt.
on appeal john contends that there was insufficient evidence that john was competent when he entered his pleas the juvenile court may not adopt defense counsel belief that john could assist in his own defense as a judicial finding of competence the court violated the requirement of section,subd.f and defense counsel was ineffective when she argued the disposition without having copies of police reports of the batteries that john admitted.
we conclude that the juvenile court had no jurisdiction to allow john counsel to withdraw her doubt and could not make a competency determination within the confines of section without expert input.the order adjudging john to be a ward of the court,pursuant to section,is reversed.we direct the trial court to withdraw john admissions and order proceedings in conformity with section.we need not examine john other assertions of error.
john has also filed a separate petition for writ of habeas corpus which seeks relief no different from that which he seeks on appeal.with our decision here,john petition for writ of habeas corpus is denied as moot.
background 
on july,the people filed a juvenile wardship petition,pursuant to section,subdivision a,alleging that john had attempted a first degree residential burglary,subd.a.john,who was then years old,had been with two friends who asked him to act as lookout while they broke into a house and john agreed,though he told police that he thought his friends were playing until he heard the sound of an alarm from the house.john and his friends left the scene,but john was apprehended because a witness followed him.
on september,the court found john eligible for deferred entry of judgment dej.on november,the court commissioner stephen houghton held a hearing for john to enter a plea for dej.the court asked john if he was admitting the attempted burglary by his own choice and john answered,no.john counsel explained that she had worked hard to help john understand the proceedings,but that issues remained and she declared a doubt as to john competency.the court suspended proceedings,pursuant to section,and,on november,appointed john rouse,to perform an evaluation of john.
on january,rouse informed the court that he had been unable to evaluate john because john mother failed to bring john for evaluation on each of three days he had scheduled with her.on february,the court appointed edward meshberg,to evaluate john and admonished john mother to ensure that the evaluation occurred.
on march,meshberg submitted a report,based upon a minute evaluation,that stated toward the end of the assessment john reported he was bored and did attempt to answer questions he was asked,even when reminded of the potential consequences of what he is facing.meshberg made rule out diagnoses of mood disorder,attention deficit disorder,and mild mental retardation.john iq was reported as on the kbit.meshberg concluded that john was not competent to help his attorney defend him and not competent to stand trial,at this time and recommended that john be given court room training in how a trial proceeds and how the various outcomes can affect his life.
at a hearing on march,the court rebecca hardie stated that that it found the report of meshberg lacking in sufficient detail and not very informative or helpful.the court also considered a probation department report stating that john had significant absences from school and had been involved in two fights there.the court placed john on home supervision with electronic monitoring.the matter of competency was continued.
on march,the court referred john to marlon griffith,for a further competency evaluation.
on march,the probation department reported that two days earlier john had left his home without the approval of his probation officer.additionally,john had been suspended from school and had failed to inform his probation officer.
on april,the court barry baskin referred john to karen franklin,because griffith would only evaluate minors who are at least years old.
on april,the court ordered that john be detained because the probation department reported that john electronic monitor had been removed and a witness reported that it had been thrown through a car windshield.john admitted removing the monitor,but not throwing it at a moving car.
on april,john counsel informed the court that the district attorney had offered to allow john to admit three misdemeanor counts and to dismiss the felony charge.john counsel believed that john understood the situation and she wished to withdraw her doubt as to john competency so that john could enter a plea.she told the court i come to realize that a lot of that with john is not about not understanding the process,it more about the vocabulary that used w hen anybody will use certain words,he just will not understand them.he does understand the word waive.he does understand.and i do think that he ever will.he has an individualized education plan.there definitely a block there but i do think that he is incompetent.i think that it really a matter of explaining things at a much more basic level.the court stated that it was happy to question john on the record,but added it a significant matter for me in vacating a prior order i t concerns me because when there is a doubt,we have an obligation to the minor to make sure that he or she understands.
following a recess,the court stated that it had reviewed the case file and found meshberg report not to be very helpful on the question of whether the minor was incompetent or not.the doctor concluded that he was,but there was,in my view,very little information in there about why.
john counsel responded well,i think that meshberg addresses his low iq and lack of focus,and i do think that that could be enough to believe that he is not competent.you know,i not sure that he does have to go beyond that,you know,if he stops answering questions and,you know,has this extremely low iq,i do think that could be enough.i troubled a lot because john is in custody now and,you know,i concerned about him i saddened that he here and i think that i do think he ever going to be competent in the way that we want him to be.i do there a developmental delay.he does need medications.you know,i do think he needs training.i think things need to be just explained to him very slowly.and,you know,word choice needs to be very,you know,thoughtful and basic.and so i just,you know and there is this offer of misdemeanors.that was what i was trying to get all along even before,you know,proceedings were suspended.it my advice that he takes it.you know,he understands.he does want to admit the charges.he understands that.he does want a trial.you know,so i just i just a little bit torn because,you know,i do want to go forward with him forward today with this so that he can move on.
john counsel and the court then proceeded to ask john questions.john was able to identify his counsel as his attorney and stated that her role was to try to get me up out of here.john did not recognize the district attorney and was not able to explain the role of a prosecutor.john said it was the police who charged him with crimes.he explained that the role of the judge was to tell you how long you got like,how long you got to spend your time in here.according to john,a trial is people that come in and they choose,like,if you are guilty or if you are guilty or not.
john said that a felony was worse than a misdemeanor and that he wanted to admit he was guilty rather than go to trial.the court asked john why a felony was more serious than a misdemeanor and john replied a felony too much serious because it much worser and stuff.and a misdemeanor is more better to me than a felony cause a felony,like,you spend more time up in here.john said he understood that by admitting the charges,a trial would not happen and that he wanted to admit he was guilty b ecause a trial at trial,it more worser.
the court then proceeded to ask whether john understood standard boykin thal admonitions.boykin alabama in re tahl cal d.
the prosecutor moved to amend the petition to allege misdemeanor attempted second degree burglary as count,subd.b,and two misdemeanor batteries on school grounds as counts and,subd.a.the court granted this motion and dismissed the original count of felony attempted burglary.john entered pleas of no contest to the three misdemeanor counts.the court stated the court accepts each of the no contest pleas as admissions.the court finds that the minor has been advised of his constitutional rights.he made a knowing,intelligent and voluntary waiver of those rights.he entered his pleas of no contest to counts,and in a knowing,intelligent and voluntary manner.the court also stated for the record,i should say that i granting this obviously,by having taken his pleas i granted murray motion to withdraw her declaration of a doubt.the record shows that detailed questioning of the minor conducted by murray and by the court,i am satisfied that he understands the proceedings.murray,you represent that he been in a position to assist you,if necessary john counsel answered yes and the court stated so i adopt that as my finding.and that the reason for the unusual procedure of allowing you to withdraw your declaration of a doubt.
at a disposition hearing on may,the court adjudged john a ward of the court.john was committed to the orin allen youth rehabilitation facility for nine months.a motion to reconsider disposition was denied by the court on june.
a timely notice of appeal was filed on may.
discussion 
to be mentally competent to stand trial,a defendant must be capable of understanding the nature and purpose of the proceedings against him,must comprehend his own status and condition in reference to such proceedings,and must be capable to assist his attorney in conducting his defense,or be able to conduct his own defense in a rational manner.people conrad d.the conviction of an accused person while he is legally incompetent violates due process and state procedures must be adequate to protect this right.pate robinson.the standard for competency is no different for a defendant who is pleading guilty than for one who is going to trial.godinez moran.
the essentials of due process and fair treatment apply to juvenile proceedings as well as to adult criminal proceedings.in re gault.juvenile incompetency is not defined solely in terms of mental illness or disability,but also encompasses developmental immaturity,because minors brains are still developing.timothy superior court th.
in california juvenile proceedings,section governs competency determinations and provides,in relevant part a during the pendency of any juvenile proceeding,the minor counsel or the court may express a doubt as to the minor competency.a minor is incompetent to proceed if he or she lacks sufficient present ability to consult with counsel and assist in preparing his or her defense with a reasonable degree of rational understanding,or lacks a rational as well as factual understanding,of the nature of the charges or proceedings against him or her.if the court finds substantial evidence raises a doubt as to the minor competency,the proceedings shall be suspended.b upon suspension of proceedings,the court shall order that the question of the minor competence be determined at a hearing.the court shall appoint an expert to evaluate whether the minor suffers from a mental disorder,developmental disability,developmental immaturity,or other condition and,if so,whether the condition or conditions impair the minor competency.the expert shall have expertise in child and adolescent development,and training in the forensic evaluation of juveniles,and shall be familiar with competency standards and accepted criteria used in evaluating competence.the judicial council shall develop and adopt rules for the implementation of these requirements.incompetency must be established by a preponderance of the evidence,subd.c.
section makes no provision for a court to withdraw its order suspending proceedings so that the minor competency can be determined at a hearing with input from an expert.we find no cases that deal with whether,or under what circumstances,a juvenile court has the discretion to withdraw orders made pursuant to section,subdivisions a and b.however,cases concerning due process requirements when determining competency in the adult criminal context are instructive.
in adult criminal proceedings,the question of competence is governed by penal code section,which provides,in relevant part a if,during the pendency of an action and prior to judgment,a doubt arises in the mind of the judge as to the mental competence of the defendant,he or she shall state that doubt in the record and inquire of the attorney for the defendant whether,in the opinion of the attorney,the defendant is mentally competent.if the defendant is not represented by counsel,the court shall appoint counsel.at the request of the defendant or his or her counsel or upon its own motion,the court shall recess the proceedings for as long as may be reasonably necessary to permit counsel to confer with the defendant and to form an opinion as to the mental competence of the defendant at that point in time.b if counsel informs the court that he or she believes the defendant is or may be mentally incompetent,the court shall order that the question of the defendant mental competence is to be determined in a hearing which is held pursuant to sections and.if counsel informs the court that he or she believes the defendant is mentally competent,the court may nevertheless order a hearing.any hearing shall be held in the superior court.c except as provided in section,when an order for a hearing into the present mental competence of the defendant has been issued,all proceedings in the criminal prosecution shall be suspended until the question of the present mental competence of the defendant has been determined.like welfare and institutions code section,penal code section requires the appointment of a psychiatrist or psychologist to evaluate the defendant competency.
