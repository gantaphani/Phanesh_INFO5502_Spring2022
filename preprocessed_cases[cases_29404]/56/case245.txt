in this matter,we are asked to decide a novel issue regarding whether a minor urging his cohorts not to cooperate with a police investigation rises to the level of a violation of penal code section.this case requires us to determine when a refusal to cooperate with police becomes unlawful interference with police activity under section.we conclude that refusal to cooperate only becomes criminal when it obstructs lawful police activity.

on appeal,chase contends that substantial evidence does not support the finding as to section,subdivision a.we agree and reverse the judgment.
statement of facts 
on may,at approximately,san diego sheriff deputy scott hill was conducting a foot patrol through turtle park,on craftsman way in the forest ranch area of san diego.hill was not in full uniform at the time,but was wearing either an external raid vest with sheriff written on it,or a sheriff shirt with patches.hill was approached by a group of middle school children,who told him that two high school aged children had tried to sell them drugs.the middle school children described the suspects with enough detail that hill believed he would be able to find the two suspects they were describing.
interaction 
hill set out in his patrol car and within two minutes had located two individuals who matched the suspects descriptions completely.the two individuals were with a group of approximately eight other minors,all of whom hill estimated to be about years old.in approaching this group,hill parked his patrol car,got out,and specifically addressed the two individuals who matched the suspects descriptions.hill told the other minors that they were free to go.
hill ordered the two suspects to sit down on the curb.one of the suspects,jason or jacob mcbride,cooperated right away.the second suspect,brandon hewgley,refused to sit down and questioned hill about why he was being detained.at this point,one of the nonsuspect minors,chase,began telling hewgley not to listen to hill or obey,not to do what hill was telling him to do.hill testified that the purpose of his investigation initially was to determine whether the two suspects had been trying to sell drugs to the middle school children,and that he had no need to contact any of the other minors in the group.
as hill was addressing the two suspects and ordering them to sit down on the curb,hewgley continued to protest.hewgley told hill that he was going to listen he was going to do what hill said.hill placed his hand on hewgley arm and said,hey,i really need you to sit down.in response,hewgley threw his arm up as if he was going to strike hill.hill grabbed hewgley and pulled him back,holding him there while hill requested immediate backup by radio.hill detained hewgley in a patrol car,and backup officers arrived on scene within two minutes.hill then proceeded with his initial investigation by speaking with the other suspect,mcbride,who had been cooperating the entire time.
in regards to what chase said to hewgley during hill initial contact,hill testified that he could only remember a generalized statement by chase telling hewgley not to listen to what i was saying,and chase telling the other kids fuck him,referring to me.hill also testified that hewgley was already refusing to comply before chase told hewgley that he should not cooperate.in contrast,hill testified that mcbride did not resist him at any time,in spite of chase audible protests.hewgley remained noncompliant throughout the contact and hill could not say whether or not this was due to chase verbal protestations.i can not say what the determining factor for hewgley to remain noncompliant was.
in addition,the other nonsuspect minors were also questioning hill actions during his initial contact with hewgley and mcbride,but hill would not quantify their statements as interfering.while hill testified he believed chase statements affected the nonsuspect minors,hill conceded that nobody became violent nobody else became resistant physically.
interaction 
when backup deputies baquiran and robins arrived,hill was placing a handcuffed hewgley in a patrol car,while another kid was yelling something,and the other nonsuspect minors were just kind of standing around.baquiran detained and handcuffed all of the remaining minors,for their safety and the officers safety.baquiran testified that the purpose of detaining the nonsuspect minors who remained on the scene was to get their information and to make sure that they did have any contraband on their person and they were not involved in any type of drug sales activity.while the officers were detaining the nonsuspect minors,chase continued to protest,telling the other minors,do listen to him.this is bullshit.do tell him anything.do say shit.baquiran asked chase,please be quiet.we trying to get information on everybody here.chase continued to say,do tell him shit.
handcuffing and identifying the teenagers took a few minutes,and was accomplished in an efficient manner.baquiran testified that there was a little delay in getting the minors information,and baquiran felt this delay was caused by chase telling the other minors not to cooperate.the minors were initially not cooperating in providing their names,but began cooperating after baquiran threatened that they would be taken down to the station and their parents would be called if they did not identify themselves.
toward the end of the encounter,hewgley began banging his head inside of the patrol car.baquiran became concerned and wanted to get hewgley out of the area and back to the station so he did hurt himself or he did try to damage the patrol vehicle.baquiran felt that he was delayed in dealing with hewgley because of the need to detain the other minors and get their information.
interaction 
chase refused to give his name or his parents information on scene,stating that he was pleading the fifth amendment.baquiran testified that when he placed handcuffs on chase,chase said,what the fuck,and am i getting arrested when baquiran told chase that he was in fact being arrested,chase responded,for what this is bullshit.baquiran told chase that he needed chase to calm down,at which point chase yelled to the other minors,do cooperate.do tell them shit.chase did not at any time,however,physically resist baquiran,run away,or require any use of force.nor did chase physically resist or obstruct hill in his performance of his duties.finally,once chase was arrested and placed in the patrol car,baquiran testified that chase became extremely cooperative and remained so while at the station.none of the other minors were arrested aside from chase and hewgley.
at the adjudication hearing,baquiran was asked what the main reason for placing chase under arrest was.he answered 
he delayed what we were trying to do,trying to accomplish by him not providing just simple information what is your name,who can we contact so they can come and take care of you,take custody of you here.that all we needed to do.it very simple.just,what is your name who is your mom where is your dad what your phone number but they refused to provide that information to us.
the people asked baquiran if there were any other factors that led him to place chase under arrest at that time.baquiran responded 
yeah.one was when i first had contact with him,he was telling the other kids,do tell them shit.do tell them anything.pretty much,do cooperate.and it makes our job harder if one person is telling the whole group do cooperate with the cops do listen to them they are not going to do anything do listen to them they ca do anything to us,pretty much.he did say that,but that what he telling them do tell them nothing and they got nothing.
the juvenile court found the allegation against chase to be true.the court adjudged chase a ward of the court under welfare and institutions code section and placed him on formal probation for one year or until chase birthday,whichever was longer.
standard of review 
our review is governed by the same principles applicable to adult criminal appeals.in re roderick cal d.our function is to determine whether the record contains any substantial evidence tending to support the finding of the trier of fact,and in considering this question we must view this evidence in the light most favorable to the finding.id.at.substantial evidence is evidence that is reasonable,credible,and of solid value such that a reasonable trier of fact could find the appellant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.people johnson cal d.the test is not whether guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt,but whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.jackson virginia.
discussion 
the elements of a violation of section,subdivision a are the following the defendant willfully resisted,delayed,or obstructed a peace officer,when the officer was engaged in the performance of his or her duties,and the defendant knew or reasonably should have known that the other person was a peace officer engaged in the performance of his or her duties.yount city of sacramento cal th.however,it is no crime in this state to nonviolently resist the unlawful action of police officers.in re michael cal d.thus,b efore a person can be convicted of a violation of section,subdivision a there must be proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the officer was acting lawfully at the time the offense against him was committed.in re joseph th.the rule flows from the premise that because an officer has no duty to take illegal action,he or she is not engaged in duties for purposes of an offense defined in such terms,if the officer conduct is unlawful in re manuel cal th,people cruz cal th,it is also a rule that when a statute makes it a crime to commit any act against a peace officer engaged in the performance of his or her duties,part of the corpus delicti of the offense is that the officer was acting lawfully at the time the offense was committed.under california law,an officer is not lawfully performing her duties when she detains an individual without reasonable suspicion or arrests an individual without probable cause.nuno county of san bernardino d,italics added.
the conviction is not supported by substantial evidence 
chase contends substantial evidence does not support the judgment as to the resisting charge because his verbal conduct in telling the other minors not to cooperate was protected political speech,which did not result in any physical interference with the officer investigation.furthermore,the nonsuspect minors were not being lawfully detained and therefore it was within chase rights to tell them not to provide their information,and to decline to provide his own information.
in analyzing the charge of resisting a peace officer,we see distinct constitutional and statutory issues with respect to chase conduct in telling hewgley not to cooperate,in telling the nonsuspect minors not to cooperate,and in refusing to disclose his identity to police prior to being placed in a patrol car.
chase conduct in telling hewgley not to cooperate interaction 
analyzing chase conviction under section for his prearrest actions at interaction,where chase encouraged hewgley not to cooperate with deputy hill,the evidence was insufficient to show that chase conduct had any effect on the arrest or processing of hewgley.chase verbal criticism of hewgley detention did not violate section because it was protected political speech.speech is generally protected by the first amendment,even if it is intended to interfere with the performance of an officer duty,provided no physical interference results.long valentino d.chase was merely exercising his right to verbally protest and challenge law enforcement decision to detain his friend.no physical interference resulted.therefore,this conduct does not rise to the level of a section violation.
furthermore,hewgley demonstrated his unwillingness to comply with hill orders before chase began protesting,and continued it long after he was separated from chase by being placed in the patrol car.hewgley went so far as to physically resist by raising his arm up against hill.no evidence was presented that hewgley engaged in these actions as a result of chase words.in fact,hill testified he could not say whether chase words influenced hewgley at all.because hewgley was resisting prior to chase comments,and continued resisting long after the two were separated,there is no evidence in the record that chase obstructed or delayed hill arrest of hewgley.
chase conduct in telling nonsuspect minors not to cooperate interaction 
interaction consisted of chase encouraging the nonsuspect minors not to provide their information to officers.the evidence was insufficient to show a violation of section based upon this act because the officers were not engaged in the lawful performance of their duties.people simons th.
the lawfulness of the officer conduct is an essential element of the offense of resisting,delaying,or obstructing a peace officer.in re joseph th.
in this case,there was no lawful detention or arrest of the admittedly nonsuspect minors.hill testified that the tip he received described only mcbride and hewgley.when hill encountered the suspects with the large group of minors,he told the nonsuspect minors including chase they were free to go.instead of leaving the scene,the minors chose to stay and protest hill decision to detain mcbride and hewgley.however,the fact that the minors chose to stay after they were told they were free to go did not make them subject to detention.
in fact,the minors did nothing to create a reason to detain them.nor was any evidence offered suggesting any other crime that the minors were suspected of,which might have provided a lawful reason to detain the minors under the fourth amendment.terry ohio.the detention of the minors was unlawful.as such,chase conduct in protesting their detention was not only politically protected free speech but would never rise to the level of a section violation for want of an essential element of the crime.in re joseph,supra,th at.
chase refusal to give his information interaction 
chase relies upon people quiroga th quiroga to show that his conduct amounted to nothing more than verbal resistance and his actions were protected by the first amendment.the court in quiroga held that an individual who protested repeatedly before complying with an officer orders could not be prosecuted under section because verbal challenges to police action are protected by the first amendment.id.at.although the defendant in quiroga did not respond with alacrity to an officer orders,he did ultimately respond to them.id.at appellant argued before complying with the order.italics added.chase conduct is similar.
interaction consisted of chase refusing to provide officers with his identification and encouraging the nonsuspect minors not to provide their information as well.the evidence was insufficient to show a violation of section based upon this act because the conduct,if it caused any delay,caused a lawful delay which did not violate section.
chase was detained along with the other nonsuspect minors when deputies baquiran and robbins arrived on scene.baquiran testified that his reason for arresting chase,who was admittedly not the target of the initial investigation,was chase refusal to provide his information and his instructing the other minors not to cooperate.at this point,chase conduct did not violate section because it did not delay or obstruct a peace officer in the discharge of any duty within the meaning of the statute.chase arrest had already been effected.chase noncooperation did not serve to delay or thwart his detention,as he was already detained.and it was still premature to ask the questions needed for booking chase in jail.quiroga,supra,th at.
under california law,the fact that someone verbally challenges a police officer autho
