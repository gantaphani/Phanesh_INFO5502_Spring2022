the juvenile court sustained allegations of a welfare and institutions code section petition alleging the juvenile committed grand theft person and attempted robbery.the juvenile appeals from the court order of wardship,claiming the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of either offense.he also claims a probation condition ordering him to stay away from areas where users congregate is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.the juvenile further contends the court erred in failing to declare on the record whether the grand theft person wobbler offense would be a misdemeanor or felony for an adult convicted of the same offense.finally,the juvenile argues the maximum term of commitment set by the court should be stricken as both erroneous and unnecessary in this case where the disposition the court ordered was home on probation.
we find the evidence does not support a finding the juvenile took the property from the person of the victim as is required for grand theft person.we will thus reduce the offense in count one to the misdemeanor offense of petty theft,a lesser included offense of grand theft person.we will also modify the court order with respect to the challenged probation condition.we affirm the court order in all other respects.

juan hernandez was working in mendez market on july.around he went into the alley behind the store to take out some trash.he saw six boys fighting in the alley to feet away.a minute later they all ran away.hernandez did not see any boy with a knife.hernandez did not hear any of the boys make any comment.
roberto testified at the adjudication hearing.he testified mario,alex,george and juan were making derogatory comments while he and appellant were eating at the mcdonald.mario and his friends made fun of roberto nose.they also made unpleasant comments about appellant disfigured eyelids.the boys called appellant,ve ciego or blind and made fun of how he looked.roberto asked,what are you looking at roberto admitted he invoked the name of his crew the assassin kings because he was angry and wanted to scare the boys who were taunting them.roberto explained assassin kings was not a tagging crew but was a regular crew.
roberto denied he and appellant followed the boys out of the mcdonald restaurant.however,he testified when they saw mario and his friends in the alley,he and appellant dumped out their sodas and walked up to them.
roberto denied either he or appellant ever asked mario or his friends for money.he testified appellant got into an argument with one of the boys over an earlier slight and a fight broke out.roberto agreed appellant had thrown the first punch.roberto was about to help appellant when another one of the boys attacked him and they started fighting.when he saw mario getting the better of appellant roberto yelled,let him go,let him go.by this time appellant already had a black eye.roberto tried to stop the fight by pretending to have a knife and threatening to shank them with his pretend knife.roberto testified it was just a bluff he used to get mario to release appellant.

discussion 
substantial evidence supports the juvenile court finding appellant committed attempted robbery.
appellant contends the evidence is insufficient to support the finding he committed an attempted robbery of mario.
the standard of proof in juvenile proceedings involving criminal acts is the same as the standard in adult criminal trials the reviewing court must review the whole record in the light most favorable to the judgment to determine whether it discloses evidence which is reasonable,credible,and of solid value,such that a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt 
robbery is defined as the felonious taking of personal property in the possession of another,from his person or immediate presence,and against his will,accomplished by means of force or fear.to establish the offense of attempted robbery the prosecution was required to show appellant intended to commit each of these elements and took direct but ineffectual steps toward their commission 
first appellant argues evidence of force or fear was lacking.we disagree.appellant and roberto began their course of intimidation inside the restaurant.roberto approached mario,asked him what he was staring at,asked him what his problem was,and tried to scare him by invoking his crew name assassin kings.roberto and appellant then followed mario and his companions out of the restaurant and into the alley.in the alley roberto loudly announced assassin kings and then asked mario if he had any money.any reasonable person would recognize the request for money meant appellant and roberto intended to steal whatever money mario admitted having.when mario said he had no money,appellant tried to intimidate mario further by punching alex in the lip.mario responded by trying to protect alex from further assault by pulling alex behind him.fear for purposes of establishing the crime of robbery includes t he fear of an immediate and unlawful injury to the person or property of anyone in the company of the person robbed at the time of the robbery.
these combined actions are more than sufficient to establish the force or fear element for robbery,notwithstanding the fact there were two potential robbers and four potential victims.
even if the evidence is sufficient to establish an attempted robbery,appellant argues the evidence is nevertheless insufficient to show he aided and abetted the attempted robbery.again,we disagree.
there was some evidence appellant personally demanded money from mario.juan testified first roberto and then appellant asked mario if he had any money.however,even if juan testimony is insufficient to establish appellant was the direct perpetrator,there was substantial evidence he aided and abetted the attempted robbery.
all persons concerned in the commission of a crime,whether they directly commit the act constituting the offense,or aid and abet in its commission,are principals in any crime so committed,see people mendoza cal th,d,people prettyman cal th,d.thus,a person who aids and abets a crime is guilty of that crime even if someone else committed some or all of the criminal acts.ibid.
to prove that a defendant is an accomplice the prosecution must show that the defendant acted with knowledge of the criminal purpose of the perpetrator and with an intent or purpose either of committing,or of encouraging or facilitating commission of,the offense.people beeman cal d,italics in original.when the offense charged is a specific intent crime,the accomplice must share the specific intent of the perpetrator this occurs when the accomplice knows the full extent of the perpetrator criminal purpose and gives aid or encouragement with the intent or purpose of facilitating the perpetrator commission of the crime.ibid.people prettyman,supra,cal th at,d.
the objective facts create the reasonable inference appellant knew of roberto criminal intent to rob mario.appellant and roberto acted in a coordinated manner from the beginning.they followed the boys out of the restaurant and confronted them face to face together.if roberto did all the talking appellant was nevertheless nearby showing his support.after roberto loudly called out assassin kings he asked mario if he had any money.when appellant and roberto did not receive the desired response appellant punched mario friend alex in the lip.appellant then started pushing mario.appellant active involvement in assaulting the robbery victims tends to show appellant was aware roberto purpose for confronting the boys in the alley was to rob them.moreover,evidence of his own actions shows he gave aid with the intent or purpose of facilitating roberto commission of the robbery by attempting to force mario compliance through violence.
in short,the evidence of appellant own acts in attempting to force mario compliance with roberto demand is sufficient to find appellant was a principal in the attempted robbery.in essence,while roberto supplied the words,appellant applied the force in the robbery attempt.
ii.the evidence is insufficient to support the juvenile court finding appellant committed grand theft person.
appellant contends the record evidence is insufficient to support the court conclusion he committed grand theft person.
what otherwise would be petty theft because of the dollar value of the property taken is nevertheless grand theft if committed w hen the property is taken from the person of another.over years ago in people our supreme court noted some confusion in the authorities on the question as to whether the property must be actually on,or attached to,the person,or merely under the eye,or within the immediate reach,and so constructively within the control of the owner.the mcelroy court strictly construed the phrase from the person,and explained this element as follows w e think its obvious purpose was to protect persons and property against the approach of the,the,the jewel abstracter,and other thieves of like character who obtain property by similar means of stealth or fraud,and that it was in contemplation that the property shall at the time be in some way actually upon or attached to the person,or carried or held in actual physical as clothing,apparel,or ornaments,or things contained therein,or attached thereto,or property held or carried in the hands,or by other means,upon the person that it was not intended to include property removed from the person and laid aside,however immediately it may be retained in the presence or constructive control or possession of the owner while so laid away from his person and out of his hands 
the mcelroy court emphasized the legislature could not have intended the words from the person to have the same meaning as the phrase immediate presence in the definition of robbery.the court observed,had the legislature intended that the offense should include instances of property merely in the immediate presence,but not in the manual possession about the person,it would doubtless have so provided,as it has in defining robbery.robbery is defined as the felonious taking of personal property in the possession of another from his person or immediate presence,while the requirement of this offense is that it shall be taken from the person.
the mcelroy court explained the justifications for requiring a physical connection between the property stolen and the victim body to sustain a felony conviction for grand theft person.the stealing of property from the person has been from an early period under the english statutes treated as a much graver and more heinous offense than ordinary or common by reason of the ease with which it can be perpetrated and the difficulty of guarding against it,and partly because of the greater liability of endangering the person or life of the victim.the same general reason and purpose animate the modern statutes,including our own,and,as in england,the offense is made punishable as a felony.
in mcelroy,the evidence showed the defendant had taken money from the victim pants which were then rolled up and being used by the victim as a pillow.the mcelroy court reversed the defendant conviction for grand theft person because theft from the pants the victim laid aside,and which were not then literally on his person,did not constitute theft from his person 
most appellate decisions since mcelroy strictly adhere to the mcelroy directive of requiring a literal physical connection between the property taken and the victim person to sustain a conviction for grand theft person.for example,people involved the classic situation of a pickpocket.the court upheld a conviction for grand theft person although the victim was unaware his wallet was missing until he exited the streetcar.the evidence showed the defendant wore an overcoat with a slit in the outside pocket conveniently arranged so it would appear he had his hand in his own po
