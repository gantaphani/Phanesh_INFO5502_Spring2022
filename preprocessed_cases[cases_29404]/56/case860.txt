discussion 
sexual offender registration 
appellant argues that the juvenile court did not have the statutory authority to require him to register as a sex offender because sexual battery in violation of section,subdivision a is not included in the list of crimes contained in section,subdivision d.the attorney general acknowledges that sexual battery is not among the offenses listed in subdivision d of section,but asserts that the court had discretion to order registration pursuant to subdivision a e of this section.appellant responds that subdivision a e of section does not apply to juvenile wards.thus,resolution of the question whether the registration order is authorized turns on the scope of this subdivision.we have concluded that subdivision a e of section confers discretion on all criminal courts,including those hearing juvenile delinquency matters,to order a person to register as a sex offender if the offense was committed for sexual gratification or if it was the result of a sexual compulsion.
at the outset,we mention that it has been determined that the registration requirement imposed by section does not constitute punishment for purposes of ex post facto analysis under the federal and california constitutions citations it neither alters the definition of any crime nor increases the punishment for criminal acts,the legislature did not intend registration to constitute punishment,and it is not so punitive in nature and effect that it must be deemed punishment.people allen th,d people castellanos cal th,d.

subdivision a e was added to section as part of a group of amendments enacted in.stats,ch,west cal.legis.service.in its current form,this subdivision provides that any court may order a ny person to register pursuant to this section for any offense not included specifically in this section if the court finds at the time of conviction or sentencing that the person committed the offense as a result of sexual compulsion or for purposes of sexual gratification.the court shall state on the record the reasons for its findings and the reasons for requiring registration.prior to the addition of this subdivision,section did not contain a provision conferring discretion on the courts to order registration as a sexual offender.the registration requirement was based exclusively on commission of certain enumerated crimes.assem.com.on pub.safety,bill analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as proposed.
whether subdivision a e of section applies to juvenile wards is an issue of statutory interpretation.
in the case of a statute adopted by the legislature or the voters,we apply the following standard of review the fundamental purpose of statutory construction is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.citations.in order to determine this intent,we begin by examining the language of the statute.citations.but i t is a settled principle of statutory interpretation that language of a statute should not be given a literal meaning if doing so would result in absurd consequences which the legislature did not intend.citations.thus,t he intent prevails over the letter,and the letter will,if possible,be so read as to conform to the spirit of the act.citation.finally,we do not construe statutes in isolation,but rather read every s
