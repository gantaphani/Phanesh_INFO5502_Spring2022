kentron,a ward of the juvenile court welf,who had been placed in the camp community program,appeals from the order finding him in violation of probation,after which he was committed to the california youth authority.he was found to have violated the conditions of his probation following a contested hearing held upon the filing of a welfare and institutions code section hereafter section notice.we consider whether this finding of violation pursuant to section,as amended by proposition,may be sustained where the prosecution chose not to present any testimony and relied solely on the hearsay allegations in the section notice,even though there was no showing that some of the probation officers who allegedly observed misconduct were unavailable and other probation officers who allegedly observed misconduct were present in court.we conclude that the finding of violation must be reversed due to appellant hearsay objections.

when the section notice was filed and the matter set for a hearing,defense counsel requested that all the probation officers be present in court at the hearing,and he objected to the admission of the report in evidence.
at the hearing,after the juvenile court indicated that it had received the report of the probation officer,the prosecutor stated that she would submit for the violation on the report and that she had four probation officers from the camp,officers ely,nunez,bruce,and echeverria,available for cross on the issues in the report.
defense counsel objected,inter alia,on the ground that the contents of the section notice constituted inadmissible hearsay.citing people arreola cal th,d,he argued that admission of the report into evidence would deny appellant his federal and state constitutional rights to the witnesses against him.counsel argued that it should not be the defense burden to call any witnesses against the defendant.so our position at this time is that we object to the report and we are still ready to proceed with the case,although we are not going to call any witnesses at this time.when the court asked counsel whether he did not intend to the probation officers,counsel explained,my position would be that the defendant does not have the burden of calling or witnesses if sic the court or the prosecutor calls them we objecting to the report and not calling any witnesses.
the juvenile court overruled the defense objection and the report was admitted into evidence.no other evidence was offered by the prosecution.defense counsel did not the probation officers.appellant stepmother testified on appellant behalf,indicating that appellant had been born a crack baby,that he had been diagnosed as having attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and as being emotionally disturbed,and that he had to be constantly reminded of the rules.
the juvenile court found that appellant had violated the conditions of probation.following receipt of a day diagnostic study,the court ordered appellant committed to the california youth authority.
discussion 
appellant contends that he was denied his due process right to confront and witnesses to the alleged probation violations when the allegations of the section notice were admitted in lieu of the live testimony of percipient witnesses,and that because these statements were the only evidence offered by the prosecution,reversal of the order finding him in violation of probation is required.we agree.the evidence admitted here failed to satisfy the requirements of section,subdivision c.
section,subdivision c,as amended by proposition effective march,provides in pertinent part as follows the court may admit and consider reliable hearsay evidence at the hearing to the same extent that such evidence would be admissible in an adult probation revocation hearing,pursuant to the decision in people brown,d.and any other relevant provision of law.this represents a change from prior law,which held that,consistent with due process,hearsay evidence that was not subject to an established exception was inadmissible in section hearings involving misconduct not amounting to a crime,just as it was inadmissible in jurisdictional hearings on original petitions.in re antonio d,relying upon in re arthur cal d.
in people brown,supra,d.brown,an adult probation revocation case,a police officer testified regarding the findings by a chemist which indicated that the substance recovered from the defendant tested positive for grams of cocaine.the defendant claimed that the evidence was erroneously admitted because it violated his right to a witness and to have only reliable,nonhearsay testimony adduced against him.id.at.the brown court upheld the admission in evidence of the testimony regarding the chemist report.
quoting morrissey brewer,d,the brown court stated,t he revocation of parole is not part of a criminal prosecution and thus the full panoply of rights due a defendant in such a proceeding does not apply to parole revocations.brown,supra,d at.the brown court observed that the rules of evidence governing a probation revocation proceeding are relaxed.it warned,however,quoting people maki cal d,maki,that a court is not permitted to admit unsubstantiated or unreliable evidence as substantive evidence citations.to be admissible,hearsay testimony must bear a substantial degree of trustworthiness,which requires that it demonstrate sufficient indicia of reliability.citation.id.at.this determination is within the discretion of the trial court.ibid.the brown court found the evidence there admissible,stating,in the instant case,officer quinn testified that he routinely passed the confiscated substances on to the police chemist who subsequently conducted the test.we have no reason to believe the test results were anything but trustworthy and reliable as it is the regular business of the police laboratory to conduct such tests.moreover,the evidence presented at appellant hearing was corroborated by both the articles of cocaine paraphernalia seized at his arrest and the chemist case evidence disposition sheet.although officer quinn was not able to read one of the words on the back of the test envelope,he clearly and definitely stated that the sample tested positive for grams of cocaine.appellant did not introduce any evidence tending to contradict this,the dispositive part of the officer testimony.brown,supra,at,fn.omitted.
given the standard set forth in the amended section,we address appellant contention that he was denied due process by the admission of the allegations in the section notice as evidence against him in lieu of the testimony of the percipient witnesses.as indicated,section provides that the juvenile court may admit and consider reliable hearsay evidence pursuant to the decision in brown,supra,d.and any other relevant provision of law.this language is clear and unambiguous and needs no further explication.lungren deukmejian cal d.we are necessarily governed by the pronouncements of our supreme court and of the united states supreme court,which are certainly relevant provision s of law,in ruling on the admissibility of hearsay evidence at a section hearing.this is particularly so because brown considered the admissibility of documentary evidence,which differs from the type of evidence before us.in people arreola,supra,cal th,d,arreola,our supreme court distinguished hearsay which consists of such documents as laboratory reports,invoices or receipts,the type of evidence at issue in brown,from hearsay which takes the place of live testimony,and reiterated the principles governing the admissibility of the latter type of hearsay at probation revocation hearings.
in arreola,our supreme court most recent discussion of the admissibility of hearsay at a probation revocation hearing,the court considered the admissibility of the transcript of the defendant preliminary hearing held on the charges which were the basis for the alleged probation violation.the court found the preliminary hearing transcript to be inadmissible at the revocation hearing because there was no showing that the declarant was unavailable and no showing of other good cause.the court reaffirmed its earlier holding in people winson cal d,winson that due process compels a showing of unavailability or other good cause before hearsay in the form of prior testimony may be admitted.
the court commenced its discussion by reference to morrissey brewer,supra,d and gagnon scarpelli,d,the cases which set forth the procedural safeguards required by the federal constitution for revocation proceedings.arreola,supra,cal th at,d.in those cases,the united states supreme court held that,under the due process clause of the federal constitution,a defendant at a parole or probation revocation hearing generally has the right to confront and adverse witnesses unless the hearing officer specifically finds good cause for not allowing confrontation id.at,d.
the court in arreola pointed out that in people vickers cal d,it had concluded that although a summary revocation of probation may be based upon a probation officer report cal d at,thereafter the probationer must be afforded a morrissey hearing with its attendant due process protections.cal d at.arreola,supra,cal th at,d.
the court further pointed out that in winson,supra,cal d,it had followed morrissey brewer and gagnon scarpelli to hold that a preliminary hearing transcript of a witness testimony in a defendant related criminal case is not a proper substitute for the live testimony of the witness at defendant probation revocation hearing in the absence of the declarant unavailability or other good cause.winson,supra,at.the winson decision relied,in part,on ohio roberts,d,where the high court explained that the federal constitutional confrontation clause reflected a preference for confrontation of adverse witnesses,and made clear that i n the usual case including cases where prior has occurred,the pr
