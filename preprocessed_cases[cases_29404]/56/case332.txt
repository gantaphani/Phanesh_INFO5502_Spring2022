background 
mother and father two children,and,were the subjects of dependency petitions under section,subdivisions a and j,both filed july,an week old boy,was detained on the allegation he was discovered,while in the care of mother and father,to have multiple unexplained injuries that were highly suspicious trauma,a girl,was detained on the basis of the alleged abuse of.in a subsequent report,the agency stated neither parent was able to provide a feasible explanation for the injuries.the juvenile court detained the children,and a contested jurisdictional hearing was scheduled.a few days later,the agency filed an amended petition with respect to,adding allegations under section,subdivisions b and e similar to the existing allegations.
at the jurisdictional hearing,held six months after the children detention and conducted over several days of testimony,was described by a pediatrician as having suffered seven separate bone fractures prior to his detention,one to each leg,an arm,and four ribs.because some of the fractures showed evidence of healing at the time of discovery,the pediatrician concluded they were caused by two,three,or more separate incidents.the most recent fracture,a complete break of arm that left the bone in two pieces,occurred several days before was brought by his parents to the hospital for treatment.the injury would have been painful for both when it occurred and whenever his arm was later moved,since movement caused the broken ends of the fracture to grind against each other.as the pediatrician said,fractures are painful events and so clearly whoever was present at the time the fracture happened would have recognized that the child was in distress a nd by that,i mean crying and screaming and obviously being in pain.
in the six months after was detained,he had not suffered any further injuries,which tended to rule out disease or other organic causes for the fractures.tests also ruled out such problems.rather,the pediatrician concluded,the cause of the injuries was a series of aggressive violent acts directed towards the child.v ery,very,very few babies have any fractures.children this age with this many fractures are often dead because they been injured so severely.
mother testified that she and father lived together with and but were not married.on the day of detention,she and father had taken him to the hospital because he was unable to move his arm.prior to that date,mother had seen no indication that had been physically traumatized or had any broken bones.she said the handling and treatment of by father and had always been appropriate,and she and father had never left in the care of anyone else.mother denied causing the injuries herself.she was unable to explain injuries,other than possibly as a result of a congenital condition that she believed had affected her brother mistakenly believed,the testimony showed.
father had similarly never seen any sign of trauma in,prior to discovering the baby could not move his arm.father denied mistreating or mishandling father said he was a very strong person and engaged in physical play with,but nothing unusual had ever happened during their play.had never cried as a result of it.father was hampered in his handling of by a brace father wore on his hand at the time,but he had never heard cry out when he handled him.on the day they took to the hospital,had caught his arm in father brace,but did not react as though he had been injured.father had never seen mother hurt either or.he had no explanation for the injuries.
father acknowledged having reported mother to the police after she had repeatedly attacked him several years before,but he denied any other violence toward him by mother.father also acknowledged reacting very violently at the courthouse on the day of the detention hearing for and 
the commissioner found true the jurisdictional allegations against the parents,noting the section,subdivision b allegations of abuse had been proved by clear and convincing evidence.
in the dispositional report,the agency stated that mother was found to have committed battery while a juvenile,in addition to having been arrested for spousal abuse.she reported that her own father and mother,over the course of a custody dispute,were verbally and physically abusive towards each other and towards her,and she had spent many years in psychological treatment,although she claimed not to have been diagnosed with a mental disorder.father reported no history of abuse or counseling.both continued to deny any responsibility for injuries.the agency recommended the juvenile court deny reunification services,explaining b ased on the parents failure to acknowledge any responsibility for the abuse,there are no services that are likely to prevent.finding clear and convincing evidence,the court adopted the recommendation of the agency to deny reunification services to both parents.the court scheduled a permanency planning hearing pursuant to section.
in the report prepared for the section hearing,the agency recommended adoption by father parents as the permanent plan.the report attached an adoption assessment prepared by the agency that expanded on the information previously available about the family.drawing on existing agency records,the assessment said mother,as a child,lived in chaotic homes wherein domestic disputes and various forms of physical violence were common,including possible sexual abuse of mother.mother had a mutually violent relationship with her father and stepmother,with whom she lived.the incidents of violence grew in frequency and intensity as mother entered puberty.she finally moved from that home at age after a physical altercation in which mother injured her.mother was hospitalized for psychiatric treatment the following year following an escalation of physical altercations with her father.she later returned to live in her father home,but she was arrested for assault after another fight in which she injured him.she was then placed in a group home,where her violent conduct appeared to subside.
the adoption assessment described father erratic conduct on the day of the detention hearing,when he violently threatened various court and agency employees.at the time,mother was heard to say,he is always like this.following the jurisdictional hearing,father threatened suicide and was hospitalized.he was later arrested for threatening to kill mother and others during a violent confrontation.in a letter sent to the agency attorney,father stated he was ready to be a dad when was born and as a result made a mistake in handling father said he ha d some huge soul searching to do before attempting to care for children again.the assessment also noted that had told caregivers father is mean and yells and asked if they could talk to her parents about spanking because they always spank me and hurt me.
the assessment contained a description of one visit between and his parents.according to the notes of the social worker,father removed the infant from the carrier seat and hugged the infant tightly,approximately sec,began to scream loudly father bounced the infant harder and appeared to push the infant face into his shoulder.the visit supervisor offered to take after watching the father struggle for about min.mother had made many attempts to ask for the crying baby and father refused father placed the infant on a bean bag and directed mother to let the baby stay on the bag.father left the room,and the visit supervisor watched mother.stopped crying.after a few minutes mother talked and played with the child but the visit supervisor noticed mother did not pick up the child but she would grab the bean bag instead.soon mother pick ed up but just to reposition the child on the bean bag.when father returned to the room,he picked up,who immediately began to cry.when father mother took and comforted him,father turned red and refused to speak.father parents told the agency,the birth parents have an established history of volatile interactions with one another that is not healthy for the children to be around and that potentially puts the children at risk of further harm.the assessment concluded the parents do not demonstrate the personal stability needed to sustain safe,effective and nurturing interactions in a larger context.
on the eve of the section hearing,less than three months after the jurisdictional ruling,mother filed a motion pursuant to section for an order modifying the dispositional order to grant her reunification services.the motion was accompanied by a declaration stating that,since the dispositional hearing,mother had separated from father and obtained a domestic violence restraining order against him.she had also sought therapeutic services in an effort to better understand the of my relationship with father as well as made an attempt to better understand myself,consisting of five seeking safety classes,five of eight parenting classes,and two sessions with a counselor.according to her declaration,mother was still at a loss to explain what happened to,although she noted father admitted he was alone with when one of his injuries occurred.
mother testified at the hearing on her motion,held august,confirming the information contained in the declaration.mother said she believed no longer being in a relationship with father was better for the children.when asked to explain,she said,i believe that i can be a mom or a better mom just it hard to answer i think i can support my kids and everything on my own,and i do think i think that i can do it on my own.mother continued to profess ignorance about the source of injuries and said she would never believe that father harmed.she acknowledged obtaining the domestic violence restraining order,but she said the issues of father that motivated the restraining order arose after the agency detention of the children and as a result of the stress caused by it.mother further contended that,but for the agency intervention,father would have presented no risk to the children,saying,i f the kids were taken away in the first place,we would not be having the problems we have now.so honestly,if the agency never got involved,no,i do not have concerns about father treatment of the children.
when mother was asked what she would do differently in the future to protect the children,she described the lessons learned in the classes she was taking,what to look for if my children are ever being harmed and how to prevent it and what the steps are to prevent any kind of injuries happening on my children ever again.she also said she now had a bigger safety net of resources in the event she suspected abuse.
the juvenile court granted reunification services,explaining,the change in circumstances that i see is that the mother has obtained the restraining order.she appears to me to be making good progress in taking classes to better herself and become a responsible parent.and i think that at this stage of the proceedings reunification services for the mother are something that would very likely result in reunification.
ii.discussion 
both the agency and the children attorney have appealed the grant of reunification services to mother,contending the juvenile court finding of changed circumstances was not supported by substantial evidence and the grant of services was based on an incorrect legal standard.
the child dependency laws are designed to allow retention of parental rights to the greatest degree consistent with the child safety and welfare,and to return full custody and control to the parents or guardians if,and as soon as,the circumstances warrant.in re ethan cal th.to that end,the general rule is that when a dependent child is removed from the parent or guardian physical custody,child welfare services,including family reunification services,must be offered.id.at,subd.a.
notwithstanding this general rule,section,subdivision b lists a series of circumstances under which reunification services need not be provided to parents,referred to as a bypass of services.these comparatively extreme situations reflect the legislature desire to provide services to parents only where those services will facilitate the return of children to parental custody.citations.when the court determines a bypass provision applies,the general rule favoring reunification is replaced with a legislative presumption that reunification services would be an unwise use of governmental resources.in re allison th.
in initially bypassing reunification services to mother,the juvenile court relied on two section,subdivision b provisions.the first provision invoked by the court,subdivision b,applicable to,allows the juvenile court to deny services if it finds t hat the child was brought within the jurisdiction of the court under subdivision e of section because of the conduct of that parent or guardian.in turn,section,subdivision e grants jurisdiction when t he child is under the age of five years and has suffered severe physical abuse by a parent,or by any person known by the parent,if the parent knew or reasonably should have known that the person was physically abusing the child.pursuant to section,subdivision c,if a juvenile court finds the subdivision b circumstances to be supported by clear and convincing evidence,the juvenile court is prohibited from granting reunification services unless it finds that,based on competent testimony,those services are likely to prevent reabuse or continued neglect of the child or that failure to try reunification will be detrimental to the child because the child is closely and positively attached to that parent,subd.c,par.
the second provision invoked by the juvenile court in denying reunification services to the parents,applicable to,is section,subdivision b,which allows a court to deny reunification services upon finding t hat the child has been adjudicated a dependent pursuant to any subdivision of section as a result of severe sexual abuse or the infliction of severe physical harm to the child,a sibling,or a half sibling by a parent or guardian,and the court makes a factual finding that it would not benefit the child to pursue reunification services with the offending parent or guardian.reunification services can not be afforded to a parent who falls under subdivision b unless the court finds,by clear and convincing evidence,that reunification is in the best interest of the child,subd.c,par.in making this best interests determination,the juvenile court shall consider any information it deems relevant,including t he specific act or omission comprising the severe sexual abuse or the severe physical harm inflicted on the child or the child sibling or half sibling t he circumstances under which the abuse or harm was inflicted on the child or the child sibling or half sibling t he severity of the emotional trauma suffered by the child or the child sibling or half sibling a ny history of abuse of other children by the offending parent or guardian t he likelihood that the child may be safely returned to the care of the offending parent or guardian within months with no continuing supervision and w hether or not the child desires to be reunified with the offending parent or guardian,subd.i.when subdivision b applies,the juvenile court lacks the authority to order reunification unless it expressly makes the best interests finding by the requisite standard of proof.nicko
