eric dayshawn speight appeals from a judgment after a jury convicted him of two counts of premeditated,willful,and deliberate attempted murder and found true various enhancements.speight argues the following the prosecutor committed prejudicial misconduct when she misstated the law concerning homicide and the error was compounded by the trial court statements and omission of an instruction on the interaction between attempted murder and attempted voluntary manslaughter and his sentence was cruel and unusual punishment and he received ineffective assistance of counsel when defense counsel failed to object to part of his sentence 
as we explain below,we agree the trial court erred in instructing the jury but conclude speight was not prejudiced.with respect to his sentencing claim,we conclude defense counsel performance was deficient regarding sentencing.we affirm the judgment,reverse speight sentence,and remand the matter for a new sentencing hearing.
one evening in august,tonesha was at home in bed asleep with her boyfriend richard when her brother michael woke them and said year old speight and a few other men had jumped him.michael had visible injuries to his lip and forehead.over the course of the following week,tonesha called speight approximately times to learn why speight hit michael.tonesha was very angry with speight and she grew angrier when he avoided her calls.cherlyn,tonesha mother,tried to speak with speight mother concerning the incident without success.

during a hearing on the jury instructions,there was a discussion concerning the voluntary manslaughter instruction.speight defense counsel inquired whether the prosecutor and the trial court agreed the prosecutor was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt speight was not acting as a result of sudden quarrel or incorrect.the prosecutor agreed and indicated she thought it was addressed.counsel replied it was addressed in calcrim but was not sure if it was addressed in caljic.the parties discussed where the instruction would be located in caljic.after the court inquired about counsel concern,counsel explained the prosecutor had the affirmative burden of proving speight did not act in the heat of passion or imperfect.the court stated it was undoubtedly the prosecutor burden but it was unaware of any caljic instruction that made it a requirement and was unsure if one was necessary.counsel distinguished the situation where the jury acquits on the charged offense and proceeds with the lesser included offenses and this situation where the prosecutor was required to prove the lessers in order to establish the charged offense.counsel added,you ca instruct the jury that they do need to consider involuntary manslaughter only when they find him not guilty of attempt ed murder,they have to consider that along with it.counsel argued the proposed instructions did not make that clear to the jury and it lowered the prosecution burden of proof because it removed that issue from the jury.the court stated caljic general instruction on burden of proof and reasonable doubt adequately covered counsel concern.the court added it almost seems like you saying before she gets to the attempted voluntary manslaughter,it her burden of proof to establish he not guilty of attempted murder.that nonsensical.you could put in it her duty to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he is guilty of the charged crimes and he is guilty of the lesser included offenses.it her burden.it her burden.it her burden.counsel stated it was going to argue language taken directly from calcrim,that if the prosecutor did not meet its burden of proving speight did not act with heat or passion or in imperfect,the jury must acquit him of attempted murder.counsel and the court debated whether the proposed instructions adequately covered that principle.the prosecutor did not object during the argument.
as relevant here,the trial court instructed the jury with the following instructions caljic,attempted murder caljic,malice aforethought caljic,willful,deliberate,and premeditated attempted murder caljic,attempted voluntary manslaughter caljic sudden quarrel or heat of passion and provocation caljic,murder or manslaughter cooling period caljic,no specific emotion alone constitutes heat of passion caljic prior threats and assaults by victim caljic,presumption of innocence reasonable doubt burden of proof caljic,respective duties of judge and jury caljic,use of multiple verdict forms and caljic,conviction of lesser included offense.the court did not instruct the jury on the issue of the prosecution burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt an absence of heat of passion.
during closing argument,as relevant here,defense counsel argued tonesha,richard,and cherlyn were biased because all were angry at speight and they sanitized and minimized their own conduct.counsel argued tonesha and richard repeatedly threatened michael to the point where caruso,who was a gang member and knowledgeable about gangs,obtained a gun for michael to protect himself.counsel contended speight was not guilty of attempted murder because he did not intend to kill tonesha or richard.after detailing the numerous threats,counsel argued speight was provoked and he acted under the heat of passion.counsel argued the prosecutor had to prove there was either insufficient provocation or that the provocation never happened.counsel made the same argument regarding imperfect.counsel concluded speight did not intend to kill anyone.
during rebuttal argument,as relevant here,the prosecutor argued talked about heat of passion.now,what critical here and let me go back.in order to get to voluntary manslaughter,which i would suggest is not the option in this case,but in order to get to voluntary manslaughter,you would all have to agree that speight,when he chased after the victims and they are running for their lives and he shot them,you would have to all find him not guilty of attempted murder.defense counsel objected the prosecutor misstated the law.the court stated that when you get to it.you do get to the attempted voluntary manslaughter unless there a unanimous finding of not guilty to the attempt ed murder on any specific count.the jury instruction is caljic no.or caljic no.addressed that.but that the law.counsel began to say,the law is the prosecutor when the court interrupted and said,no,c ounsel,i said what the law is.if,in fact,the jurors believe there some confusion or dispute regarding the law,you follow the law in the jury instructions,not what anyone not what the attorneys tell you.you may proceed.the prosecutor continued with her rebuttal in order for you to get to even the lesser,which is voluntary manslaughter it a lesser necessary included offense you would have to all agree that speight is not guilty,or in addition to that,you would have to agree that the defense of heat of passion or the defense of he reasonably was in fear for his life,an actual but unreasonable,you have to find that in order for you to even get down to voluntary manslaughter.
the jury convicted speight of counts and and found true the accompanying enhancements,including that he was years of age or older at the time of the offenses.the jury acquitted him of count concerning bryant.
the trial court sentenced year old speight to prison as follows count an indeterminate term of seven years to life plus years to life for discharging a firearm plus a five year determinate term for inflicting great bodily injury and count an indeterminate term of seven years to life plus years to life for discharging a firearm.the court ordered the sentences on counts and to run consecutively because there were two victims.thus,the court sentenced speight to prison for a determinate term of five years plus years to life.
discussion 
jury instructions 
speight argues the prosecutor committed misconduct during rebuttal argument when she discussed the interaction between attempted murder and attempted voluntary manslaughter and the trial court reinforced the misstatement by agreeing the prosecutor statement was legally correct.noting the trial court instructed the jury with caljic and not calcrim,speight adds the court erred in failing to instruct the jury sua sponte the prosecution had the burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that speight did not act as a result of heat of passion.speight does not spend much time explaining how the court erred in failing to instruct the jury on that point.instead,speight asserts the alleged instructional error compounded the prejudice caused by the prosecutor and the court misstatements to the jury.
the attorney general first asserts the prosecutor did not misstate the law.recognizing caljic is a correct statement of law that would have provided the jury with the language speight asserts was improperly omitted,the attorney general nevertheless contends there was no prejudicial instructional error.the attorney general claims the other instructions properly informed the jury that to convict speight of murder,the prosecution had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt speight acted with malice aforethought,which necessarily meant the prosecution had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt speight did not act as a result of heat of passion.as we explain below,we agree the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury sua sponte with caljic.
attempted murder requires a direct but ineffectual act towards killing a person and the person harbored express malice aforethought.people houston cal th.attempted voluntary manslaughter is the unlawful killing of a person without malice.people avila cal th.attempted voluntary manslaughter is a lesser included offense of attempted murder.people beltran cal th,beltran.
the mens rea element required for murder is a state of mind constituting either express or implied malice.a person who kills without malice does not commit murder.heat of passion is a mental state that precludes the formation of malice and reduces an unlawful killing from murder to manslaughter.heat of passion arises if,at the time of the killing,the reason of the accused was obscured or disturbed by passion to such an extent as would cause the ordinarily reasonable person of average disposition to act rashly and without deliberation and reflection,and from such passion rather than from judgment.citation.heat of passion,then,is a state of mind caused by legally sufficient provocation that causes a person to act,not out of rational thought but out of unconsidered reaction to the provocation.while some measure of thought is required to form either an intent to kill or a conscious disregard for human life,a person who acts without reflection in response to adequate provocation does not act with malice.beltran,supra,cal th at,fn.omitted.
this authority establishes that to prove the defendant guilty of attempted murder,the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt among other things,the defendant acted with malice aforethought.to determine whether the defendant acted with malice aforethought,the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt,where heat of passion is at issue based on the state of the evidence,the defendant did not act as a result of heat of passion.assuming the prosecution met its burden on this element,and attempted murder other elements,the defendant is guilty of attempted murder.if,however,the prosecution fails to establish beyond a reasonable doubt the defendant did not act as a result of heat of passion,the prosecution fails its burden and the defendant is guilty of attempted voluntary manslaughter.people rios cal th,rios mitigating circumstance of heat of passion reduce s an intentional,unlawful killing from murder to voluntary manslaughter by negating the element of malice that otherwise inheres in such a homicide.thus,when attempted murder and attempted voluntary manslaughter heat of passion are before the jury,there is interaction between the two offenses.
speight relies on this interaction to argue t he prosecutor misstated the law when she stated that in order to even consider the lesser included offense of attempted voluntary manslaughter,the members of the jury had to first find him not guilty of attempted murder.it is of course improper for the prosecutor to misstate the law and particularly to absolve the prosecution from proving beyond a reasonable doubt all elements of a charged offense.people marshall cal th.we do not,however,read the prosecutor statements to forbid the jury from considering attempted voluntary manslaughter until they concluded he was not guilty of attempted murder.nor do we read her statements as an attempt to somehow lessen her burden of proof.read in their totality,we conclude the prosecutor simply informed the jury that to convict speight of attempted voluntary manslaughter it had to first conclude he was not guilty of attempted murder.
additionally,the trial court properly instructed the jury with caljic concerning how the jury should approach deliberations on lesser included offenses and that it could not accept a verdict on a lesser crime until the jury acquitted on the charged crime,and caljic,concerning how the jury was to complete the verdict forms.the jury had a written copy of all the instructions during deliberations.it is well settled that if anything counsel says during argument conflicts with the trial court jury instructions,the jury must follow the court instructions.people sisneros th.the trial court here instructed the jury with that legal requirement and any misstatement was remedied by the court instructions.caljic.we turn now to speight claim the trial court erred in instructing the jury.
w here the defendant killed intentionally and unlawfully,evidence of heat of passion,or of an actual,though unreasonable,belief in the need for,is relevant only to determine whether malice has been established,thus allowing a conviction of murder,or has not been established,thus precluding a murder conviction and limiting the crime to the lesser included offense of voluntary manslaughter.indeed,in a murder case,unless the people own evidence suggests that the killing may have been provoked or in honest response to perceived danger,it is the defendant obligation to proffer some showing on these issues sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt of his guilt of murder.citations.if the issue of provocation or imperfect is thus properly presented in a murder case mullaney wilbur,mullaney,the people must prove beyond reasonable doubt that these circumstances were lacking in order to establish the murder element of malice.citations.california standard jury instructions have long so provided.citation.in such cases,if the fact finder determines the killing was intentional and unlawful,but is not persuaded beyond reasonable doubt that provocation or imperfect was absent,it should acquit the defendant of murder and convict him of voluntary manslaughter.citations.rios,supra,cal th at.
of course,in a murder trial,the court,on its own motion,must fully instruct on every theory of a lesser included offense,such as voluntary manslaughter,that is supported by the evidence.citation.hence,where the evidence warrants,a murder jury must hear that provocation or imperfect negates the malice necessary for murder and reduces the offense to voluntary manslaughter.rios,supra,cal th at,fn.
as relevant here,the trial court instructed the jury that to convict speight of attempted murder,it had to find he acted with express malice aforethought caljic as defined caljic.the court also instructed the jury with caljic,willful,deliberate,and premeditated attempted murder.that instruction,after providing the definitions for willful,deliberate,and premeditated,provides,if you find that the attempted murder was preceded and accompanied by a clear,deliberate intent to kill,which was the result of deliberation and premeditation,so that it must have been formed upon reflection and not under a sudden heat of passion or other condition precluding the idea of deliberation,it is attempt to commit willful,deliberate,and premeditated murder.italics added.the instruction also provided,the people have the burden of proving the truth of this allegation.if you have a reasonable doubt that it is true,you must find it to be not true.
the trial court instructed the jury on attempted voluntary manslaughter with caljic,as follows every person who unlawfully attempts without malice aforethought to kill another human being is guilty of the crime of attempted voluntary manslaughter in violation of sections and,subdivision a,a crime.voluntary manslaughter is the unlawful killing of a human being without malice aforethought.there is no malice aforethought if the attempted killing occurred upon a sudden quarrel or heat of passion or in the actual but unreasonable belief in the necessity to defend oneself or another person against imminent peril to life or great bodily injury.in order to prove this crime,each of the following elements must be proved.a direct but ineffectual act was done by one person towards killing another human being and.that person had the specific intent to kill another person and.the actions taken to kill were unlawful.in deciding whether a direct but ineffectual act was committed,it is necessary to distinguish between mere preparation,on the one hand,and the actual commencement of the doing of the criminal deed,on the other.mere preparation,which may consist of planning the killing or devising,obtaining or arranging the means for its commission,is not sufficient to constitute an attempt.however,acts of a person who intends to kill another person will constitute an attempt where those acts clearly indicate a certain,unambiguous intent to kill.the acts must be an immediate step in the present execution of the killing,the progress of which would be completed unless interrupted by some circumstances not intended in the original design.an attempt to kill is lawful if done in lawful or defense of others.
here,the trial court properly instructed the jury on the lesser included offense of attempted voluntary manslaughter.however,the court did not instruct the jury the prosecution had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that speight did not act as a result of heat of passion.that was error.
the attorney general does not dispute,and we agree,the record includes sufficient evidence from which the jury could reasonably conclude speight was provoked and he acted as a result of heat of passion.tonesha admitted she called speight times over the course of about four days,conduct that can not be described as anything but harassing.speight testified that during at least two of those telephone calls,tonesha threatened to kill everyone in his house.he also testified that a few days before the incident,tonesha and richard went to his house where richard tried to hit him.on that occasion,richard told speight that he was a member of a bloods gang speight believed to be particularly violent.later that night,someone threw a brick through speight window.speight mother testimony corroborated the vandalism to her home.speight repeatedly testified he was scared because he believed richard was a gang member.
on the day of the incident,speight stated there was a man outside his house angrily yelling at him to come outside and fight.speight stated the man made a gesture with his hand simulating a gun and when the man turned and walked towards his car,speight thought the man was getting a gun from his car.speight stated that when he went inside to get his gun,he heard his friend yell they were jumping butler,his aunt.speight explained he went outside and started firing his gun with the intent to scare them and he blacked out as he had in the past when he becomes scared.without expressing any opinion on the likelihood of success of this defense,the record certainly includes sufficient evidence that could support speight claim he was provoked and acted as a result of heat of passion.thus,the trial court properly instructed the jury with caljic.people gutierrez th,victim must cause provocation and provocation caused ordinary person to act rashly or without due caution and circumspection.but the trial court fell short in its duty to instruct the jury completely on this theory.
caljic in relevant part provides the distinction between murder and manslaughter is that murder requires malice while manslaughter does not.when the act causing the death,though unlawful,is done in the heat of passion or is excited by a sudden quarrel that amounts to adequate provocation,or in the actual but unreasonable bel
