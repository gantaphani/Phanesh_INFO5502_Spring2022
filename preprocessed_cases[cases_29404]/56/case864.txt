discussion 
in the legislature enacted the sexually violent predators act svp act,which is codified in section et.stats,ch.similar legislation has appeared throughout the country.constitutional challenges to the svp act have reached both the california supreme court and the united states supreme court.these decisions have established constitutional limitations on civil commitment statutes,such as section et.
we are presented here with due process and equal protection challenges to section as a result of the principles pronounced in the svp act cases.our analysis begins with a review of the relevant civil commitment statutes.
the svp act provides for the involuntary civil commitment of certain offenders.an offender is eligible for commitment as an svp if he or she has been convicted of sexually violent offenses as defined in section,subd.a against two or more victims,and he or she has a diagnosed mental disorder that makes the person a danger to the health and safety of others in that it is likely that he or she will engage in sexually violent behavior,subd.a.a diagnosed mental disorder is defined as a congenital or acquired condition affecting the emotional or volitional capacity that predisposes the person to the commission of criminal sexual acts in a degree constituting the person a menace to the health and safety of others,subd.c.
the mentally disordered offender act mdo act,et is a civil commitment statute that also applies to certain offenders about to be released on parole.an offender is eligible for commitment under the mdo act if all of the following are met he or she has a severe mental disorder that is not in remission or can not be kept in remission without treatment,subd.a the disorder must have been one of the causes of or was an aggravating factor in the commission of a crime for which the prisoner was sentenced to prison,subd.b he or she has been in treatment for the severe mental disorder for days or more within the year prior to the release date,subd.c before his or her parole or release,the treating physician and other specified medical authorities certify that each of the noted conditions exist,and because of the disorder the offender represents a substantial danger of physical harm to others,subd.d and the crime for which the prisoner was sentenced to prison was punished by a determinate sentence under penal code section,subd.e and is specifically listed in the mdo act,subd.e a q.
the act lps act et is a comprehensive scheme designed to address a variety of circumstances in which a member of the general population may need to be evaluated or treated for different lengths of time.cooley superior court cal th,d.a person who,as a result of mental disorder,is a danger to others,or to himself or herself,or gravely disabled,may be taken into custody and placed in a designated facility for varying periods,depending on the circumstances.
section et provides for the civil commitment of individuals under the control of the cya.the scheme provides that if the youthful offender parole board yopb determines that discharge of a person from the cya would be physically dangerous to the public because of the person mental or physical deficiency,disorder,or abnormality,the yopb may request that a petition be filed seeking continued commitment of the person.ibid.
sections,and were added by statute in.stats,ch.section was added by statute in.stats,ch.these statutes have been amended infrequently some,if not most,of the amendments were in response to constitutional challenges to other civil commitment statutes unfortunately,the most recent amendments have not kept pace with current constitutional pronouncements on civil commitment statutes.
as stated above,enactment of the svp act generated considerable litigation.kansas sexually violent predator act the kansas act,similar to the svp act people williams cal th,d,williams,was challenged on substantive due process grounds in kansas hendricks,d hendricks.hendricks was a pedophile who admittedly had trouble controlling his urge to molest children when he became stressed out.id.at.the kansas act defined a sexually violent predator as any person who has been convicted of or charged with a sexually violent offense and who suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder which makes the person likely to engage in the predatory acts of sexual violence.citation.a mental abnormality was defined,in turn,as a congenital or acquired condition affecting the emotional or volitional capacity which predisposes the person to commit sexually violent offenses in a degree constituting such person a menace to the health and safety of others.citation.id.at.
the kansas supreme court invalidated the kansas act,concluding it violated hendricks right to due process because the statute definition of mental abnormality did not satisfy the constitutional requirement that civil commitment statutes be limited to those individuals who have a mental illness.hendricks,supra,at.
the united states supreme court acknowledged that states have in certain narrow circumstances provided for the forcible civil detainment of people who are unable to control their behavior and who thereby pose a danger to the public health and safety.citations.we have consistently upheld such involuntary commitment statutes,provided the confinement takes place pursuant to proper procedures and evidentiary standards.citations.a finding of dangerousness,standing alone,is ordinarily not a sufficient ground upon which to justify indefinite involuntary commitment.we have sustained civil commitment statutes when they have coupled proof of dangerousness with the proof of some additional factor,such as a mental illness or mental abnormality.citations.these added statutory requirements serve to limit involuntary civil confinement to those who suffer from a volitional impairment rendering them dangerous beyond their control.hendricks,supra,at.the supreme court concluded that the kansas act satisfied the above requirements and did not violate hendricks right to equal protection.id.at.the supreme court also held the kansas act was a civil commitment statute that did not implicate either ex post facto or double jeopardy principles.id.at.
the supreme court revisited the kansas act in kansas crane,d crane.the kansas supreme court vacated crane commitment as a sexually violent predat
