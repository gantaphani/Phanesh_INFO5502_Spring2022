minor was detained at birth by alameda county social services agency agency after she tested positive for cocaine.as a basis for jurisdiction,the agency alleged mother mother abused drugs,preventing her from caring properly for the minor,and mother and the minor alleged father,appellant father,had engaged in domestic violence and had criminal histories.the juvenile court sustained all of the jurisdictional allegations and detained the minor.father contends the jurisdictional findings involving his conduct should be vacated because they were not supported by substantial evidence,but he does not challenge the validity of the jurisdictional finding based on mother drug abuse.because father contentions,even if accepted,would not justify a reversal of the court jurisdictional ruling or the grant of any other effective relief,we decline to address them and dismiss the appeal.
background 
the minor was the subject of a dependency petition under welfare and institutions code section,subdivisions b and g,filed november,under subdivision b,the petition alleged the minor tested positive for cocaine at birth and mother had a history of drug abuse that limited her ability to care for the minor.in addition,it alleged she had reported episodes of domestic violence between herself and father,and both had criminal histories.the minor was detained and placed in foster care,and a paternity test was ordered for father.
the agency jurisdictional report noted mother had admitted using crack cocaine prior to giving birth to the minor.she gave birth at home,apparently without proper prenatal care,and had made no provision for the minor care.mother had been in and out of drug treatment for the last years,and her two earlier children both resided with their fathers.father had custody of one of those children,an older sister of the minor.during a meeting with the agency,father acknowledged he and mother had fights,and mother told the agency father was verbally abusive and had committed domestic violence.based on the tone of father remarks to mother during this meeting,the agency social worker concluded they were in a domestic violent relationship.father arrest record revealed aliases and social security numbers.he had been arrested for battery against a cohabitant in,resisting an officer in,theft in,and several drug and theft charges in and.
at the contested jurisdictional hearing,the social worker confirmed father told her he was arrested for battery in after he and mother got into a fight.during the meeting at which this disclosure was made,the social worker observed father make demeaning remarks to mother and raise his voice,leading her to characterize his conduct as emotionally and psychologically abusive.she found h is tone and the manner in which he spoke to mother shocking.
father testified he had known mother for about or years and believed he was the minor biological father he denied ever being abusive to mother.he said the arrest for battery was based on her false statement to police he had hit her and pointed out no charges were filed in connection with the arrest.he also denied demeaning or otherwise mistreating mother at the meeting with the agency.although father acknowledged having been criminally convicted a few times when i was younger,he claimed his most recent arrest,before the arrest,was in.
mother acknowledged using crack cocaine,testifying she had relapsed seven months into her pregnancy with the minor.with respect to father,she testified that over the course of their year acquaintance,she periodically had occasion to fear him.he would call her names and intimidate her with forceful and demanding words.they just put me in a certain feeling,you know,a feeling of fear.on three occasions,she had called police when he refused to leave her home.mother was also reluctant to cross father,since she depended upon him for access to the daughter of whom he had custody.
without explanation,the juvenile court found true all of the petition allegations under section,subdivision b.by the time of the dispositional hearing,mother was participating in a residential drug treatment program.the court placed the minor in mother custody,ordered reunification services for mother,and granted visitation to father.
ii.discussion 
father contends the juvenile court jurisdictional findings involving his conduct were unsupported because there was no evidence his conduct presented a substantial risk to the minor.the agency urges us to dismiss the appeal,arguing it fails to raise a justiciable issue because father has not challenged all of the jurisdictional findings.because we agree with the agency this appeal does not raise a justiciable issue,we do not reach the merits of father contention.
justiciability doctrine 
it is a fundamental principle of appellate practice that an appeal will not be entertained unless it presents a justiciable issue,costa serena owners coalition costa serena architectural com.th,costa serena.the justification for this doctrine,which in general terms requires an appeal to concern a present,concrete,and genuine dispute as to which the court can grant effective relief,is well explained by wright and miller hornbook of federal practice the central perception is that courts should not render decisions absent a genuine need to resolve a real dispute.unnecessary decisions dissipate judicial energies better conserved for litigants who have a real need for official assistance.as to the parties themselves,courts should not undertake the role of helpful counselors defendants,moreover,should not be forced to bear the burdens of litigation without substantial justification perhaps more importantly,decisions involve lawmaking.courts worry that unnecessary lawmaking should be avoided,both as a matter of defining the proper role of the judiciary in society and as a matter of reducing the risk that premature litigation will lead to adjudication.wright,et,federal practice and procedure ed,at,fns.omitted.
the many aspects of the justiciability doctrine in california were summarized in wilson county civil service com.d a judicial tribunal ordinarily may consider and determine only an existing controversy,and not a moot question or abstract proposition as a general rule it is not within the function of the court to act upon or decide a moot question or speculative,theoretical or abstract question or proposition,or a purely academic question,or to give an advisory opinion on such a question or proposition id.at.an important requirement for justiciability is the availability of effective relief that is,the prospect of a remedy that can have a practical,tangible impact on the parties conduct or legal status.it is this court duty to decide actual controversies by a judgment which can be carried into effect,and not to give opinions upon moot questions or abstract propositions,or to declare principles or rules of law which can not affect the matter in issue in the case before it.costa serena,supra,th at see also in re anna th,a case is moot when it is impossible for the appellate court to grant the appellant effective relief simi garamendi th,a case becomes moot when a court ruling can have no practical impact or can not provide the parties with effective relief.when the court can not grant effective relief to the parties to an appeal,the appeal must be dismissed.costa serena,at.
dependency jurisdiction 
although father appeal was taken from the court dispositional order,he does not question that order.rather,he characterizes his appeal as challenging the juvenile court jurisdictional order as explained below,however,an examination of the juvenile court dependency jurisdiction demonstrates the issues raised in his appeal present no genuine challenge to the court assumption of dependency jurisdiction.as a result,any order we enter will have no practical impact on the pending dependency proceeding,thereby precluding a grant of effective relief.for that reason,we find father appeal to be nonjusticiable.
