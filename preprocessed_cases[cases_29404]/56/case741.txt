maurice appeals from an order of the juvenile court in proceedings under welfare and institutions code section adjudging him to be a ward of the court.he asserts that the order must be reversed because the juvenile court improperly continued the jurisdictional hearing beyond the statutory time limit.we affirm.
background 
on october,a petition was filed alleging that on september,maurice committed attempted second degree robbery,subd.c.maurice was taken into custody on september,and on october was ordered detained for not more than judicial days.the jurisdictional hearing commenced on october,when the victim testified.the victim was able to identify two of the boys who had attacked him,but did not identify maurice.after the victim testimony,the court stated,let then discuss what we going to do next.you have two to three witnesses,jhin the prosecutor is that right the prosecutor responded,that correct and the court added,and pursuant to our discussions,you released the two officers is that right the prosecutor stated that one officer was available to testify the following day,but that another was not.the prosecutor stated,detective sappal is unavailable tomorrow due to the fact that his wife just had a baby in the past couple of days,and he is watching the baby.he found alternate child care for today because i told him it was an absolute emergency,and he simply stated he would not be available at all tomorrow.he will be available starting next monday.the court then continued the hearing without objection to the following day for the other officer and maurice mother to testify.after the two additional witnesses testified on october,at the request of the district attorney but over maurice objection,the court again continued the hearing,to october,finding that there was good cause for the continuance because the second police officer was still unavailable.on october,the court sustained the petition.at the disposition hearing on november,the court adjudged maurice to be a ward of the court and ordered him committed to a county institution for days,with credit for days served in juvenile hall.maurice timely appealed.
discussion 
maurice contends that the juvenile court violated his statutory right to a jurisdictional hearing within judicial days of his detention order and argues that the error requires reversal.section,subdivision a provides that i n the case of a minor detained in custody at the time of the filing of the petition,the petition must be set for hearing within judicial days from the date of the order of the court directing such detention.california rules of court,rule b reiterates this time limit,providing that i f the child is detained,the jurisdiction hearing on the petition shall begin within judicial days from the date of the order of the court directing detention.
a jurisdictional hearing may be continued only upon a showing of good cause and only for that period of time shown to be necessary,subd.b rule a.rule is entitled grounds for continuance of jurisdiction hearing.subdivision a of that rule provides,in accordance with section,subdivision a,that a continuance shall be granted only on a showing of good cause and only for the time shown to be necessary.that subdivision concludes,absent a waiver of time,a child may not be detained beyond the statutory time limits.subdivisions b,c and d of the rule provide specific grounds for which a court may or must continue a jurisdiction hearing to allow the minor to prepare for the hearing to allow the petitioner to subpoena witnesses where the minor has made an admission and then denies it or indicated an intent to admit the allegations and then denies them or the minor and parent consent.
maurice argues that the jurisdictional hearing was continued beyond the limitation,so that the subsequent orders must be reversed and the petition dismissed.in his opening brief on appeal,maurice challenged two continuance orders one setting the jurisdictional hearing to commence on october when he had been in custody since september,and the second continuing the hearing from october to october.in response to the attorney general argument,his reply brief prudently discards the first contention.the period prescribed in both the statute and the rule of court is judicial,days on which court is required to be in session,which excludes saturdays,sundays and legal the period begins to run not from the date of arrest but from the date of the order of the court directing detention,subd.a.maurice detention hearing was held on october,when the detention order was issued,and the commencement of the jurisdiction hearing on october was only judicial days later,well within the permissible time period.
at least four questions are presented,however,with respect to maurice challenge to the second continuance.initially,there are two questions not addressed in the briefs of either party.since the hearing was timely commenced on october,it would be plausible to read the statute and the rule as satisfied,regardless of whether there was good cause for delaying the completion of the hearing to october,which was the judicial day after october.section provides only that the petition must be set for hearing within the period,and rule b requires only that the jurisdictional hearing begin within court days.if the jurisdictional hearing is not commenced within days and the period is not tolled for the minor failure to appear,the minor is entitled to be released from custody.citation.if the minor is released,the petition may be reset for hearing within the time prescribed for cases of nondetained minors.citations.if the jurisdictional hearing is not commenced and the minor is not released at the expiration of the period,the petition must be dismissed,unless the hearing is continued pursuant to current rule.in re edwayne d,italics added.clearly these provisions do not require that the jurisdictional hearing be completed within days of the detention order.hearings begun within the day period undoubtedly may proceed from day to day until completed without fear of violating this time limit.nonetheless,that is not what occurred here.the interruption of the hearing to await an absent witness might well be characterized as a continuance which is permissible only if authorized by section,subdivision b and rule.jeff superior court th,d accordingly,we order the juvenile court to conduct trial every court day,all day,without further continuances in the absence of good cause,until trial is concluded and the matter is fully adjudicated.since the parties have not addressed this question,we shall not base our decision upon it.without deciding the issue,we shall assume with the parties that the continuance to october comes within the scope of these provisions.
the second issue not addressed by the parties is that rule unequivocally provides that the minor may not be detained beyond the limit absent a time waiver by the minor.no such waiver appears in the record.however,maurice does not refer to or base his argument upon this provision limiting the period of detention.his argument is that the court was not authorized to continue the hearing,not that he was detained longer than permitted.since maurice failed to seek immediate writ relief from his extended detention,as he might have done see superior court th,d,the propriety of having kept maurice at juvenile hall until october is now moot.
assuming that the october order continuing the hearing to october was permissible only if authorized by section and rule,the parties disagree about the proper interpretation of these provisions.as noted above,both provide that a continuance shall be granted only on a showing of good cause and only for the time shown to be necessary.maurice argues preliminarily that section,subdivision a requires a written notice of a motion for a continuance to be served and filed at least two court days before the hearing sought to be continued,and that no such notice was given here.however,subdivision c of section and subdivision a of rule permit a motion to be made without complying with these requirements upon a showing of good cause for the failure to comply.here,the rea
