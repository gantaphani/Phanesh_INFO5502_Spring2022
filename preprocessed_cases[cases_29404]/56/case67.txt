at approximately on august,metro nashville police department mnpd officer jamie scruggs was on patrol in north nashville when he saw a white chevrolet lumina matching the description of a vehicle that had reportedly been involved in an earlier incident.officer scruggs followed the vehicle and radioed two other mnpd officers,sharraff mallery and wayne fisher,who were in the area.mallery and fisher followed the vehicle and,after the suspect driver parked the car,a chase on foot ensued.
mallery pursued crowell,who was the driver of the chevrolet,and his passenger,an unidentified person who was never captured,through a local public housing project.mallery testified that during the chase he saw crowell holding onto the waistband of his pants with his right hand which,in his experience,often indicated that a person was carrying a gun.mallery further testified that he saw crowell retrieve a silver object,at which point he radioed that the defendant had a gun when mallery saw crowell throw the gun into a nearby bush,he was approximately five to ten feet behind crowell.in his testimony,mallery emphasized his certainty that crowell discarded a gun and that no one else was observed in the area where the gun was recovered.mallery continued to chase crowell across the street,where after a brief struggle,he took the defendant into custody.at that point,fisher arrived on the scene and mallery directed fisher to the roughly feet mallery had seen crowell throw the gun.fisher proceeded to the bush and retrieved the gun,later identified as a ruger semiautomatic handgun the gun was retrieved roughly thirty seconds to a minute after crowell was apprehended.
fisher testified that he too witnessed crowell discard the gun.according to fisher,he was running in an attempt to cut off crowell escape when he saw the defendant pull a gun from his waistband and throw it to the ground.fisher testified that he was approximately thirty to forty feet from crowell at the time and that he had no difficulty whatsoever seeing crowell discard the gun.
at trial,crowell testified that,contrary to mallery testimony,mallery lost sight of crowell during the chase.crowell asserted that he ran from the police only because he was on parole.according to crowell,the officers never saw him with a gun but instead charged him with possession because he was the only person apprehended.defense witness terica green,a friend of crowell cousin,testified that she was standing across the street when she saw another unidentified man run out of a building,along with crowell and a police officer.according to green,it was this man,not crowell,who dropped the gun.green did not come forward with this information for almost three years after crowell arrest.
on june,a jury found crowell guilty of being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of g.at his sentencing hearing,crowell denied the existence of a juvenile conviction for aggravated robbery the government responded by presenting written proof of crowell juvenile adjudication along with the testimony of the detective who prosecuted crowell on the charge.the district court concluded that the government had carried its burden for proving the existence of the juvenile conviction.including this conviction,the court found that crowell had three prior convictions for violent felonies and therefore qualified as an armed career criminal pursuant to e.the court also concluded that using crowell juvenile conviction as an acca predicate was not a violation of due process.
the court found crowell to have an offense level of and a criminal history category of vi,resulting in a guidelines range of to months.the court denied crowell motion for a downward departure based on his diminished capacity and sentenced crowell to months imprisonment.
crowell contends that the evidence presented at trial was constitutionally insufficient to support his conviction as a felon in possession of a firearm.in reviewing a sufficiency of the evidence claim,this court considers whether,after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.united states copeland,cir internal quotation marks omitted.it is not necessary that circumstantial evidence remove every reasonable hypothesis except that of guilt.united states stone,cir.in assessing the sufficiency of the evidence,this court do es not weigh the evidence,assess the credibility of the witnesses,or substitute our judgment for that of the jury.united states jackson,cir internal quotation marks omitted.further,this court makes all reasonable inferences and credibility decisions in support of the jury verdict.united states hughes,cir.
to obtain a conviction pursuant to g,the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant has a prior conviction for a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year that the defendant thereafter knowingly possessed the firearm and ammunition specified in the indictment and that the possession was in or affecting interstate commerce.united states schreane,cir internal quotation marks omitted.crowell challenges only the element of possession.
crowell asserts that a lthough the government two law enforcement witnesses were unwavering that the defendant had a firearm and threw it into the bushes while fleeing from the police,the defense proof contradicted this evidence.crowell cites only his own testimony and that of green,who testified that she observed a little dude drop the gun in the bushes,not crowell.however,crowell provides no support for his assertion that the existence of any evidence to the contrary renders a conviction constitutionally deficient.the government presented ample evidence establishing that crowell knowingly possessed the firearm in question.in their trial testimony,mallery and fisher both conveyed their complete confidence in having seen the defendant discard the gun in the nearby bushes.both officers were near the defendant at the time and their views were unobstructed.mallery testimony was substantiated by the radio transmission,made contemporaneously with the event,in which he reported that crowell had thrown a gun while fleeing.both officers identified the gun at trial and crowell as the person who discarded the gun.finally,mallery testified that,after his arrest,crowell made the statement that the gun in question was a nice nine millimeter.
after hearing testimony from the officers at the scene of the arrest,the jury made the decision to credit this testimony over that of the contradictory testimony proffered by crowell and green.review of the record reveals nothing that indicates this decision was in error.because a rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that crowell possessed the firearm in question,we find that sufficient evidence was presented at trial to support crowell conviction as a felon in possession of a firearm.
crowell contests the existence of an april juvenile court adjudication that,along with two other convictions,established that crowell was an armed career criminal under e.crowell denied the existence of the juvenile adjudication at his sentencing hearing and now asserts that a document indicating that h
