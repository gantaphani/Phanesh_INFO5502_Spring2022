the united states petitions for a writ of mandamus under the all writs act,a in its petition,the government challenges various rulings of the united states court of federal claims in the case of scholl united states.all proceedings in the court of federal claims have been stayed pending our consideration of the petition.
this case involves a suit,purportedly under the tucker act,a,by david scholl,a former bankruptcy judge of the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania.in his suit,scholl alleges that the denial of his reappointment as a bankruptcy judge by the united states court of appeals for the third circuit was in violation of his right to due process under the fifth amendment to the constitution and certain regulations relating to the reappointment of bankruptcy judges that have been promulgated by the judicial conference of the united states.
because the court of federal claims should not have exercised jurisdiction over scholl suit and because the requirements for the writ of mandamus are met,we grant the government petition for a writ of mandamus and direct the court to dismiss scholl complaint.
background 
in each federal judicial district,the bankruptcy judges in regular active service constitute a unit of the district court known as the bankruptcy court for that district.in each district,bankruptcy judges are appointed by a majority of the active judges of the circuit court of appeals in which the district is located.id.a.each appointment is for a term of fourteen years.id.section of the federal court improvement act of,stat,codified as a note to section,provides that w hen filling vacancies,the court of appeals may consider reappointing incumbent bankruptcy judges under procedures prescribed by regulations issued by the judicial conference of the united states.the judicial conference of the united states the judicial conference is the statutorily created body of federal judges that establishes policy for the administration of the judicial branch.williams united states,citing.the judicial conference is composed of the chief justice of the united states,the chief judge of each judicial circuit,the chief judge of the court of international trade,and a district judge from each judicial circuit.the third circuit generally follows the judicial conference regulations,although it has never formally adopted them.
in,the year in which scholl was denied reappointment,sections b and c of chapter of the judicial conference regulations provided 
b the court of appeals will decide whether or not to reappoint the incumbent judge.in making this decision,the court of appeals shall take into consideration the professional and career status of the incumbent.reappointment should not be denied unless the incumbent has failed to perform the duties of a bankruptcy judge according to the high standards of performance regularly met by united states bankruptcy judges.
c if the court of appeals determines by majority vote of the active judges of that court that the incumbent bankruptcy judge appears to merit reappointment,the court shall follow the procedures set forth in following sections and.
section of the regulations provided that,if the court of appeals determined that an incumbent bankruptcy judge who was willing to be reappointed appeared to merit reappointment,the circuit executive of the court would cause to be published a public notice stating that the court was considering the judge for reappointment and inviting comments from members of the bar and the public.section of the regulations dealt with the process by which the court of appeals would decide on the reappointment after comments from the bar and public were reviewed 
on august,scholl was appointed to the bankruptcy court for the eastern district of pennsylvania by the court of appeals for the third circuit.his term of appointment ended on august.in a letter addressed to the chief judge of the third circuit,dated december,scholl expressed his willingness to accept reappointment.a preliminary vote of the active judges of the third circuit was held,and scholl received enough votes to have his reappointment proceed through the public notice and comment process.the process involved notices in local newspapers seeking comments on the proposed reappointment,as well as questionnaires sent to attorneys and bankruptcy trustees who had appeared before scholl during his tenure as a judge.approximately of the questionnaires were returned to the court of appeals.scholl was provided with copies of all comments and a detailed chart analyzing the responses to the questionnaires,to which he submitted a detailed response.upon reviewing the comments,responses to the questionnaires,and scholl response,the active judges of the third circuit voted against reappointment of scholl.in a may,letter,scholl was informed of the adverse vote,and was told that the process to appoint a replacement was being initiated.scholl served as a bankruptcy judge until his term ended on august.
after the expiration of his term,scholl brought the present action in the court of federal claims,purportedly under the tucker act.in count i of his complaint,he alleges,that as a bankruptcy judge,he had a property interest in continued employment that was taken in violation of the due process clause of the fifth amendment to the constitution.compl.in count ii of his complaint,he alleges that the failure to reappoint him was in violation of the judicial conference regulations.id.scholl asserts that a,the pay statute for bankruptcy judges,and the judicial conference regulations support tucker act jurisdiction in the court of federal claims.
in due course,the government moved,pursuant to rule b of the rules of the court of federal claims,to have scholl suit dismissed for lack of jurisdiction the government argued that the case should be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the tucker act because scholl did not have a firm right to reappointment under a money mandating statute,regulation of an executive department,or constitutional provision.the court rejected this contention in scholl i.at.the court ruled that under the applicable judicial conference regulations,judge scholl had a firm right to be reappointed as a bankruptcy judge,absent the showing that he had failed to perform according to high standards.the government made a renewed motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,which was denied in scholl united states.scholl ii.
four months later,the government filed a motion to certify interlocutory appeal and to stay further proceedings.in its motion,the government argued that whether scholl states a claim when he seeks back pay for not being reappointed and whether the court of federal claims possesses jurisdiction to review the third circuit decision not to reappoint him are controlling questions of law,and that if the decision of the trial court is reversed with respect to either issue,dismissal of the suit would result.interlocutory appeal mot.at.the government further argued that whether a firm right to reappointment exists is an issue of first impression upon which there are substantial grounds for a difference of opinion.id.at.finally,the government asserted that the trial court should grant a discretionary stay because discovery in this case likely would involve a sensitive and potentially burdensome inquiry into the basis for the decision of the third circuit judges id.at.
the court of federal claims determined that the government motion was untimely and that,in any event,the government had failed to satisfy the requirements for an interlocutory appeal.consequently,the court denied certification for interlocutory appeal in scholl united states.scholl iii.scholl then moved to compel the government answer to an interrogatory seeking the name and nature of the testimony of each witness that the government intended to call at trial.the government response opposed scholl motion to compel and also presented a renewed motion for certification of an interlocutory appeal.
in its response,the government stated that i f scholl intends to challenge the merits of the decision not to appoint him,the likely witnesses would be one or more third circuit judges.government opp to mot.to compel disc.at.the government also stated that the decision whether to reappoint a bankruptcy judge is sufficiently judicial in nature to warrant the assertion of the judicial function privilege.id.at.the government further stated that communications between attorneys working for the third circuit and the third circuit judges were protected by privilege.id.at.finally,in support for its renewed motion for certification of an interlocutory appeal,the government,among other arguments,asserted that b asic principles prevent an article i court the court of federal claims from reviewing a judicial branch appointment decision.id.at.
the court of federal claims,inter alia,i granted the motion to compel the interrogatory answer insofar as it related to count ii of the complaint,ii directed the government to submit under seal to the court all documents in its privilege log for in camera review,iii issued an order to show cause why the due process claim in count i should not be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,and iv denied the renewed motion for certification of an interlocutory appeal for the same reasons that it had denied the original motion.scholl united states.scholl iv.the government then petitioned this court for a writ of mandamus.as noted above,proceedings in the court of federal claims have been stayed pending our consideration of the petition.
discussion 
a writ of mandamus is a drastic and extraordinary remedy reserved for really extraordinary causes.cheney dist.court for the,d quoting ex parte fahey.the supreme court has explained that t he traditional use of the writ in aid of appellate jurisdiction both at common law and in the federal courts has been to confine the court against which mandamus is sought to a lawful exercise of its prescribed jurisdiction.id.quoting roche evaporated milk.
three conditions must be satisfied before a court will issue a writ of mandamus.first,the party seeking issuance of the writ must have no other adequate means to attain the relief he desires.id.quoting kerr dist.court for the dist.of,d.second,the petitioner must satisfy the burden of showing that his right to issuance of the writ is clear and indisputable.id.at.quoting kerr,at.third,even if the first two prerequisites have been met,the issuing court,in the exercise of its discretion,must be satisfied that the writ is appropriate under the circumstances.id.citing kerr,at.
in its petition for mandamus,the government argues that the court of federal claims made an extraordinary claim of power to review the third circuit decision not to reappoint scholl as a bankruptcy judge.pet.at.the government asserts 
congress vested that appointment power exclusively in the courts of appeals,and declined to provide judicial officers with a private right of action in the court of federal claims.review of the third circuit appointment decisions by an article i court would raise serious appointments clause and problems,which by themselves warrant immediate mandamus review.
id.the government further asserts that the court of federal claims has now imposed an additional,concrete,and imminent harm on the third circuit,by requiring it to turn over for in camera review documents containing circuit judges internal deliberations and other privileged and confidential communications relating to the appointment decision at issue.id.in view of the trial court denials of certification for interlocutory appeal and its order compelling discovery,the government concludes that no remedy other than mandamus is available to prevent imminent,concrete,and irreparable harm to the third circuit,the separation of powers,and the deliberative process.id.at.
scholl responds that the government has failed to meet the requirements of the drastic remedy of mandamus and show that the circumstances here are extraordinary.scholl answer to pet.at.according to scholl,the trial court did not usurp power its decisions are not clearly and indisputably incorrect relief by appeal from final judgment is available id.
after the mandamus petition and scholl response were filed,we asked the parties to brief,and we heard oral argument on,the question of the jurisdiction of the court of federal claims under the tucker act.we now grant the government petition for mandamus.we do so because the court of federal claims erred by exercising jurisdiction in this case and because the requirements for mandamus have been met.we begin with the matter of jurisdiction.
in relevant part,the tucker act gives the court of federal claims jurisdiction to render judgment upon any claim against the united states founded either upon the constitution,or any act of congress or any regulation of an executive department,or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort.a.however,the tucker act is itself only a jurisdictional statute it does not create any substantive right enforceable against the united states for money damages.united states testan,d.thus,in order to invoke jurisdiction under the tucker act,a plaintiff must point to a substantive right to money damages against the united states.hamlet united states,citing testan,at.this means that a tucker act plaintiff must assert a claim under a separate constitutional provision,statute,or regulation,the violation of which supports a claim for damages against the united states.see todd united states,holley united states,adkins united states.a substantive law is only if it can fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation by the federal government for the damage sustained.united states mitchell,d.
a pay statute may serve as the basis for tucker act jurisdiction.for example,in james caldera,we stated that serves as a statute.that is because section provides that a member of a uniformed service who is on active duty is entitled to the basic pay of the grade to which assigned.in a given case,whether tucker act jurisdiction exists is a question of law that we review without deference to the decision of the trial court.see core concepts of,united states,clark united states.
scholl asserts two bases for tucker act jurisdiction in this case.first,he points to a,which is the pay statute for bankruptcy judges.he alleges that,in the course of considering him for reappointment,the third circuit acted in a manner that violated his right to due process under the fifth amendment to the constitution and deprived him of the pay mandated by section a.second,he points to the judicial conference regulations.he asserts that he performed the duties of a bankruptcy judge according to the high standards of performance regularly met by united states bankruptcy judges and that,consequently,he was entitled to be reappointed.he argues that the third circuit violated the regulations when it did not reappoint him.we address section a first.
section a clearly is a statute,for it provides that a bankruptcy judge shall receive as full compensation for his services,a salary at an annual rate that is equal to percent of the salary of a judge of the district court of the united states as determined pursuant,to be paid at such times as the judicial conference of the united states determines.however,section a command only benefits an individual who actually holds the position of bankruptcy judge.see testan,at.the established rule is that one is not entitled to the benefit of a position until he has been duly appointed to it.once scholl term as a bankruptcy judge ended,he no longer was entitled to the pay mandated by section a.see james,at once james term of enlistment ended,he no longer was entitled to pay under,because he was no longer a service member.
apparently recognizing the problem that he faces under section a,scholl argues that his was a form of discharge.scholl supplemental br.on jurisdiction at.this argument is without merit.it is true that a claim of unlawful discharge may support tucker act jurisdiction.testan,at.t he employee is entitled to the emoluments of his position until he has been legally disqualified.james,at if an enlisted member of the armed services
