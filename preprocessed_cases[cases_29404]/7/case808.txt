in this bankruptcy case,the trustee of debtor ramba,seeks to avoid a transfer of made by ramba to the appellee,baker hughes oilfield operations.the trustee contends that the transfer was a preferential payment of a debt,and thus avoidable under b.baker hughes responds that,inter alia,the transfer was not a preferential payment,but instead a contemporaneous exchange for new value.the bankruptcy court granted summary judgment for the trustee and avoided the transfer.the district court,however,reversed and granted summary judgment for baker hughes.for the reasons set forth below,we reverse the judgment of the district court and render judgment for the trustee.
ramba,ramba was in the oilfield services business.it purchased supplies,including drilling mud,from the appellee,baker hughes oilfield operations,baker hughes,and resold the products to its customers.in august,various creditors brought an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding against ramba in the bankruptcy court for the southern district of texas.on september,baker hughes joined the case as a petitioning creditor.
shortly thereafter,the petitioning creditors reached an agreement with ramba,under which ramba would pay off its debts and the creditors would move to dismiss the bankruptcy petition.ramba issued checks to all three petitioning creditors,including one to baker hughes in the amount of.the proposed settlement was then submitted to the bankruptcy court.
in reviewing the agreement,the bankruptcy court noted that ramba was engaged in an effort to sell its drilling fluids division,and that the pending petition was preventing ramba from attracting a buyer.the bankruptcy court found that the sale would be in the best interest of unsecured creditors,approved the proposed settlement,and dismissed the petition on september.soon thereafter,ramba sold its drilling fluids division for,among other things,the assumption of million in trade debt.
unfortunately,the sale and accompanying removal of debt were not enough to stave off insolvency.in november,ramba filed a voluntary chapter bankruptcy petition.lowell cage was appointed as ramba bankruptcy trustee.
in april,the trustee brought this action to avoid various the payment to baker to of the bankruptcy code.before the bankruptcy court,the trustee contended that the payment was a preferential transfer,and thus avoidable under b.baker hughes responded that,in fact,the payment was a contemporaneous exchange for new value the new value being the dismissal of the involuntary petition,resulting in the sale of the drilling fluids was therefore not avoidable.see c.
the bankruptcy court granted summary judgment for the trustee and avoided the transfer.the district court reversed and ordered that the trustee take nothing.the trustee now appeals.
the trustee contends that all three reasons given by the district court for its reversal of the bankruptcy court were in error.specifically,he contends that the district court erred in holding that ramba transfer was a contemporaneous exchange for new value and thus,not avoidable under opposed to an avoidable payment of an antecedent debt baker hughes held a statutory lien on ramba property,so as to bar the avoidance of the transfer and questions of material fact exist as to whether ramba was insolvent at the time of the transfer,precluding summary judgment for the trustee.
we review the decision of the district court by applying the same standard to the bankruptcy court findings of fact and conclusions of law that the district court applied.a bankruptcy court findings of fact are subject to review for clear error,and its conclusions of law are reviewed de novo.see in re drilling,cir.
first,we consider the proper classification of ramba transfer for purposes of avoidability under.the bankruptcy court held that the transfer was payment of an antecedent debt,and thus avoidable under b.as noted,the district court reversed,holding that the transfer was instead a contemporaneous exchange for new value,which,under c,may not be avoided.
section b of the bankruptcy code permits a bankruptcy trustee to avoid a debtor preferential transfers to creditors.a transfer may be avoided if it benefits the creditor is made in payment of a debt that is antecedent to the transfer is made while the debtor is insolvent is made within ninety days before the filing of the bankruptcy petition and enables the creditor to receive more that it would under chapter bankruptcy proceedings.
section c lists eight exceptions to the general rule of avoidability under b.in particular,c provides that a trustee may not avoid under this section a transfer to the extent such transfer was a intended by the debtor and the creditor to or for whose benefit such transfer was made to be a contemporaneous exchange for new value given to the debtor and b in fact a substantially contemporaneous exchange.
as a preliminary matter,we note that the antecedent debt requirement of b and the contemporaneous exchange exception of c although often treated as opposite sides of the same two analytically separate inquiries.see,in re armstrong,cir.the former is an element of avoidability the latter is an is,an affirmative avoidability.it is therefore possible that a given transaction might be one or the other,neither,or both.as such,we consider the two issues separately.
first,we inquire as to whether the transfer in this case was made in payment of an antecedent debt.we begin,as always,with the text of the statute.the bankruptcy code defines a debt as a liability on a claim.a claim,in turn,is defined broadly as the right to payment,whether or not such right is reduced to judgment,liquidated,unliquidated,fixed,contingent,matured,unmatured,disputed,undisputed,legal,equitable,secured or unsecured.a debt is antecedent for purposes of b if it was incurred before the alleged preferential transfer.see southmark schulte roth zabel,cir.
baker hughes does not dispute that ramba transfer was made in satisfaction of a debt owed on,drilling had already received.instead,baker hughes contends that,upon joining the involuntary bankruptcy proceeding,its claim,although originally based on the underlying debt for drilling mud,became something different.in other words,although ramba transfer was payment of an antecedent debt within the meaning of b,it served the additional purpose of securing a discrete present is,the release of the involuntary bankruptcy petition.
baker hughes argument conflates the antecedent debt requirement of b with the contemporaneous exchange exception of c.the possibility that the latter might apply in this case does not affect our analysis of the former whatever else ramba transfer might be,it was unquestionably made on account of an antecedent debt,and that is all that b requires.
as explained supra,the real thrust of baker hughes argument is that,although ramba transfer was made in payment of an antecedent debt,it was also a contemporaneous exchange for new value,and thus subject to the exception to avoidability set forth in c.
section c provides that a transfer may not be avoided if it is a contemporaneous exchange for new value given to the debtor.the controlling question in this case is whether the benefit ramba received in exchange for its payment to baker,dismissal of the involuntary bankruptcy within the statutory definition of new value.
section a defines new value as money or money worth in goods,services,or new credit,or release by a transferee of property previously transferred to such transferee including proceeds of such property.baker hughes contends that its agreement to dismiss the involuntary bankruptcy proceeding enabled ramba to sell its drilling fluids division,which in turn yielded money or money worth.this argument reflects a misreading of the,perhaps,but significant.
certainly,baker hughes dismissal of the petition began a chain of events that ultimately permitted ramba to acquire money through the sale of its drilling fluids division.the new value described in c,however,must be given to the debtor by the creditor as part of a contemporaneous exchange.thus,it is the precise benefit received from the creditor,and not the secondary or tertiar
