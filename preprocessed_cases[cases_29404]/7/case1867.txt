at one level,this is a dispute over loan payments secured by a nearly year old pontiac trans am.at another level,this case tests the limits of a bankruptcy trustee statutory power to displace existing lienholders.agreeing with the bankruptcy appellate panel of the tenth circuit bap,we hold that a bankruptcy trustee who successfully avoids a lien pursuant to and preserves for the bankruptcy estate the value of the avoided lien,but does not automatically assume other rights the original lienholder may have against the debtor.
in,christopher and catherine haberman the debtors or habermans borrowed from john national bank bank in order to purchase a new computer.to secure their loan,the habermans granted the bank a security interest in their pontiac trans am.a year later,the habermans filed for chapter bankruptcy and claimed the trans am as exempt from the bankruptcy estate.on the date they filed bankruptcy,they owed the bank on the loan,inclusive of interest,and the fair market value of their trans am was.morris john bank in re haberman.
the bankruptcy trustee,michael morris the trustee,soon discovered that,through inadvertence,the bank failed to perfect its security interest in the trans am.seeking to protect the estate interests,the trustee filed an adversary action against the bank and the debtors to avoid the security interest pursuant to a and preserve the avoided lien for the benefit of the estate pursuant to.in re haberman,at.
while the trustee litigated his adversary action,the bankruptcy court issued interim orders permitting the habermans to retain possession of the trans am and continue making their loan payments to the bank,with the understanding that,should the trustee prevail,he could collect an appropriate sum from the bank.and,indeed,the habermans continued making payments on their loan,eventually paying off the full balance.
at the conclusion of the trustee adversary proceeding,the bankruptcy court determined that the trustee was indeed entitled to avoid the bank lien.but the question then arose should the trustee recoup from the bank the value of the lien itself as of the date of the habermans bankruptcy is,the value of the trans am or was the trustee entitled to recover the full amount of the loan as of the same is,
the bankruptcy court ruled that a trustee who voids a lien pursuant to and takes for the bankruptcy estate only the value of the lien itself and ordered the bank to disburse to the trustee the bap affirmed,holding that o nce the trustee avoided the bank lien,he inherited the bank position prior to avoidance and could not expand that position by enforcing the lien over and above the value of the collateral.his rights in the collateral were to be valued at the amount of the bank debt on the petition date,limited by the value of the collateral on that date.in re haberman,at.the trustee then filed this appeal,which we entertain pursuant to d.
the trustee argues before us that the bankruptcy laws permit him to recoup the full value of the loan rather than just the value of the bank secured interest.to be sure the amount at stake is huge representing the difference in these two sums.but the trustee submits that the issue recurs frequently,and is one that merits clarification because it goes to the core of his statutory rights and duties.indeed,he has pursued several different theories in other bankruptcy cases in support of his mission to recover all postpetition payments in lien avoidance and preference actions.in re haberman,at.as the bap has put it,and we agree,though unsuccessful to date,the trustee efforts on behalf of the estates he represents are certainly admirable.id.
because the alleged error the trustee identifies is,in all events,one entirely of law,we review the bap decision de novo.in doing so,we begin at the beginning,by acknowledging that liens generally pass through bankruptcy unaffected,as they did before the enactment of the bankruptcy code.see dewsnup timm,d farrey sanderfoot,d.various provisions of the bankruptcy code,of course,create certain exceptions to this rule.relevant for our purposes,these exceptions include the trustee strong arm powers to avoid liens and transfers and preserve them for the bankruptcy estate under and.
in section a,congress afforded trustees the power to avoid any transfer or obligation that a hypothetical creditor with an unsatisfied judicial lien on the debtor property could avoid under relevant state nonbankruptcy law.see a see also collier on bankruptcy ed.that is,just as any other creditor could avoided the lien on the trans am because of the bank failure to perfect its security interest under state law,congress allowed the trustee to do the same in bankruptcy.
having avoided the lien,what happens next in section,congress directed that a ny transfer avoided or any lien void ed is preserved for the benefit of the estate.so,the trustee,on behalf of the entire bankruptcy estate,in some sense steps into the shoes of the former lienholder,with the same rights in the collateralized property that the original lienholder enjoyed.likewise,the trustee,on behalf of the entire estate,assumes the original lienholder position in the line of secured creditors in this way,congress sought to assure that the avoidance of a lien does simply benefit junior lienholders who would otherwise gain an improved security position and might,when the estate is limited,prove the only beneficiaries of the trustee actions.see,at,as reprinted in,noting that the preservation of avoided liens principally serves to prevent junior lienors from improving their position at the expense of the estate when a senior lien is avoided,at,as reprinted in,same.
but,while section places the estate in the shoes of the displaced lienholder in certain respects,in others it does not.section says that only liens in particular,and transfers more generally,may be taken by the trustee for the benefit of the estate.section defines the broader term transfer to embrace liens but also certain other dispositions of property interests,including the creation of a lien the retention of title as a security interest the foreclosure of a debtor equity of redemption or each mode,direct or indirect,absolute or conditional,voluntary or involuntary,of disposing of or parting with property or an interest in property.
though encompassing a wide array of modes of disposition of property interests,this definition does not,by its terms,cover contractual promises to future payments.in this respect at least,the statute appears to conform to the generally recognized if sometimes hazardous to define line between property and contract relations,affording the trustee the right to take for the benefit of the estate property but not purely contractual interests as corbin notes,a fully effective exchange or,we might say here,transfer,without including any enforceable promise of future performance by either party,creates numerous legal relations that are customarily described as property relations and not as contractual relations.this is because they are relations not merely between the two parties themselves,but between all persons who as a society recognize the transfer of a property interest.corbin on contracts ed.the contractual right embodied in a promise to pay some sum in the future is thus distinct and independent from the present property right created and recognized by society when one is given an interest in property such as a lien.id.
so,for example,in robinson howard bank in re kors,cir,our sister circuit held that,while the benefit of an avoided security interest belonged to the estate under section,the bank whose lien was avoided nonetheless retained its interest in a contract with the though that contract,in the form of a subordination agreement,was part of the same transaction and ancillary to the avoided security interest.t he subordination agreement is not a part of the bank unperfected security interest and is not itself a security interest,the court explained,and therefore the trustee powers under a and do not extend to the bank rights under the subordination agreement.id.at.collier makes much the same point,explaining that secti
