opinion of the court 
in this bankruptcy appeal,affiliated debtors approximately in number filed separate cases under chapter of the bankruptcy code but were permitted to administer their cases jointly.the bankruptcy court also permitted them to use a centralized cash management system under which a small number of debtors held bank accounts from which the expenses of all other debtors were paid.
in this context,two issues are before us.the first is whether the employment of the centralized cash management system affects the amount of quarterly bankruptcy fees each debtor would otherwise owe to the united states trustee under a in the absence of such a system.this issue,a question of first impression for us,turns on the interpretation of the term disbursement under a.specifically,we consider whether payments made by certain debtors on behalf of other debtors constitute disbursements of the paying debtors only or whether those payments must be attributed to the debtors on whose behalf the payments were made.the second issue relates to the duration of payments.does the obligation for trustee quarterly fee payments under a continue after confirmation of the debtors joint plan of reorganization reorganization plan or plan providing in part that they are deemed consolidated for certain purposes 
the bankruptcy court held,and the district court affirmed,that each debtor was obligated to pay quarterly fees based on the payment of its respective operating expenses regardless whether it actually wrote the checks to pay for these expenses,and the deemed consolidation of the debtors under the reorganization plan had no effect on the amount of the quarterly fees payable by each debtor in connection with its own chapter case still pending.we agree with both courts on both issues and thus affirm.
factual and procedural background 
genesis health ventures,genesis,genesis eldercare known for our purposes as multicare,and their affiliates are providers of healthcare and support services to the elderly.on june,genesis,multicare,and their affiliates collectively the debtors and individually a debtor separately filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware.the debtors simultaneously moved for joint administration of their chapter cases in two groups genesis and its affiliated debtors the genesis debtors,and multicare and its affiliated debtors the multicare debtors the bankruptcy court granted the debtors motions.
because the debtors planned to continue to operate their businesses as debtors in possession they also moved for authorization to continue their centralized cash management systems in chapter for the genesis debtors,the other for the multicare debtors.under the cash management system each debtor revenues were typically deposited into separate accounts.on a periodic basis,the funds in these separate accounts were transferred to a handful of concentration accounts,then to several disbursing accounts held only by paying debtors.in turn,these disbursing accounts were used to pay the various financial obligations of each debtor,such as accounts payable,payroll,and taxes.the debtors maintained,however,balances so that each of them was able to account for its own revenues and expenses.on june,the bankruptcy court granted the debtors motions.in doing so,the court directed each group of debtors to maintain records of all transfers within the cash management system so that all transfers and transactions shall be adequately and promptly documented in,and readily ascertainable from,their books and records,to the same extent maintained by the debtors prior to the commencement of these c hapter cases.
while operating under chapter,the debtors were required to pay quarterly fees to the trustee under a the amount of the quarterly fees payable under a varies depending on the total disbursements that a debtor makes during each quarter.the maximum fee that a debtor is required to pay each quarter is capped at for disbursements totaling million or more.id.
in little more than a year from the debtors chapter filings until june,they collectively paid in quarterly disbursement fees.in calculating these fees,the debtors treated all disbursements as applicable only to those paying debtors who held the disbursing accounts from which they were made.had fees been paid for the debtors for whom the disbursements were made,the aggregate quarterly disbursement fees would have been,according to the trustee,almost million.
the trustee objected to the debtors proposed reorganization plan,claiming that they still owed approximately million in quarterly fees each debtor,the trustee reasoned,owed its respective quarterly fees based on the disbursements attributable to that debtor,regardless who held the accounts from which actual disbursements were made.after confirming the reorganization plan and reserving decision on the proper amount of quarterly fees the bankruptcy court agreed with the trustee and ordered the debtors to pay the deficiency claimed by the trustee.the district court affirmed that decision one year later.
for the first quarter after the reorganization plan was fourth quarter of debtors made a single fee payment of to the trustee,the statutory maximum amount for a single case.the debtors claimed that the payment of a single fee was justified under the provision of the reorganization plan that d eemed the debtors consolidated for plan p urposes o nly.
the trustee disputed this,arguing that quarterly disbursement fees should be assessed for each debtor for its own chapter case notwithstanding the deemed consolidation provision of the plan.the bankruptcy court again agreed,in re genesis health ventures,and on appeal the district court again affirmed.
the debtors appeal the rulings on both the and fee issues 
ii.discussion 
the debtors argue that payments made by paying debtors should not be allocated to other debtors for whom the payments were made for the purpose of the a fees calculation.they assert that disbursement in that subsection means actual payment by cash or check.by this logic,payments made on behalf of,but not directly by,debtors are irrelevant in determining the disbursements of those entities.
when the meaning of a statute is plain,the sole function of the courts is to enforce it according to its terms.caminetti united states.the language of a statute is plain when it admits of no more than one meaning and in such a case the duty of interpretation does not arise and the rules which are to aid doubtful meanings need no discussion.id.
section a provides that a quarterly fee shall be paid to the united states trustee in each case under chapter of title for each quarter until the case is converted or dismissed,whichever occurs first.a emphasis added.it is clear from this language that each debtor in its respective chapter case is required to pay its own quarterly fee.
as stated previously,the bankruptcy court permitted the debtors to administer their cases jointly and to transfer funds among themselves,allowing the affiliated debtors to manage centrally their cash flow.for us the practical question is whether the convenience of cash management procedures make disbursements under a mean only the literal payments by a debtor even when they are made for other debtors.put another way,is an amount owed by debtor a,but paid by debtor b,attributed as a disbursement for trustee quarterly fees to a which would pay absent the cash management order or b which did not owe the amount itself but as an operational convenience was making a payment 
disbursement is not defined in the statute.thus we interpret the word in accordance with its ordinary,contemporary,common meaning.perrin united states,d citation omitted.disburse is defined as to expend or to pay out.websters third new international dictionary.based on this ordinary meaning,the ninth circuit court of appeals held that indirect payment of a debtor,payments made by an unrelated third party to secured creditors of the disbursements of the owing debtor and should be included in calculating its quarterly fees under a.angelo v
