regions bank appeals the district court adverse grant of summary judgment on its rico claims against the various defendants.the rico claims relate to alleged fraud in the procurement of a loan and the subsequent transfer and use of the collateral for the loan before and during a bankruptcy,culminating in a bankruptcy sale.because regions bank neither raised the issue of fraud during the bankruptcy nor timely moved to set aside the bankruptcy sale,we find the current rico claims to be an impermissible collateral attack on the final judgment of the bankruptcy court.
in the alternative,we find that regions bank suffered no rico injury and therefore lacks standing to bring a rico claim.because regions bank security interest in the collateral was inferior to the perfected security interest of another lender,whose security interest completely encumbered the collateral,regions bank security interest was of no value from its inception.further,regions bank has not alleged that other assets existed to satisfy unsecured creditors.accordingly,any injury to regions bank was complete when regions bank funded the loan.the rico injuries regions bank alleges in this case relate to the subsequent bankruptcy sale,use of the collateral,and diversion of income generated with the collateral.to the extent there was an injury,it was injury to the third party,priority lienholder whose priority lien fully encumbered the collateral and entitled it to the collateral the proceeds from the collateral.for this additional reason,we affirm the district court dismissal of the rico claims.in addition,we affirm the district court dismissal of the supplemental state law claims for lack of federal jurisdiction.
background 
through jones realty,jones realty and oil company,oil steven jones owned and operated various gas stations and convenience stores.in april,steven jones applied for a loan from regions bank,ostensibly to buy inventory for oil to use in the operation of a truck stop in cameron,missouri.steven jones submitted personal financial information as well as financial information regarding oil and jones realty.he represented to regions bank that oil held assets in excess of million,jones realty was worth over million,and he and his wife,marcella jones,had a net worth in excess of million.in addition,he represented that regions bank would receive a first lien on oil accounts receivable,equipment,and inventory.regions bank granted and funded the loan to oil and steven jones.jones realty provided a guarantee on the loan.steven jones executed a security agreement on behalf of oil that granted regions bank a lien on oil accounts receivable,equipment,and inventory.
according to the regions bank officer who signed the oil security agreement on behalf of regions bank,and according to a regions bank officer in charge of trouble loans,regions bank did not complete its lien search until after it funded the loan.the lien search revealed that regions bank held a secondary lien position in the collateral.
in early summer,steven jones and his wife,marcella jones,with the financial assistance of steven jones friend,larry taylor,organized a new company,jones travel mart,jtm.jtm assumed management of the truck stop in cameron,missouri.regions bank contends that jones realty owned the real estate associated with the truck stop and oil owned the equipment,inventory,accounts receivable,and other assets associated with operation of the truck stop.in addition,marcella jones nominally assumed control of two other convenience stores owned by jones realty and operated by oil in piggot and paragould,arkansas.after assuming nominal control of these two other convenience store properties,she started operating them as piggot jonesmart and northend jonesmart.there is no documentation to memorialize any transfer of assets from oil to jones realty,larry taylor,jtm,marcella jones,piggot jonesmart,or northend jonesmart.oil claims that this omission in its records is due to the fact that oil lost many records when oil failed to pay rent on storage buildings that housed the records.regions bank claims that these persons and entities wrongly appropriated the assets of oil.without explanation,after regions bank funded the loan to oil,elwood bonner,the accountant for oil,wrote off over million of oil furniture,equipment,inventory and accounts receivable.
on the same day that steven jones organized jtm,oil filed for bankruptcy under chapter.oil included regions bank in its list of creditors.two days later,on july,jones realty filed for bankruptcy under chapter.jones realty did not list regions bank as a creditor.the first meeting of creditors for both bankruptcies took place on september,at in the federal building in jonesboro,arkansas,in the same room.counsel for regions bank,marie miller,attended the meeting on behalf of regions bank and signed in as the representative for regions bank on a sheet for the oil bankruptcy.regions bank did not intervene in the jones realty bankruptcy nor request notice of proceedings in the jones realty bankruptcy.it is undisputed that regions bank knew that the guarantor on the loan,jones realty,filed bankruptcy.
according to oil bankruptcy filings,loan documents,security agreements,and ucc filings,oil borrowed from enterprise mortgage acceptance corporation enterprise in.in,oil borrowed an additional from enterprise.in and,enterprise perfected continuing security interests over oil assets,including accounts receivable,inventory,and equipment at the cameron,missouri,and piggott and paragould,arkansas sites,among others.in,enterprise assigned its security interests to lasalle national bank lasalle.oil,apparently,borrowed additional money from enterprise.when oil filed for bankruptcy,oil listed its debt to enterprise as.in its bankruptcy filings,oil listed inventory as collateral for the debt owed to regions bank,listed the value of the inventory as only,and listed the entire of debt to regions bank as unsecured.regions bank neither contested the information oil provided to the bankruptcy court,challenged the amount of indebtedness that oil listed regarding enterprise,nor raised the issue of bonner unexplained of million worth of furniture,inventory,equipment,and accounts receivable.it is undisputed that regions bank knew at the time of the oil bankruptcy that steven jones had made misrepresentations to induce regions bank to grant him the loan.
between august,and december,jtm paid out approximately to steven and marcella jones.regions bank alleges in its current rico claims that these payments were improper diversions of cash generated by assets that jtm misappropriated from oil during the time of the oil bankruptcy.regions bank further alleges that oil should have been operating the cameron truck stop as the under chapter.no defendant offered an explanation for these payments from jtm to the joneses.
oil moved to dismiss its chapter bankruptcy on december.in this motion,oil represented that it 
no longer ha d an operating business.moreover,the remaining property of the debtor,to the extent any such property exists,is encumbered by liens which secure debt in excess of the value of such property.the remaining property of the debtor is burdensome or of inconsequential value so that there is nothing to administer for the benefit of unsecured creditors.
regions bank does not allege that it failed to receive notice of the motion to dismiss.further,regions bank does not allege that it acted to prevent the dismissal,failed to receive any documents associated with the oil bankruptcy,or raised any claim before the bankruptcy court regarding the purported misappropriation of oil assets by jones realty,jtm,steven jones,marcella jones,larry taylor,or any other individual or entity.the bankruptcy court records show the oil bankruptcy closed as of february,with no outstanding objections.
on june,regions bank received a state court judgment in the state of arkansas against steven jones in the amount of for the outstanding principal on the note as well as in attorneys fees.
on july,jones realty filed a motion in the jones realty bankruptcy to seek approval for the sale of real property and improvements at four sites in missouri and arkansas to a company named sierra pacific land company sierra or its assigns.the sites included real property in cameron,missouri property other than the cameron truck stop.lasalle,the priority lienholder,objected.on september,after jones realty and sierra worked out a settlement with lasalle,the bankruptcy court approved the sale of real property for,free and clear of all liens.the bankruptcy court specifically found that sierra or its assigns were purchasers in good faith,the terms of the sale were fair and equitable,jones realty exercised its best business judgment in connection with the sale,and the sale was in the best interest of jones realty and its creditors.
sierra assigned its rights under the september sale order to northchase development,northchase,a company formed and owned by steven jones friend,larry taylor.on october,northchase purchased the four parcels of real property from jones realty in accordance with the september order.
on december,jones realty filed a motion with the bankruptcy court to seek approval for the sale of all right,title,and interest in and to certain real and personal property,free and clear of all liens,claims,and encumbrances of any kind whatsoever.emphasis added.the certain real property included the cameron truck stop and the piggott and paragould,arkansas properties.the proposed buyer was larry taylor company,northchase.on january,the bankruptcy court approved the sale,free and clear of all liens,for million.the bankrupcty court specifically found that northchase was a purchaser in good faith,the sale was the result of a fully negotiated,transaction,the terms of the sale were fair and equitable,jones realty exercised its best business judgment in connection with the sale,and the sale was in the best interest of the estate and jones realty creditors.
on january,northchase purchased the property from jones realty in accordance with the january order.larry taylor and marcella jones transferred their shares of jtm to northchase,which in turn transferred the shares of jtm to a company named walcott enterprises,walcott,run by steven jones son,kelly jones.regions bank alleges that kelly jones was young,inexperienced in the operation of gas stores,and not creditworthy.nevertheless,before february,northchase agreed to loan walcott under a promissory note that kelly jones executed on behalf of walcott.northchase and larry taylor,in turn,borrowed money from american bank so that northchase could fund the note to walcott.on february,northchase leased the newly purchased property to walcott.through a series of payments,northchase,in fact,funded the note to walcott.in return,northchase structured the lease payments due from walcott to mirror northchase debt payments to american bank.
taylor received a payment of from jtm that regions bank characterizes as a consulting fee for taylor role in the,reorganization.regions bank alleges that kelly jones is a figurehead and walcott is merely a shell to permit steven jones,his family,and larry taylor to thwart creditors and hold and enjoy the benefit of the properties sold through the jones realty bankruptcy.
on april,regions bank filed its complaint in the present case.regions bank did not allege that any of the bankruptcy sales were for less than fair value.regions bank alleged state law fraud,civil conspiracy,and breach of contract claims.in addition,regions bank alleged three civil rico claims.in its three rico claims,regions bank alleged that the enterprise was an association consisting of steven,marcella and kelly jones,larry taylor,walcott,and northchase.in count i,regions bank alleged that these defendants acquired and maintained interests in and control of jtm through a pattern of racketeering activity in violation of b.in count ii,regions bank alleged that these defendants agreed to and did conduct and participate in the conduct of the enterprise affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity in violation of c.in count iii,regions bank alleged that these defendants conspired to commit the actions alleged in counts i and ii in violation of d.as predicate acts,regions bank alleged fraud in the procurement of the loan,bankruptcy fraud,and multiple acts of wire and mail fraud that extended until early when walcott obtained control of oil former assets through the jones realty bankruptcy sale.regions bank alleged in the alternative and conspiracies.under the conspiracy theory,regions bank alleged as ongoing predicate acts the use of the mails and wires to make ongoing lease payments from walcott to northchase.
larry taylor and northchase moved to dismiss regions bank original complaint for failure to plead the alleged instances of fraud with sufficient particularity,as required under federal rule of civil procedure b.regions bank amended its complaint to add detail.larry taylor and northchase,however,renewed their motion.in addition,after some discovery,larry taylor and northchase moved for summary judgment.all other defendants joined in the summary judgment motion.the defendants argued that the rico claims failed as a matter of law and the district court should not retain jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims.the defendants specifically argued that regions bank failed to generate a genuine question of material fact as to the continuity requirement of the rico claims or the requirement of a rico injury to confer standing.further,the defendants argued on grounds of res judicata that regions bank rico claims were nothing more than a thinly veiled collateral attack on the judgment of the jones realty bankruptcy court regarding the sales of assets to northchase for fair value.
the district court treated the motions to dismiss as motions for summary judgment,allowed regions bank adequate opportunity to respond,and ruled on the outstanding motions in one order.the district court determined that regions bank failed to allege sufficient predicate acts over a sufficient period of time to establish the continuity prong of a rico claim under either a or scheme.the district court did not address other arguments that the defendants raised in their motions.
because other creditors had forced steven jones into involuntary bankruptcy by the time of the district court ruling,steven jones enjoyed the protection of the automatic stay associated with his personal,involuntary bankruptcy.the district court ruled that the automatic stay did not require a stay of the claims against the other defendants.accordingly,the district court final order in this case disposed of the rico claims against all defendants other than steven jones.
ii.discussion 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo and view the facts in a light most favorable to the party.terry lambert plumbing,western sec.bank,cir.regions bank argues that our review is strictly limited to the legal issue that the district court chose to address,namely,the continuity requirement under rico.it is clear,however,that the defendants properly raised numerous other grounds for relief before the district court.it is well settled that we are not constrained by a district court choice of legal theories among those that parties set forth for disposition of a case.rather,we may decide a case on any grounds supported by the record and not waived by a moving party.see lane peterson,cir we may affirm a judgment on any ground supported by the record even if not relied upon by the district court.blum bacon,d w ithout filing a or,an appellee may rely upon any matter appearing in the record in support of the judgment below.here,those issues include regions bank standing under rico and the defendants characterization of regions bank rico claim as an impermissible collateral attack on the bankruptcy court final judgment.
rico standing 
to have standing to bring a civil rico claim,a plaintiff must have suffered injury by reason of a rico violation.c any person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section of this chapter may sue therefor in any appropriate united states district court and shall recover threefold the damages he sustains and the cos
