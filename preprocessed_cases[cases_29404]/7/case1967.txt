advanced telecommunications network,atn,a chapter bankrupt debtor seeking to recover certain transfers made before the company declared bankruptcy,appeals from a district court order affirming a bankruptcy court judgment in favor of daniel allen allen and his brother david,the recipients of the disputed transfers.atn focuses its claim on a million transfer atn made to the allens on june,alleging that the transfer was fraudulent under new jersey law.
background 
daniel allen and gary carpenter founded atn in as a reseller of telecommunication services.the company purchased long distance telephone service in bulk from larger carriers,such as,and resold it to customers.allen and carpenter each held exactly half of atn voting stock 
by,disputes between allen and carpenter had developed into a bitter battle for control of the company.in april,carpenter who was then president of atn sent allen a letter placing him on administrative leave.although allen continued to draw salary until august of that year,carpenter refused to give him access to the company financial information.on august,carpenter wrote allen another letter informing him that his employment with atn was terminated and that his salary would end at the close of business that day 
the litigation 
as a result of carpenter actions,allen sued carpenter and atn in new jersey state court in april,seeking control of the company.allen argued in that atn has been in a serious state of decline under carpenter management,and that losses exceeded million by november of.with the company frozen while its equal voting and for control,the court appointed a third director rutgers law school dean milton leontiades to help the company remain afloat.the company was able to avoid bankruptcy,and the case proceeded to trial in december.atn actively participated at trial,and retained separate,independent counsel.
on december,in the midst of the evidentiary presentation for trial,attorneys for the allens and carpenter met and signed a short,handwritten settlement agreement which relieved carpenter of any personal liability to the allens.no lawyer for atn was present or participated in this meeting.nonetheless,the terms of the agreement provided that atn would pay the allens attorneys million in fees by january,plus another by january.atn would then transfer an additional million to the allens themselves no later than june.atn was also required to forgive the allens debts to the company,which totaled approximately million,and advance any funds needed by the allens to pay for tax liabilities arising from their ownership of atn.the handwritten agreement was signed by the lawyers for the allens and carpenter.no one signed the handwritten document on behalf of atn.
the handwritten agreement was subsequently formalized in a typed document on january,agreement.this time,carpenter signed on behalf of atn in his capacity as president,as did daniel allen in his capacity as secretary.carpenter and allen also signed a separate consent action on behalf of atn shareholders,approving the actions required under the agreement.the two men also signed in their individual capacities.the agreement provided additional detail as to terms,but did not differ in substance from the handwritten document signed by carpenter and allen weeks earlier.
the disputed transfer 
carpenter,allen,and atn all fulfilled their obligations under the agreement.just after the agreement was signed,atn paid to allens attorneys and,as agreed,paid them an additional in three later installments.also pursuant to the terms of the agreement,atn paid the allens on january,and an additional million on june.this money went directly to the allens from atn coffers.it never passed through any individual account owned by carpenter,even though the money was used to settle a lawsuit filed by allen against carpenter individually.
sometime after june,these million payments from atn to allen were recharacterized as loans to carpenter,who signed two promissory to january,and one to june,the amounts of and,respectively.the notes retroactively recharacterized the transfers as purchases by carpenter purchase of the allens stock from atn,in exchange for carpenter promise to pay atn and assume the allens million in shareholder loans.
the dispute 
beginning in,atn was also engaged in a contract dispute with,wats,a competitor.filed a million claim against atn,which was still pending when atn made the million transfer to the allens.
atn and wats settled their dispute on october,about a year and a half after allen and carpenter settled their dispute.the parties agreed that atn would pay million to wats to settle the claims as part of the settlement,carpenter relinquished control of atn to two companies controlled by wats president damian freeman,thus placing freeman in control of atn,where he remains.
the current litigation 
following the june transfer of million to the allens and the october settlement between atn and wats and accompanying management shuffle,as freeman replaced carpenter at the helm of atn,atn continued to operate as a going enterprise for nearly three years before filing for reorganization under chapter.on january,atn filed the petition initiating the present case,seeking to recover the money transferred to the allens in.atn asserted counts in its amended complaint six fraudulent transfer claims and one count of improper distribution to shareholders,plus counts alleging actual fraud,conflict of interest,unjust enrichment,right to an accounting,equitable subordination,and turnover.
the bankruptcy court rejected atn fraudulent transfer claims,finding them to be barred by new jersey statute of limitations period because the obligation giving rise to the transfer arose on december,when the handwritten agreement between allen and carpenter was years and two weeks prior to the filing of the lawsuit.alternatively,the court found that atn claims failed as a matter of law because atn had failed to satisfy the two elements of fraudulent transfer under new jersey law that atn was insolvent at the time of the million transfer,and that atn received less than reasonably equivalent value in return for the transfer.see stat.ann.atn appealed the bankruptcy court decisions on counts,and constructive fraud counts,and and improper shareholder distributions count to the district court which affirmed the bankruptcy court in a brief opinion.atn then timely appealed to this court.
discussion 
as an initial matter,we must determine whether atn fraudulent transfer claims are barred by the applicable statute of limitations.because we find that the statute of limitations does not bar the claim,we then turn to the bankruptcy court alternative holding,which rejected the merits of atn fraudulent transfer claim.
under new jersey law,a corporation transfer of cash to its shareholders is fraudulent if the transferor atn made the transfer while insolvent,and the transferor received less than a reasonably equivalent value in exchange.stat.ann.a.the bankruptcy court ruled against atn on both prongs of this test.after careful review,we find that the bankruptcy court erred both by finding that atn was solvent at the time of the transfer and by finding that it received reasonably equivalent value for the million transfer.
i.the statute of limitations does not bar atn claims 
under new jersey law,fraudulent transfer claims must be filed within four years of the date the transfer was made or the obligation was incurred.stat.ann.the claims in this case were filed on january.the parties dispute,however,whether the statutory period ended before or after that date 
we find that the atn obligation was not incurred until carpenter and allen signed the agreement on the company behalf on january.according to new jersey law,an obligation is incurred i f evidenced by a writing,when the writing executed by the obligor is delivered to or for the benefit of the obligee.stat.ann.atn did not participate in the drafting of the december,handwritten agreement,and did not sign it.none of the signatories signed the handwritten document on atn behalf.atn thus incurred no obligation under the handwritten agreement,and we can not measure the statute of limitations from that date.
moreover,even if atn obligation arose on december,its claims still would not be barred by the statute of limitations.as the bankruptcy court recognized,an odd quirk of new jersey law allows a party to allege constructive fraud to avoid both a transfer and an obligation.because of this duality,atn has alleged two counts for each type of fraudulent transfer claim.one count asserts that the transfer is avoidable.the second count asserts the obligation is avoidable.order at,see stat.ann.b.the bankruptcy court erred,however,by dismissing all of atn of which seek to avoid the on the incorrect calculation of the date when atn obligation to pay the allens arose.
ii.atn was insolvent at the time of the transfer 
finding that atn petition was timely does not end our inquiry,however.we turn next to the merits,and consider whether atn has met both prongs of the fraudulent transfer test set out in stat.ann.
the first prong of the fraudulent transfer inquiry asks whether the debtor making the challenged transfer was insolvent at the time the transfer was made.new jersey law recognizes both presumptive and conclusive insolvency.under new jersey law,a debtor who is generally not paying his debts as they become due is presumed to be insolvent.stat.ann.b.a debtor is conclusively insolvent if its debts exceed the fair value of his assets.stat.ann.
here,there is no question that the bankruptcy court was right in finding that atn meets the test of presumptive insolvency.the bankruptcy court found that i n order to accumulate the cash to pay the allens and their attorneys,atn delayed paying some of its regular bills for a short period of time.order at,at.the company was thus clearly unable to meet its debts as they came due and must be considered presumptively insolvent.id.at,at as such,under new jersey law,atn is presumptively insolvent during this approximately five month time period between december,and june,when the transfers were made.the parties do not dispute this point,and our independent review of the record confirms the company dire financial straits.on may,just two weeks before the transfer,atn chief financial officer phil krieger noted in an to carpenter fyi will need to cut back on payments for next two weeks money for dan is going to be awfully tight.three days later,krieger several atn employees,including carpenter,saying 
we will need a substantial portion if not all of the funds that atn currently has in order to meet the payment.we hopefully will have a line of credit in place by that time,but it will not cover the full million.as soon as atn knows the status of the line and what cash will be available,then i can make a decision on what needs to be done.this of course will be done in conjunction with gary carpenter.if this thing goes down to the last minute,which we should all expect it will,then that is reality and we will have to deal with it.
by that time,atn landlord and insurance carrier were threatening to terminate their agreements with the company,and other vendors were threatening to withhold services.carpenter himself estimated that on june,the day atn transferred million to the allens,the company had only in its checking account.on june,the day after the million transfer,atn actually owed million dollars to.although atn received hundreds of thousands of dollars in the weeks following the transfer,its debts still far exceeded its assets.
the bankruptcy court finding of presumptive insolvency finding shifted the burden to the allens to show that atn was conclusively solvent under a balance sheet test that is,that the fair value of atn assets exceeded the fair value of its debts,notwithstanding the fact that it had not paid its debts as they come due.stat.ann.applying this balance sheet test,and apparently relying solely on evidence presented by atn to prove its insolvency,the bankruptcy court found that atn was actually solvent at the time of the transfer.the bankruptcy court reasoning on this point was erroneous 
the bankruptcy court calculated three adjustments to atn bottom line,which began with a net value of negative the parties do not dispute the first of these adjustments,by which the court added between and to the company assets to reflect the value of its customer list.however,the court calculation of the second and third,rather,its refusal to do closer examination.if made,these adjustments would have lowered atn net worth by more than million,thus demonstrating clear balance sheet insolvency.
the second adjustment turned on the disputed value of the shareholder loans which carpenter pledged to atn following atn million transfer to the allens.the bankruptcy court upwardly adjusted atn assets to reflect the value of these outstanding loans,thus increasing the company value by.although the loans were backdated to appear contemporaneous with the transfer,carpenter loans arose after the million transfer from atn to the allens.because carpenter had no ability to repay the fact which was knowable at the time the loans were upward adjustment was erroneous as a matter of law.
as the bankruptcy court recognized,carpenter ability to repay the loans was entirely dependent on atn financial performance of course,carpenter ability to repay the loans was directly tied to his ability to improve atn profitability.if the company succeeded,carpenter prospered.conversely,if atn failed,so did he.carpenter certainly had no independent income or assets available to repay the substantial shareholders loans.order at,at emphasis added.effectively,carpenter pledged the company dwindling value against itself,knowing that he personally had no funds to make the payments at the time of the settlement in october,carpenter produced an affidavit indicating that he had a negative net worth of,most of it to the promissory notes he gave atn under the allen settlement and which he had obviously not been able to repay in an ironic twist,the bankruptcy court erroneously considered this a reason to discount atn argument that the loans were worthless,saying that it is irreconcilably is insolvent because carpenter can not repay his shareholder loans,and carpenter can not repay his shareholder loans because atn is insolvent.the court was correct about the circularity of the situation,but erred in holding that this circularity favored the allens.in truth,it simply demonstrated that there was no value underlying carpenter promise.
in any case,the shareholder debt was clearly not a liquid bankruptcy court recognized that neither daniel allen nor carpenter had liquid assets and thus had no immediate value to atn.as such,carpenter promise to repay money to the company over time the loans had a term should not have been not at full among the company assets.see in the matter of taylor,in calculating the debtor balance sheet,the court should consider only those assets readily susceptible to liquidation and the payment of debts.internal quotation and citation omitted.
the third adjustment involved atn obligation if any,at the time of the transfer,to wats in the litigation between those two entities.wats suit claimed million in damages,a claim which the parties eventually settled for million.atn argued that the full amount of the settlement should be a downward adjustment to atn assets at the time of the transfer because it was a plainly foreseeable liability.the allens argued,and the bankruptcy court found,that atn obligation to wats did not arise until after the transfer at issue in this case,could not have been reasonably foreseen,and thus no downward adjustment was necessary we reject both extreme positions,and find that the proper approach would have simply discounted the expected value of the judgment by the probability of its ever occurring.although it may be true,as the bankruptcy court put it,that no one could have predicted this result with any reasonable certainty,such a precise prediction was not required.the court was instead required to calculate the present value of the expected cost of the liability times the estimated chance of it ever occurring.unless either the expected cost or the chances of it occurring are equal to zero that is,the liability is costless,or the chances of it happening are negligible,the estimated value should be more than zero.
new jersey law requires a bankruptcy court conducting an insolvency analysis to include the value of claims against the debtor.under new jersey law,a claim means a right to payment,whether or not the right is reduced to judgment,liquidated,unliquidated,fixed,contingent,matured,unmatured,disputed,undisputed,legal,equitable,secured,or unsecured.stat.ann.by its plain terms,this includes wats pending claim against prototypical contingent liability.
the fair value of a contingent liability,of course,should be discounted according to the possibility of its ever becoming real.thus in this case the bankruptcy court should have estimated the expected value of a judgment against atn atn own lawyers had already placed it in the millions well before the case actually settled for million,and then multiplied that value by the chance that atn would face such a judgment thus,for example,halving the judgment value if atn faced only a fifty percent chance of an adverse judgment.the seventh circuit court of appeals set forth the leading statement of this approach in in re xonics photochemical 
a contingent liability is not often is highly to become an actual liability.to value the contingent liability it is necessary to discount it by the probability that the contingency will occur and the liability will become real.
cir.thus,t he asset or liability must be reduced to its present,or expected,value before a determination can be made whether the firm assets exceed its liabilities.id.citations omitted emphasis added.
the bankruptcy court should have calculated a discounted value for this liability,especially in light of its willingness to include the value of contingent assets in its balance sheet calculations.the court in fact acknowledged that both contingent liabilities and contingent assets are appropriately considered.order at,at internal citation omitted,but failed to apply that reasoning to the wats debt.had the court done so,it is difficult to imagine that it would have come up with a fair value of zero dollars.while that might be an appropriate valuation for some exceedingly remote or unlikely liabilities,the record evidence shows that,at the time of the transfer,atn faced a very real prospect of a dollar obligation to wats.in january,almost a year before atn settled its lawsuit with the allens,the company had a pending settlement offer from wats in the amount of million.atn counsel advised atn at that time that the company had significant exposure,and that d iscovery to date indicates that there is a substantial risk that the plaintiff could be successful on all,or part of this claim at the time of trial.since plaintiff had asserted claims for fraud there is also the possibility,while remote,of punitive damages.
rather than calculate an appropriately discounted value for this eminently foreseeable liability,however,the bankruptcy court simply said that certainly no one could have reasonably estimated the amount of the settlement months earlier.absolute precision,however,is not required.but since atn own lawyers had advised than a year prior to the the company faced millions of dollars in liability,the bankruptcy court was not justified in simply assigning a dollar value of zero to the liability the equivalent of saying that there was no chance whatsoever any liability would be incurred.the bankruptcy court implicitly recognized this fact when it noted that p erhaps,upon a thorough review,atn,in,should have anticipated a contingent liability to atn in some amount,but exactly million seems far fetched.it is of course correct to say that amount of the could not have been predicted with any accuracy in.but the court erred by using this uncertainty to completely discount the value of the liability accordingly,the court concludes that no downward adjustment to add a million contingent liability payable to wats is merited.order at,at emphasis added.
thus the bankruptcy court erred by failing to downwardly adjust atn assets according to the discounted value of atn obligation to wats.the bankruptcy court effectively gave full positive value to atn contingent assets,and no negative value to its contingent debts.as a result,it substantially overvalued the company 
iii.atn received no reasonably equivalent value for the transfer 
in order to make out a successful fraudulent transfer claim,atn must show not only that it was insolvent at the time of the challenged action,but also that it failed to receive a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transfer.stat.ann.the bankruptcy court here found that atn failed on this prong as well.this conclusion,too,was error.
by its terms and application,the concept of reasonably equivalent value does not demand a precise exchange.in re perry county foods,citing butler aviation int l,whyte matter of fairchild aircraft,cir.the benefit received need not be entirely direct,and courts have occasionally upheld as reasonably equivalent value the cessation of shareholder disputes.schaps just enough corporation in re pinto trucking service,finding reasonable value where company transferred to fighting shareholders and forgave shareholder loans totaling.nevertheless,courts are to scrutinize the value of transfers much more closely in situations such as this one,which involve transfers to insiders.see general electric capital auto lease,broach in re lucas dallas.
it is clear from the record that atn received nothing in return at the actual time of the transfer,other than the arguable value of the cessation of allen and carpenter litigation.as the bankruptcy court noted,t he subsequent decision by atn to characterize the transfers as a loan to carpenter was an afterthought to balance atn financial records.although the allens would later argue that carpenter shareholder loans were effectively an asset of atn,the bankruptcy court noted that carpenter later agreement to repay atn for the transfers to the allens does not discount the reality that atn,not carpenter,initially made all of the payments.the court emphasized that although the allens were not involved in the mechanics of how atn and carpenter gather ed the money,they,and everyone involved in management at atn,knew the monies could only come from atn.we thus can not count the value of carpenter promise towards any value that atn received,because atn clearly did not receive the promise in exchange for the transfer.stat.ann.emphasis added.
even if we were to consider the value of carpenter shareholder loans,however,the value of those loans would have to be deeply discounted to reflect carpenter precarious financial situation at the time he made them.as the district court noted,and as explained in more detail above,carpenter ability to repay the loans was directly tied to his ability to improve atn profitability.if the company succeeded,carpenter prospered.conversely,if atn failed,so did he.carpenter certainly had no independent income or assets available to repay the substantial shareholders loans.order at,at emphasis added.the trial court also found that atn business was one that generated substantial cash in short periods of time,and thus that there was a possibility that promise was backed only by the ability of the company to generate substantial be able to pay off some of the loans.this does not change the fact,however,that carpenter had essentially pledged the value of the company,which the parties agree met the statutory definition of presumptive insolvency,against itself.these promises were built on sand and delivered after the fact.therefore,they do not present a reasonably equivalent value to the million transfer to the allens.
in addition to carpenter promises,the bankruptcy court found that the second major value atn received for its millions of dollars of payment to the allens was a quantifiable and more importantly,a final resolution of the dispute between the allens and carpenter continuation of the litigation brought uncertainty,the possibility of an unfavorable judgment against atn,and a guarantee of substantia
