background 
at issue here are the proceeds of certain inventory that van diest supply sold to hennings feed and crop care.hennings was a retail dealer in agricultural products,including chemicals,fertilizer,and limestone who purchased inventory from multiple suppliers,including van diest.in,van diest and hennings executed an agreement that granted van diest a purchase money security interest in inventory supplied by van diest,and the proceeds from such inventory.we concluded in an earlier case that the security interest did not extend to all hennings inventory instead,it was limited to inventory van diest supplied to hennings.shelby county state bank van diest supply,cir.
although hennings had multiple suppliers,it did not segregate inventory by supplier,track inventory by supplier,or know on any given day how much inventory it had on hand from any supplier.on may,hennings and shelby signed a draw rate agreement that allowed hennings to draw up to million at a time,and shelby made advances to hennings under the note in exchange for hennings accounts receivable.shelby then collected the receivables.shelby purchased hennings receivables from may until either december,or january,and received payments totaling over million.
in late march or early april,van diest received a financial statement from hennings dated september.based on the financial statement,van diest credit manager believed hennings was insolvent.van diest had already shipped additional product to hennings,and payment was not due until june.hennings was still current on its obligations,and van diest did not take any steps to enforce its rights under its security agreement with hennings.
april also marked the first time that hennings conducted a physical inventory.at the time,hennings computer records listed an inventory of approximately million,but a check of the physical inventory revealed a missing million in inventory.
hennings first defaulted on a payment to van diest on june,and that day,van diest sent a demand letter to hennings requesting payment in full.van diest did not learn of shelby factoring arrangement with hennings until july.hennings filed for bankruptcy the next month,on august.van diest then demanded payment of the funds paid to shelby from the accounts factored under the note,and shelby refused to pay van diest.
van diest filed suit against shelby,alleging that shelby converted its property.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of shelby,and van diest now appeals.
ii.analysis 
our review of a district court grant of summary judgment is de novo.dumas infinity broad,cir.summary judgment is proper only when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.e celotex catrett,d.we will review all the facts and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of van diest,the party.dumas,at.to defeat a motion for summary judgment,the party can not rest on the mere allegations or denials contained in his pleadings,but must present sufficient evidence to show the existence of each element of its case on which it will bear the burden at trial.robin espo eng g,cir citations omitted.however,neither presenting a scintilla of evidence,nor the mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties or some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts,is sufficient to oppose a motion for summary judgment the party must supply evidence sufficient to allow a jury to render a verdict in his favor.id.at internal citations omitted.
van diest sued shelby under a theory of conversion,a dispute governed by state law.in diversity cases,we apply the substantive law of the state in which the district court sits.erie tompkins.here,illinois law governs the dispute.in order to recover for conversion in illinois,a plaintiff must show a right to the property an absolute and unconditional right to the immediate possession of the property a demand for possession and that the defendant wrongfully and without authorization assumed control,dominion,or ownership over the property.cirrincione johnson.
van diest held a perfected,first priority purchase money security interest in the inventory it sold to hennings.shelby,also a secured party,claimed a security interest in all inventory,accounts receivable,and equipment of hennings.van diest contends that shelby converted its property when shelby received the proceeds from the sale of inventory van diest had supplied to hennings.van diest does not challenge the district court finding that the funds hennings paid to shelby directly by check written on hennings bank accounts are not at issue.still at issue,though,are the direct payments to shelby from hennings customers which did not pass through hennings bank account.after hennings drew on the note,and shelby received accounts,hennings customers either paid shelby directly or wrote checks to hennings,which hennings delivered to shelby.van diest contends it can show that each of these payments came from the sale of its collateral by showing the proportion of hennings inventory on the date of each transaction that was attributable to product that van diest had provided to hennings.
the conduct that forms the basis of van diest complaint occurred before july,and before the illinois legislature enacted a revised version of article to its uniform commercial code.see.july.the parties do not dispute that the code as it existed prior to july,applies in this case.at the time relevant here,the code defined proceeds to include whatever is received upon the sale,exchange,collection or other disposition of collateral or proceeds.ilcs west.significantly here,the code also provided that a party continued to have a security interest in the proceeds of the sale of inventory to the extent that the proceeds were identifiable.ilcs west.
it is clear in illinois that commingling does not necessarily make proceeds unidentifiable.first,ilcs west specifically provides that a security interest is not invalid by reason of liberty in the debtor to use,commingle,or dispose of all or part of the collateral or to use,commingle,or dispose of proceeds.in addition,section west states that a security interest continues in any identifiable proceeds.finally,the illinois supreme court recognized in funk sons,sullivan,that a security interest could continue in a commingled account if the proceeds were identifiable.see also brown williamson tobacco first bank,cir.therefore,so long as the proceeds were identifiable,van diest security interest in the proceeds of the sale of the inventory it supplied to hennings continued.
the code does not define the term identifiable.it does,however,direct that its provisions should be supplemented by principles of law and equity.ilcs west.like many other courts,the illinois supreme court has construed this provision to allow a party to identify proceeds using a tracing theory known in the law of trusts as the lowest intermediate balance rule.see funk,at.
in this case,the district court concluded that van diest did not present evidence sufficient to allow it to identify its proceeds.therefore,it concluded that van diest had not presented evidence that it had an ownership interest in the proceeds shelby received from the sale of hennings inventory,an immediate right to posse
