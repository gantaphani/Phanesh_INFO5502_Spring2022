richard hamlett appeals the district court judgment affirming two orders of the bankruptcy vacating a prior default judgment against his creditor,amsouth bank,and one denying his motion to avoid liens held by amsouth.the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in vacating hamlett default judgment on the ground that he had not properly served amsouth.nor did the bankruptcy court err in holding that its disallowance of amsouth claims as untimely did not void amsouth underlying liens.accordingly,we affirm.
the parties have stipulated to all relevant facts.in,hamlett conveyed deeds of trust on several parcels of real property located in salem,virginia to secure loans serviced by dovenmuehle mortgage,for amsouth bank.at some point neither the record nor the briefs indicate exactly when,hamlett filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code.see west and supp.in the course of hamlett bankruptcy proceedings,amsouth through dovenmuehle filed seven proofs of claim regarding its secured interests in hamlett property.upon the trustee objection,the bankruptcy court disallowed five of these claims as not timely filed.
on october,hamlett filed an adversary proceeding requesting,pursuant to d west,that the court avoid the liens held by amsouth on his properties.hamlett served his complaint by certified mail on edward parker,amsouth registered agent in virginia.when amsouth did not file a responsive pleading and did not appear at the conference,hamlett moved for a default judgment.on january,the bankruptcy court granted the motion and ordered that the amsouth liens be avoided.
in response,on january,amsouth filed an answer to the complaint and moved that the court set aside the default judgment on the ground that service on its registered agent did not comply with federal rule of bankruptcy procedure h.see fed.h.the bankruptcy court vacated the default judgment,finding service did not meet rule h requirement that service be made on an officer of the institution.
the bankruptcy court then proceeded to determine the merits of the adversary proceeding,whether amsouth liens were void under d because amsouth had not timely filed its claims.the court concluded that amsouth failure to timely file its claims did not automatically extinguish its underlying liens and thus ordered that hamlett to avoid the liens be denied and dismissed.
hamlett appealed both orders to the district court.after full briefing and oral argument,the district court affirmed,adopting as its findings and opinions the rationale of the bankruptcy court.hamlett then noted a timely appeal to this court.
because a district court sits as an appellate court in bankruptcy matters,we apply the same standard of review that the district court applied.in this case,we review the bankruptcy court order vacating hamlett default judgment for abuse of discretion.see park lexington ins,cir.we review de novo its order denying hamlett motion to avoid amsouth liens.see in re bunker,cir see also in re southeast hotel props,cir.
the bankruptcy court vacated hamlett default judgment against amsouth,finding that hamlett service of process on amsouth did not comply with the requirement under federal rule of bankruptcy procedure h that service of process be made on an officer of the institution.hamlett argues that service on amsouth registered agent satisfied the requirements of the rule.
with exceptions not relevant here,rule h provides 
service on an insured depository institution as defined in section of the federal deposit insurance act in a contested matter or adversary proceeding shall be made by certified mail addressed to an officer of the institution.
in support of his contention that service on amsouth registered agent satisfied rule h,hamlett focuses initially not on the language of the rule,which was enacted as part of the bankruptcy reform act of,but on its legislative history.in fact,neither the plain language of rule h nor its history support hamlett position.
a comparison of rule h language with that of other federal rules governing service of process on entities and corporations clearly evidences a congressional intent to fashion more rigorous service of process requirements for adversary proceedings initiated against insured depository institutions.for example,rules d a and h of the federal rules of civil procedure and rule b of the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure,all of which were promulgated prior to rule h,provide for service of process on an officer,a managing or general agent,or on any other agent authorized by appointment or by law.in contrast,rule h does not contain any of the language referring to agents,but instead provides for service solely on an officer of the institution.congress could easily have included within rule h the same general or authorized agent language contained in the other rules.indeed,simply adopting the language of the other rules would seem to have been the easiest course.that congress did not do this indicates clearly that it did not deem service on a designated agent sufficient under rule h.
the rule legislative history bears this out.contrary to hamlett suggestion that the only purpose of the rule was to require that service of process on a bank be accomplished by certified mail,the legislative history indicates that congress added rule h largely in response to the perceived need to grant additional safeguards to depository institutions involved in adversary proceedings.see cong.rec.daily ed,discussing bill to amend rule to require that service of process on an insured depository institution be made upon an officer of the institution cong.rec.daily ed.april,same.in doing so,congress apparently determined that requiring service of process by certified mail and restricting such service to an officer of these institutions would achieve this goal.thus,nothing in the rule itself or its history suggests that congress intended the term officer in rule h to include registered agent.
hamlett also seeks to rely on virginia law for his contention that service on amsouth registered agent was proper.he first maintains that under virginia law a corporation is not required to appoint a registered agent,but if it does appoint a registered agent,as amsouth did,then service on that agent satisfies virginia law and,by extension,rule h.alternatively,hamlett contends that in designating a registered agent,amsouth effectively waived its entitlement to service of process on an officer of the institution.both of these arguments fail.
first,hamlett misreads virginia law.under the law of virginia,amsouth,a foreign corporation doing business in virginia,must designate a registered agent,but service on that agent is not necessarily the required means of serving a corporation.see c lexis supp stating that provision of the code identifying registered agent as corporation agent for service of process does not prescribe the required means of serving a corporation id.requiring each foreign corporation seeking to do business in virginia to maintain a registered agent.thus,service on amsouth registered agent does not necessarily satisfy virginia requirements,let alone rule h.furthermore,since virginia law requires amsouth to designate a registered agent,the bank action in doing so can not be read as any sort of waiver of its right to receive service on an officer of the institution as provided for under the federal rule.
moreover,even if hamlett had not misread virginia law,he could not prevail because,as amsouth notes,state law should not and does not preempt federal procedural law in this context.see fed.the bankruptcy rules and forms govern procedure in cases under title of the united states code.see also in re edmonston,cir the bankruptcy rules govern procedure in all bankruptcy proceedings unless inconsistent with either title or title,united states code.diamond mortg.of sugar,cir holding that the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure apply to adversary proceedings without regard to judicial forum in re,finding that rule supercedes the state rule for service of process.
accordingly,we agree with the district court that the bankruptcy court did not abuse
