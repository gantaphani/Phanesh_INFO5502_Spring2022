eric mwangi and pauline mwicharo collectively the debtors were account holders at wells fargo bank.when wells fargo discovered that the debtors had filed a voluntary chapter bankruptcy petition,it placed a temporary administrative pledge on the debtors accounts.wells fargo then requested instructions from the chapter trustee regarding the distribution of account funds,a portion of which the debtors claimed as exempt under nevada revised statutes g.
in this case,we must decide whether the debtors can state a claim for a willful violation of a which proscribes any act to obtain possession of property of the estate or of property from the estate or to exercise control over property of the estate based on the operation of wells fargo administrative pledge.we hold that they can not state such a claim.before the account funds revested in the debtors,they remained estate property,and the debtors had no right to possess or control them.accordingly,the operation of the administrative pledge could cause the debtors no injury before the account funds revested.after the account funds revested in the debtors,they lost their status as estate property and thus were no longer subject to a.we therefore affirm the district court order affirming the bankruptcy court judgment of dismissal with prejudice.
facts and procedural history 
the debtors filed a voluntary chapter bankruptcy petition on august.at that time,the debtors held four accounts at wells fargo,with an aggregate balance of.the debtors did not list two of the four accounts in their original schedule b,nor did they claim an exemption for any account funds in their original schedule c.but the debtors did list wells fargo as an unsecured creditor for two debts totaling.mwangi wells fargo bank,in re mwangi ii.
each night,wells fargo runs a computerized comparison of all newly filed chapter bankruptcy petitions against its list of account holders.when wells fargo discovered the debtors bankruptcy filing,it placed a temporary administrative pledge on all four of their accounts.id.wells fargo then sent a letter dated august,to the chapter trustee,requesting instructions as to how wells fargo should dispose of the account funds.in the letter to the trustee,wells fargo stated that upon the filing of the bankruptcy petition,the account funds became property of the bankruptcy estate,payable only to the trustee or upon the trustee order.wells fargo advised the trustee that it would maintain a hold on the account funds until it received direction from the trustee regarding their disposition or until days after the scheduled meeting of creditors.
also on august,wells fargo sent letters to the debtors counsel,stating that the account funds had become estate property and that,as such,the account funds were no longer available to the debtors.the letters further stated that wells fargo had requested instruction from the trustee,and suggested that the debtors might be able to expedite a decision regarding the account funds distribution by contacting the trustee directly.
on august,the debtors filed an amended schedule b in which they included all four of their wells fargo accounts.the debtors also filed an amended schedule c in which they claimed an exemption in percent of the value of each of their wells fargo accounts,relying on nevada revised statutes g,which provides an exemption for percent of a debtor disposable earnings.no party ever objected to the exemption claimed by the debtors in the account funds.
on august,the debtors counsel contacted wells fargo to request that the hold be lifted because the debtors claimed an exemption in a portion of the funds.wells fargo refused to lift the hold without the trustee agreement.
on august,the debtors filed a motion in the bankruptcy court seeking sanctions pursuant to k against wells fargo,based on wells fargo alleged intentional violation of the automatic stay provisions in a and a.the bankruptcy court denied this motion,concluding that wells fargo could not have violated the automatic stay because the automatic stay applies only to property of the bankruptcy estate,and exempt property never becomes estate property and wells fargo took no action to collect,assess,or recover any prepetition claim against the debtors.
the debtors appealed to the bankruptcy appellate panel bap,which reversed the bankruptcy court.mwangi wells fargo bank,in re mwangi i,cir.first,the bap rejected wells fargo argument that the supreme court decision in citizens bank of maryland strumpf,authorizes wells fargo policy of temporary administrative pledges.according to the bap,strumpf authorizes a bank to impose a temporary administrative hold only to preserve setoff rights,and in this case,wells fargo denied any intent to protect setoff rights.in re mwangi i,at.second,the bap found that the debtors had an inchoate interest in the account funds,which remained part of the bankruptcy estate.id.at.third,the bap held that right to claim exemptions in estate property bestows standing on debtors to pursue sanctions for violations of automatic stay provisions.id.at.fourth,the bap held that wells fargo had violated a by exercising control over estate property.id.at.the bap reasoned that the turnover provisions of the bankruptcy code are and that the debtors were not required to take any action to ripen their interest in the account funds before asserting a violation of automatic stay provisions.id.at.finally,the bap remanded the case to the bankruptcy court to determine whether wells fargo retention of the account funds was reasonable and,if not,whether the debtors had suffered damages.id.at.
on remand,the bankruptcy court denied the motion for sanctions the debtors then filed an adversary class action against wells fargo,alleging violations of a automatic stay provision.wells fargo moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim,and the bankruptcy court eventually dismissed the adversary class action with prejudice.the bankruptcy court concluded that the debtors lacked standing to pursue any alleged violations of a automatic stay provision with respect to the account funds because the trustee alone has standing to protect estate property.in addition,the bankruptcy court concluded that the debtors could not allege any injury to their inchoate interest in the account funds because they had no right to possess estate property.
the debtors then appealed the bankruptcy court decision to the district court.relying principally on this court intervening decision in gebhart gaughan in re gebhart,cir,the district court first set out its analytical framework.in the district court view,if there is no objection to a debtor claimed exemption,the property is exempt from the property of the estate and passes immediately to the debtor upon expiration of federal rule of bankruptcy procedure b objections period.in re mwangi ii,at.there is an exception to this general rule,however,if 
the statute permitting the debtor to claim a particular exemption does not allow the debtor to exempt the entire property interest,but instead permits exemption of an interest in the property up to a particular dollar amount,what is removed from the estate is an interest in the property equal to the value of the exemption claimed at filing.
id.at quoting in re gebhart,at internal quotation marks omitted.in such cases,the asset remains estate property,and the estate does not relinquish the property until it is administered in the bankruptcy,the trustee abandons the property,or the bankruptcy case is closed.id.
applying this analytical framework,the district court found that the statute at issue here permits a debtor to exempt the entire property interest.id.at.accordingly,before the objections period ran,the account funds remained in the bankruptcy estate.id.at.the district court found that wells fargo could not violate a automatic stay provision during this period because the debtors had no right to possess or control the account funds.id.after the objections period ran,however,the property that the debtors claimed as exempt passed out of the bankruptcy estate.during this second period,wells fargo could not violate a automatic stay provision because that provision applies only to estate property.id.therefore,because wells fargo administrative hold did not injure the debtors under a,the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court judgment of dismissal with prejudice.id.at.

iii.statutory framework 
the filing of a chapter bankruptcy petition automatically creates an estate.a.subject to exceptions not relevant here,the property of the bankruptcy estate includes all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.id.a.the trustee is the representative of this estate,id,and the debtor has a duty to surrender to the trustee all estate property,id.a.
by filing a bankruptcy petition,the debtor immediately obtains the protection of an automatic stay.id.a.the automatic stay is designed to effect an immediate freeze of the status quo by precluding and nullifying actions,judicial or nonjudicial,in nonbankruptcy fora against the debtor or affecting the property of the estate.hillis motors,haw.auto.dealers ass n,cir.the stay thus protects the debtor by allowing it breathing space and also protects creditors as a class from the possibility that one creditor will obtain payment on its claims to the detriment of all others.id.
the specific stay provision at issue here is a,which proscribes any act to obtain possession of property of the estate or of property from the estate or to exercise control over property of the estate.section k provides the enforcement mechanism for the automatic stay a n individual injured by any willful violation of a stay provided by this section shall recover actual damages,including costs and attorneys fees,and,in appropriate circumstances,may recover punitive damages.
in addition to the operation of the automatic stay,the turnover provisions of help preserve the status quo of the bankruptcy estate at the time of its formation.the relevant turnover provision in this appeal is b,which provides that an entity that owes a debt that is property of the estate and that is matured,payable on demand,or payable on order,shall pay such debt to,or on the order of,the trustee,except to the extent that such debt may be offset under section of this title against a claim against the debtor.
although,as previously noted,the debtor is required to surrender all estate property to the trustee,the debtor may claim certain exemptions.to do so,the debtor must file a list of property that he claims as exempt.id.l.a party in interest may then file an objection to the list of property claimed as exempt within days after the meeting of creditors held under a is concluded or within days after any amendment to the list or supplemental schedules is filed,whichever is later.fed.b.if a party in interest does not object during the objections period,however,the property claimed as exempt on such list is exempt.l.this is true even if the debtor had no good faith basis for the claim of exemption.in re gebhart,at.the effect of an exemption is that the debtor interest in the property is withdrawn from the estate and hence from the creditors for the benefit of the debtor.id.at quoting owen owen.indeed,i t is widely accepted that property deemed exempt from a debtor bankruptcy estate revests in the debtor.smith kennedy in re smith,cir.
iv.discussion 
although this statutory framework is undisputed,the parties contest how it applies to the case before us.the parties disagreement revolves around a when exempted property revests in the debtor under nevada revised statutes g b whether the alleged willful violation of a injured the debtors property interest c whether the debtors were required to take any action to perfect their claim of exemption before asserting a claim for damages and d whether the debtors have a claim under a.
a.the revesting of property under nevada revised statutes g 
resolution of this appeal requires us to determine when the account funds revested in the debtors,when the debtors developed a right to possess or control the account funds.the supreme court decision in schwab reilly,guides our analysis.there,the court considered whether an interested party must object to a claimed exemption where the relevant statute defines the property the debtor is authorized to exempt as an interest,the value of which may not exceed a certain dollar amount,in a particular type of asset rather than as the asset itself.id.at.the court concluded that an interested party has no duty to object so long as the asserted value of the property claimed as exempt is within the limits the statute allows.id.at.in addition,the court found that even when a debtor claims an exemption in an amount that is equal to the full value of the property as stated in the petition and the trustee fails to object,the asset itself remains in the estate only an interest in the property equal to the value of the exemption claimed at filing is removed from the estate.id.at.
we applied schwab holding in in re gebhart.there,we considered two statutes that allow a debtor to exempt an interest in real property,the value of which may not exceed a certain dollar amount.in re gebhart,at.relying on schwab,we held that the fact that the value of the claimed exemption was equal to the market value of the residence at the time of filing the petition did not remove the entire asset from the estate.id.instead,what was removed from the estate was an interest in the property equal to the value of the exemption.id.internal quotation marks omitted.as a result,the asset would remain estate property until it was administered in bankruptcy,the trustee abandoned the asset,or the bankruptcy case closed.id.at,see also schwab,at where a debtor intends to exempt nothing more than an interest and an interested party does not object to the claimed interest,title to the asset will remain with the estate pursuant to,and the debtor will be guaranteed a payment in the dollar amount of the exemption.
the bap concluded that schwab applies to all exemptions,not just exemptions of an interest,the value of which may not exceed a certain dollar amount.in re mwangi i,at.under this view,all exempt property remains estate property until it is administered in bankruptcy,the trustee abandons the asset,or the bankruptcy case closes.we disagree.the general rule is that exempt property immediately revests in the debtor.see in re gebhart,at the effect of an exemption is that the debtor interest in the property is withdrawn from the estate and hence from the creditors for the benefit of the debtor.quoting owen,at bell bell in re bell,cir quite simply,property that has been exempted belongs to the debtor.we read schwab and in re gebhart as an exception to this general rule,motivated by the fact that certain statutes exempt only a partial interest in an asset,the value of which may fluctuate during the pendency of the bankruptcy case.accordingly,in our view,schwab and in re gebhart are limited to exemptions of an interest,the value of which may not exceed a certain dollar amount.
the question then becomes whether the relevant exemption in this case falls within the schwab and in re gebhart exception to the general rule that exempt property immediately revests in the debtor.we conclude that it does not.under schwab and in re gebhart,we look to the text of the statute to determine whether the statute exempts the asset or an interest therein.schwab,at in re gebhart,at.nevada revised statutes g purports to exempt percent of the disposable earnings of a judgment debtor during any workweek.on its face,g defines the property that the debtor is authorized to exempt as the asset itself,disposable earnings therefore,g does not fall within the schwab and in re gebhart exception,and the
