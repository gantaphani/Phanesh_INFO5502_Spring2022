the panel held that the bankruptcy court did not clearly err when it found bad faith and did not abuse its discretion when it converted the debtors chapter proceedings to chapter proceedings.
concurring in part,judge rawlinson agreed with the majority that the bankruptcy court acted within its discretion when it converted the proceedings from chapter to chapter.she also joined the majority conclusion that b applies to debtors who are individuals.judge rawlinson dissented from the conclusion of the majority that b was inapplicable because the creditor claims did not arise from a purchase or sale of securities.
fernandez,circuit judge 
zafar david khan and terrance alexander tomkow collectively debtors appeal the judgment of the bankruptcy appellate panel of the ninth circuit bap,which affirmed the decision of the bankruptcy court that the claim of kenneth barton was not subordinated pursuant to the provisions of b and converted the debtors chapter bankruptcy proceedings to chapter proceedings we affirm the decision of the bankruptcy court.
background 
in,barton obtained a superior court of the state of california superior court judgment against the debtors and rpost international,ril for conversion,fraud,breach of fiduciary duty,and violation of california business and professions code section,based upon barton allegations that the debtors fraudulently converted his shares of common stock in ril.
the superior court found that after barton and the debtors founded ril,they each received an initial distribution of ril stock in.the consideration for the stock was stated to be unreimbursed expenses and compensation.
after suffering a stroke,barton took leave from ril.thereafter,the debtors cancelled barton shares of stock and returned them to the ril treasury in june or july of.the superior court held that the debtors fraudulently converted barton stock in and determined that they had forged corporate resolutions in an attempt to support their fraud and either misplaced or destroyed the shareholder registry,which was the best evidence of the issuance of the stock.the superior court then ruled that barton should recover damages and that his shares should be reinstated.after further hearings,the superior court determined barton should,instead,receive the value of the converted stock.therefore,it fixed damages for the conversion at,based upon the value of the ril stock as of june,the date of conversion,which was per share.after adjustments,a judgment including for the converted shares was entered in barton favor.
a few days before the superior court intended to determine the value of the ril stock for the award of compensatory and punitive damages,each of the debtors had separately filed a chapter petition for bankruptcy.at the creditors meeting hearing,the debtors did not give meaningful information regarding their companies business transactions,stock valuation,and settlements.and,in their chapter schedules,they each reported their ril stock as having a value and listed barton conversion judgment as having a value of only with a remainder unliquidated pending the superior court proceedings.neither debtor filed amended schedules or an amended plan that included the full value of the judgment after it was rendered.
barton filed a proof of claim in each case and the debtors objected.they argued that the claims should be mandatorily subordinated under b,which,they said,would render the claim unenforceable and subject to disallowance under b.the debtors also filed separate actions for mandatory subordination and disallowance on the same grounds as those alleged in their objections.the bankruptcy court dismissed the separate actions after the parties litigated the claim objections to resolution because the same result would apply to those actions.
barton had filed separate motions to convert each case to chapter,arguing that the debtors acted in bad faith,which was cause to convert under c.
after a hearing,the bankruptcy court ruled on the debtors claim objections based on subordination and disallowance and on barton motions to convert.it held that barton claims were not subject to subordination because they were not for damages arising from the purchase or sale of a security.b.rather,the bankruptcy court determined that barton claims were based upon the superior court judgment for fraud and conversion.the bankruptcy court did not specifically address the disallowance issue,but did dismiss the debtors separate objections related to that issue.finally,the court granted barton motions to convert.as to each of the debtors,it found that the timing of the filing was intended to defeat the state court action because it was likely that there was going to be an award of damages that would have put these debtors outside a chapter.it also found that the debtors manipulated the bankruptcy process and concealed assets.the debtors then appealed to the bap.
the bap affirmed the bankruptcy court subordination determination,but on different grounds.it determined that b did not apply in an individual debtor case.khan i,at.the bap also affirmed the bankruptcy court refusal to disallow barton claims because they were not subject to subordination and,even if they were,there was no basis for claims disallowance under b.id.at.lastly,the bap held that the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion when it found bad faith and converted the cases from chapter proceedings to chapter proceedings.id.at.these appeals followed.
jurisdiction and standards of review 
we have jurisdiction pursuant to d.
we review decisions of the bap de novo.aalfs wirum in re straightline,cir.this court independently reviews the bankruptcy court rulings on appeal from the bap.miller cardinale in re deville,cir.because we are in as good a position as the bap to review bankruptcy court rulings,we independently examine the bankruptcy court decision,reviewing the bankruptcy court interpretation of the bankruptcy code de novo and its factual findings for clear error.id.we accept findings of fact made by the bankruptcy court unless those findings leave the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed by the bankruptcy judge.aalfs,at internal quotation marks omitted.
we review for abuse of discretion the bankruptcy court ultimate decisions to convert the cases from chapter to chapter.rosson fitzgerald in re rosson,cir.a court abuses its discretion when it makes a factual finding that was illogical,implausible,or without support in inferences that may be drawn from the facts in the record.united states hinkson,cir.en banc.we review the bankruptcy court finding of bad faith for clear error.leavitt soto in re leavitt,cir.
discussion 
we will first consider the debtors assertion that the bankruptcy court and the bap erred when they determined that b did not apply thereafter,we will consider their argument that those courts should not have determined that the conversion of their proceedings from chapter to chapter was appropriate.
subordination of barton claims 
section b requires that claims for damages arising from the purchase or sale of a security of the debtor or of an affiliate of the debtor shall be subordinated to certain other claims or interests as already noted,the bankruptcy court determined that the section did not apply because barton claims did not arise from the purchase or sale of a security.the bap affirmed the bankruptcy court on the basis that the section did not apply because the debtors were individuals.see khan i,at.however,after the bap ruled,we held that b does apply when debtors are individuals and in doing so we specifically disagreed with khan see liquidating tr.comm.of the del biaggio liquidating tr.freeman in re del biaggio,cir.that effectively overturned the basis of the bap decision,and we now make that explicit by rejecting the bap contrary decision.
nevertheless,we affirm the bankruptcy court decision on the basis stated by that court,that is,we agree that barton claims did not arise out of a purchase or sale of securities.no doubt barton did purchase securities in ril in shortly after ril was founded.also,we assume that ril is an affiliate of the debtors however,barton claims against the debtors do not arise from his purchase of ril securities.rather,they are based upon the judgment entered against the debtors by the superior court on account of their actions many years later when they fraudulently converted barton stock.
of course,we have given a broad interpretation to the arising from language of the statute.for example,in del biaggio,we found a sufficient nexus to a purchase and sale where the claimant freeman had been fraudulently induced by the individual debtor to invest in an affiliate of the debtor.we pointed out that freeman claim is really no claim at all but for his investment in the affiliate.del biaggio,at.in fact,freeman claim was not for misrepresentations as such,but for the investment he made in detrimental reliance on those misrepresentations.id.and what he sought correspond ed exactly to the amount he invested.id.
the case at hand is quite different from del biaggio because here what barton seeks has nothing to do with his investment,other than the fact that he had purchased the securities many years earlier.and the damages he sought were not remotely related to the purchase they were simply a judgment measured by the value of the converted property when the conversion took place.
we recognize that in other cases,where no actual purchase or sale had been consummated,we found that claims,nevertheless,arose from a purchase or sale transaction.see,pensco tr.tristar esperanza,llc in re tristar esperanza,llc,cir.the claim arose out of a failed agreement by the debtor to purchase claimant stock am.broad,nugent in re betacom of phoenix,cir.a merger fell through so no ultimate sale took place,but claim still arose from a sales transaction.while those cases do bespeak a broad interpretation of arising from,there is a limit to the reach of b,which stops short of encompassing every transaction that touches on or involves stock in a corporation.that is well explicated in racusin am.wagering,in re am.wagering,cir.
in racusin,the claimant was promised that due to past services he would be paid,in part,with common stock of the company upon completion of a common offering or initial public offering.id.at.when the contract was breached,he sued the company and others for damages.id.the district court determined that racusin should receive shares of stock,and he appealed.id.he did so on the basis that he did not want stock he wanted damages.we agreed with him.id.thus,we remanded the case to the district court to calculate the monetary value of the shares.id.the amount was determined,the debtors quickly filed for bankruptcy,racusin filed a claim,and the debtors asserted that b required subordination.id.we disagreed.id.at.we pointed out that racusin did not seek to be,and was not,a shareholder.rather,the value of the stock was just the measuring stick for determining the compensation owed for services he performed pursuant to a contract that the debtors breached.id.at.thus,he was a true creditor rather than an equity investor in a corporation.see also in re angeles,bankr.cal.debtor had committed bad acts after claimant purchase of securities was complete,and claims did not arise from the purchase,aff,cir.
here,barton sought and obtained damages.even though his damage award for conversion was based on the value of the securities at the time of conversion,his action did not arise out of the purchase of the securities and the risks that the purchase might entail.it arose out of the debtors conversion of the securities many years later.the value of the securities at the date of conversion was the measuring stick.
moreover,the rationales for the b subordination requirement do not apply here.primarily,the separate wrongdoing of the debtors had no connection to the purchase or sale of barton shares of stock in ril nor did the judgments against the debtors that form the basis for barton bankruptcy claims arise from a purchase or sale.in any event,the risk that those who purchase or sell stock investors in a corporation assume and expect to take is not that the shares themselves will later be stolen outright by other individuals nor,to the extent it applies at all,does the equity cushion rationale affect our decision here even if the debtors creditors did,somehow,rely upon the equity contributed by ril investors,that does not touch upon the separate torts committed by the debtors in this case.
in short,the bankruptcy court did not err when it refused to subordinate barton claims pursuant to b.
ii.conversion of chapter proceedings to chapter proceedings 
the debtors also assert that the bankruptcy court clearly erred when it found bad faith and abused its discretion when it converted their chapter proceedings to chapter proceedings we disagree.the bankruptcy court was required to and did consider the totality of the circumstances.eisen curry in re eisen,cir.per curiam internal quotation marks omitted.however,the debtors point to the factors we outlined in leavitt,at.those are 
whether the debtor misrepresented facts in his petition or plan,unfairly manipulated the bankruptcy code,or otherwise filed his chapter petition or plan in an inequitable manner 
the debtor history of filings and dismissals 
whether the debtor only intended to defeat state court litigation and 
whether egregious behavior is present.
id.citations,internal quotation marks,and brackets omitted.the bankruptcy court was well aware of those factors,and declared that the second factor did not cut against the debtors.it did,however,find manipulation of the bankruptcy proceedings first factor and interference with the state proceedings third factor.moreover,although it did not specifically mention the egregiousness of the debtors behavior,it plainly thought that the behavior was quite troubling at the very least fourth factor.the bap agreed with the bankruptcy court analysis.see khan i,at.
the debtors attack those determinations and concentrate a good deal of their firepower on leavitt third factor.leavitt,at see also chinichian campolongo in re chinichian,cir.they focus on the word only and take that to mean that defeating state court litigation had to be the sole motive,but we have not so treated it.for example,in leavitt itself we decided that avoidance was merely the primary motive.leavitt,at see also eisen,at if only intent is to defeat state court litigation,that is bad faith chinichian,at multitude of factors showed bad faith,including the real purpose of the filing.the debtors do not appear to recognize that the factors are simply factors to consider and that not every one of them must be met.that rather blinds them to the overarching requirement that what matters is the totality of the circumstances.eisen,at see also ho dowell in re ho,cir.a court must decide in the light of all militating factors.the bap recognized that.see khan i,at.as the bap put it even if a debtor presents more than one purpose for filing,the third leavitt factor does not fail to support cause if the other purpose also reflects bad faith.and,once again,the third factor is considered in a totality of the circumstances context.id.at.
we have carefully reviewed the record together with decisions of the bankruptcy court and the bap,and are satisfied that the evidence fully supports the determinations that there was bad faith and that conversion was appropriate.the highly suspect timing of the debtors chapter petitions,their failure and refusal to provide financial information critical to the determination of the value of their assets,and their further failure to provide information regarding the movement of funds among their various business entities all combined to justify the conversion decision.
thus,the bankruptcy court did not clearly err or abuse its discretion.
conclusion 
this case presents a saga of picaresque behavior.the debtors converted barton stock and were required by the superior court to pay substantial damages as a result.in the bankruptcy proceedings,their timing was at least suspicious,and they continued their inappropriate behavior by refusing to be forthcoming about the nature and activities of the business entities they controlled.on this record,the bankruptcy court properly determined that barton claims should not be subordinated and that the chapter proceedings should be converted to chapter proceedings.we,therefore,affirm the bankruptcy court 
affirmed.barton shall recover his costs on appeal.
i agree with the majority that the bankruptcy court acted within its discretion when it converted the debtors bankruptcy proceedings from chapter to chapter.i also join the majority conclusion that b applies to debtors who are individuals.however,i dissent from the conclusion of the majority that b is inapplicable because the claims of kenneth barton did not arise from a purchase or sale of securities.in my view,the opposite conclusion is inescapable that barton claim did arise from the purchase or sale of a security under b.
it is undisputed that barton purchased securities in rpost international.it is also undisputed that debtors impermissibly converted barton stock.however,that conversion did not erase the fact that barton subsequent claims against debtors arose from his previous purchase of securities.
the majority acknowledges that we have consistently interpreted the phrase arising from broadly.majority opinion.we most recently reiterated that interpretation in del biaggio liquidating trust freeman in re del biaggio,cir.w e observe that b arising from language reaches broadly to subordinate damage claims involving qualifying securities.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.we went on to explicate that the arising from phraseology is broader than causation and is ordinarily understood to mean originating from,having its origin in growing out of,or flowing from or in short,incident to or having connection with.id.citation omitted.
we rejected the creditor contention that his claims did not arise from the purchase or sale of securities because the claimant was indisputably an investor in the debtor affiliate.see id.at.rather,we continued to adhere to one of the general principles of corporate and bankruptcy law embodied within the text of b that creditors are entitled to be paid ahead of shareholders in the distribution of corporate assets.id.at quoting racusin american wagering in re american wagering,cir.
in del biaggio,we cited our precedent concluding that a claimant was a shareholder even though the debtor defalcation converted the claimant interest from an equity interest to a debt interest before the bankruptcy filing.id.at quoting pensco trust tristar esperanza properties,llc in re tristar esperanza properties,llc,cir.
we also referenced american broadcasting nugent in re betacom of phoenix,cir,as an example of our broad interpretation of b.see id.we explained that we applied b to a damages claim predicated on a purported breach of contract in a merger agreement because the claim was one surrounding the sale or purchase of a security of the debtor.id.quoting in re betacom,at.
in addition,we noted that our broad interpretation of the arising from language of b is consistent with the interpretations advanced by our sister circuits.see id.referencing templeton in re am.hous.found,cir.seaquest diving,lp diving,in re seaquest diving,lp,cir.rombro dufrayne in re med diversified,cir.
the majority also cites our precedent and does not attempt to distinguish it,other than to try to fit the facts of this case within the confines of our decision in american wagering.see majority opinion.however,the fit is cramped and imperfect.preliminarily,in del biaggio,we described our decision in american wagering as requiring subordination where there exists some nexus or causal relationship between the claim and the purchase of the securities.del biaggio,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted emphasis added.we explained that the facts in american wagering did not fall within our broad interpretation because,and only because,the claimant contract with the debtor was explicitly not for the purchase or sale of securities.see id.rather,the contract was explicitly for services as a financial advisor.the resulting agreement stated 
should the creditor bring in a buyer said company will be paid a commission based on of the purchase price.
in re am.wagering,at.
seven months later,another agreement was entered into between the same parties,with the following provision 
claimant has been our financial advisor for the purpose of an initial public offering as compensation he would be paid of the final evaluation in the form of common stock and cash.
after two years,the debtor filed an action against the creditor seeking to invalidate the contract in its entirety.see id.following a jury trial,a verdict was rendered in favor of the creditor for stock in an amount equal to of the final valuation of the common stock and in cash.id.consistent with this verdict,the court awarded the creditor shares of stock worth million.see id.
the creditor appealed the award,arguing that it was error for the court to award specific performance by way of bestowing stock,when the creditor requested money damages.see id.we agreed and remanded for the court to calculate the monetary equivalent of the shares.see leroy horse and sports place racusin,fed.appx,cir.on remand,the creditor was awarded monetary damages of cash plus the value of the stock as of the date when the creditor could have sold his shares.see american wagering,at.
shortly after the damages award,the debtor filed for chapter bankruptcy protection,and sought to subordinate the creditor claim pursuant to b.see id.
as we observed in del biaggio,the creditor in american wagering never sought to recover an investment loss.del biaggio,at.rather,the creditor contract with the debtor merely used stock value as a basis for calculating compensation.id.we clarified in american wagering that the creditor received a money judgment for services rendered.at.we referenced o ur earlier decision reversing the award of stock to the creditor as making it clear that the creditor underlying claim was a debt claim,not an equity claim.id.the creditor did not sue debtors as an equity investor seeking monetary damages for fraud related to their mishandling of shareholders economic investment.id.instead,the creditor brought his action as an individual who was not compensated as provided in an employment agreement.see id.
in contrast,barton initially brought his action in state court specifically describing himself as a shareholder who had been wrongfully deprived of his shares by the debtors.in his third amended complaint,barton asserted that he was issued shares of rpost international limited stock,that defendants owed.barton alleged that he was a shareholder,owed a fiduciary duty of disclosure,and defendants wrongfully converted barton shares of stock,causing barton to suffer damages a s a direct,proximate,and foreseeable result of the taking and conversion of barton shares third amended complaint,barton rpost international ltd,case no,superior court of the state of california for the county of los district,february.
consistent with barton allegations focusing exclusively on the conversion of his shares,the superior court judge continued in the same vein.indeed,the decision of the state court judge leaves no doubt about the genesis of barton claims.the state court issue d a declarati
