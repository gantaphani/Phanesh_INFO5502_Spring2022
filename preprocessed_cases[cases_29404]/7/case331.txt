background 
supplee began working for lukens,lukens in,and became an employee of bsc in when bsc acquired lukens.lukens maintained two retirement plans for its employees as a supplement to its primary retirement plan the lukens.supplemental retirement plan serp,adopted on december,and the lukens.supplemental retirement plan for lukens performance incentive plan participants lpip serp,adopted on january,collectively,the plans.supplee was promoted to a position in february,at which point he became eligible for the serp,and upon its subsequent adoption,also became eligible for the lpip serp.when bsc acquired lukens,it took over lukens obligations under the plans.
benefits under the serp and the lpip serp vested after an employee accrued five years of service,and were available in full to employees who retired at or after the age of.employees who retired before reaching,however,were entitled to receive benefits subject to an early retirement penalty of four percent of their total accrued benefits for each full year by which they were younger than,with a proportionate reduction for partial years.
although the plans were to provide benefits after retirement in the form of monthly payments,they included provisions the provisions allowing an employee to receive the present value of accrued benefits under the plans in a lump sum if any of three events occurred within five years after a change in control,meaning,essentially,the sale of the company the employee was terminated other than for cause the employee resigned because the company withheld compensation or reduced his or her salary,except where all similarly situated employees were likewise affected or the company terminated the plans without initiating similar ones.if the employee had not reached age at the time one of the three triggering events occurred,his or her payment would not be reduced by the penalty as it would have in the case of an early retirement.
bsc acquired lukens effective may.on october,bsc filed for relief under chapter in the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york.on april,within five years of bsc acquisition of lukens,bsc terminated supplee employment as part of its sale of substantially all of its assets to another company.the parties agree that bsc acquisition of lukens constituted a change of control under the plans and bsc appears not to dispute that supplee termination triggered the provisions.in may,june and july,supplee received severance payments totaling under the bethlehem severance allowance plan,a severance plan independent of the plans.on july,supplee filed a timely claim with the bankruptcy court for his payment,which he calculated as.he asserted that this claim was entitled to priority payment as an administrative expense under bsc reorganization plan,subsequently approved on october,administrative claims would be paid in full.
bsc filed an objection,asserting that supplee claim was not for an administrative expense of the estate.in a to bsc objection,supplee conceded that only a portion of his claim was entitled to priority as an administrative expense.specifically,he asserted that he had an administrative claim for the waiver of the early retirement penalty he claimed that his termination had is,for the difference between the payment he was entitled to receive because of his termination not reduced by an early retirement penalty and the present value of the retirement benefits he would have received in monthly installments if he had retired early rather than been fired reduced by an early retirement penalty.because supplee was nearly at the time of his termination,he would have been subject to the early retirement penalty had he retired at the time of his termination.as he explained in his,his monthly payment under the plans had he retired,calculated under the plans formulas and offset by the early retirement penalty,would have been,which had a present value of.as noted,he calculated the payment to which he was entitled because of his termination,in contrast,as.in his view,the difference between these two figures,which amounted to,constituted severance pay and was entitled to priority as an administrative expense under.
on december,following a hearing,the bankruptcy court granted bsc objection to supplee claim.it acknowledged that held that severance payments for terminated employees are administrative expenses,but concluded that supplee was applying too broadly in claiming that the benefits owed him were severance payments.the bankruptcy court reasoned that unlike in,in which the termination itself created the severance payments,supplee termination did not create his entitlement to benefits under the plans,but instead only accelerated the payment of benefits to which he was already entitled.the bankruptcy court also held that because the benefits were payment for past services,they were not severance payments under trustees of the amalgamated insurance fund mcfarlin,cir mcfarlin.
supplee appealed the bankruptcy court order,and in a memorandum decision and order entered march,the district court affirmed.supplee bethlehem steel in re bethlehem steel,wl.it agreed that supplee benefits were not severance payments unlike severance payments,which are earned at the time of dismissal because they compensate employees for the hardship of termination,the benefits supplee claimed were not intended to compensate him for his job loss,but instead had accrued over the course of his employment.the district court determined supplee entitlement to the benefits,therefore,to be accelerated,rather than triggered,by his termination.moreover,the district court agreed with the bankruptcy court conclusion that the benefits were not severance pay because they constituted payment for past service.in its view,p ayments under these plans were to supplement appellant retirement income under the qualified pension plan,not to compensate him for his dismissal from his employment.
supplee timely appeal to this court followed.
