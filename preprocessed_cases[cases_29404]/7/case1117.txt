the bankruptcy court dismissed the case as a sanction for failing to comply with the court orders regarding discovery and for lying to the court about compliance with discovery orders.the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court ruling and thomas consolidated industries,consolidated appeals.because the lower courts acted within their discretion in dismissing the case,we affirm.
louis levit,the trustee,filed this adversary proceeding against the defendants on november,everyone agrees that the parties did not commence discovery in earnest until august when the cogana defendants served interrogatories and document requests on robert thomas,counsel for the trustee the herbst defendants followed with document requests and interrogatories in september.on september,thomas made available for inspection several file cabinets that contained documents he believed were responsive to the document requests.he did not,however,specify which documents were responsive to each request and did not file a written response to the document request.on october,herbst served thomas with its second set of interrogatories and a second document request.once again thomas did not serve written answers to the document requests,but on january,responded in writing to both sets of herbst interrogatories.approximately eighteen of the interrogatories in the first set referenced specific allegations in the complaint and requested each and every fact upon which plaintiff bases these allegations and asked the trustee to identify all documents which plaintiff contends support these allegations.in response to every one of these eighteen different interrogatories,thomas supplied the following answer 
plaintiff can not state every fact sic at this stage of the proceedings and is not obligated to prepare the case of the defendants for trial.plaintiff relies upon frcp d,the depositions of robert thomas,juergen herbst,ed cogana,fred pollak,the witnesses referred to in these depositions,the documents produced by these parties,the documents attached to these depositions and the documents which defendants had the opportunity to inspect and copy on september.
thomas repeated this response word for word including the unmatched quotation mark and the misplaced colon in the first line eighteen times,giving no individual attention to the different allegations referenced in the interrogatories.thomas answers to the second set of interrogatories fared only a little better,with thomas replying to ten of nineteen interrogatories by referring the defendants to the september,document production.needless to say,the herbst defendants were unsatisfied with these responses and filed motions to compel.they complained that the plaintiff failed to provide written responses to the document requests and failed to make clear which documents were responsive to each request.they also alleged that the responses to the interrogatories were inadequate.
the cogana defendants received responses to their interrogatories on january,approximately one week after the response to the herbst defendants and approximately five months after the discovery was served.these interrogatories took a similar approach to those propounded by the herbst defendants,asking the trustee to state the facts in support of certain allegations in the complaint and to identify documents in support of those allegations.in response,thomas cut and pasted the reply he had given the herbst defendants,using the very same paragraph we quoted above right down to the misplaced punctuation to respond to eighteen interrogatories from cogana and seven interrogatories from pollak.in addition,thomas refused to answer six of pollak interrogatories because they were duplicates of certain of cogana interrogatories.the cogana defendants met these responses with their own motions to compel.
in each instance,thomas defended his responses as adequate.he argued that the herbst document requests were an attempt to oppress and cause expense to plaintiff,to have plaintiff prepare their case for them and to improperly gain insight into plaintiff lawyers preparation for the case.in response to cogana motion,thomas argued that interrogatories that sought the factual basis of the allegations in his complaint were an attempt to oppress and cause expense to plaintiff,to have plaintiff prepare their case for them and to improperly gain insight into plaintiff lawyers preparation of the case,thereby violating the attorney work product privilege.on march,the bankruptcy court heard all of the motions to compel together,and granted the defendants motions.in explaining its ruling,the court told thomas that the defendants were absolutely right in their motion and that thomas was absolutely wrong 
if someone were suing ford motor company on the design of an automobile,ford motor company could respond to a request for documents by saying,here,look at all our documents.i think you can see the relevance and the impossibility of that.similarly,you ca just say here are all the documents i got,take a look through them.that all you got to do.that not sufficient.you have to identify what documents you think support the allegations of fact that you have made.that not preparing the defendants case for them,that substantiating your own case.and so far you have done that.
march,tr.at.before concluding the hearing,the court emphasized the meaning of its ruling 
but i want to make it clear,thomas,that you simply have to do a better job of complying with the procedural requirements.when i order you to do something by a particular date,when it filing something,the only safe way that you can prove you complied with the order is to have a file stamped copy of the document that was supposed to be filed.and that way if the court electronic docket is wrong,i know it a problem in the clerk office and not your problem,but when you simply say that you mailed something and it never arrived,that not sufficient.i think this case is important to you.you have spent a lot of time on it,and you simply have to comply with the orders or you will never get to a trial.
march,tr.at.after thomas asked for days to respond to the outstanding discovery,the court gave him days to comply with the court order compelling discovery,setting a deadline of april.at a status hearing on april,thomas did not ask for any further time to comply with the order.thomas failed to serve any response to discovery by april.
on may,the herbst defendants moved for sanctions,requesting that the trustee claims against them be dismissed.they set the sanctions motion for a hearing in the bankruptcy court on may.on may,both the herbst and the cogana defendants received discovery responses from thomas.the certificates of service,signed by thomas as counsel for the trustee,stated that the responses were served this day of may,to the service list attached hereto,by mail,postage prepaid.the responses had in fact been sent by ups overnight service.a ups tracking form for the package delivered to the herbst defendants showed that it had been tendered to ups on may,that it was sent next day air,and was delivered may at.in a subsequent pleading,thomas indicated he tendered the responses to ups on may.these amended responses suffered some of the same infirmities as the first round.in response to interrogatories from the herbst defendants seeking facts in support of the allegations in the complaint,thomas once again repeated that he could not state every fact in support of his claims,that he was not obligated to prepare the defendants case for them,that he relied on federal rule of civil procedure d,on a number of depositions and documents that had already been produced by the defendants and by his september,document production.in other words,he repeated the very response that the district court warned him was woefully inadequate the first time around.in response to an interrogatory from the cogana defendants asking the trustee to state the facts and identify the documents in support of an allegation that the defendants acted willfully and wantonly,thomas replied,the evidence will show that the documents discovered in this case and the actions of these
