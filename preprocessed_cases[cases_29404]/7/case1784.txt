dora carrillo carrillo filed an adversary complaint in louis su su chapter bankruptcy case to determine the dischargeability of debt owed to her by su.the bankruptcy court held that su debt to carrillo was nondischargeable.the bankruptcy appellate panel bap reversed,holding that the bankruptcy court erred by applying the incorrect legal standard.carrillo appeals,arguing that the bankruptcy court correctly applied the law and that su debt is nondischargeable.we have jurisdiction under d,and we affirm the bap.
factual background 
on august,shortly before,carrillo was lawfully crossing a major downtown san francisco intersection while walking to work.su,who was driving a van,sped into the intersection against a red light,traveling miles per hour in a zone,nearly five seconds after the light had turned red.he crashed into a car that was lawfully in the intersection and then careened into carrillo,severely injuring her.
carrillo subsequently sued su in state court for compensatory and punitive damages,alleging that h is conduct was wanton,willful and malicious,and such acts were intentionally done with reckless disregard of the consequences,necessarily producing permanent injury and harm to plaintiff,without just cause or excuse.the jury found that su was negligent,that his negligence resulted in carrillo injuries,and that he was guilty of malice by clear and convincing evidence.malice was defined by the state court either as conduct intended to cause injury to the plaintiff or as despicable conduct carried on with a willful and conscious disregard for the safety and rights of others.the jury awarded carrillo in economic damages and in damages no punitive damages were awarded.
after this judgment was entered against him,su filed a chapter bankruptcy petition.in her adversary proceeding,carrillo alleged that her judgment against su was not dischargeable because a a excepts from discharge a debt for willful and malicious injury by the debtor to another entity or to the property of another entity.relying on miller abrams in re miller,cir,which held that injuries are considered willful and malicious under a when the debtor possesses either an objective substantial certainty of harm or a subjective motive to cause harm,the bankruptcy court held that su debt to carrillo was nondischargeable because there was by an objective standard,a substantial certainty of harm when su drove his van through a red light at an intersection known to be heavily congested with traffic.
after the bankruptcy court decision,and while the case was pending before the bap,this court decided petralia jercich in re jercich,cir,cert.denied,d.in re jercich held that a willful injury requirement is met when it is shown either that the debtor had a subjective motive to inflict the injury or that the debtor believed that injury was substantially certain to occur as a result of his conduct.id.at.
based largely on in re jercich,the bap reversed the bankruptcy court.see su carrillo in re su,cir.according to the bap,the bankruptcy court use of an objective substantial certainty standard was inconsistent with the subjective substantial certainty standard articulated in in re jercich.id.

iii.discussion 
section a of the bankruptcy code provides a a discharge under section,a,b,or b of this title does not discharge an individual debtor from any debt for willful and malicious injury by the debtor to another entity or to the property of another entity.the question presented on appeal is whether a finding of willful and malicious injury must be based on the debtor subjective knowledge or intent or whether such a finding can be predicated upon an objective evaluation of the debtor conduct.we hold that a willful injury requirement is met only when the debtor has a subjective motive to inflict injury or when the debtor believes that injury is substantially certain to result from his own conduct.
willfulness 
in kawaauhau geiger,d,the supreme court established that a does not apply to those debts arising from unintentionally inflicted injuries 
the word willful in a modifies the word injury,indicating that nondischargeability takes a deliberate or intentional injury,not merely a deliberate or intentional act that leads to injury.had congress meant to exempt debts resulting from unintentionally inflicted injuries,it might have described instead willful acts that cause injury.t he a formulation triggers in the lawyer mind the category intentional torts,as distinguished from negligent or reckless torts.intentional torts generally require that the actor intend the consequences of an act,not simply the act itself.
at.citation omitted.thus,geiger held that debts arising out of a medical malpractice judgment were dischargeable,even though the plaintiff alleged that geiger had intentionally rendered inadequate medical care,and that this necessarily led to her injury.geiger concluded that debts arising from recklessly or negligently inflicted injuries do not fall within the compass of a.id.at.
both parties agree that a deliberate or intentional injury is required for a to render a debt nondischargeable.the question we must decide is the state of mind that is required to satisfy a s willful injury requirement.according to the restatement,an action is intentional if an actor subjectively desires to cause consequences of his act,or believes that the consequences are substantially certain to result from it.restatement second of torts.the geiger court,however,did not expressly adopt this subjective restatement formulation and the lower courts have differed over whether to adopt a strict subjective test when applying a.
the sixth circuit interpretation of a exemplifies the strict subjective approach,in which a debt is nondischargeable under a only if the debtor intended to cause harm or knew that harm was a substantially certain consequence of his or her behavior.in markowitz campbell in re markowitz,cir,the debt arose from a legal malpractice action against the debtor.the creditor argued that the debt was nondischargeable under a willful and malicious injury provision.while in re markowitz acknowledged that geiger had not expressly adopted the restatement subjective substantially certain language,it nonetheless concluded that from the court language and analysis in geiger,we now hold that unless the actor desires to cause consequences of his act,or believes that the consequences are substantially certain to result from it,he has not committed a willful and malicious injury as defined under a.id.at quoting restatement second of torts.
conversely,the fifth circuit interpretation of a exemplifies the objective approach,in which debt is nondischargeable under a either if there is a subjective intent to cause an injury or if there is an objective substantial certainty of harm.in in re miller,the creditor sought a determination that a state court judgment for misuse of trade secrets constituted a nondischargeable debt.while acknowledging that geiger certainly eliminates the possibility that willful encompasses negligence or recklessness,in re miller held that the label intentional tort is too elusive to sort intentional acts that lead to injury from acts intended to cause injury.rather,either objective substantial certainty or subjective motive meets the supreme court definition of willful injury in a.at.
while this difference between the objective approach taken by the fifth circuit and the subjective approach taken by the sixth circuit is evident from in re miller a
