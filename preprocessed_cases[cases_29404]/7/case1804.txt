michael batlan trustee appeals the district court judgment affirming the decision of the bankruptcy court.batlan filed an action to recover payments made by a chapter debtor to transamerica commercial finance corporation tcfc.the bankruptcy court found that the payments were not avoidable transfers under b.we agree with the bankruptcy court and the district court that the trustee did not satisfy his burden of showing that tcfc received a greater amount by virtue of the payments than it would have received in a hypothetical chapter liquidation.
factual and procedural background 
smith home furnishings,smith,sold furniture,electronic goods,and appliances at stores in oregon,washington,and idaho.tcfc was one of smith primary lenders for almost a decade.tcfc financed smith purchase of some merchandise the prime inventory,consisting mainly of electronic goods and appliances.tcfc loans were secured by a floating lien on the prime inventory and the proceeds from it thus,the prime inventory served as collateral for tcfc loans to smith.
under the loan agreements,tcfc extended credit to smith by granting approval to various manufacturers.after receiving approval,the manufacturers shipped merchandise to smith.when smith sold a product financed by tcfc,it paid tcfc the wholesale price of that product.
smith did not segregate its sales receipts.instead,smith deposited all its sales proceeds into commingled bank accounts at the end of each day.first interstate bank the bank,smith financier,swept the accounts daily,leaving the accounts with overnight balances of zero.the next day,the bank advanced new funds to smith if sufficient collateral was available.smith then paid its operating expenses and creditors,including tcfc 
during,smith suffered substantial losses.consequently,in march tcfc reduced smith line of credit from million to million.over the next few months,tcfc reduced smith line of credit twice more,down to million by august.during the same period,tcfc required substantial paydowns of smith debt smith paid tcfc most of its available cash in a series of payments,totaling more than million,between may,and august.
on august,tcfc declared a final default,accelerated the entire debt due from smith,and sought a receiver for the company.for the first time,tcfc also sought to require smith to segregate the proceeds from its collateral.
smith voluntarily initiated bankruptcy proceedings under chapter of the bankruptcy code on august,the petition date.as of that date,smith owed to tcfc.tcfc took possession of its collateral and liquidated it,receiving.
on october,the case was converted to a chapter liquidation and batlan was appointed as trustee.the trustee discovered the in payments that smith had made to tcfc during the days before the petition date the preference period.believing that the payments were preferential,he asked tcfc to return the money to the bankruptcy estate.when tcfc refused,the trustee initiated this adversary proceeding,seeking to avoid the payments as preferential transfers,under b,and to recover the money for the benefit of other creditors of smith,under a.
the parties stipulated that the payments met the first four elements of a preferential transfer under b.additionally,tcfc agreed not to pursue affirmative defenses under c.the parties proceeded to trial to determine whether the payments met the fifth element of the preferential transfer statute,b,and whether tcfc could establish an affirmative defense under c.
on september,the bankruptcy court ruled,in a letter opinion,that the trustee had failed to meet his burden of proof in showing that the payments were preferential transfers.the court reasoned that,because the value of the collateral on the petition date exceeded the amount of tcfc claim on the petition date,tcfc was oversecured by.as a result,the court concluded that,because tcfc was a creditor,the trustee was required to prove that tcfc was undersecured at some time during the preference period in order to avoid the transfers.the court also ruled that tcfc collateral should be valued at liquidation value and that liquidation costs should be deducted from the liquidation value in computing the value of the collateral,but that the trustee had failed to present credible evidence of tcfc liquidation costs.because the bankruptcy court concluded that the trustee had not proved that the transfers were preferential,the court did not address tcfc affirmative defense under c.
the trustee filed a motion for reconsideration.in response,the bankruptcy court amended its opinion to correct typographical and computational errors,but otherwise confirmed its judgment.the trustee timely filed an appeal to the district court,raising the same issues that it raises in this appeal.in a published opinion,batlan transamerica commercial finance,the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court decision in all respects.this timely appeal followed.

discussion 
greater amount test 
this case requires us to interpret two sections of the bankruptcy code,b and g.b permits a trustee to avoid any transfer of an interest of the debtor in property when certain conditions are met.one of the conditions is that the transfer enable the creditor to receive more than such creditor would receive if 
a the case were a case under chapter of this title 
b the transfer had not been made and 
c such creditor received payment of such debt to the extent provided by the provisions of this title.
b.tcfc and the trustee dispute whether the payments made during the preference period enabled tcfc,as a result of the payments,to receive more than if the payments had not been made and tcfc had received payments only pursuant to a chapter liquidation.section g places the burden of proof on the trustee to show all of the conditions of b.thus,the trustee must show that the creditor received a greater amount than it would have if the transfer had not been made and there had been a hypothetical chapter liquidation as of the petition date.if the trustee shows that tcfc received a greater amount by virtue of the payments,then the payments are avoidable as preferential transfers.see in re lewis shurtleff,cir.the trustee contends that he satisfied his burden because the payments plus the amount that tcfc received from the sale of its collateral is greater than the amount received from the sale of the collateral standing alone and tcfc has not traced the source of the allegedly preferential payments to sales of its collateral.we disagree with both of the trustee arguments.
a.the method does not satisfy the trustee burden when the payments come from collateral secured by a floating lien 
the trustee tried to satisfy his burden under b by adding the amount of the payments to the amount tcfc received as a result of the sale of its remaining collateral.the trustee then compared this amount to the obviously smaller amount of the sale by itself and concluded that tcfc must have received a greater amount because of the payments.some bankruptcy courts have used the same method employed by the trustee to determine the status of a creditor on the petition date.see in re,adding alleged preferences to the amount of unpaid balance at the petition date to find the creditor secured status in re estate of ascot mortgage,adding amounts received to what would have been received under a chapter liquidation.
we agree with the bankruptcy court and the district court,however,and conclude that the calculation does not satisfy the trustee burden in this case.transfers to a creditor that is fully secured on the petition date are generally not preferential because the secured creditor is entitled to percent of its claims.see in re lco enterprises,cir.this is not a hard and fast rule.as the bankruptcy court in this case noted,payments that change the status of a creditor from partially unsecured to fully secured at the time of petition may be preferential.see porter yukon bank,cir.moreover,a transfer may be avoided when the creditor is fully secured at the time of payment,but is undersecured on the petition date.see in re estate of sufolla,cir.the trustee failed to show,however,that tcfc was undersecured at any time during the preference period.instead,the evidence submitted showed that as of the petition date,the value of the collateral held by smith exceeded its indebtedness to tcfc if tcfc was never undercollateralized,then tcfc could not have received more by virtue of the payments than it would have received in a hypothetical liquidation without the payments.
it is important to understand that tcfc did not loan one fixed amount to the debtor instead,tcfc held a floating lien.a floating lien is a financing device where the creditor claims an interest in property acquired after the original extension of the loan and extends its security interest to cover further advances.the floating lien is a lien against a constantly changing mass of collateral for a loan value that will change as payments are received and further advances are made.see norton.prac d.the cases the trustee cites applying the method do not deal with floating liens.it is not correct to assume that the payments gave tcfc more than it would have received if the payments had not been made.instead,under a floating lien arrangement,those payments are used to liquidate part of the debtor debt.then,new credit under the floating lien is extended and is secured by new collateral.it is not enough for the trustee to show that the payments plus the amount received upon dissolution exceeded the amount of tcfc secured claim as of the petition date.since collateral and indebtedness changed throughout the preference period,these values do not prove that tcfc received more by virtue of the payments than it would have received without them.under b,the trustee must show that the amount of indebtedness under the floating lien was greater than the amount of collateral at some point during the period.see in re schwinn bicycle,at no point in time did the collateral value fall below the outstanding debt,and therefore tifco was not preferenced in having received payments on its secured debt.
the trustee contends that the existence of the floating lien means that the burden is shifted to tcfc under c.section c provides an affirmative defense for creditors when the trustee has successfully demonstrated that the creditor received more from the payments than under a hypothetical liquidation.section c insulates the transfer of a security interest in property,a floating lien,provided that the creditor does not improve its position during the preference period.in effect,the trustee contends that the existence of a floating lien means that he does not have to prove that the creditor was undersecured at some point during the period and therefore received more by virtue of the payments than the creditor would have if the creditor had waited for a chapter liquidation.
we reject the trustee argument a floating lien does not shift the burden of showing avoidability to the creditor.the trustee still has to satisfy his burden under b.the tenth circuit has addressed the question of what needs to be shown by a trustee to avoid a transfer financed by the sale of inventory subject to a floating lien.see in re castletons,cir.in castletons,the creditor held a floating lien on the debtor inventory,accounts receivable,and proceeds.the trustee sought to avoid the payments given by the debtor to the creditor during the preference period.the tenth circuit affirmed the district court holding that the trustee failed to show that the creditor received more from the challenged payments than it would have received in a chapter liquidation.it explained 
a ll payments to the creditor came from assets already subject to its security interest.it is further uncontested that the nature of the creditor security interest in debtor assets was never altered during the preference period.
under these circumstances,it can not be said,as b requires,the transfers enabled the creditor to receive more on its debt than would be available to it in a chapter distribution.
id.at.essential to the court holding was its recognition that the creditor held a floating lien while the identity of individual items of collateral changed because of sales and subsequent acquisitions of new collateral,the overall nature of the creditor security interest remained the same.id.at.
it is true that other courts have evaluated floating lien cases by proceeding directly to the c affirmative defense without a discussion of the requirements of b.see in re wesley,cir in re lackow,cir.but in those cases,the parties had stipulated or the bankruptcy court had found that the creditor was undersecured as of the petition date.in other words,the b burden had already been satisfied so it did not need to be discussed.the trustee in this case never showed that tcfc was undersecured at any point during the period and the bankruptcy court determined that tcfc was fully secured as of the petition date.the trustee did not satisfy his burden.see richard duncan,preferential transfers,the floating lien,and section c of the bankruptcy reform act of,i t is not necessary to reach the question of application of section c until after the trustee has met his burden of proving all of the necessary elements of a preference under section b.james white daniel israel,preference conundrums,com,it is important to remember,however,that c applies only to a creditor who is undersecured ninety days before bankruptcy.the creditor who is fully secured can not be attacked under b.there is no initial deficiency and later transactions can not improve the creditor position.
b.the burden of tracing the funds used to make the preferential payments is on the trustee 
the trustee contends that its use of the method is correct because tcfc has not shown that the source of the allegedly preferential payments was sales of tcfc collateral.in castletons,it was undisputed that all of the preference period payments came from sales of assets subject to the creditor floating lien.see in re castletons,at.in this case,however,the payments came from a commingled account that contained monies from the sales of other goods not subject to tcfc lien.when smith made a sale,the proceeds were deposited into commingled bank accounts.smith bank swept the accounts daily,leaving them with zero balances overnight.thus,the challenged payments were not made directly from the proceeds of the sales of tcfc collateral.on the other hand,there is no evidence indicating that smith did not sell off enough of tcfc collateral to account for all of the challenged payments.
there is some authority for requiring a creditor to establish that funds in a commingled account are traceable to the proceeds of its collateral.see stoumbos kilimnik,cir this court has held that the creditor bears the burden of establishing that a deposit account contains proceeds of collateral covered by a security interest.in re gibson products,cir we think that it is fair to place the burden on the creditor to identify his own proceeds and thus to defeat,in whole or in part,the trustee claim of preference.but stoumbos and gibson products are not persuasive because they dealt with the intersection of the bankruptcy code and section of the ucc.the ucc provision at issue in those cases allows a creditor to claim all funds in a deposit account where the funds are proceeds from collateral covered by the creditor security interest.see stoumbos,at.in this situation,there is a presumption against the creditor and in favor of the trustee.id.at.this is the opposite of a b analysis where the burden of proof is on the trustee and the presumption is in favor of the creditor.see in re,acknowledging that under a code section other than,a secured creditor may be obliged to prove the validity of its alleged security interests,but explaining that is a code section which provides its own specific designations of the burdens of proof of the respective parties.
instead,we believe that it is part of the trustee b burden to trace the funds used to make the payments to sales of merchandise not subject to tcfc liens.see in re robinson.drilling,cir under g,a trustee seeking to avoid an allegedly preferential transfer under b has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence every essential,controverted element resulting in the preference.quoting collier on bankruptcy at ed in re prescott,cir placing burden on trustee to establish value of collateral and to show that value of collateral was less than the amount of indebtedness at time of transfer.one might argue that the creditor will be in a better position than the trustee to prove whether or not the alleged preferential payments came from the proceeds of the sale of its own collateral.on the other hand,in bankruptcy,it is the trustee who accedes to the debtor books and records and has easier access and a better ability to divine the financial activities of the debtor in its last months of operation.regardless of which side is better equipped to decipher the debtor final financial actions,we hold that the language of the statute places the burden of demonstrating the source of such preferential payments squarely on the trustee see in re,at it is therefore an unfortunate fact of life that a preference plaintiff must effectively prove a negative that the defendant is not a totally secured creditor,even though the secured creditor is the party with most access to proof of the validity of its own security interests.
commingled funds or not,b places the burden on the trustee to show that the payments at issue came from a source other than sales of tcfc collateral.here there is no suggestion that any sales of products funded by tcfc were not subject to tcfc priority lien.instead,both parties stipulated that tcfc held a valid security interest in smith property.it is true that the route the payment took to tcfc was indirect,but we are not prepared to release the trustee from his burden under b simply because the payments did not,demonstrably,come directly from sale of tcfc collateral.see in re compton,cir the federal courts have long recognized that t o constitute a preference,it is not necessary that the transfer be made directly to the creditor.quoting national bank of newport national herkimer county bank.it is up to the trustee to show that the payments did not come from tcfc collateral before he can use the method to satisfy his b burden.
ii.liquidation costs 
the trustee also argues that the bankruptcy court erred when it concluded that the trustee failed to prove liquidation costs.in the alternative,the trustee contends that the court was required to estimate liquidation costs.we disagree with both contentions.
as evidence of liquidation costs,the trustee presented deposition testimony by tcfc manager of portfolio administration during the liquidation.the manager testified that tcfc had incurred costs in liquidating the collateral,but that he did not know the amount of the costs.he also testified that he had prepared an analysis of projected costs two months before the bankruptcy,but admitted that the numbers involved were real rough number s out of the air.the bankruptcy court gave no weight to this testimony,observing that the witness admitted that he did not know the actual costs and that his estimates were plucked out of the air.
the trustee also presented expert testimony as evidence of liquidation costs.the expert testified generally about the types of costs that arise in a liquidation.the court gave this testimony no weight because it was not probative of the actual costs of liquidation incurred by tcfc.
the trustee additionally presented testimony from tcfc senior counsel that tcfc did incur some liquidation costs,and from a tcfc portfolio manager that tcfc had employed people to oversee the liquidation.the bankruptcy court did not err when it concluded that the evidence was not sufficient to prove liquidation costs.even though the evidence demonstrates that some costs were incurred,that is not sufficient to establish the amount of those costs.
neither was the court required to estimate the costs simply because the evidence established that tcfc had incurred some.although bankruptcy courts have estimated liquidation costs,see,in re martindale,as the district court noted in this case the evidence presented to the bankruptcy court in this case fell far short of the precise projections proffered in martindale no one,much less the trustee,offered the court evidence from which a reasoned estimate could be made.batlan,at.consequently,the bankruptcy court did not err when it declined to estimate liquidation costs on this record.
finally,the court did not abuse its discretion when it refused to admit into evidence the trustee proposed exhibit,a chart entitled smith that appears to show expenses for smith in oregon,washington,and idaho during the period from august through april.the trustee provided no testimony as to what the document illustrates.it is unclear whether it represents estimates of costs or actual costs.consequently,it is not probative of the actual amount of liquidation costs incurred by tcfc.
conclusion 
we affirm the decision of the bankruptcy court in all respects.
i concur in part ii of the majority opinion but respectfully dissent from part i.in my view,under b and g a bankruptcy trustee need not prove,as part of the prima facie case establishing an avoidable preference,that a creditor was not fully secured at the time of the allegedly preferential payment,when the value of the collateral on the petition date exceeds the creditor claim on the petition date.
to establish a prima facie case that a payment to a creditor was preferential,the trustee must show that the payment enabled the creditor to receive more than it would have in a chapter proceeding had the payment not been made.b g see also norton.prac d,at west a analysis is required.first,one must determine what the creditor receives if the transfer remains valid.second,one must determine what the creditor would have received in a liquidation case if the transfer had not been made.the appropriate date for this analysis is the date of the petition filing.emphasis added footnote omitted.whether a creditor has received a preference is to be determined,not by what the situation would have been if the debtor assets had been liquidated and distributed among his creditors at the time the alleged preferential payment was made,but by the actual effect of the payment as determined when bankruptcy results.palmer clay prods.brown.see also alvarado walsh in re lco enters,cir.
the bankruptcy court and the majority err in two ways.first,by holding that tcfc was fully secured for purposes of b analysis,they disregard the statutory directive to determine what the status of tcfc claims would have been had the challenged payments not been made.second,by holding that the trustee was required to prove that tcfc was undersecured on the date of each challenged payment,they effectively shift to the trustee a burden of proof placed on tcfc by the bankruptcy code.
for purposes of b,tcfc was not fully secured.
although we have recognized that p payments to a fully secured creditor generally will not be considered preferential because the creditor would not receive more than in a chapter liquidation,committee of creditors holding unsecured claims koch oil in re powerine oil,cir quoting collier on bankruptcy,at lawrence king,ed,our previous cases have not defined what it takes to make a creditor fully secured within the meaning of b.the mere fact that the value of a creditor collateral exceeds the bankrupt indebtedness in a snapshot on the petition date does not establish that a creditor is fully secured for purposes of b analysis.see official comm.of unsecured creditors am.sterilizer in re comptronix,holding that a creditor can not defeat a claim of preference merely by showing that the debt is fully secured on the petition date.instead,b requires the court to determine what the status of the creditor claims would have been had the challenged payments not been made.see wickham united am.bank in re property leasing,t he only relevant question is what the secured status of the claim would have been had the payments not been made on the date of the petition since that alone would determine the distribution to which the creditor would have been entitled in a chapter liquidation.only then can the court analyze whether,and to what extent,the payments caused a creditor to receive more than it would have in a hypothetical chapter liquidation.
to summarize,b directs a court that is analyzing a preference claim to compare two quantities the amount that the creditor actually received,and the amount that the creditor would have received in a hypothetical chapter liquidation had the allegedly preferential transfers not been made.elliott frontier props.in re lewis shurtleff,cir.to the extent that challenged payments permit the creditor to receive more than it would have in the hypothetical liquidation,the trustee can avoid them.b.the statute contains no exception for a creditor 
aggregated analysis 
although the text of the code directs the court to examine each challenged payment individually for simplicity,i will analyze them in the aggregate because the result is the same under either approach on these facts the result is the same here because tcfc collateral was not the source of the allegedly preferential payments,so the return of the payments to the estate would not increase the value of the collateral securing smith indebtedness to tcfc tcfc already received the full value of its collateral each payment allowed tcfc to receive an amount in excess of the value of its collateral tcfc claim was unsecured to the extent that it exceeded the value of the collateral and other creditors with unsecured claims received no payments on those claims 
b.what tcfc actually received 
in analyzing the amount that a challenged transfer enabled the creditor to receive,the creditor must be charged with the value of what was transferred plus any additional amount that he would be entitled to receive from a chapter liquidation.shurtleff,at emphasis in original.the challenged payments and the liquidation of tcfc collateral caused tcfc to receive a total of.
tcfc entitlement in a hypothetical chapter liquidation 
as explained above,b instructs us to analyze how much tcfc would have received in a chapter liquidation conducted on the petition date,had the challenged payments not been made.the return of the payments to the estate potentially alters two quantities the amount of the creditor claim against the estate on the petition date and the amount of collateral securing the creditor claim on the petition date.those two quantities ultimately determine the extent to which a creditor is secured for purposes of b.
i tcfc claim against the estate 
in this case,had the payments not been made,smith would have owed tcfc its actual claim on the petition date plus the amount of antecedent debt paid in the transfers,or a total of.thus,tcfc hypothetical claim against the estate,in an analysis under b,is.see henderson bank of commerce in re,holding that the creditor claim on the petition date for purposes of a b analysis was the unpaid balance of the store loans as of the filing date,plus the total amount of the alleged preferential payments see also,gray credit in re paris indus,computing the amount of the creditor claim for purposes of b by adding the amount of the challenged payments to the amount of the creditor claim on the petition date property leasing,at same.
ii the value of the collateral 
although the relevant date for assessing the value of the collateral securing a creditor debt is the petition date,see palmer clay,at.lco,at,b requires an adjustment to that amount when the source of the allegedly preferential payments was the secured party collateral.see krafsur scurlock permian in re el paso refinery,cir t he creditor will not be deemed to have received a greater percentage as a result of the payment if the source of the payment is the creditor own collateral.sloan zions first bank in re castletons,cir concluding that a secured creditor was not preferred when all the challenged payments were from assets subject to the creditor security interest.the reason for the adjustment is that,when the source of the payments is the creditor own collateral,then,had the payments not been made,the assets would have remained in the estate as part of the collateral securing the creditor debt.to that extent,the value of the collateral securing the creditor debt would be greater.see el paso refinery,at a creditor who merely recovers its own collateral receives no more as a result than it would have received anyway had the funds been retained by the debtor,subject to the creditor security interest.
in this case,the trustee presented evidence that of the challenged payments were from commingled funds that were not traceable to proceeds of tcfc collateral.the other payments were from debtors who owed money to smith and who,at smith direction,sent the payments to tcfc on behalf of smith.accordingly,had the payments not been made,all the funds would have been unencumbered and available to pay unsecured claims 
because the challenged payments were not traceable to tcfc collateral,the trustee established a prima facie case that the payments were avoidable preferences by proving that the value of the collateral was,its worth as of the petition date and the creditor claim,as calculated above,was.under a,a creditor claim is a secured claim to the extent of the value of such creditor interest in the estate interest in such property and is an unsecured claim to the extent that the value of such creditor interest is less than the amount of such allowed claim.tcfc held a secured claim for,the extent of the value of the collateral,and an unsecured claim for the remainder.because the unsecured creditors of smith received no payments on their claims in this proceeding,tcfc would have been paid in full on its secured claim only.thus,in a hypothetical chapter liquidation,tcfc would have recovered only.clearly,as illustrated in the charts in the appendix,the payments enabled tcfc to receive more.the trustee is entitled to recover the excess as a preference under,unless tcfc proves its affirmative defense.
the bankruptcy court and the majority improperly require smith to prove the absence of tcfc affirmative defense.
the bankruptcy court held,and the majority agrees,that the trustee did not meet his burden of proof in establishing his prima facie case because the trustee proof does not establish that tcfc was undersecured at the time the payments were made.majority op.at.in so holding,the majority improperly requires the trustee to prove the absence of the creditor affirmative defense as part of his prima facie case.
a payment to a fully secured creditor is not preferential because the payment does not deplete the bankruptcy estate.norton prac d.for example,payment to a fully secured creditor does not diminish the value of the estate since,while cash is removed from the estate,the secured party lien is reduced in equal amount.id,at.thus,the reason why a creditor who is fully secured at the time of a challenged payment can not be considered preferred by a payment is that the creditor,in general,contemporaneously returns value to the estate in the form of an equal reduction of the lien.
under c,a trustee can not avoid a payment to a creditor if the creditor establishes that the payment was intended by the debtor and the creditor to be a contemporaneous exchange for new value given to the debtor and was in fact a substantially contemporaneous exchange.see also g allocating the burden of proof to the creditor.we have recognized that the release of a security interest to the extent of a payment is one form of new value that a creditor may give in exchange for the debtor payment.p ayments by a debtor in exchange for a secured creditor release of its security interest falls within the exception of section c.seaboard sur.in re fegert,c
