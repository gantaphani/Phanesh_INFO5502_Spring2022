this appeal arises from contempt sanctions issued by the bankruptcy court against defendants alejandro diaz barba and martha margarita barba de la torre collectively,the diazes for failing to transfer a mexican coastal villa to plaintiff kismet acquisition,llc.the district court confirmed that the diazes conduct was sanctionable,but remanded for consideration of appropriate sanctions.the diazes appealed the conclusion that their conduct was sanctionable,and kismet part of the district court decision reversing the bankruptcy court.
we have jurisdiction pursuant to d.despite the district court partial remand to the bankruptcy court to recalculate the amount of fees and costs,immediate review is proper this appeal concerns primarily legal questions regarding the propriety of the bankruptcy court contempt orders,the factfinding to be conducted by the bankruptcy court on remand is not related to a central issue raised on appeal,and the panel decision might dispose of the case and obviate the need for factfinding.see in re lehtinen,cir in re dyer,cir in re bonner mall,cir.we affirm.
a.the bankruptcy court underlying judgment.
debtors jerry and donna icenhower owned an interest in villa vista hermosa,a coastal villa in jalisco,mexico.their interest was not a fee simple,as mexican law prohibits foreign nationals from owning title to land within kilometers of the border or kilometers of the coast.see brady brown,cir.rather,debtors held the beneficial interest in a fideicomiso trust an arrangement wherein a mexican bank holds title to property and a foreign national is granted the right to its use.see id.at.a fideicomiso trust may be created only with a permit issued by the mexican ministry of foreign affairs.see id.
on march,debtors purchased h g,a shell company,and transferred the villa interest to h on december,debtors filed for bankruptcy protection.on june,h g sold the villa interest to the diazes for million.
on august,the bankruptcy trustee filed an action seeking to avoid the transfer of the villa interest from debtors to h g as a fraudulent conveyance.on august,the trustee filed an action seeking to avoid the transfer from h g to the diazes as an unauthorized postpetition transfer.h g did not appear in either action.by agreement approved by the bankruptcy court on november,kismet purchased the estate assets and was substituted for the trustee.
on june,following a bench trial,the bankruptcy court ruled for kismet in both actions.on the same day,the court issued a separate judgment,ordering the diazes,under a 
a to take all actions necessary to execute and deliver any and all documents needed to undo the avoided transfer,and to take all actions necessary to cause the property to be reconveyed to a fideicomiso trust naming kismet as the sole beneficiary for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate or 
b alternatively,at kismet sole option made upon proper noticed motion,the court reserves jurisdiction to enter a monetary judgment in favor of kismet,and against defendants,in an amount necessary to make the estate whole at the time of judgment.
on july,the court filed an amended consolidated judgment,in which it clarified that the villa interest was an interest in a fideicomiso trust,not a fee simple,and required the diazes to comply within days.following denials of a stay pending appeal by both the bankruptcy court and district court,the diazes faced a compliance deadline of september.
initial attempts by kismet to effect the transfer.
following the bankruptcy court issuance of the acj,kismet took the initiative in preparing documents by which the diazes would transfer the villa interest.on august,kismet provided the diazes a draft power of attorney to be used to convey the villa interest to kismet or its assignee.the diazes objected that the power of attorney involved a conflict of interest,as the persons nominated to act on their behalf worked at the same law firm as kismet counsel,and impermissibly allowed kismet to transfer the villa interest to persons beyond the jurisdiction of courts.
on september,kismet proposed that,rather than execute a power of attorney,the diazes appear before a notary public in mexico to execute appropriate transfer documents.on september,kismet sent the diazes a proposed transfer instrument that named a mexican company,axolotl inmobiliaria de,kismet assignee,as the beneficiary of the fideicomiso.the diazes rejected this document two days later,arguing that it should have specified kismet as the beneficiary of the fideicomiso for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate and included language explicitly referencing the bankruptcy case.on september,kismet circulated a new version of the transfer agreement that stated that the bankruptcy court would continue to maintain jurisdiction over the acj.again,the diazes objected that the document named axolotl as beneficiary.also on september,counsel for barba de la torre wrote to kismet,m y client is advised by mexican counsel that the specific performance portion of the bankruptcy court judgment undoing of the avoided transaction can not at least at this stage of these proceedings,be accomplished under mexican law.
on september,following an ex parte application by kismet,the bankruptcy court ordered the diazes to show cause why they should not be held in contempt.on september,the bankruptcy court ordered diaz to submit to a deposition and produce documents relevant to his and barba de la torre attempts to comply with the acj.at his deposition,diaz testified that counsel had advised him that signing the transfer documents would violate mexican law.he also testified that,pursuant to advice of counsel,he sought to enjoin transfer of the villa interest through an amparo a mexican proceeding to ensure that an individual constitutional rights are not violated by a mexican official.the diazes also submitted declarations from two of their attorneys stating that mexican law prevented them from complying with the acj.
arguing that these statements waived privilege,kismet moved on october to compel discovery of communications with counsel regarding the impossibility defense or correspondence with mexican officials.the bankruptcy court granted kismet motion on october.the diazes produced responsive documents on november.
c.the diazes continued delay and obstruction.
the disclosed documents indicate that,rather than make a good faith effort to comply with the acj,the diazes sought to delay and obstruct its implementation.on september,diaz told his counsel i will not sign anything that executes a trust agreement i will not cooperate with these brigands,making a mockery of m exican law and attempting to circumvent it.diaz counsel responded 
i understand that but we do need to reveal it to kismet counsel yet.better to let him think we are preparing to cooperate while we get our ducks in a row in mexico.therefore,to the extent we can point to defects,we can send back the draft document and make them change it again causing delay.
in another email,diaz counsel noted that her objection to a proposed transfer document should throw a wrench in the works.
one means by which the diazes sought to obstruct the bankruptcy court judgment was by soliciting intervention by mexican officials.as diaz attorney stated in an email i think the only thing we can do now is work with the mexican authorities to try to ensure that the order can not be accomplished.on september,diaz instructed his counsel to lobby ambassador joel hernandez garcia,a legal advisor in the mexican ministry of foreign affairs,to sign a document stating that compliance with the acj would be impossible under mexican law.the next day,ambassador garcia agreed to sign a more limited form of such a declaration,omitting any statement that the diazes would be subject to penalties in mexico if they complied with the acj.
on august,diaz contacted the ministry of foreign affairs in an attempt to ensure that the ministry did not issue a fideicomiso permit to kismet.on september,the diazes filed an amparo,seeking to enjoin the transfer of the villa interest.in a september email,an attorney for the diazes stated that the plan was to keep the amparo a secret until they had it recorded,and that they would then want to present the certificate of recording as an obstacle for transferring title.nonetheless,the amparo was soon dismissed,as kismet had not sought to have the acj recognized in mexico and thus there was no official mexican action to enjoin.finally,the diazes circulated in mexico a narrative highly critical of the bankruptcy judge and orchestrated radio advertisements denouncing kismet.
at a hearing on november,the bankruptcy court held the diazes in contempt.the court also found that,as a result of the diazes actions,kismet was unlikely to receive a fideicomiso permit.however,a permit would not be necessary to transfer the villa interest to axolotl,a mexican corporation.thus,the bankruptcy court ordered the diazes,within one week,to sign a document transferring the villa interest to axolotl or another assignee of kismet.the court ruled that,if the diazes did not purge their contempt by november,compulsory sanctions would issue at the rate of per day.the court also imposed compensatory sanctions,retroactive to september,of per day in lost rental value and per day in lost use of the property.finally,the court required the diazes to pay kismet its attorney fees and costs related to preparing documents to carry out the transfer of the villa interest.
renewed attempts to effect the transfer.
the transfer was originally scheduled to close in mexico on november.however,on november,the notary public who had agreed to oversee the transaction suddenly withdrew,despite having previously approved the transfer documents.kismet arranged for a different notary to preside over the closing,but that notary soon withdrew,as well.she reported that she had been contacted by an agent of the diazes counsel who had allegedly been hired to investigate the transaction.the notary was thus concerned about the risk to herself if she proceeded with the transaction.further,she allegedly believed that every notary in the area had been contacted that day to ensure that no notary would participate in the transaction.
on november,the bankruptcy court heard argument on why the transfer had failed to close.the diazes argued that the notaries had withdrawn based on legitimate objections to the transfer,whereas kismet argued that their withdrawal was solely due to the diazes intimidation.the court deferred resolving this dispute until a hearing on december,but ordered the diazes to close the transaction by november.to avoid interference with the notary,the court ordered that kismet not inform the diazes of the notary name until the time of closing.
the closing was scheduled for november.prior to that date,a relative of the diazes attempted to identify and influence the notary,though the diazes disclaimed involvement.on november,but before the transaction closed,guillermo rivera,a close friend of diaz,crashed his truck through the villa gate and,together with his associates,took the property hostage.after the transfer was executed,counsel for kismet learned of rivera actions and that he refused to leave except pursuant to barba de la torre instructions.counsel for kismet requested the diazes to instruct rivera and his associates to vacate the villa,but the diazes refused.
e.the bankruptcy court further rulings.
at a hearing on december,the bankruptcy court ruled that the diazes were at fault for failing to close the transaction on november.the court imposed compulsory sanctions of per day,retroactive to november,until the diazes complied with the acj.rejecting the diazes argument that they had complied simply by signing the transfer documents,the court ruled that,if rivera had in fact occupied the property on the diazes behalf prior to the closing,this would have violated a preliminary injunction,incorporated into the acj,which prohibited making unavailable any part of the villa property.compulsory and compensatory sanctions would issue until possession was restored.
the diazes vacated the villa on december.on december,the court heard argument and testimony regarding rivera occupation of the villa.at the end of the hearing,the court found that rivera had invaded the villa prior to the closing in concert with the diazes.the court held the diazes in contempt of the preliminary injunction,issued compulsory and compensatory sanctions for the period november to december,and granted kismet application for attorney fees from november to december.
f.the district court order.
on june,the district court issued its decision on appeal.it found no clear error in the bankruptcy court factual findings and affirmed most of the bankruptcy court rulings.however,it reversed the imposition of in compulsory sanctions from november to december,and the imposition of compensatory sanctions for loss of use of the villa,and vacated the district court awards of attorney fees and costs and remanded for recalculation of fees and costs.

the diazes challenge the bankruptcy court rulings on seven grounds the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction to substitute axolotl as transferee,the bankruptcy court violated due process in imposing certain sanctions,the acj was not sufficiently specific to support a finding of contempt,mexican law rendered compliance with the acj impossible,the bankruptcy court findings of contempt for the period up to november were clearly erroneous,the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction to quantify fees and costs in its order of december,and the bankruptcy court improperly abrogated privilege.kismet on a single ground that the district court erred in vacating the compulsory sanctions imposed for the period from november,to december.we consider these issues in turn.
we first consider the diazes argument that the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction to substitute axolotl as transferee on november,after the acj was appealed on august.after an appeal is filed,a court generally may not alter or expand upon the judgment.in re padilla,cir.however,a court retains jurisdiction to supervise a required course of conduct.see hoffman beer drivers salesmen local union,cir holding that a trial court retains jurisdiction to modify an injunction where the court supervises a continuing course of conduct and where as new facts develop additional supervisory action by the court is required meinhold dep t of,cir holding that court retained jurisdiction to expand injunction,despite pending appeal,where court was serving supervisory role.
here,even if substituting axolotl as transferee constituted altering or expanding upon the acj,it was within the bankruptcy court retained jurisdiction to supervise the course of conduct mandated in the judgment,namely transferring the villa interest to kismet or its assignee.the diazes had taken action to obstruct this transfer,and the bankruptcy court reasonably concluded that kismet would have precious little success in getting a permit for a fideicomiso trust in mexico.to account for these changed facts,the bankruptcy court ordered the villa transferred to axolotl,which,as a mexican corporation,could receive the property without using a fideicomiso.this order was within the court jurisdiction.
we next consider the diazes argument that the bankruptcy court contempt and sanctions orders,except those based on evidence submitted at the december hearing regarding conduct starting on november,violated due process since they were issued solely based on affidavits.ordinarily,courts should not impose contempt sanctions solely on the basis of affidavits.peterson
