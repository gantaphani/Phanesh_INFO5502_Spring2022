clyde bergemann,bergemann,appeals the district court affirmance of the bankruptcy court order authorizing a financing agreement between the babcock and wilcox company,diamond power international,diamond power,babcock wilcox construction,americon,collectively,the debtors,and citicorp north america,cna.finding no error,we affirm.
bergemann,a competitor of diamond power,filed in a patent infringement suit,which is currently pending,seeking million damages.in february,the debtors filed voluntary chapter petitions in response to unrelated mass tort litigation and the bankruptcy court administratively consolidated the debtors cases.at the same time they filed the petitions,the debtors filed a motion the dip financing motion with the bankruptcy court seeking authorization under,and a to enter into a financing arrangement with cna,pursuant to a revolving credit facility the dip financing agreement.
under that agreement,the debtors received a million line of credit and the ability to procure letters of credit,which allowed them to continue doing business.the agreement gave cna a security interest in the debtors assets any funds borrowed under the line of credit would give rise to a claim against the assets of all debtors,which claim would be accorded administrative expense status against all unsecured creditors of each debtor 
the bankruptcy court granted the dip financing motion in an interim order,to which bergemann objected on the grounds generally that the interests of other creditors would be unfairly subordinated to cna and specifically that the assets of diamond power might be exposed to claims by cna in response to bergemann objection,the debtors amended the agreement to include a clause providing that,in the event diamond power or any other debtor makes payments to cna in excess of funds received by that debtor from cna,the debtor will receive a claim against all other debtors,subordinate only to cna claim bergemann disagreed that this clause adequately protected its interests and continued to object to the dip financing agreement.
in march,after a hearing,the bankruptcy court issued a final order the dip financing order finding that the dip financing agreement was necessary to the collective health of the debtors and that all the debtors would benefit from the agreement and authorizing the amended dip financing agreement over bergemann objection.bergemann appealed to the district court,which affirmed.
we review a bankruptcy court conclusions of law de novo and findings of fact for clear error.traina whitney bank,cir.when the district court has affirmed the bankruptcy court findings,the review for clear error is strict.id.
bergemann contends that the dip financing order is improper because it substantively consolidates the debtors without following required procedures.substantive consolidation is one mechanism for administering the bankruptcy estates of multiple,related entities and the issue of the device propriety in a particular case normally arises from a bankruptcy court express order of consolidation.bergemann admits that the bankruptcy court did not purport substantively to consolidate the debtors estates but instead argues that that court performed a de facto substantive consolidation.bergemann cites no persuasive authority supporting that theory,however because we do not agree that the court order is a substantive consolidation,we do not address the issue whether the court conducted a sufficient inquiry into its necessity.
the bankruptcy court order authorized only a financing arrangement involving all the debtors and from which each of the debtors benefits as the district court noted,a t most,what has happened here is that the under the dip financing agreement could have access to the assets of debtors like diamond power in excess of the amount that diamond power benefitted from the agreement.moreover,to the extent that diamond power is required to pay an amount disproportionate to funds it obtains through the agreement,its interests are protected by a claim against the other debtors under c.while the availability of a c claim may not fully protect diamond power creditors it does maintain the critical distinction between diamond power assets and liabilities and those of the other debtors,negating the lynchpin of any substantive consolidation order the dip financing order does not combine the assets or liabilities of the debtors and does not establish a common pool of funds to pay claims.
moreover,the order fails to exhibit any other properties commonly characterizing substantive consolidation it neither extinguishes claims nor combines each debtor creditors for purposes of voting on a reorganization plan.bergemann claim has not been consolidated with those of the other debtors unsecured creditors,and bergemann recovery has not been limited to a share equal to that of the other unsecured creditors.almost none of the elements characteristic of a substantive consolidation order is present in the bankruptcy court order.thus,the order does not effect a substantive consolidation,de facto or otherwise.
bergemann argues that the dip financing order is invalid because it violates the absolute priority rule,embodied by b b,which outlines the requirements for confirming a chapter plan 
the court shall confirm a plan only if all of the following requirements are met 
with respect to a class of unsecured claims 
i the plan provides that each holder of a claim of such class receive or retain on account of such claim property of a value,as of the effective date of the plan,equal to the allowed amount of such claim or 
ii the holder of any claim or interest that is junior to the claims of such class will not receive or retain under the plan on account of such junior claim or interest any property.
emphasis added.by its plain text,the absolute priority rule applies only to the confirmation of a chapter is entitled confirmation of plan and therefore is inapplicable to the dip financing order.
bergemann avers that the bankruptcy court attempted to do outside a plan what it can not do in a plan,citing in re braniff airways,cir,for support.bergemann reads braniff too broadly,however.there the bankruptcy court approved a transaction under b that included the sale of substantially all the assets and the exchange of million of the estate cash for restricted travel scrip.this court reversed,finding that many of the activities contemplated by the transaction fell outside the provisions of b authorizing the trustee to use,sell or lease the debtor assets moreover,we reasoned that the restricted nature of the travel scrip had the practical effect of dictating some of the terms of any future reorganization plan,and concluded that after such a sale,little would remain of the estate save fixed based equipment and little prospect or occasion for further reorganization t his proposed sale is in fact a reorganization.id.at.
braniff stands merely for the proposition that the provisions of permitting a trustee to use,sell,or lease the assets do not allow a debtor to gut the bankruptcy estate before reorganization or to change the fundamental nature of the estate assets in such a way that limits a future reorganization plan.the dip financing agreement contemplates neither of those functions it merely allows the debtors to obtain the credit necessary to their continued vitality as going entities,pledging their assets as security for the credit.it neither changes the fundamental nature of the assets nor limits future reorganization options.braniff does not compel application of the absolute priority rule in this case 
bergemann cites two additional cases for the proposition that the absolute priority rule applies in the context neither is persuasive instead,we agree that t he absolute priority rule is a confirmation standard which does not apply to a preconfirmation contested matter involving a debtor request to obtain senior credit.in re cent.park,neither the plain language of the statute nor any persuasive authority favors application of the absolute priority rule before plan confirmation.
even were we persuaded that the absolute priority rule permissibly could be
