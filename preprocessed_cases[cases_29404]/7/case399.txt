opinion of the court 
in a bankruptcy proceeding,oec group,new york oec asserted maritime liens on goods then in its possession,and it now appeals a ruling of the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania that certain contractual modifications to those liens were unenforceable.because we conclude that the modifications were enforceable as to goods then in oec possession,we will reverse and remand for the district court to craft an appropriate remedy.
background 
although the parties dispute the legal consequences of the facts,what happened is not in dispute.world imports,world imports chicago,llc,world imports south,llc,and llc collectively,world imports are business entities a that buy furniture wholesale and sell it to retail distributors.oec provided common carrier transportation to world imports for approximately five years,including services to ensure that cargo was delivered from countries of origin to world imports warehouse or to other united states destinations designated by world imports.
supporting documents 
on or about january,world imports,entered into an application for credit with oec the application.page two of the application,titled notice concerning limitation of liability,was signed by the vice president of world imports,and included the following language 
oec has adopted general terms and conditions of service.these terms and conditions are printed on the back of or accompany every invoice issued by oec and are incorporated herein by reference when oec is acting as a carrier,the exact limits of liability and the other terms and conditions of carriage can be located on the ocean bill of lading or other shipping document such as the airway bill issued by the carrier which is the contract between the parties.unless modified or superseded by the terms of the bill of lading or other contract of carriage,oec general terms and conditions of service will also apply to the transaction.however,the terms of the bill of lading prevail in all cases.
page three of the application,titled terms for credit accounts,was signed by the bookkeeper of world imports,and said 
specific terms and conditions of service apply to the services performed by oec.these terms and conditions are established by contract as set forth in the governing instrument or by operation of law.oec standard payment terms require receipt of cash in advance of performance.in the event that oec extends credit to world imports,which is defined as permitting world imports to pay for service within a specified period of time after performance by oec,world imports agrees that the following additional terms are applicable 
as security for any existing and future indebtedness of world imports to oec,including claims for charges,expenses or advances incurred by oec in connection with any shipment or transaction of world imports,and whether or not presently contemplated by world imports and oec,world imports hereby grants to oec a general lien and security interest in any and all property of world imports including goods and documents relating thereto then or thereafter in oec possession,custody or control or en route the collateral.this general lien and security interest shall be in addition to any other rights oec has or may acquire under other agreements applicable law,and shall survive delivery or release of any specific property of world imports

procedural background 
on july,the petition date,world imports filed voluntary petitions for relief in the bankruptcy court pursuant to chapter of title of the united states code the bankruptcy code.oec promptly filed a motion for relief from the automatic stay imposed by bankruptcy code a.it argued that it was a secured creditor with a possessory maritime lien on world imports goods in its possession and was entitled to refuse to release such goods unless and until certain prepetition claims were satisfied.as exhibits to its motion,oec provided documentation that,as of july,the total amount owed to oec by world imports was.of that amount,was the estimated freight and related charges due on containers then in oec possession the landed goods.the remaining consisted of freight and related charges associated with goods for which oec had previously provided transportation services the prepetition goods.oec estimated the total value of world imports goods then in oec possession was approximately.
world imports responded by filing an adversary proceeding against oec and a motion for an expedited hearing to compel oec to turn over all of world imports current goods,which world imports defined to include both the landed goods and goods then in transit for which oec was to provide delivery in the near future.a.world imports represented its willingness to pay oec for the freight charges on those current goods but not for the outstanding charges associated with the prepetition goods.after a hearing,the bankruptcy court granted the injunctive relief sought by world imports,ordering that 
pursuant to,world imports is entitled to immediate delivery and possession of the current goods and defendant oec shall immediately account for and deliver the current goods to world imports 
upon defendant oec delivery of the current goods to world imports,world imports shall pay defendant oec a the regular freight charges on the current goods b documented charges.
a.after oec timely filed its notice of appeal from the bankruptcy court order,that court issued an opinion in support of its order.see in re world imports.
oec did not seek a stay of the bankruptcy court order.rather,on appeal to the district court,it requested entry of an order requiring world imports to pay all outstanding amounts due for oec transportation services or,in the alternative,providing oec with valid,fully enforceable replacement liens on assets of world imports in the amount of.a.the district court ordered the parties to brief whether the specific contract at issue between the parties created a maritime lien a.after that briefing,the court entered an order on january,affirming the order of the bankruptcy court.specifically,the district court held that oec did not possess a valid maritime lien on the prepetition goods because the provisions in oec contract with world imports purporting to give oec a lien on goods in its possession for freight charges for the prepetition goods are unenforceable.world imports,oec group new york.accordingly,oec could not assert a maritime lien to supersede interests secured according to the uniform commercial code as adopted in various jurisdictions.id.at.oec timely appealed.
oec frames its appeal as a single question,namely,whether the bankruptcy court and district court erred in holding that the contract provisions at issue,which purported to give oec maritime liens on goods in its possession both for freight charges on those goods and for unpaid charges on prior shipments,were unenforceable.in its response,world imports has added the further question of whether oec failure to obtain a stay of the bankruptcy court order renders the appeal moot.we address the latter question first.
world imports argues that oec appeal should be dismissed as constitutionally moot because oec failed to obtain a stay of the bankruptcy court order and,instead,fully complied with that order by releasing the current goods to world imports in exchange for payment for the charges on those goods.that argument,however,fails to account for remedies that may still be granted to oec.as we observed in in re continental airlines,
an appeal is moot in the constitutional sense only if events have taken place during the pendency of the appeal that make it impossible for the court to grant any effectual relief whatsoever.an appeal is not moot merely because a court can not restore the parties to the status quo ante.rather,when a court can fashion some form of meaningful relief,even if it only partially redresses the grievances of the prevailing party,the appeal is not moot.
cir internal quotation marks omitted see also church of scientology of california united states,d.in this case,although oec complied with the bankruptcy court order by delivering the current goods,it has asked for relief that would remedy its loss from the surrender of those goods,specifically,a court order either requiring world imports to pay its outstanding debts to oec or granting oec enforceable replacement liens on other assets of world imports.because we are not precluded from granting any effective relief,oec appeal is not moot 
whether oec held a valid maritime lien 
the district court concluded,and world imports does not dispute,that a valid maritime lien would supersede any ucc security interests that may exist in the world imports cargo.world imports also concedes that oec possessed a valid maritime lien on the current goods for the actual freight charges associated with the current goods.appellees br.thus,the only dispute is whether oec held a valid maritime lien for charges associated with the prepetition goods.
maritime liens generally 
a maritime lien is a privileged claim upon maritime property,such as a vessel,arising out of services rendered to or injuries caused by that property.thomas schoenbaum,and.law,at ed.maritime liens are a security device intended to keep ships moving in commerce while preventing them from escaping their debts by sailing away.id.at.thus,such a lien attaches to the maritime property from the moment a debt arises,and adheres,even through changes in the property ownership,until extinguished by operation of law.id.at.
because maritime liens enjoy a special priority status and may operate without notice,courts are hesitant to recognize new forms of them or new circumstances under which such liens may arise.see osaka shosen kaisha pacific export lumber.the maritime privilege or lien,though adhering to the vessel,is a secret one which may operate to the prejudice of general creditors and purchasers without notice and is therefore stricti juris and can not be extended by construction,analogy or inference.citing vandewater mills,claimant of yankee blade,how.federal courts nevertheless have full authority to update old doctrines and to recognize new forms of liens if warranted by new conditions.logistics,v.one pyramid tent arena,cir internal quotation omitted collecting cases.
in much the same way that traditional maritime liens against a ship were based on the legal fiction that the ship was the wrongdoer,see schoenbaum,supra,at,maritime law recognizes a reciprocal claim against the ship cargo for debts associated with it.
subject to the exception that the lien of the shipowner may be displaced by an unconditional delivery of the goods before the consignee is required to pay the freight,or by an inconsistent and irreconcilable provision in the or bill of lading,the rule is universal as understood in the decisions of the federal courts,that the ship is bound to the merchandise and the merchandise to the ship for the performance on the part of the shipper and shipowner of their respective contracts.
the maggie hammond,wall.as the supreme court acknowledged in its influential opinion in a case captioned simply the bird of paradise,such liens on cargo may arise out of contracts to pay freight.wall.see also thomas russell,benedict on admiralty,at ed.collecting cases.
waiver of liens for unpaid freight 
a lien for unpaid freight arises from the right of the to retain the possession of the goods until the freight is paid,and thus is lost upon unconditional delivery to the consignee.bird of paradise,at emphasis added.yet,because it would frustrate commerce to require shipowners to retain their liens only by actual possession of the implicated cargo a shipowner enjoys a strong presumption that,absent a clear indication to the contrary,he has not waived his cargo lien upon delivery of that cargo to overcome the presumption against waiver,a court determining whether a cargo lien has been waived by unconditional delivery may consider,among other things,whether there was an understanding between the parties regarding retention of the lien either before or at the time the consignee took possession of the cargo whether there was a stipulation in the contract of affreightment inconsistent with the exercise of a lien,or whether other security was taken when the cargo was discharged.russell,supra,at.
both the bankruptcy court and the district court appear to have assumed,without analysis,that oec did not merely deliver the prepetition goods to world imports,but did so unconditionally and thus in waiver of its liens on those goods given the strong presumption against waiver,and in the absence of clear evidence of unconditional delivery,we can not agree with that assumption.the evidence appears to us to be very much to the contrary.consistent with the presumption against waiver,both the application and the tariff expressly state the understanding of the parties that oec would hold liens against any world imports goods in oec possession as security for among other things charges incurred for any shipment of world imports goods,and that such liens would survive delivery.a.independent of the question of whether those provisions are fully enforceable in and of themselves,they are compelling evidence that oec did not clearly intend to waive its cargo liens on the prepetition goods by making an unconditional delivery of such goods.they show instead that there was an agreement between the parties,for the purpose of perpetuating any such lien,to apply unwaived and unsatisfied liens toward cargo currently in oec possession,the cargo essentially taking the place of cargo previously delivered out of oec possession.moreover,this case is akin to capitol transportation,united states,in which the first circuit rejected the argument that a carrier had waived its liens on prior shipments when it released shipping containers without providing notice of a continuing lien,noting that the relevant tariffs in effect in this case provide that such liens survive delivery of the goods,cir.those tariffs,the court affirmed,are considered binding and in essence carry the force of law.id.at.in light of the express language of oec tariff,that case squarely supports the position that oec did not unconditionally deliver the prepetition goods,and hence retained its liens on those goods.
we further note that the persistence of a lien through substitution is not a novel practice,as i t is familiar doctrine of the admiralty courts that a maritime lien attaches not only to the original subject of the lien,but also to whatever is substituted for it,and that the lienholder may follow the proceeds wherever he can distinctly trace them.bank of british am.freights,of the hutton,cir.shipping freights of the jackie hause,holding that a shipowner had not waived its cargo lien when its release of the cargo was conditioned on the substitution of freight money,held in escrow,for such cargo.
world imports disputes that the parties could have created valid maritime liens entirely through contract,but it has not attempted to dispute that,as a general proposition,oec carrier services created enforceable maritime liens by operation of law.indeed,world imports consistent acknowledgment that oec possessed a maritime lien on the current goods for the actual freight charges associated with the current goods is also,by implication,a tacit concession that oec,at least initially,must have possessed comparable maritime liens on the prepetition goods for freight charges associated with those goods.appellees br.hence,if one concludes,as we do,that oec never waived those liens on the prepetition goods,then the question of whether the parties could and did create the liens solely through contract is a red herring.instead,the dispositive questions are whether liens arising by operation of maritime law may be modified or extended by agreement,and whether such an agreement may extend an unwaived lien onto property currently in the lienholder possession.
enforceability of maritime lien provisions 
world imports argues against the enforceability of the parties contractual lien modifications by pointing to portions of the supreme court opinion in bird of paradise which state that maritime liens on cargo are established by operation of law rather than agreement of the parties and arise from the shipowners possessory interest in the cargo.attempting to place on oec the burden of proving both that the parties intended to preserve the maritime liens for the prepetition goods and that the delivery of those goods was not unconditional world imports argues that oec has failed to produce any evidence whatsoever to demonstrate that the delivery of the prepetition goods was anything but unconditional.appellees br.insisting that oec made such an unconditional delivery of the prepetition goods,world imports essentially argues that bird of paradise does not authorize the parties to reassert waived liens from the prepetition goods onto the current goods.both the district court and bankruptcy court accepted that argument and declined to interpret bird of paradise as authorizing the parties contractual extension of oec maritime liens.
to recap,our analysis of the facts begins from a very different premise than that adopted by the district court and bankruptcy court.they assumed that oec waived its liens on the prepetition goods through unconditional delivery but nevertheless tried,through contract,to revive those liens and place them on the current goods.we conclude that oec did not waive its previous liens but rather agreed with world imports in advance that such liens would survive delivery and would be applied to any of world imports goods currently in oec possession.on that foundation,we hold that their agreement to extend the liens is enforceable.
despite world imports contentions,the opinion in bird of paradise made clear that there is no internal contradiction in recognizing a lien as a creature of maritime law that,once created by operation of law,may be extended or modified by agreement of the parties.in that case,the court affirmed that a maritime lien arises from the usages of commerce,independently of the agreement of the parties bird of paradise,at see also osaka,at clarifying that t he contract of affreightment itself creates no lien,and this court has consistently declared that the obligation between ship and cargo is mutual and reciprocal and does not attach until the cargo is on board or in the master custody krauss.lumber dimon.affirming that,while contracts may form the basis of a maritime lien,it is o nly upon the lading of the vessel or at least when she is ready to receive the cargo that the lien arises or attaches.in other words,a traditional maritime lien can not be created by contract alone,but that does not mean that such liens,once created,are beyond contractual modification.
on the contrary,immediately after recognizing that a cargo lien,being possessory,is lost by an unconditional delivery to the consignee,bird of paradise used broad language supporting contractual modification and extension of the lien beyond delivery,stating 
parties,however,may frame their contract of affreightment as they please,and of course may employ words to affirm the existence of the maritime lien,or to extend or modify it,or they may so frame their contract as to exclude it altogether.they may agree that the goods,when the ship arrives at the port of destination,shall be deposited in the warehouse of the consignee or owner,and that the transfer and deposit shall not be regarded as the waiver of the lien and where they so agree,the settled rule in this court is,that the law will uphold the agreement and support the lien.
at emphasis added 
the bankruptcy court interpreted that passage more narrowly than the language calls for,hanging great weight on the opinion prior use of the definite article the before the word freight to conclude that a maritime lien was limited to the immediate circumstances in which it arose 
in bird of paradise,the high court stated that the l egal effect of such a lien is that the,as carrier by water,may retain the goods until the freight is paid id.at.it added that the lien arises from the right of the to retain the possession of the goods until the freight is paid,and is lost by an unconditional delivery to the consignee.id.this court places emphasis on the definite article the preceding the word freight.it reads those statements to limit the extent of a maritime lien to the freight charges for those goods on that vessel at that time.it does not share oec reading of the case to allow the parties to unconditionally extend the lien to unpaid freight for prior cargo deliveries.see also newell norton,wall.indeed,the only power the contracting parties have respecting such liens as attach as consequences to certain contracts is,that the creditor may waive the lien,and may by express stipulation,or by his manner of dealing in certain cases,give credit exclusively to those who would also have been bound to him personally by the same contract which would have given rise to the lien.
in re world imports,at original emphasis.besides its underlying assumption that oec waived its prior liens through unconditional delivery,we think the bankruptcy court analysis is flawed by two significant oversights.first,it overlooks the context and sequence in which the supposedly limiting language appeared in the bird of paradise opinion.as mentioned above,the supreme court opinion began by describing the origins and traditional form of maritime liens,but then,in its transition between paragraphs,signaled that the parties may depart from the norm by contractual agreement.see bird of paradise,at t he lien arises from the right of the to retain the possession of the goods until the freight is paid,and is lost by an unconditional delivery to the consignee.parties,however,may frame their contract of affreightment as they please,and of course may employ words to affirm the existence of the maritime lien,or to extend or modify it emphasis added and footnote omitted.had the order of the statements been reversed that is,had the supreme court stressed the traditional form of maritime liens after discussing contractual modification that might provide a stronger basis from which to argue that the supreme court intended to limit albeit only implicitly the scope of contractual modifications of liens to something closely resembling the traditional form.however,read in proper sequence,the supreme court opinion signals the opposite message,namely,that despite the origins and traditional form of maritime liens,parties are free to contractually extend or modify an existing lien as they please,at.
the bankruptcy court second oversight is its casual citation to language appearing in the report of another supreme court case,newell norton,language that is not the supreme court but is merely a summary of one party position in the syllabus of that case,on a point which ultimately played no role in the court analysis.see newell,at documenting the arguments of counsel for the appellants in that case.world imports has pushed that erroneous reliance on newell syllabus at every stage of the proceedings see a,appellees br,even after oec has repeatedly,and correctly,drawn attention to the citation complete absence of authoritative value see a,appellant br,reply br.the dogged determination of world imports to perpetuate a clear error of citation is both troubling and revealing.
especially in light of the familiar doctrine that a maritime lien may attach to property substituted for the original object of the lien,bank of british,at,we see no sound reason why the parties contractual transfer of the unwaived liens to the current goods should not have been enforceable see also logistics,at contractual provisions regarding liens on cargo for freight are enforceable in admiralty.citing bird of paradise,at id.a lien on the cargo is normally expressly granted in the bills of lading and charter parties.if so,the extent of the relevant lien is governed by the terms of the lien clause.quoting eric danoff,provisional remedies in.
both the district court and world imports raise the policy argument that an extended maritime lien on cargo could hurt innocent third parties.in doing so,they rely primarily on atlantic richfield good hope refineries,cir,in which the fifth circuit concluded that a transportation provider could not assert a lien on undelivered cargo to secure unpaid charges on already delivered cargo.after concluding,as a matter of contractual interpretation,that the applicable lien clause did not guarantee this right o n its face and was not otherwise ambiguous,id.at,the court opined,in dicta,that a broader construction of the contractual language might also have unfavorable consequences to third parties 
an expansive interpretation of this maritime lien clause would have consequences far beyond the situation where the cargo belonged to the charterer and was seized before it left the vessel.the lien for the debts of past voyages would extend to cargo owned by others,and might,if all the other terms of the entire clause were literally enforced,follow that cargo after delivery,even if all freights due for its carriage were paid.we decline to sanction reinterpretation of words apparently clear to permit this result.
id.at emphasis added.
the fifth circuit policy concerns were apparently ancillary to what the court considered a question of contractual interpretation,but the district court in the present case decided that the lien clauses now at issue are unenforceable on policy grounds alone.specifically,it worried that a purchaser of the undelivered goods would have no notice that the goods it purchased could be withheld pursuant to a maritime lien on goods.world imports,at.
putting aside the real and immediate harm of depriving oec of the benefit of its bargain with world imports,at least three other considerations weigh against the district court policy concern.first,any risk to third parties is mitigated by the fact that,unlike the voyage charter at issue in atlantic richfield,oec tariff not only specifies the applicability of the maritime lien to unsatisfied debts of previous shipments in unambiguous language,but does so in a published document.
second,the potential of harm to third parties is implicated regardless of whether the maritime lien is intended to satisfy the consignee immediate charges or past ones.in either case,the lien creates the danger that the consignee failure to meet its obligations to the carrier will impede its ability to put the cargo into the hands of a third party.t his is a characteristic of all maritime liens.usher ocean wave,cir.any marginal increase in the risk to third parties above the risk inherent in a traditional lien on cargo is limited in this case because,as already noted supra,the goods to which the previous liens attached were still in the carrier possession.in other words,the type of lien asserted in this case was still,at bottom,a possessory lien over goods that had not yet entered the stream of commerce.
third,we must consider the potential benefits to commerce of enforcing the parties voluntary decision to enter into this type of credit arrangement.although world imports has argued that commerce is hindered by allowing a current shipment of goods to be held hostage to secure the payment of prior shipments,that argument ignores the commercial benefit implicit in that or any other credit arrangement that facilitates the exchange of goods or services with a guarantee of future payment.the relevant fact is not simply that the most recent shipment was held up,but that numerous prior shipments were not held up because the shipper had assurances that it could release those shipments conditionally,without surrendering its liens.in other words,while the traditional cargo lien promotes commerce by ensuring that a particular ship can assert a secured claim even after the cargo has conditionally left the ship,oec contractually modified lien further promotes commerce over a series of transactions by ensuring that the carrier can retain its secured claims in an ongoing business relationship 
besides its public policy argument,the district court also relied on the principle that maritime liens should be strictly construed,reasoning that 
n o supreme court decision has addressed whether parties may contractually modify a maritime lien to make the delivery of existing shipments contingent on the consignee payment for shipments.as maritime liens are to be strictly construed,this court declines oec invitation to extend or modify maritime liens beyond the circumstances indicated by supreme court precedent.see osaka shosen kaisha,at 
world imports,at.
the case which the district court cited,osaka shosen kaisha pacific export lumber,reaffirmed that t he maritime privilege or lien is a secret one which may operate to the prejudice of general creditors and purchasers without notice and is therefore stricti juris and can not be extended by construction,analogy or inference.at.and while that principle is sound,we think the district court has misapprehended its import.the principle does not restrain the private modification of liens arising out of the traditional relationship between ship and cargo,the lien of the cargo owner on the ship or the lien of the shipowner on the cargo but rather limits the judicial creation of new circumstances,outside that reciprocal relationship,under which liens may attach in the first instance.the language proscribing the expansion of the lien universe by construction,analogy or inference curtails a court ability to recognize,by mere legal implication,previously unanticipated circumstances under which liens may arise by operation of maritime law,but says nothing about private parties ability to modify traditional liens by express agreement.reading that language to limit private lien modifications to those forms previously and specifically blessed by the supreme court renders meaningless the same court affirmation that parties may extend or modify liens and otherwise frame their contracts of affreightment as they please.compare osaka,at finding inadequate legal authority to recognize a new type of lien upon a ship for damages resulting from a failure to accept all the intended cargo with bird of paradise,at recognizing that parties of course may agree to extend or modify a lien aris ing from the usages of commerce.the district court appears to have blurred the distinction between judicial enforcement of a private contract and more comprehensive judicial,interpreting oec enforceability argument as an invitation for the court itself to extend or modify maritime liens beyond their traditional forms.world imports,at.in this case at least,there is a material difference between judicial expansion of a legal doctrine and judicial enforcement of a private agreement to vary from a legal default.
one last argument against enforceability of oec liens is embodied in the bankruptcy court co
