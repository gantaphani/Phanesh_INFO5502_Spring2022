these consolidated appeals present the issue of law of whether the term abandonment in section of the bankruptcy code gives the bankruptcy courts the power to adversely abandon a railroad easement and trackage rights over rail lines owned by the debtor at the time of the bankruptcy.this appears to be an issue of first impression in the courts of appeals.
section,which resulted from the bankruptcy code amendments,is an exception to the normal rule that only the surface transportation board stb,the successor to the earlier interstate commerce commission icc,has jurisdiction to authorize the abandonment of rail lines or the discontinuance of operations over any part of a rail line.see.in the section abandonment process,the stb still plays a role,but it is an advisory one.see b,c.outside of the context of a bankrupt railroad,in order to achieve an abandonment or a discontinuance,rail carriers must apply to the stb for permission.
a discussion of some of the parlance of federal railroad regulation is helpful.generally,when a rail carrier or a third party wishes to abandon its own rail line,it must seek permission from the stb.if a rail carrier is operating rail transportation over its own line or over the line of another by the grant of independent trackage rights,it must seek permission from the stb to discontinue the service.id.the stb authority and the standards governing its decisions are the same regardless of whether it is granting an abandonment or a discontinuance.see id.d.
under,this application can be brought to the stb by the rail carrier itself or,in a more unusual circumstance,by a third party.see consolidated rail.if the rail carrier applies to abandon or discontinue its own lines or service,the application is for an abandonment or discontinuance what we will call a direct abandonment or discontinuance for purposes of clarity.by contrast,if a third party applies to abandon or discontinue the lines or services of another rail carrier in an stb proceeding,it is called an adverse abandonment or discontinuance.id.the stb can grant an adverse abandonment or discontinuance on a third party petition even if the owner of the line or the trackage rights objects.the text of section itself does not distinguish between adverse and direct abandonments,but the case law makes it clear that the stb has authority to hear both types of applications.thompson texas mexican ry.there is no requirement that the application for abandonment to the stb be made by the carrier whose operations are sought to be abandoned.
here the debtor railroad through its trustee seeks to adversely abandon not its own interest,but the interests of a third party in an easement and trackage rights over lines once owned by the debtor at the time of bankruptcy.the rub is that it seeks to do so in the bankruptcy court,not before the stb.the district court held that the statutory language in section,giving the bankruptcy court authority over abandonments of rail lines,does not include the authority to grant adverse abandonments of a trackage or other rights.the in bankruptcy appeals this decision.
we affirm the district court dismissal of count iii of the trustee complaint.in doing so,we hold that the bankruptcy court does not have the authority under section to adversely abandon the lines or trackage rights of a,on the petition of a debtor railroad who owned those lines at the time of bankruptcy.such authority lies,instead,within the jurisdiction of the stb under.we also affirm the decision of the stb under denying permission for the relief the trustee seeks.
in march,bangor aroostook railroad company bar and canadian national cn which includes canadian national railway company cnr and its subsidiary,waterloo railway company waterloo entered into a series of agreements involving the movement of rail cars over the madawaska rail line.at the time of the agreements,bar and its wholly owned subsidiary,van buren bridge company vbbc,owned this line.the madawaska line runs from the fraser paper mill in madawaska,maine,to an interchange with a cn line at leonard,new brunswick,canada.in exchange for the rights granted under the agreements,cn paid bar five million dollars in cash.the first agreement between the two parties was a junction settlement agreement,under which bar agreed to move cn railcars over bar madawaska line,between the connection with cn rail lines at leonard and the fraser paper mill cn agreed to pay bar a specified price for performing these haulage services and has done so.the parties also entered into a trackage rights agreement.under this agreement,cnr acquired limited local trackage rights which allowed it to run its own trains over the madawaska line to the fraser paper mill.finally,in a third agreement bar granted waterloo a freight easement,under which waterloo could also operate its trains over the line.it is the last two agreements which the trustee seeks to undo here.
the stb approved the trackage rights and easement agreements on an application by cn on march.since this time,cn has not itself used its own trackage rights or the easement instead it has relied on the haulage agreement to service the fraser mill,and pays bar a fee for its services.
on august,certain creditors filed an involuntary chapter bankruptcy proceeding against bar.in december,the bankruptcy court entered an order for relief under chapter.it appointed james howard as trustee in bankruptcy as part of the bankruptcy plan,montreal,maine atlantic railway ltd mm a acquired the madawaska line and other bar rail assets from the trustee in january.the effect of the agreement between mm a and bar is that the trustee no longer has ownership rights as to the line.
there was also what we suspect was an unusual arrangement in a part of the acquisition agreement mm a agreed to pay bar five million dollars if bar successfully removed cn from the madawaska line prior to january.the trustee sole remaining interest in the line is the potential five million dollar payout from mm a.as a result,bar had a financial incentive to attempt to oust cn from the madawaska line,although it no longer owns the line.cn,of course,had no interest in abandoning any of its rights in that line which it recently had paid five million dollars to bar to acquire.
in march,the trustee filed a motion in bankruptcy court to reject the junction settlement agreement,the trackage rights agreement,and the easement as executory contracts under.the trustee initially acknowledged that the elimination of cn trackage rights and easement was subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the stb,but later changed his position on this issue.
in may,the bankruptcy court stayed the proceedings pending action by the stb on appropriate requests for relief by the trustee to the stb.with the stb,the trustee filed a petition to revoke cn trackage and easement rights,pursuant to d.this effort was unsuccessful,and the stb explained that because cn trackage and easement rights were authorized by the agency,they will remain in effect until discontinuance authority is granted under.canadian ry,stb finance docket,wl at stb june.basically,the stb said the trustee had used the wrong procedural vehicle.the stb also said that even if it were to construe a petition to revoke as a request for adverse discontinuance under the correct vehicle,there was no basis in the record to grant such a request.id.at.
after the stb rejection of the trustee petition to revoke,the bankruptcy court extended the stay of the proceedings,pending the trustee completion of the adverse abandonment proceedings before the stb under.
the trustee then switched tracks metaphorically.on april,the trustee asserted for the first time in bankruptcy court that the stb did not have final authority over the forced abandonment of cn rights,and that the bankruptcy court could unilaterally oust cn from the line pursuant to its authority under.it is apparent that the trustee calculated,rightly or wrongly,that he was more likely to get the five million dollar payment from mm a by being in bankruptcy court on the adverse abandonment issue,rather than before the stb.
on may,the bankruptcy court issued an oral order that lifted the stay on the proceedings and converted the matter to an adversary proceeding.the trustee filed his complaint in the adversary proceedings against cn on june.count iii of the complaint sought an order from the bankruptcy court authorizing the discontinuance of cn trackage rights and the abandonment of cn easement.
after a telephone conference with the parties,the bankruptcy court issued a procedural order dated june.the court stated that it was uncertain whether bar efforts not to discontinue its own existing service over a portion of a rail line,but to adversely abandon cn rights to use bar tracks were within the scope of a bankruptcy court power under.on june,cn filed an unopposed motion to withdraw reference of the adversary proceeding to the bankruptcy court.the motion was granted on june,and all further proceedings took place in the federal district court of maine.on july,cn moved to dismiss the trustee complaint,arguing that the bankruptcy court had no authority to issue adverse abandonments of a lines under.
the magistrate judge issued a recommended decision that section of the bankruptcy code did not apply to the trustee efforts to remove cn from the madawaska line,and that the relief sought by the trustee could only be obtained if the stb granted the adverse abandonment pursuant to section.the decision concluded that the plain language of the statute did not determine its meaning and that recourse to the legislative history was appropriate.the magistrate judge concluded that the legislative history made it reasonably clear that in enacting section congress was concerned with streamlining and accelerating the process of abandonment or discontinuance of a debtor own rail lines,not the lines of.this interpretation was further supported by the stb decision in chicago,rock island pac,wl,which the magistrate judge found reasonably construed sections and,in tandem,to preserve the stb power to adjudicate an petition filed by a debtor railroad.finally,the magistrate judge concluded that the language used by congress in enacting different legislation in which applied section to the milwaukee railroad restructuring supported an interpretation limiting the abandonment authority of the bankruptcy court to the debtor own lines.in this legislation,congress stated,the bankruptcy court may authorize the abandonment of lines of the milwaukee railroad pursuant to section of title.a 
on november,the district court agreed with the decision of the magistrate judge and adopted its reasoning.the district court order granted cn motion to dismiss count iii of the complaint under rule b.it also deferred adjudication of the motion as it pertained to the remaining counts of the trustee complaint pending the stb disposition on the trustee adverse discontinuance application.
in the meantime,the trustee had filed on october,an application with the stb for the abandonment of cn trackage rights and easement over the madawaska line.this was essentially an application for an adverse abandonment under section but the trustee noted that his position was that if the final authority was in the bankruptcy court under section,then the stb opinion should be viewed only as an advisory opinion as permitted by section.from the perspective of the stb,whether it is acting in an advisory capacity or as the final authority,the substantive standards for the two determinations are the same.treating it as a matter under section,the stb on april,denied the application because it found the trustee had failed to meet its burden of showing that the public convenience and necessity required the ouster of cn from the madawaska line.waterloo ry,stb docket no,wl,at stb april.
the stb determined that the public is best served by allowing cn to remain on the madawaska line.in coming to its conclusion,the stb balanced the competing benefits and burdens on all interested parties.one such interested party was fraser papers.fraser papers had intervened in and opposed the trustee abandonment action before the stb.fraser stressed that in the past its mill at madawaska,maine,had been served only by bar and that in late it had expressed strong concern to cn that bar financial condition was deteriorating and that a consequent loss of rail service would likely result in a shutdown of the madawaska mill.fraser said that the madawaska mill is highly interdependent with another mill in edmundston,new brunswick,canada.if the madawaska mill were shut down,the edmundston mill would be shut down as well,depriving employees of work and depriving fraser of million dollars in revenue per week.the stb agreed that the loss of competitive rail service would be a detriment to fraser and perhaps would impact the economic development and of communities and rural areas near the mill.id.at.
although it was not required by statute to do so,the stb also considered the needs of bar creditors,the benefits to the bankrupt estate,and the fairness of the arrangement to the parties involved.id.at.the stb found that the trackage rights obligation between cn and bar and now honored by mm a in march was fair and entered into at arm length.it also determined that the retention of cn on the madawaska line would not affect mm a survival or cause the abandonment of other mm a line segments.the board ultimately determined that the interests of the bankrupt estate did not justify stripping cn of its right to provide competitive rail service to fraser or depriving fraser of its right to receive that service.id.at.
the stb rejected challenges made to the standing of the trustee in light of the sale of the line by bar to mm id.at no party challenges that determination on appeal.after the stb issued its decision,the trustee filed in court a consented to motion for the voluntary dismissal of the remaining counts of the trustee complaint without prejudice,pursuant to rule a.on june,the district court granted the voluntary dismissal without prejudice as to the remaining counts of the trustee complaint and entered a separate and final judgment in cn favor,pursuant to rule a.the trustee timely appealed the dismissal of count iii to this court in.fraser has intervened and has filed a brief in this court in support of affirmance of the district court opinion.
in,the trustee also timely petitioned this court for review of the stb order denying the trustee application for discontinuance and abandonment.see.both fraser and cn have intervened in this matter.the trustee argues that the stb had no jurisdiction to issue a binding decision under and that it could only issue an advisory report under.the trustee does not attack the merits of the stb decision.in response,the stb has also filed a brief,pointing out that it had been made a party only in appeal,and that the issue of whether section applied was an issue only in appeal.the stb says that whatever the outcome of that question,the trustee has waived any argument addressed to the merits of the stb determination.the stb asks that we affirm the board decision.
review of the dismissal of a claim under rule b for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted is de novo.martin applied cellular,cir.
the trustee makes an argument based on the plain meaning of the statutory text of.the relevant parts of section provide as follows 
a the court,after notice and a hearing,may authorize the abandonment of all or a portion of a railroad line if such abandonment is 
a in the best interest of the estate or 
b essential to the formulation of a plan and 
consistent with the public interest.
b if such abandonment would require approval by the stb under law of the united states,the trustee shall initiate an appropriate application for such abandonment with the stb.the court may fix a time within which the stb shall report to the court on such application.
c after the court receives the report of the stb,or the expiration of the time fixed under subsection b of this section,whichever occurs first,the court may authorize such abandonment,after notice to the stb,the secretary of transportation,the trustee,any party in interest that has requested notice,any affected shipper or community,and any other entity prescribed by the court,and a hearing.
the trustee argues that section is not limited to abandonment of the debtor own operations and that the phrase all or a portion of a rail line shows that the term abandonment is not so limited 
in fact,bar argument does not rely on the plain text of section,but requires reference to a prior judicial construction of section.the relevant parts of that section,in turn,provide 
d a rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the board under this part may 
abandon any part of its railroad lines or 
discontinue the operation of all rail transportation over any part of its railroad lines 
only if the board finds that the present or future public convenience and necessity require or permit the abandonment or discontinuance.
bar argument is that the term abandonment as used in section has been construed by both the agency and the courts to include adverse abandonment.see consolidated rail,at.from this,the trustee argues that congress was aware of the construction of abandonment in section and is presumed to have adopted that construction in section.
the trustee also argues that his reading of section is sensible and would not have improper effects on third parties.the trustee says first that concerns about railroads are irrelevant because any consequences to them are exactly what congress intended,as the plain text demonstrates.further,the trustee points out that section requires the court to consult the stb and consider the public interest that is enough,the trustee says,to allay any untoward effects on third parties 
indeed the trustee attacks the district court ruling itself as leading to untoward results.the trustee argues,for example,that if the debtor wants to abandon its own underlying rail lines,the bankruptcy court could not grant this abandonment until the debtor first sought an application with the stb to discontinue the overlying trackage rights of a.see.pac,wl,an abandonment may not be consummated until the rail carrier with trackage rights discontinuance has been authorized and interested persons are given an opportunity to seek imposition of trail use and public use conditions.
finally,the trustee argues that legislative history should not be considered,but that if it is,it supports the trustee interpretation we take each argument in turn.
the meaning of the term abandonment as it is used in is not and can not be resolved on textual plain meaning grounds.one can not tell by reading the term abandonment in section whether the term includes adverse abandonment.nor can one tell whether this is so simply from the fact that the term abandonment in section has been construed to include adverse abandonments as well.in determining what the statute means,we can not simply rely on a few phrases in a complicated statutory structure.section must be read in the context of what congress was trying to do when it gave the bankruptcy court abandonment authority over a debtor railroad in bankruptcy.both that context and the legislative history lead us to reject the trustee interpretation.
in designing the statutory scheme,congress set up an interplay between and.under section,the stb is the regulatory board charged with implementing overall congressional rail transportation policy.rail carriers are subject to the jurisdiction of the stb,and when a rail carrier intends to abandon its underlying rail lines or discontinue rail transportation or trackage rights over a line,it must seek permission by filing an application with the stb.generally,the stb authority over abandonment of rail lines is exclusive and plenary.chicago transp.kalo brick tile,d.
one exception to this exclusive stb authority is the abandonment of rail lines when a debtor railroad is in bankruptcy.congress designed special provisions in those limited circumstances for railroad reorganization that attempted to allow the railroad to emerge as a living,not a dying,enterprise.see new haven inclusion cases,d internal quotations omitted.one such provision can be found in the amendments to the bankruptcy code.
section replaced section o of the bankruptcy act,formerly codified at o.the courts had construed the former section dealing with railroads in bankruptcy to require an stb determination of whether an abandonment of a debtor rail line was adverse to the public interest as a prerequisite to abandonment in bankruptcy,palmer massachusetts.palmer involved a direct abandonment by a debtor rail line of its own lines.in an effort to streamline the process,congress made it clear in enacting that it wanted the bankruptcy court,not the stb,to make the final determination of whether a debtor rail lines could be abandoned and the stb to play an advisory role,subject to time constraints.this would speed up the decisional process.
importantly,the stb was not ousted of its exclusive jurisdiction over all matters pertaining to bankrupt railroads.see except with respect to abandonment under section and certain other situations the trustee and the debtor are subject to the provisions of subtitle iv of title the chapter authorizing the stb that are applicable to railroads.if,for example,the debtor as part of its reorganization plan wanted to construct an extension to any of its railroad lines,construct an additional railroad line,or provide transportation over an extended or additional railroad line,it would first have to apply to the stb for a certificate authorizing such activity.see 
under section,the stb still plays an important advisory role in the granting of permission for the abandonment of a reorganizing debtor rail lines.if the stb issues an advisory report within the time allowed by the bankruptcy court,the bankruptcy court should consider the stb report,but the stb conclusions are not binding.b,c.
the legislative history of section illuminates congress intent in several ways.first,it identifies the regulatory problem that needed to be remedied.second,it identifies the type of problems suffered by debtor railroads which were of concern.third,it focuses on which railroads debtor or interests were of concern.fourth,it emphasizes that other types of issues concerning a debtor rail line remain within the stb exclusive jurisdiction.
in enacting section,congress was attempting to remedy specific problems which arose from the judicial interpretation of the old scheme.the regulatory problem was that when the debtor was first required to go to the stb to seek the abandonment without any time limits for the stb decisions and then go to the court,there was a delay.the senate report states 
the incorporation of railroad reorganizations into the general reorganization provisions of the bill eliminates the cumbersome and duplicative procedure of section under which plans of reorganization shuttled back and forth between the stb and the courts and proceedings were inevitably more time consuming and expensive.under the bill,the bankruptcy court,rather than the stb,assumes the primary responsibility for the reorganization proceeding.
at,reprinted in.in turn,this delay exacerbated the cash drain on a rail carrier operating a financially unsound line while waiting for the stb to consider its application to abandon that line 
in the case of a railroad being administered under title,the necessity to stem the bankrupt carrier cash drain requires expeditious treatment of abandonment applications.this subchapter provides that the court rather than the stb has the authority to authorize abandonments or discontinuances of rail services.
at,reprinted in.the legislative history makes it clear that congress was concerned with making the system for the abandonment of debtor railroad rail lines quicker,more efficient,and less costly for the debtor railroad.
the legislative history emphasizes that many of the operations of the debtor railroad remain within the exclusive jurisdiction of the stb 
s ince a plan of reorganization for a railroad may propose changes in transportation patterns or operation by,among other things,granting operating rights over,or transferring,the debtor rail lines,the bill retains the stb jurisdiction with respect t
