shortly after her debts had been discharged in bankruptcy,nancy murray received a credit solicitation from gmac mortgage,which had learned her name and address by asking credit bureaus to forward information about potential borrowers who met specified criteria.gmacm offered murray a loan to be secured by a mortgage on her home.deluged by offers,murray showed them to a lawyer,who concluded that gmacm had violated the fair credit reporting act in two ways first,gmacm had not made the firm offer of credit that is essential when a potential lender accesses someone credit history without that person consent,see c b i second,gmacm offer did not include a clear and conspicuous notice of the recipient right to close her credit information to all who lacked her prior consent,see d d.murray filed suit,proposing to represent a class of about million recipients of similar offers from gmacm and demanding statutory damages,which range from to per person.see a a.a recent amendment to the act abolishes private remedies for violations of the requirement,which in the future will be enforced administratively,but that change does not apply to offers made before its effective date and thus does not affect this litigation.see stat,adding h.
while waiting for the judge to decide whether the suit could proceed as a class action,the parties reached a tentative the district judge refused to read,stating that this would be a waste of time because he had decided that murray could not represent a class.see wl,dist.lexis,reconsideration denied,wl,dist.lexis.in an effort to save the availability of relief,murray proposes an interlocutory appeal,which we have discretion to allow.see.f.gmacm,seeing an opportunity to avoid liability at least until another recipient of its offer files suit,opposes her petition.meanwhile another district judge has certified a class in an essentially identical action.see murray new cingular wireless services.we accept the appeal,which presents some fundamental questions about the management of consumer class actions,in light of this conflict and the fact that about two score more of these suits are pending in the northern district of illinois.because the papers already filed cover the issues fully,we proceed directly to decision.
the district court gave four reasons for declining to certify a class counsel did not try to cut a deal for murray personally.the complaint seeks statutory but not compensatory damages.statutory damages,if awarded to a class,would be ruinously high.nancy murray is a professional plaintiff unfit to represent a class.all but evince hostility to all class litigation if any one were adopted,consumer class actions under the fair credit reporting act would be impossible.none is a proper ground on which to deny class certification,however.
let us start with the first.the district judge wrote murray interests are antagonistic to other class members interests because murray may desire to settle her claim alone.murray might be able to recover more funds individually with fewer complications if she settled individually.yet every plaintiff may desire to settle alone if this were enough to preclude class treatment,there could be no class actions for damages under rule b.the district judge did not point to any evidence suggesting that murray does want to settle privately if she did and her lawyers say,without contradiction from the record,that she does,why launch the suit as a class action the only answer would be that she wanted to use the class as bait to attract a better offer,then cash in by withdrawing the class claim.if that were her goal or her lawyer,it would be unethical,see shelton pargo,cir,as well as unrealistic.for unless the statute of limitations had run which it has,why would gmacm pay murray to go away when any of a million other recipients could take her place 
unfortunately,the terms of the tentative settlement suggest that murray or her lawyers may have tried something worse,negotiating for payment while giving gmacm the benefit of a judgment that leaves the class.gmacm agreed to put up a fund of that would be divided between the class members and their lawyer.murray would get the first the remaining class members some of whom would receive mailed notice and counsel would divide the rest.that works out to less than per recipient of gmacm mailing.money not claimed from the,given the tiny sum per person,who would bother to mail a claim would be distributed to charity and murray lawyers.
this looks like the sort of settlement that we condemned in blair equifax check services,cir,and crawford equifax payment services,cir,two appeals arising from the same litigation.that suit had been settled for to the named plaintiff,to a society that had not been injured by the defendant conduct,and in legal fees.we treated the disproportion for one class member,nothing for the proof that the class device had been used to obtain leverage for one person benefit.see also,young higbee.weiss regal collections,cir chateau de ville productions,music library,cir.here the proposed award is to the representative while other class members are frozen out.the payment of to murray is three times the statutory maximum,while others do get even the that the act specifies as the minimum.oddly,this is the sort of tactic that the district judge chastised counsel for not employing on murray behalf.
such a settlement is untenable.we do mean by this that all class members must receive risk that the class will lose should the suit go to judgment on the merits justifies a compromise that affords a lower award with certainty.see in re mexico money transfer litigation,cir.but if the reason other class members get relief worth about of the minimum statutory award is that the suit has only a chance of success,then how could murray personally accept of the statutory maximum and,if the chance of success really is only,should the suit be dismissed as frivolous and no one receive a penny if,however,the chance of success is materially greater than,as the proposed payment to murray implies,then the failure to afford effectual relief to any other class member makes the deal look like a sellout.thus it may well be that murray is not a good champion,that her law firm edelman,combs,latturner goodwin,llc is not an appropriate counsel,or both.but this is the opposite of the district judge reason recall that the judge wanted murray to jettison the class for personal benefit,so this consideration can not sustain the decision.
the district court second murray should have sought compensatory damages for herself and all class members rather than relying on the make consumer class actions impossible.what each person injury may be is a question that must be resolved one consumer at a time.although compensatory damages may be awarded to redress negligence,while statutory damages require wilful conduct,introducing the easier negligence theory would preclude class treatment.common questions no longer would predominate,and an effort to determine a million consumers individual losses would make the suit unmanageable.yet individual losses,if any,are likely to be modest concern about privacy,a slight chance that information would leak out and lead to identity theft.that actual loss is small and hard to quantify is why statutes such as the fair credit reporting act provide for modest damages without proof of injury.
rule b was designed for situations such as this,in which the potential recovery is too slight to support individual suits,but injury is substantial in the aggregate.see,mace van ru credit,cir.reliance on federal law avoids the complications that can plague classes under state law,see in re,tires products liability litigation,cir,and society may gain from the deterrent effect of financial awards.the practical alternative to class litigation is punitive damages,not a fusillade of claims.see mathias accor economy lodging,cir.
refusing to certify a class because the plaintiff decides not to make the sort of arguments that render class treatment infeasible would throw away the benefits of consolidated treatment.unless a district court finds that personal injuries are large
