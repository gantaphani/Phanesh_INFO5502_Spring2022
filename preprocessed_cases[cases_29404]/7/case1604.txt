factual and procedural history 
debtor jennifer jan bledsoe and defendant ryan curtis bledsoe married in.defendant filed for divorce in oregon state court in.debtor filed an appearance,and the parties did not enter into a settlement.
in,the oregon court struck debtor appearance and entered a default judgment.the court found that debtor had failed to comply with the discovery and production requirements of oregon law that she had ignored the discovery process and that her disobedience was willful and in bad faith that she had failed to comply with one of the court order s and that she had indicated no willingness,despite repeated opportunity and while represented by a variety of counsel,to produce the documentation necessary for a meaningful trial.according to trustee michael batlan,who is seeking to avoid the transfers made pursuant to the dissolution judgment,the judgment granted defendant items valued at,while debtor received items valued at only 
debtor filed for bankruptcy in.thereafter,trustee brought an adversary action against defendant,asserting claims under b and a b.the bankruptcy court granted summary judgment to defendant on all claims,concluding 
because trustee does not allege any facts which may constitute extrinsic fraud under oregon law,his claims under the uniform fraudulent transfer act constitute an impermissible collateral attack against the dissolution judgment entered by the state court and the state law claims which underlie the claims must therefore be dismissed.because there are no allegations of collusion,actual intent to defraud,or that the dissolution judgment was not obtained pursuant to a regularly conducted proceeding under state law,the transfers made pursuant to the dissolution judgment conclusively establish reasonably equivalent value for purposes of bankruptcy code a b.
the district court summarily affirmed,and trustee timely appealed.

discussion 
federal bankruptcy law,like state fraudulent transfer laws,generally allows a creditor to ask the court to void certain transfers if the creditor can establish either actual fraud or constructive fraud.an actual fraud theory alleges that the debtor transferred assets within a specified period before filing for bankruptcy and that the debtor did so with a fraudulent intent.constructive fraud proceeds on the theory that,although the debtor may not have had a fraudulent intent,the court nevertheless should void the transfer,usually because the debtor received inadequate consideration.
in this case,trustee makes only a constructive fraud claim.that is,he does not argue that the dissolution judgment was obtained in order to thwart debtor creditors.he argues instead that the transfers pursuant to the dissolution judgment must be voided because defendant received much more than debtor.
under b,a trustee may avoid any transfer of an interest of the debtor in property that is voidable under applicable law.here,trustee argues that the transfers made under the dissolution judgment are voidable as fraudulent transfers under oregon law,specifically its version of the uniform fraudulent transfer act ufta.see kupetz wolf,cir section b of the bankruptcy code permits the trustee to stand in the shoes of a creditor to assert any state law claims that a creditor may have.trustee also argues that the transfers made under the dissolution judgment are voidable directly under federal law,a b.specifically,he asserts that,under a b,debtor receive d less than a reasonably equivalent value from the dissolution judgment.we will examine each claim in turn.
section claim 
in johnson johnson,or,the oregon supreme court held that a party may attack a judgment collaterally only by alleging and proving extrinsic fraud.see also id.since friese hummel,or,or.per curiam,this court has recognized a distinction between extrinsic and intrinsic fraud in granting relief from a judgment.extrinsic fraud consists of collateral acts not involved in the fact finder consideration of the merits of the case.id.trustee concedes that he does not allege extrinsic fraud,and we are bound,of course,by johnson.see.power,berkeley,cir when interpreting state law,federal courts are bound by decisions of the state highest court.so,if the extrinsic fraud requirement in johnson applies to collateral attacks in the form of fraudulent transfer claims under the ufta,the bankruptcy court did not err in dismissing trustee claim under.
we begin by observing that nothing in johnson suggests that its rule is not one of general applicability that is,nothing suggests that the rule would not apply to all collateral attacks on judgments.additionally,trustee has failed to explain persuasively why ufta fraudulent transfer claims would be subject to a different rule.but we need not rest there,because we have guidance from the oregon court of appeals.
in greeninger cromwell,the court considered a ufta fraudulent transfer to the one brought by trustee held that the extrinsic fraud requirement from johnson applies.in the absence of a pronouncement by the highest court of a state,we must follow the decision of the intermediate appellate courts of the state unless there is convincing evidence that the highest court of the state would decide differently.munson del taco,cir order alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.trustee argues that greeninger was wrongly decided,but there is little certainly not convincing evidence that the oregon supreme court would repudiate greeninger.
according to trustee,the greeninger court failed to appreciate the difference between ufta fraudulent transfer claims and other collateral attacks.trustee argument begins with the unobjectionable observation that,generally speaking,a party may seek avoidance of transfers under either an actual fraud theory or a constructive fraud theory.according to trustee,the greeninger rule eviscerates the second half of that proposition,because it disallows all claims under a constructive fraud theory.
trustee reads the greeninger rule too broadly.a party may not proceed under a constructive fraud theory when challenging a judgment collaterally,but constructive fraud is still a viable theory for challenging all other types of transfers.see.b.most constructive fraud cases do not involve transfers that have received a judicial imprimatur,and even fewer involve transfers effected through marriage dissolution judgments.with respect to the class of cases like this one,involving transfers under a regularly obtained dissolution judgment following a contested proceeding,we think that the oregon supreme court would hold,as did greeninger,that allegations of extrinsic fraud are required 
in conclusion,in johnson the oregon supreme court announced a rule of general applicability that a party must allege extrinsic fraud to bring a successful collateral challenge to a regularly obtained court judgment.in greeninger,the oregon court of appeals applied that general rule to the specific type of claim here a fraudulent transfer claim under the ufta.there is no convincing evidence that the oregon supreme court would repudiate greeninger.we therefore hold that the district court properly granted summary judgment to defendant on the claim.
section claim 
as we have explained,a trustee may avoid certain transfers if the debtor received less than a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for such transfer.a b i.defendant argues,and the bankruptcy court agreed,that a dissolution judgment following a regularly conducted proceeding conclusively establishes reasonably equivalent value.for the following reasons,we also agree.
in bfp resolution trust,d,the supreme court addressed whether the consideration received from a noncollusive,real estate mortgage foreclosure sale conducted in conformance with applicable state law conclusively satisfies the bankruptcy code requirement of exchange for a reasonably equivalent value.the court answered that question in the affirmative,but expressly limited its holding to mortgage foreclosures of real estate.id.at.
the court first rejected,primarily for textual reasons,the conclusion of some appellate courts that the term reasonably equivalent value meant fair market value.id.at.the court next sought to create its own definition of a reasonable price,but rejected that approach,too to specify a federal reasonable price is to extend federal bankruptcy law well beyond the traditional field of fraudulent transfers,into realms of policy where it has not ventured before.id.at.the court then reasoned that i t is beyond question that an essential state interest is at issue here that t o displace traditional state regulation in such a manner,the federal statutory purpose must be clear and manifest and that,because no such clear purpose appears evident in the bankruptcy code,the term reasonably equivalent value means the price in fact received at the foreclosure sale,so long as all the requirements of the state foreclosure law have been complied with.id.at.the court concluded 
this conclusion does not render a superfluous,since the reasonably equivalent value criterion will continue to have independent meaning ordinarily a meaning similar to fair market value outside the foreclosure context.indeed,a will even continue to be an exclusive means of invalidating some foreclosure sales.although collusive foreclosure sales are likely subject to attack under a,which authorizes the trustee to avoid transfers made with actual intent to hinder,delay,or defraud creditors,that provision may not reach foreclosure sales that,while not intentionally fraudulent,nevertheless fail to comply with all governing state laws.any irregularity in the conduct of the sale that would permit judicial invalidation of the sale under applicable state law deprives the sale price of its conclusive force under a a 
id.at.citation omitted.
applying the principles of bfp,the fifth circuit held in erlewine that,as a matter of law,the debtor received reasonably equivalent value from a dissolution judgment.we can not agree with the trustee that the debtor necessarily received less than reasonably equivalent value for her claims solely by virtue of the fact that the debtor received less than half of the community property.erlewine,at.the fifth circuit summarized bfp and concluded that the court there responded to some of the same concerns as are present in this case,and they suggest that we should hesitate before we impute to congress an intent to upset the finality of judgments in an area as central to state law as divorce decrees.id.at.the court limited its holding to cases in which the state divorce proceeding was fully litigated,without any suggestion of collusion,sandbagging,or indeed any irregularity.id.at.
we agree with the fifth circuit.at the outset,we share the policy concern that it voiced the trustee argument,if adopted,would apparently subject every divorce decree to scrutiny in the bankruptcy court,so long as the divorce court divided the community property unequally.id.at.
turning to bfp,we observe what animated the court decision that foreclosure sales touch on traditional state interests.although the court clearly limited its holding to mortgage foreclosure sales,the same basic principle applies here.the state traditional interest in the regulation of marriage and divorce is at least as powerful as its traditional interest in regulating sales of real property.see,attorney of,d recognizing the state strong,traditional interest in setting the terms of and procedures for marriage and divorce.avoiding transfers made pursuant to a dissolution judgment would seriously impinge on that traditional state interest.to displace traditional state regulation in such a manner,the federal statutory purpose must be clear and manifest.bfp,at.citation omitted.we do not discern any congressional intention to allow collateral attacks on,or to inject uncertainty into,properly obtained state dissolution judgments.and,just as reasonably equivalent value was an approximate term for purposes of foreclosure sales,so it is for purposes of transfers made under a dissolution judgment.as the bankruptcy court cogently explained 
oregon law requires an equitable distribution of the parties assets in a marital dissolution.f.like property that is subject to foreclosure,the economic value of the assets is questionable and difficult to ascertain,so long as it is subject to the competing claims of the parties in the divorce.the divorce resolves these matters,and furthers the state interests by dividing property in a manner that gives due consideration to the economic interests of the parties and their dependants,given the circumstances of the case.this process should be deemed to provide reasonably equivalent value to the same extent that a foreclosure does.
in conclusion,we hold that a state court dissolution judgment,following a regularly conducted contested proceeding,conclusively establishes reasonably equivalent value for the purpose of,in the absence of actual fraud.
trustee argues in the alternative that,even under that rule,his claim must proceed because the dissolution judgment at issue here was a default judgment.we disagree.a default judgment has the same solemn character as a judgment entered after trial.watson state,en banc.there being no suggestion of collusion,sandbagging,or indeed any irregularity in the dissolution proceedings,erlewine,at,we hold that the rule applies here.accordingly,we affirm the grant of summary judgment to defendant on the claim.
the special concurrence would hold that a marriage dissolution judgment does not effect a transfer,as that term is defined by the bankruptcy code.concurrence at.but the special concurrence fails to explain how we may reach that argument.defendant did not raise that argument before us,before the district court,or before the bankruptcy court.the argument is therefore waived.see smith marsh,cir o n appeal,arguments not raised by a party in its opening brief are deemed waived.thacker fcc in re magnacom wireless,llc,cir the trustee failed to raise this argument before either the bankruptcy court or the district court.we,therefore,deem it waived,cert.denied,d.in fact,defendant expressly declined to raise the argument before the district court,stating as for p laintiff claim under,d efendant agrees that a transfer occurred with the entry of the dissolution judgment.
the parties position is not surprising.although we are hesitant to address an issue without the benefit of any briefing from the parties,we do note our deep skepticism of the special concurrence position.what constitutes a transfer and when it is complete is a matter of federal law.barnhill johnson,d quoting mckenzie irving trust.the text of the bankruptcy code states the term transfer means among other things d each mode,direct or indirect,absolute or conditional,voluntary or involuntary,of disposing of or parting with i property or ii an interest in property.d.we are concerned that the special concurrence fails to take proper account of the bankruptcy code definition of transfer,which is extremely broad.bernard sheaffer in re bernard,cir see also id.the definition of transfer is as broad as possible.quoting,sess,reprinted in.
notwithstanding the extremely broad federal definition of transfer,we note that the terms property and interest in property are creatures of state law,barnhill,at.we therefore must examine whether oregon law defines the property rights of spouses in a manner consistent with the special concurrence position.it does not.a transfer of marital assets under a judgment of annulment or dissolution of marriage shall be considered a partitioning of jointly owned property.f emphasis added.it is indisputable that the partitioning of jointly owned property effects a transfer of property interests between the two parties.
i concur in the judgment of the court and agree entirely with the majority cogent analysis and rejection of the bankruptcy trustee claim under,which would avoid the effect of the marriage dissolution judgment.although i share the view that the trustee parallel claim under must also fail,the majority analysis of that issue troubles me,particularly with respect to bfp resolution trust,d.i interpret bfp to hold that real estate mortgage foreclosure sales pursuant to state law establish reasonably equivalent value as a statutory matter i believe,however,state dissolution judgments can not fulfill such function.rather,the latter merely establish the ownership,not value,of property as between two divorcing spouses.this perspective compels me to take a somewhat different approach on the issue and therefore i can not concur in part b of the majority opinion.
michael batlan is the trustee of the bankruptcy estate of jennifer jan bledsoe,who filed for chapter protection.before she filed,the now former bledsoe had divorced her husband,ryan bledsoe,in a contested proceeding.the appropriate oregon court adjudicated the divorce over time jennifer stopped participating,and the court divided the marital assets between the two former spouses in a default judgment.according to batlan,ryan received far more under the marriage dissolution judgment than jennifer did.as the trustee of jennifer chapter estate,batlan has the right to avoid,or set aside,certain transfers that she made during and shortly before bankruptcy.see establishing and limiting the trustee avoidance powers see also establishing the liability of a transferee of an avoided transfer.batlan seeks to avoid the effect of the marriage dissolution judgment as a fraudulent conveyance under two provisions of the bankruptcy code and.because i agree with the majority discussion of the claim,i address only the claim.
section allows the trustee to avoid transfers,made on the eve of bankruptcy,because they are said to defraud creditors.the law governing fraudulent conveyances has a long pedigree in the common law,and it has generally recognized two types of fraud.first,a transfer is fraudulent if made with actual intent to hinder,delay,or defraud any entity to which the debtor was or became,on or after the date that such transfer was made or such obligation was incurred,indebted.a a emphasis added.this is the classic fraudulent conveyance,as english law has recognized it since the statute of elizabeth see an act against fraudulent deeds,gifts,and alienations,eliz,nullifying as against third parties conveyances with the purpose and intent to delaye hynder or defraude creditors,cited in donell kowell,cir.to take an example,suppose a man owes to his creditor,but before he files for bankruptcy,he secretly sells his sports car to his brother for in order to defraud his classic,actually fraudulent transfer.
second,transfers can be constructively fraudulent where courts infer fraudulent intent without direct evidence of it.these transfers bear one of the badges of fraud traditionally associated with the classic fraudulent conveyance.see twyne case,eng,b listing examples of badges or marks of fraud see also bfp,at.referring to the badges of fraud heath helmick,cir the badges of fraud with relation to creditors were early marked in the english mercantile community twyne case is a classic which delineates many devious devices.the badge at issue in this case is,as the bankruptcy code phrases it,a transfer in which the debtor received less than a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for such transfer.a b i.the law infers the fraudulent intent,in other words,simply because the debtor transfered his mint condition sports car for rather than,even if there is no direct evidence of fraudulent intent.we must start from the proposition,therefore,that an exchange for less than reasonably equivalent value is constructively fraudulent.
here we have a proceeding by the bankruptcy trustee in a chapter case to recover assets pursuant to that a debtor former spouse received in the dissolution of their marriage.the trustee,batlan,claims that there is a constructively fraudulent conveyance because the debtor spouse received significantly less in the dissolution than the spouse received.in other words,he alleges that the dissolution judgment effected a transfer for less than reasonably equivalent value.under fraudulent conveyance law,if batlan is correct that the values are not reasonably equivalent,then he can avoid the transfer.
the bankruptcy court analogized from bfp to conclude that where a transfer occurs pursuant to a,contested divorce proceeding,it is presumed to be for reasonably equivalent value and therefore precludes an action by the trustee to recover the assets transferred as a constructively fraudulent conveyance.see batlan bledsoe in re bledsoe.this is essentially the position the majority adopts in its carefully crafted opinion.the majority emphasizes the policy implications of the trustee theory of recovery,which would expose final state court marriage dissolution judgments to collateral attack in bankruptcy.see op.at.
although this approach is reasonable and its policy concerns sensible,i prefer to reach the same conclusion by a different route.in particular,i worry that the majority has inadvertently interpreted bfp too broadly in applying it directly to marriage dissolution judgments.it is odd to presume that two values are reasonably equivalent when they are numerically far apart,but that is what the majority opinion does.i agree with the majority that there is an analogy to be drawn between this case and bfp,but not the one the majority draws.
in bfp,the supreme court held that a fair and proper price,or a reasonably equivalent value,for foreclosed property,is the price in fact received at the foreclosure sale,so long as all the requirements of the state foreclosure law have been complied with.at.the majority properly seeks to follow,and build upon,this holding.in doing so,however,it focuses more on the important state interest regulating real property transfers in bfp,regulating divorces here involved than on the logical underpinnings of the supreme court opinion.to be sure,as the majority points out,bfp highlighted the traditional state interest in regulating real estate mortgage foreclosure sales without risk of federal interference.see op.at.but the supreme court took account of the state interest only as a guide in construing the meaning,in the context at issue,of the statutory term reasonably equivalent value.see bfp,at.federal statutes impinging upon important state interests can not be construed without regard to the implications of our dual system of government internal quotation marks and alteration omitted emphasis added.
i prefer to place the holding of bfp in its theoretical context.the supreme court emphasized that a b i always directs an inquiry into the relationship of the value received by the debtor to the worth of the property transferred.id.at.in the context of bfp,t he language of the statute received less than a reasonably equivalent value in exchange requires judicial inquiry into whether the foreclosed property was sold for a price that approximated its worth at the time of sale.id.at.the supreme court concluded that the price obtained at a lawful real estate mortgage foreclosure sale,as opposed to the fair market value or some other measure,must be the criterion of equivalence,id.at,between the property the debtor transfers the foreclosed property and the property he receives the price obtained.
to put it another way,t he central question in bfp was what is a foreclosed property worth id.at.is it fair market value or something else the court acknowledged that a n appraiser reconstruction of fair market value could show what similar pro
