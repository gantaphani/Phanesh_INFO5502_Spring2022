audible,audible appeals the decision of the united states district court for the western district of washington to deny audible motion for attorney fees under including its request for additional discovery to develop the claim.we heard oral argument on september.because we discern no clear error in the district court finding that the case is not exceptional and because we conclude the court did not abuse its discretion in denying additional discovery,we affirm.
digeo,digeo purchased patent patent as is from ipdn corporation,the successor in interest to microtome,at a bankruptcy estate sale on august.the patent is entitled,systems and apparatus for electronic communication and storage of information,video pocket readers with michael saigh,douglas brockhouse,edward chang,and chang listed as the inventors.chang is edward chang brother and goes by the informal name oliver chang.
the facts of this case read like a novel in that they involve the resurrection of an inventor thought to be deceased.shortly prior to the bankruptcy estate sale,digeo obtained the file history for the patent,which contains riveting facts.a power of attorney poa was filed with the united states patent and trademark office uspto on july,allegedly signed by oliver chang as the executor of the estate of his deceased brother,edward chang.also filed on the same day was a separate poa by oliver chang,saigh,and brockhouse.the file history contains no document demonstrating that edward chang was deceased.
both the issue fee transmittal dated july,and the patent,which issued on march,list microtome as the assignee,although the bankruptcy trustee did not file the assignments to microtome with the uspto until july,well after the patent had issued.in particular,there are july assignments to microtome by oliver chang,saigh,and brockhouse,and oliver chang on behalf of edward chang.all assignments were notarized in july predating the issuance of the patent,but were not filed with the uspto until a few weeks before the bankruptcy estate sale.
digeo sued audible for infringement of the patent on march,almost two and a half years after digeo had purchased the patent in its complaint,digeo alleges that it is the owner of all right,title,and interest in the patent,including the right to sue for infringement of that patent.compl.about a year into the litigation,audible deposed the changs on may,and discovered that edward chang was alive and residing in los angeles,ca and that oliver chang did not sign the documents purported to be the poas and assignments.audible also secured a license from edward chang to the patent retroactive to the date of issuance.as a result,audible moved for summary judgment msj and alternatively for dismissal on may,on the grounds that digeo lacked standing because it did not possess complete ownership of the patent and that audible had a license under the patent.in the msj,audible also moved for attorney fees under.
on august,the district court granted partial summary judgment in favor of audible on digeo claim of patent infringement.the district court concluded that because the assignments were forgeries they did not convey legal title to digeo the summary adjudication was partially in favor of audible because there was a material factual dispute as to whether digeo had equitable title to the patent based on edward chang fiduciary or express contractual duty to assign his interest to microtome.the district court also denied audible motion because there was no evidence that digeo knew or should have known about the forged documents.
on october,digeo filed a voluntary motion to dismiss the complaint with prejudice.one day later,the changs filed a motion to intervene.audible filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss in which it renewed its motion and asked for limited discovery to develop its claim 
on december,the district court granted the motion to dismiss the complaint with prejudice and denied the motion to intervene.the district court also denied audible renewed motion for attorney fees and request for extension of discovery.digeo,audible,wl,dist.lexis,dismissal order.the district court entered final judgment on december,this timely appeal followed on the issue of whether the district court denial of the motion and request for additional discovery was proper.
we apply federal circuit caselaw to the analysis,as it is unique to patent law.pharmacia upjohn mylan.the determination of whether a case is exceptional and,thus,eligible for and warranting an award of attorney fees under is a process in which the district court must determine whether there is clear and convincing evidence that a case is exceptional,a factual determination reviewed for clear error,and if so,then determine in its discretion whether an award of attorney fees is justified,a determination that we review for an abuse of discretion.cybor fas,en banc see also the court in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.because the district court denied the motion solely on the basis that it found that the case was not exceptional,we merely analyze whether that was clearly erroneous.a finding is clearly erroneous when although there is evidence to support it,the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.united states united states gypsum.
if there is clear and convincing evidence that a plaintiff has brought a baseless or frivolous suit against an accused infringer,that is a sufficient basis to require a district court to deem the case exceptional under.see forest,abbott,although a lawsuit pursued in bad faith is a sufficient basis for imposing attorney fees under,such bad faith requires not misleading conduct,but vexatious,unjustified,or frivolous litigation.after the district court considered the circumstances of this case and all the evidence,it observed that the lack of an assignment in the file history is immaterial because there is no evidence suggesting one should expect to find an assignment in the file history just before the patent issued,microtome indicated that it was the sole assignee the assignments,bearing dates prior to the issuance of the patent,suggest sloppy paperwork but not a defective title and the patent,recorded assignments,and file history are consistent with a finding that digeo purchased a patent that appeared to have been assigned to microtome.in response to audible argument that the defect in title would have been discovered through ordinary diligence,the court found that no one else including the prior litigants that had settled their suit with digeo discovered the defect prior to audible,that it took audible at least a year of litigation to discover the problem,and that audible offered no evidence as to what steps it took to discover the defect.therefore,the district court concluded that there was no clear and convincing evidence that digeo knew or should have known of the defect in its title to the patent.the district court findings and inferences therefrom are not clearly erroneous.therefore,its ultimate finding that the case is not exceptional can not be clearly erroneous,either.
on appeal,audible argues that the district court committed error by switching the burden of proof to audible to show that digeo had not performed an appropriate investigation,rather than leaving that burden with digeo,in contravention of view engineering,robotic vision systems.we give plenary review to whether the district court applied the proper legal standard under.forest,at.
