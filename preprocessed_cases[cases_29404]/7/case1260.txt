this appeal requires us to examine the meaning and application of the phrases projected disposable income and applicable commitment period in b,as amended by the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of bapcpa.the specific question before us is whether an chapter debtor plan must extend for five years,the length of the applicable commitment period,or whether a bankruptcy court can confirm a shorter plan period when the debtor has a negative disposable income as defined in b and calculated on form.the bankruptcy court held that a shorter plan period is permissible and thus confirmed craig matthew frederickson the debtor proposed plan.in re frederickson.the bankruptcy appellate panel for the eighth circuit affirmed.coop frederickson in re frederickson,cir.bap.having jurisdiction under d,we reverse.
background 
the facts of this case are not in dispute.frederickson current monthly income is above the median income level for his state of residence,and therefore he is an debtor.see b.his disposable income,defined in b and calculated on form is a negative amount.the parties agree that because of this calculation,frederickson has no projected disposable income as referred to in b b.nevertheless,the calculations on frederickson schedule i current income and schedule j current expenditures indicate that he has a monthly net income of.frederickson proposed a plan to pay his unsecured creditors per month for months.under this plan,frederickson unsecured creditors will receive approximately percent of their claims.the trustee objected to this plan because it did not extend for the full applicable commitment period referred to in b a ii.if the plan extended for five years,it is estimated that frederickson unsecured creditors would receive almost all,if not all,of their claims.
a bankruptcy court may confirm a chapter debtor plan if the requirements of a are satisfied.if the trustee or the holder of an allowed unsecured claim objects to the confirmation of the plan,however,the bankruptcy court may approve the plan only if a the plan provides for payment of of claims,or b the plan provides that all of the debtor projected disposable income to be received in the applicable commitment period beginning on the date that the first payment is due under the plan will be applied to make payments to unsecured creditors under the plan.b.
this statutory rubric works when an debtor disposable income calculated under form results in a positive number.but because frederickson has a negative disposable income as calculated on form and the trustee objected to the proposed plan,the bankruptcy court was required to weigh conflicting interpretations of the relevant portions of the statute.one possible interpretation of b b is that if the debtor does not have any disposable income,and therefore does not have any projected disposable income,the debtor proposed plan can be confirmed regardless of the amount proposed to be paid and the length of the plan because the amount of projected disposable income to be received in the applicable commitment period is a second possible interpretation is that the applicable commitment period,as defined in b and used in b b,is a temporal requirement that must be met even if the debtor does not have any projected disposable income.
the parties have stipulated that frederickson does not have any projected disposable income and therefore there is no minimal amount which must be paid to the general unsecured creditors.see in re frederickson,at.this concession assumes that the requirement set forth in b b creates a minimum payment requirement and that no minimum exists if the debtor has no projected disposable income.accordingly,the bankruptcy court determined that a debtor proposed plan could be confirmed over the trustee objections despite the fact that it does not extend for the full applicable commitment period because there is no minimum payment and therefore the applicable commitment period does not apply.at the same time,the bankruptcy court determined that when a debtor has positive disposable income,the applicable commitment period applies and creates a temporal requirement,a minimum plan length requirement.thus,the bankruptcy court held that when a trustee objects to an debtor proposed plan in situations in which the debtor has positive disposable income,the plan can not be confirmed unless it provides for payment of all projected disposable income over a period of five years,b b,or the plan provides for payment in full of all allowed unsecured claims,b b.
judge federman dissented from the bankruptcy appellate panel affirmance,concluding that the applicable commitment period is always a temporal requirement.citing the house report on,he wrote that 
bapcpa was intended by congress to require that higher income debtors either pay of unsecured claims,or make payments for a period of years.while there is scant legislative history for most of the bapcpa provisions,the house report on b makes clear that the applicable commitment period is a durational requirement for the chapter plan,and not just,as the majority holds,a multiplier.

ii.discussion 
because we are reviewing only legal conclusions made by the bankruptcy court,our review is de novo.debold case,cir.
to determine the congressional intent of statutory text,we begin by looking at the text itself.lamie trustee,d.generally,when the statutory text is plain and does not lead to an absurd result,the sole function of the courts is to enforce the plain language of the statute.id.when the text leads to a result that is seemingly at odds with the congressional intent of the text,however,the plain language is not conclusive.united states ron pair,d.
along with these general rules of statutory construction,the supreme court has also acknowledged that in determining the true congressional intent of a statute it can be appropriate to consider all available evidence of that intent rather than limiting the analysis to the text of the statute.koons buick pontiac gmc,nigh,d stevens,concurring citing.pub.intervenor mortier,d,and other supreme court cases.thus,when the statutory text is not altogether clear and there is more than one plausible interpretation of the text,it is proper to consult extratextual sources to determine congressional intent.see also id.at.kennedy,concurring.
we are presented with that very situation in the case before us.the debtor and the trustee have presented possible interpretations of the text that are supported by authority.indeed,the differing outcomes of the bankruptcy courts that have examined this issue to date indicate that the language of b is not at all clear.see in re laroy davis,outlining cases that are divided on how to calculate a debtor projected disposable income id.at outlining cases that are divided on whether the applicable commitment period is a monetary or temporal requirement see also in re green,noting that bapcpa rendered b a murky stew of conflicting judicial opinions about the plain language meaning of common words and phrases contained in the statute itself and the congressional intent behind it in re slusher,although apparently straightforward,as with much of bapcpa,the text congress used plausibly lends itself to at least two different interpretations of what exactly applicable commitment period means.
neither interpretation fits neatly into the structure of b and simultaneously complies with the overarching purpose of bapcpa.frederickson argues that the applicable commitment period is not a temporal requirement if the debtor has no disposable income as calculated on form,even if the debtor has disposable income as calculated on schedules i and j.the resulting outcome of this interpretation is that an debtor who has more actual income than actual expenses,after taking into consideration payment to secured creditors,can have his proposed plan approved without making any payments to unsecured creditors and can close out his plan in a matter of months rather than staying in the system for the full applicable commitment period of sixty months this result does not comport with the clear co
