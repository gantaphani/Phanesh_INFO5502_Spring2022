this appeal involves two jurisdictional issues as well as interpretation of a provision of the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of bapcpa.with regard to the bankruptcy issue,this court must resolve whether an debtor who has no monthly vehicle loan or lease payment can claim a vehicle ownership expense deduction when calculating his disposable income.for the reasons explained below,we reverse the district court.
background 
the debtors,marvin and deborah tousey,filed a voluntary bankruptcy petition under chapter of the bankruptcy code on august.the debtors live in mattoon,wisconsin and are each longstanding employees of the mohican north star casino in bowler,wisconsin.in connection with their bankruptcy filing,the debtors reported household income above the applicable state median income level.
bapcpa subjects debtors to a means test.the purpose of the means test is to distinguish between debtors who can repay a portion of their debt and debtors who can not.under the means test,if a debtor has enough disposable income to pay his unsecured creditors at least each month that is,at least over five years,the debtor usually should proceed under chapter,which allows for a partial repayment of debt.if the debtor has or more of disposable income under the means test,proceedings under chapter allows for a complete discharge of considered presumptively abusive.see b a ii i.
the means test uses a formula to determine a debtor ability to pay a portion of his debts.essentially,the means test takes the debtor current monthly income cmi and reduces it by amounts corresponding to allowed monthly expenses set out in b a ii iv.pertinent to this appeal,under b a ii i,debtors are permitted to deduct 
the debtor applicable monthly expense amounts specified under the internal revenue service national standards and local standards,and the debtor actual monthly expenses for the categories specified as other necessary expenses issued by the internal revenue service for the area in which the debtor resides notwithstanding any other provision of this clause,the monthly expenses of the debtor shall not include any payments for debts.
in performing their means test,the debtors here claimed the internal revenue service irs local standard vehicle transportation allowance of as well as the irs local standard vehicle ownership allowance of for two vehicles.with these expenses subtracted from their cmi,the debtors means test resulted in a finding that they had no disposable income.the debtors thus claimed that the presumption of abuse did not arise in their case and that they should be able to discharge their debts under chapter.
on october,the united states trustee ust filed a motion to dismiss the debtors case for abuse under section b.originally,the ust filed the motion under b b,asserting that the debtors chapter petition was abusive based upon the totality of the circumstances of the debtors financial situation.a few days the deadline set by b for ust motions to dismiss had ust supplemented its october motion to dismiss,asserting that the case also merited a presumption of abuse under section b because the debtors should not have taken the local standard vehicle ownership deduction.on december,the bankruptcy court denied the ust motion to dismiss,concluding that the totality of the circumstances did not establish abuse and that no presumption of abuse arose under section b due to the vehicle ownership deduction.the bankruptcy court interpreted section b a ii i to allow the debtors to take the vehicle ownership deduction even though the debtors had no monthly loans or leases on their vehicles.
the ust appealed and the district court reversed with regard to the section b presumption of abuse,holding that the debtors could not claim the vehicle ownership deduction under section b a ii i for vehicles the debtors owned outright.see neary in re.the district court did not address the ust alternative argument,made under section b b,that the totality of the debtors circumstances demonstrated abuse.the district court therefore concluded that the presumption of abuse arose in the debtors case and remanded to the bankruptcy court for further proceedings to determine whether the debtors could rebut the presumption of abuse.id.at.
the debtors appealed to this court.the ust moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of finality because the bankruptcy court had not yet determined whether the debtors had special circumstances sufficient to rebut the presumption.however,the debtors responded by stating that they had no special circumstances to raise on remand.due to that concession,the ust agreed that this court had jurisdiction in its reply brief.this court denied the ust motion to dismiss the appeal on february.
ii.discussion 
jurisdiction 
before turning to the merits of this appeal,the court addresses two jurisdictional questions.
the first jurisdictional question is whether there is a final order appropriate for appellate review in this case.this court has jurisdiction over appeals from all final decisions,judgments,orders,and decrees entered by a district court pursuant to its review of final decisions of a bankruptcy court.d.in other words,we have jurisdiction only if both the bankruptcy court order and the district court order reviewing that original order are final decisions.zedan habash,cir citing in re salem,cir.there are thus two questions to address regarding finality in this case whether the bankruptcy court made a final decision when it denied the ust motion to dismiss,and whether the district court made a final decision when it reversed that determination.
with regard to the first question,normally a denial of a motion to dismiss is not an appealable final order.see hammond kunard,cir.however,the seventh circuit has observed that finality in the bankruptcy context is considerably more flexible than in an ordinary civil appeal.see zedan,at.finality does not require the termination of the entire bankruptcy proceeding rather,an adjudication by the bankruptcy court is definitive because it can not be affected by the resolution of any other issue in the proceeding,and therefore no purpose would be served by postponing the appeal to the proceeding conclusion.in re oakley,cir district court order that overturned bankruptcy court order sustaining trustee objection was final and appealable because it definitely adjudicated the debtor entitlement to a definite amount of money.we have also held that a n impending ministerial act does not make a decision,for routine action on remand is unlikely to precipitate a later appeal.in re financial service center,citing in re lopez,cir.
here,the bankruptcy court denied the ust motion to dismiss under sections b and b b.this decision resolved all of the contested issues on the merits and left only the distribution of estate assets to be completed.because distribution of assets is a ministerial act,see in re official comm.of unsecured creditors,cir,the denial of the motion to dismiss was appropriate for appeal to the district court.see also in re wade,cir a final order in a bankruptcy case,sic is one that resolves all contested issues on the merits and leaves only the distribution of the estate assets to be completed.
the district court order was also final and appealable.as mentioned above,the district court reversed the bankruptcy court denial of the motion to dismiss and remanded to the bankruptcy court for further proceedings.see,at.normally an order dismissing a case is appealable the issue here is whether the district court remand to the bankruptcy court made the district court order.we have held that even if the decision of the bankruptcy court is final,a decision by the district court which remands the case to the bankruptcy court for further proceedings is not final unless the contemplated further proceedings are of a purely ministerial character lopez,at see also in re fox,cir a district court order remanding the case to the bankruptcy court may qualify as final if all that remains to do on remand is a purely mechanical,computational,or in short ministerial task,whose performance is unlikely either to generate a new appeal or to affect the issue that the disappointed party wants to raise on appeal from the order of remand.here,the district court reversed and remanded to the bankruptcy court,which had yet to determine whether the debtors had special circumstances sufficient to rebut the presumption of abuse under section b.however,the debtors appealed to this court.when the ust moved to dismiss the appeal due to the issue pending on remand,the debtors responded by stating that they had no special circumstances to raise on remand.because debtors have stipulated that no special circumstances exist,it appears that the only task for the bankruptcy court on remand would be to allow the petitioners to convert their petition to a chapter proceeding or dismiss the case.since the decision between these options is within the debtors the bankruptcy court the remand contemplates only ministerial action.we therefore find that the district court order was effectively a final order and therefore appropriate for appellate review.see,in re cortez,cir where the bankruptcy court denied the ust motion to dismiss under section b but the district court reversed the dismissal,the remand left only ministerial tasks to be completed and therefore constituted a final appealable order.
untimeliness 
the second jurisdictional issue is whether the ust untimely raising of the section b grounds for dismissal deprives this court of jurisdiction.section b,as mentioned above,sets a deadline for filing motions to dismiss chapter cases for presumed abuse under section b.see b.in this case,the ust timely filed its initial motion to dismiss on october.the october motion argued that the case should be dismissed because of the totality of the debtor circumstances.the ust did not raise the section b claim for presumed abuse until it supplemented its dismissal motion on november.the november supplement referenced,which allows an amendment as a matter of course before a responsive pleading is filed,and allows such an amendment to relate back to the date of the original filing in certain circumstances.but,as the ust now concedes in briefing,rule did not apply to its motion to dismiss and was thus improperly invoked.see fed.governing contested matters in bankruptcy but not incorporating fed,the rule analog in bankruptcy proceedings.the debtors did not object to the tardy supplement,nor did they raise the untimeliness issue in the district court or in their opening brief before this court.
the question for us is whether the deadline for ust motions to dismiss provided in section b is jurisdictional in nature.there are two possibilities a that the time limit for ust motions to dismiss is jurisdictional,such that untimeliness of the ust section b supplement deprived the bankruptcy court of jurisdiction to entertain those grounds for dismissal or b that the time limit is not jurisdictional and the debtors waived their objection to the ust late filing by failing to object.the ust claims that any objection to its untimely filing has been waived because section b deadline for ust motions to dismiss is not jurisdictional.statutory limits,it claims,are only jurisdictional when congress clearly states that they are jurisdictional.the debtors argue for the first time in their reply brief that i f the motion under b were untimely,it resolves the appeal because t he lack of a timely objection should deprive the court of jurisdiction to entertain the motion to dismiss on that basis.
in bowles russell,d,the supreme court held that the appellate filing deadline set by fed.a a and a was jurisdictional in nature.the court distinguished its holding in bowles from that in kontrick ryan,d,where the court had held that federal rule of bankruptcy procedure set deadlines for objections to a debtor not jurisdictional.in contrasting its holdings in bowles and kontrick,the court emphasized that the nature of the time limit in kontrick was essential to the analysis in that case.see bowles.at.justice thomas noted that those decisions which have undertaken to clarify the distinction between jurisdictional and rules have recognized the jurisdictional significance of the fact that a time limit is set forth in a statute.id.this distinction made sense,the court reasoned,because congress decides whether federal courts can hear cases at all,and thus it can also determine when,and under what conditions,federal courts can hear them.id.at.
bowles suggests that where a filing deadline is set by statute,the time limit in question could be jurisdictional.see bowles.at.however,we do not believe that the supreme court intended bowles to apply to every statutory deadline,especially in light of the fact that such an interpretation would overturn huge swaths of established case law.see jason binford,deadline hard line bowles russell and the special significance of statutory deadlines,am.for example,most statutes of limitations are contained in statutes,but it is generally understood that a party can waive a statute of limitations defense by failing to raise it.the supreme court confirmed this point in john sand gravel united states,d.in that case,the court stated that most limitations periods are affirmative defenses and are subject to waiver,forfeiture,and equitable tolling.id.at citing,inter alia,rotella wood,d federal statutes of limitations are generally subject to equitable principles of tolling.specifically,the court distinguished between the majority of statutes of limitations that seek primarily to protect defendants against stale or unduly delayed claims,which are and subject to waiver,see id.citing,inter alia,united states kubrick,d,and statutes of limitations that seek to achieve a broader goal such as promoting judicial efficiency,which are more absolute and have been referred to as jurisdictional,see id.citing,inter alia,bowles.at.
thus,although bowles implies that all statutory time limits may have jurisdictional significance,the supreme court later discussion of statutes of limitations in john sand gravel appears to soften bowles implications,at least for statutes of limitations and statutory time limits like the one at issue here.in this case,although the section b deadline for ust motions to dismiss has the salutary effect of promoting judicial efficiency,we believe that its primary purpose is to protect possibly debtors from needlessly protracted or delayed bankruptcy proceedings.because section b main purpose is to protect debtors,we believe that its protections,like those of the vast majority of statutory time limits,can be waived by the debtors as well see john sand gravel.at.because we hold that the section b deadline is not jurisdictional,the debtors have waived any objection to the ust tardy supplemental filing raising the section b grounds for dismissal.we thus proceed to the merits of this appeal.
vehicle ownership deduction under bapcpa 
the only issue on the merits in this case is whether,in conducting their means test under section b,the debtors may claim a vehicle ownership expense for a vehicle that is not encumbered by a debt or lease.we review this issue of statutory interpretation de novo.see thornton,cir see also in re kimbro.
as noted above,the chapter means test defines monthly expenses as follows 
the debtor monthly expenses shall be the debtor applicable monthly expense amounts specified under the national standards and local standards,and the debtor actual monthly expenses for the categories specified as other necessary expenses issued by the internal revenue service for the area in which the debtor resides notwithstanding any other provision of this clause,the monthly expenses of the debtor shall not include any payments for debts.
b a ii i.the national and local standards referenced in the statute are found in the irs financial analysis handbook which is,in turn,contained in the irs internal revenue manual irm revenue agents use the irm to assess the financial condition of delinquent taxpayers in order to determine how much they can afford to pay back to the government.the irm specifies three types of expenses national standards,local standards,and other expenses.see irm.the irm local standards set out two categories of expenses transportation and.there are two components of the transportation standard a nationwide allowance for ownership costs and an allowance to cover the cost of operating one or two motor vehicles or the cost of public transportation.see irm.
in this case,the district court concluded that the debtors could not take the vehicle ownership deduction because they had no monthly car payment and so had no applicable monthly expenses.the debtors argue that the district court erred in its interpretation because the statute specifically differentiates between applicable monthly expenses which include the transportation ownership deduction and actual monthly expenses.under the debtors reading,applicable expenses are those that apply to the debtors by virtue of their geographic region and number of cars,regardless of whether the debtor has an actual loan or lease payment.
this issue has been heavily litigated,and there is a close split among courts that have addressed it.see in re ransom,describing the split in authority see also in re ragle.same.we note that of the four bankruptcy appellate panels that have addressed this question,two have concluded that a debtor who owns his car outright may take the deduction,see in re kimbro,in re pearson,and two have concluded the opposite,see in re ransom,in re wilson.the seventh circuit is the first circuit court to consider this issue.
in determining whether a debtor is entitled to take the ownership deduction,courts have generally taken two approaches.these approaches have generally been called the irm approach and the plain language approach as explained below,we believe that the plain language allows the vehicle ownership deduction even where the debtors have no monthly car the better interpretation.
statutory language 
to analyze this issue,we begin with the language of the statute.when the language is plain,the sole function of the courts is to enforce the statute according to its terms.see lamie united states trustee,d.the problem here is that courts are sharply divided on the proper interpretation of the statute.courts following the irm approach reason that the ownership deduction should not be taken if the debtor has no car payment because the word applicable means that the deduction may only be taken if the deduction is relevant,that is,if the debtor has such an expense.see,wilson,at.courts adopting this approach believe that this reading gives applicable its customary meaning of capable of being applied having relevance and thereby sufficiently distinguishes the term applicable monthly expense amounts from the term actual monthly expenses in the statute.see,ransom,at citing collegiate dictionary ed.thus,under the irm approach,if the debtor has no debt or lease payment on his vehicle,he can not take the ownership deduction because it is not applicable to him.
however,courts in the plain language camp argue that applicable refers to the selection of an expense amount corresponding to the appropriate geographic region and number of vehicles owned by the debtor.see,in re grunert,in re mcivor,wl,the word applicable,in the context of b a ii i means the applicable local standards as it pertains to the area in which the debtor resides in re smith,wl,june,if the debtor has only one car,the applicable expense is the one found in the first column of the standard for ownership costs,and if a debtor has a second vehicle,the amount in the second column is also applicable.in other words,under the plain language approach,the local standard vehicle ownership deduction applies to the debtor by virtue of his geographic region and number of cars,regardless of whether that deduction is an actual expenses.
we are persuaded that the plain language view of section b a ii i is more strongly supported by the language and logic of the statute.in order to give effect to all the words of the statute,the term applicable monthly expense amounts can not mean the same thing as actual monthly expenses.under the statute,a debtor actual monthly expenses are only relevant with regard to the irs other necessary expenses they are not relevant to deductions taken under the local standards,including the transportation ownership deduction.since applicable can not be synonymous with actual,applicable can not reference what the debtor actual expense is for a category,as courts favoring the irm approach would interpret the word.we conclude that the better interpretation of applicable is that it references the selection of the debtor geographic region and number of cars.
we also take note of two additional points in connection with the statutory language.first,as the sixth circuit bap pointed out in kimbro,section b a ii i additionally states that n otwithstanding any other provision of this clause,the monthly expenses of the debtor shall not include any payments for debts.it is difficult to square this part of section b a ii i with the irm approach,which would only allow the vehicle ownership deduction on condition of a monthly debt payment.see kimbro,at this provision alone establishes beyond doubt that congress intended to allow an ownership expense even when a debtor has no debt payment on a vehicle.second,when we examine the means test more broadly,we find that congress has been fairly specific in describing the circumstances under which deductions are to be taken.for example,section b a ii uses the following phrases to describe the nature of various other deductions debtor reasonably necessary expenses incurred,b a ii i family violence prevention and services act expenses expenses paid by the debtor that are reasonable and necessary,b a ii ii expenses for elderly,chronically ill or disabled immediate family members reasonable and necessary expenses,b a ii i additional allowances for food and clothing up to and actual expenses that are are reasonable and necessary,b a ii v additional home energy costs.the language of these provisions shows that when congress intended to condition a deduction on a debtor actual expenditure or showing of need,it did so.the absence of this type of language with regard to the local,the statute only refers to the debtor applicable monthly expense amounts specified under the national standards and local standards suggests that courts should not require more of the debtor than to show that the amount specified under the local standard be applicable by virtue of the debtor geography and number of vehicles.
incorporation of irm analysis 
the irm approach is characterized as such because courts following it use the methodology of the irm as an interpretive guide for the means test.decisions favoring the irm view generally reason that we should look not only to the local standards themselves which are simply dollar amounts in conducting a debtor means test,but also to the manner in which the irm uses the local standards in the revenue collection process.see,ransom,at.
irs agents use the local standards as caps on what a delinquent taxpayer may claim as living expenses when calculating what the taxpayer can pay back to the government.see irm stating,regarding the local standards,that t axpayers will be allowed the local standard or the amount actually paid,whichever is less emphasis in original.under irs methodology,if a taxpayer has no car payment,the taxpayer is entitled only to the transportation operation deduction,not the ownership deduction.see id.if a taxpayer has a car,but no car payment sic only the operating cost portion of the transportation standard is used to figure the allowable transportation expense.as the ninth circuit bap explained in ransom because the irs manual prohibits the debtor from asserting the vehicle ownership expense deduction when he or she has no loan or lease payments on a vehicle,courts taking the irm approach reason that b a ii i does not allow such a deduction either.ransom,at.
however,while the irm provides a useful methodology to irs agents for determining a taxpayer ability to pay the irs,we agree with other plain language courts that there is no indication that congress intended that methodology to be used in conducting the means test.as an initi
