this case involves the latest wranglings in an ongoing dispute between joseph golant,a patent attorney,and abraham levy,an inventor and one of golant former clients.from to,golant provided levy with legal services relating to a product known as the car shade,a folding device placed on the dashboard of a parked car to protect the car interior from the sun.levy ceased paying for golant services when golant refused to provide him with more detailed billing records.as a result of levy refusal to pay,golant filed a breach of contract claim against levy in california state court in.levy,alleging that golant had overbilled him by million.
on march,golant filed for chapter bankruptcy protection,before the california trial reached judgment.levy,apparently worried that his against golant might be discharged in bankruptcy,filed a adversarial complaint in golant bankruptcy proceeding on october.count one of the complaint sought to deny golant a general discharge of his debts under section a of the bankruptcy code,a.count two sought to deny golant a specific discharge of levy debt under sections a and a of the bankruptcy code,a.
on levy motion,the bankruptcy court bifurcated the adversary proceedings and tried count one of levy complaint first.in december,golant appeared pursuant to a notice for deposition and document production that had been served on him by levy.at that time,golant refused to tender all of the requested documents.as a result,levy filed a motion to compel production on march.over golant objection,the bankruptcy court granted levy motion and,in an order dated april,required golant to produce within seven days documents relating to his credit and debit cards,including evidence of payment of card balances,and documents relating to golant prepetition legal services from january to december,including time records,billing statements,account ledgers and client names and addresses.
while golant did produce a number of his records,he did not fully comply with the april order.for example,golant failed to produce his bank statements bank books and check registers names and addresses of all of his clients and documents showing the case numbers,captions and courts in which he represented clients.in addition,golant tendered a list of clients,but produced billing records for only of them.
in response to golant failure to comply with the april order,levy filed his first motion for entry of judgment as a discovery sanction.the bankruptcy court denied this motion,but,in an order dated may,required golant to comply with the april order by may.the court also warned golant that it might deny him a discharge of his debts as a discovery sanction if he continued to fail to comply with the april order.levy filed a second motion for entry of judgment on may,but the court continued this motion to may,apparently because levy had filed it before golant time to comply with the april order had expired.ultimately,golant did not comply with the discovery orders,and the court set an evidentiary hearing for may to determine the extent of golant failure to comply.
at the evidentiary hearing,golant admitted to creating or receiving time records billing statements monthly bank statements for the account used in his practice deposit slips from deposits of funds into his law account a ledger for recording fees received check stubs showing deposits of fees received and documents with case numbers,captions and courts in which golant represented clients.however,golant produced none of these documents,maintaining that they had,for the most part,already been produced.golant,however,did admit to not producing billing statements for some clients from whom he received money shortly before bankruptcy,even though he was required to produce these statements.golant also admitted not producing documents evidencing payment of his credit card debts.
on september,the bankruptcy court entered a default judgment in favor of levy on his adversary complaint as a discovery sanction under federal rule of civil procedure made applicable to bankruptcy proceedings by federal rule of bankruptcy procedure.the court discussed golant failure to comply with its discovery orders and noted that golant persistent refusal to abide by the provisions of the bankruptcy code and rules is frustrating to the court,to say the least.levy golant in re golant,b,slip op.at.the court further noted that t here was no way that this court could have tried this case and no way that the court can try it now due to golant own actions and failures to act.id.at.as a result of the sanction,golant was denied a general discharge in bankruptcy.golant appealed to the district court,which affirmed.
before we address the merits of golant argument,we must determine whether we may properly exercise jurisdiction over this appeal.a court of appeals has jurisdiction over a bankruptcy appeal only if the bankruptcy court original order and the district court order reviewing the bankruptcy court original order are both final.in re rimsat,cir and authority cited therein see also d.
we first consider the finality of the bankruptcy court original sanction order.in the context of a bankruptcy proceeding,w here an order terminates a discrete dispute that,but for the bankruptcy,would be a suit by or against the trustee,the order will be considered final and appealable.rimsat,at.ordinarily,a request for a declaration of nondischargeability is conceived as kicking off a separate,adversary proceeding within the framework of the overall bankruptcy proceeding,bankruptcy rule,so that an order declaring the debt either dischargeable or not is a final,appealable order.in the matter of marchiando,cir citing in re riggsby,cir.thus,had the bankruptcy court decided levy complaint on the merits,the court order would easily qualify as the kind of final,appealable order over which we routinely exercise jurisdiction.however,the bankruptcy court did not decide levy complaint on the merits,and we must decide whether this wrinkle alters our jurisdiction.
in the bankruptcy context,most forms of discovery sanction had been considered final and appealable until rimsat noted,without deciding,that this view may no longer be tenable in light of cunningham hamilton county,ohio,d.see rimsat,at discussing in re wade,cir.in cunningham,the supreme court ruled that an order imposing monetary sanctions upon an attorney in a civil case was not an immediately appealable final decision.at.thus,as noted by rimsat,cunningham might certainly be read to preclude the interlocutory review of monetary sanctions in bankruptcy cases as well.
however,cunningham can not be understood to preclude the immediate review of the entry of default judgment,at least in the bankruptcy context.the entry of default judgment is simply much more final effectively terminating a party litigation in the imposition of monetary sanctions,which merely alter the litigation course.indeed,we were unable to uncover any cases discussing how cunningham might alter the view that sanctions which completely eliminate the possibility of a decision on the as a default judgment or final for the purpose of appeal.see,ordower feldman,cir order in civil case dismissing complaint for untimely service is final aurora bancshares weston,cir order in civil case dismissing suit as a sanction for discovery abuse is final.consequently,regardless of how cunningham might apply to the review of monetary sanctions in a bankruptcy proceeding,cunningham does not preclude the review of a sanction imposing a default judgment.therefore,the bankruptcy court order here is a final,appealable order.
as noted,however,it is not enough for the bankruptcy court order to be final the district court decision on appeal must be final as well.a n order is considered final for purposes of d when it finally determines one creditor position in the matter of gould,cir.a creditor position has been finally determined when there is no need to remand a case to the bankruptcy court for further significant proceedings with regard to that creditor.see in the matter of lopez,cir in the matter of riggsby,cir.thus,in cases like ours where the bankruptcy court is aff
