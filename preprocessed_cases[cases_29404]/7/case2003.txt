this case involves a chapter bankruptcy debtor seeking to exclude her interest in a trust from the bankruptcy estate.the trust,which was created by the debtor prior to insolvency,was established to provide income to the debtor for her lifetime with the remainder ultimately being given to several charities.based on the presence of a spendthrift clause prohibiting assignment or alienation,the debtor contends her interest in the trust is exempt from her bankruptcy estate.alternatively,the debtor contends her interest is exempt because the trust qualifies as a support trust.having created the trust for her own benefit,however,the debtor can not shield her interest in the trust from her creditors.this interest,consisting of a yearly income stream from the trust assets,is not exempt from the debtor bankruptcy estate.the corpus of the trust,however,is not likewise subject to the claims of the debtor creditors.
background 
establishment of the trust 
appellee jane mclean brown appellee,the debtor in the bankruptcy case giving rise to this appeal,suffers from chronic alcoholism.in,her mother died,leaving her an inheritance of approximately.in order to protect the inheritance from her own improvidence,appellee decided to place the money into an irrevocable trust which would pay her a monthly income for life.on august,appellee executed the trust agreement,entitled irrevocable charitable remainder unitrust agreement icrua.
under the icrua,appellee is entitled to receive an annual amount equal to of the net worth of the trust,valued as of the first day of each taxable year.the payments are due in monthly installments.appellee,who is unemployed,lives off of the monthly payments flowing from the icrua.appellee is the only beneficiary currently entitled to receive income payments under the trust.
as a trust beneficiary,appellee only rights are to receive the income payments.although appellee also serves as trustee,her powers are generally limited to directing investment decisions.she does not have the discretion to invade the trust corpus or to alter the amount of payments made to the trust beneficiaries.furthermore,appellee is prohibited from assigning or otherwise alienating her interest in the trust by virtue of a spendthrift clause contained into the icrua 
to the extent permitted by law,no beneficiary shall have any power to dispose of or to charge by way of anticipation any interest given to her,and all sums payable to any beneficiary shall be free and clear of her debts,contracts,dispositions and anticipations,and shall not be taken or reached by any legal or equitable process in satisfaction thereof.
see article iv of the icrua.
upon appellee death,the yearly trust income payments will be made to her daughter for life at the daughter death,the corpus of the trust will pass to four charities listed in the icrua.although the icrua expressly reserves appellee right to designate substitute or additional charitable beneficiaries by testamentary instruction,the right of redesignation is limited to substituting or adding other charities meeting certain internal revenue code qualifications 
chapter bankruptcy 
on february,appellee filed a voluntary petition for chapter bankruptcy.appellant deborah menotte appellant was appointed as the chapter trustee.in her bankruptcy petition,appellee listed secured and unsecured claims totaling.although appellee acknowledged her interest in the icrua,no value for the interest was included as part of her asset calculation rather,appellee claimed her interest in the trust was exempt from the bankruptcy estate.appellant objected,arguing trusts are not insulated from the claims of creditors.
on july,the bankruptcy court overruled appellant objection to the claimed exemption.based on the presence of the spendthrift clause,the bankruptcy court concluded appellee interest in the trust could not be attached by her creditors.as an additional ground for exemption,the bankruptcy court indicated the trust also qualified as a support trust,which is a type of trust established to provide for a beneficiary needs.the bankruptcy court rejected appellee alternative argument that her interest in the trust constituted an exempt annuity.
on november,appellant filed an appeal to the united states district court for the southern district of florida.on appeal,appellant argued the bankruptcy court erred in finding the icrua was exempt from the bankruptcy estate as either a spendthrift trust or a support trust.the district court affirmed in part,finding the icrua was exempt from the bankruptcy estate based on its spendthrift provision.although it did not need to reach the bankruptcy court other ground for exemption,the district court indicated the trust likely would not qualify as a support trust because the icrua provided for payment of a fixed sum to appellee each year regardless of the amount needed for her support.having not been raised on appeal,the issue of whether the trust qualified as an exempt annuity was not addressed by the district court this appeal followed.

iii.discussion 
an estate in bankruptcy consists of all interests in property possessed by the debtor at the time of her bankruptcy filing.a.where there is a restriction on transfer of the debtor interests under applicable law,however,such restriction remains effective even in bankruptcy.c.as a result,spendthrift and support trusts are excluded from a debtor bankruptcy estate to the extent they are protected from creditors under applicable state law the state law applicable in this case is the law of the state of florida.we will examine in turn whether the icrua qualifies as either a spendthrift trust or a support trust under florida law.
a.the icrua as a spendthrift trust 
in florida,trusts containing valid spendthrift provisions are protected from the reach of creditors,so long as the beneficiaries can not exercise dominion over the trust assets.see generally waterbury munn,so d,en banc recognizing the validity of spendthrift trusts croom ocala plumbing,so,holding creditors could reach trust property,despite presence of spendthrift clause,where the beneficiaries possessed absolute control over the property.where a trust is by a beneficiary,however,there is an issue as to whether the trust spendthrift provision is valid as against creditors of the.we conclude it is not,and the beneficiary interest is subject to alienation by her creditors.
validity of the icrua spendthrift provision as against appellee creditors 
spendthrift trusts are defined under florida law as those trusts that are created with a view of providing a fund for the maintenance of another,and at the same time securing it against his own improvidence or incapacity for.croom,so.at emphasis added see also waterbury,so d at a spendthrift trust is one that is created with the view of providing a fund for the maintenance of another,and at the same time securing it against his own improvidence or incapacity for self protection.
as impliedly recognized by the definition of spendthrift trusts set forth in croom,florida law will not protect assets contained within a spendthrift trust to the extent the settlor creates the trust for her own benefit,rather than for the benefit of another see in re witlin,cir.unit b holding,under florida law on spendthrift trusts,debtor interest in his keogh plan was not exempt from his bankruptcy estate where the debtor was both the beneficiary and the settlor of the plan in re wheat,holding,under florida law on spendthrift trusts,debtor deferred compensation plan was not exempt from his bankruptcy estate where it was in re williams,holding,under florida law on spendthrift trusts,debtor interests in his employer thrift plan was not exempt from his bankruptcy estate where it was john grimsley,florida law of trusts b ed.a settlor can not create for himself a spendthrift trust to avoid creditors.jur d trusts the trustee and the sole beneficiary can not be one in the same under spendthrift trust law.a settlor can not create a spendthrift trust for his or her own benefit.
this limitation comports with the common law of trusts see,restatement second of trusts where a person creates for his own benefit a trust with a provision restraining the voluntary or involuntary transfer of his interest,his transferee or creditors can reach his interest.george gleason bogert george taylor bogert,trusts trustees ed.if a settlor creates a trust for his own benefit and inserts a spendthrift clause,it is void as far as then existing or future creditors are concerned,and they can reach his interest under the trust.erwin griswold,spendthrift trusts a spendthrift trust created by a person for his own benefit is invalid against creditors.ii austin wakeman scott,the law of trusts ed.it is to be noticed that the beneficial interest reserved to the settlor is for some purposes treated differently from a beneficial interest created in a third person.thus,although a beneficial interest created in a third person may be inalienable by him and not subject to the claims of his creditors,a beneficial interest reserved to the settlor himself can be alienated by him or reached by his creditors even though it is otherwise provided by the terms of the trust.trusts may be reached by creditors,even if the settlor was solvent at the time of the trust creation and no fraud was intended.see scott,supra,at it is immaterial that in creating the trust the settlor did not intend to defraud his creditors.it is immaterial that he was solvent at the time of the creation of the trust.it is against public policy to permit a man to tie up his own property in such a way that he can still enjoy it but can prevent his creditors from reaching it.
in this case,appellee is a beneficiary of a spendthrift trust.in,appellee inherited from her mother.to protect the inheritance from her own squandering,appellee established a charitable trust under which she retained the right to receive a income for life.appellee purportedly was not insolvent at the time the trust was established nor is there evidence appellee intended to defraud her creditors.nevertheless,appellee is both the settlor and a beneficiary of the trust.consequently,the spendthrift clause contained in the trust is ineffective as against appellee creditors 
interest reachable by appellee creditors 
when a settlor creates a trust for her own benefit and inserts a spendthrift clause,the entire spendthrift clause is void as to her creditors.see bogert the entire spendthrift clause,both as to voluntary and involuntary alienation,is void.the creditors can reach the interest.in the absence of a valid spendthrift provision,a beneficiary interest in a trust is a property right which is liable for the beneficiary debts to the same extent as her legal interests.see generally grimsley where the beneficiary equitable interest is vested in him without restraint on alienation,the interest is transferable by him and subject to claims of his creditors.bogert if the trust is active the creditor of the beneficiary can subject the latter interest in the trust to the satisfaction of the debt,either in law or equity,unless a statute or a valid spendthrift provision prevents this result.
as with any other property right,a trust beneficiary right to receive income for life is an interest which may be alienated or subject to attachment by her creditors.see generally blair comm r of internal revenue.holding that in absence of a valid restraint on alienation,the interest of a trust beneficiary to income for life was present property which could be assigned to others bradshaw am.advent christian home orphanage,so,holding that in absence of a restraint on alienation,income stream granted to orphanage as trust beneficiary was subject to the claims of the orphanages creditors.
where the only interest a settlor has retained for herself under a trust is the right to income for life,it is solely this interest which her creditors can reach see ii scott where the only interest which the settlor has created for himself under the trust is a right to the income for life or for some other period,it is this interest alone which his creditors can reach,unless the creation of the trust was a disposition in fraud of his creditors.see also in re goff,cir indicating creditors of were limited to attaching whatever interest the settlors retained under the trust and,therefore,could not obtain a lien on real property conveyed into the trust because settlors interest was equitable rather than legal bogert if the settlor creates a trust for the settlor for life,with a restraint on voluntary or involuntary alienation of his interest,and with a remainder interest in others at his death,his creditors can reach his life interest but not the remainder,unless he has also reserved a general power of appointment.griswold indicating creditors could reach a settlor life interest,but not the remainder if vested in another as illustrated in the restatement second of trusts 
a transfers property to b in trust to pay the income to a for life and to pay the principal on a death to by the terms of the trust it is provided that a interest under the trust can not be transferred or reached by his creditors.a can transfer his interest his creditors can reach his interest.

this result makes sense.although the spendthrift provision of a trust is void as against a creditors,the trust itself remains valid.see,in re goff,at holding spendthrift provision was void as against creditors based on,but trust itself was valid liberty nat.bank hicks,holding was bound by terms of trust,even though its spendthrift provision was ineffective as against his creditors see also d trusts w here there is a provision in the terms of the trust imposing restraint on the transfer by a beneficiary of his interest and the provision is illegal,the provision fails,but the whole trust does not fail,since provisions like this can ordinarily be separated from other provisions without defeating the purpose of the settlor in creating the trust.thus,although a creditors are not bound by a trust spendthrift clause,the assets subject to attachment are circumscribed by the trust agreement.
by establishing an irrevocable trust in favor of another,a settlor,in effect,gives her assets to the third party as a gift.once conveyed,the assets no longer belong to the settlor and are no more subject to the claims of her creditors than if the settlor had directly transferred title to the third party.where the settlor retains a right to income payments,however,there is a limited interest created in favor of the settlor.it is this limited interest,and not the entire trust assets,which may be attached by the settlor creditors 
life interest in settlor with remainder over to a named or designated person.the settlor may reserve to himself only the income from the property transferred during his life and may by the transfer give a vested remainder after his death to some named person or persons.this situation arises in the following typical case a conveys property to t on trust to pay the income to a during a life,with restraints against anticipation,assignment,and the rights of creditors,and with a further provision that on the death of a the property shall be conveyed to b.such a conveyance creates in b a present vested remainder,and if the transfer is not a fraudulent conveyance,the interest of b can not,of course,be reached for a debts.the remainder may be to a class,as to the children of the settlor.it may likewise be contingent until the death of the settlor.in any of these cases,if the settlor has reserved no power over the remainder,and the transfer is not fraudulent,the conveyance of the remainder constitutes a present gift and is just as much beyond the reach of creditors as any other completed gift.
in this case,appellee transferred assets of into a charitable trust.the transfer was irrevocable,and the charities listed in the trust became vested in the corpus of the trust,subject only to divestment through redesignation of other charitable remaindermen.appellee retained no rights to the trust principle.in establishing the icrua,how
