youssef abdelbary appeals a district court order requiring him to pay restitution as part of his sentence for bankruptcy fraud.finding no error,we affirm.
abdelbary was convicted of wire fraud,money laundering,currency structuring,bankruptcy fraud,and perjury.this is the second appeal in this case,and many of the facts relevant to this appeal are set out in our first decision.see united states abdelbary,fed.app x,wl cir.
youssef abdelbary owned and operated a gas station and convenience store in dublin,virginia.abdelbary leased the property and bought the gas he sold from jordan oil.while running this business,abdelbary used a branch of the carter bank and trust in christiansburg,virginia,where he made more than one hundred transactions,each involving more than.at the time of the first deposit of this size,ralph stewart,a local manager for carter bank and trust,explained to abdelbary about the currency transaction reports ctrs that had to be filed on a transaction involving more than.
abdelbary relationship with jordan oil grew contentious in late and early.when abdelbary failed to make a payment due to jordan oil in early february for gas it had delivered,jordan oil ceased its deliveries to abdelbary.jordan oil sued soon thereafter to collect the money that abdelbary owed,which totaled about.the following day,abdelbary began withdrawing currency in amounts less than.over the next eight days,abdelbary withdrew from his account in eleven transactions.the litigation against jordan oil continued through the spring of.eventually,at the end of may,this litigation concluded when jordan oil obtained a final judgment against abdelbary for and abdelbary counterclaim was dismissed.
the next month,abdelbary engaged in a series of credit card transactions in which he charged his personal credit cards at his store in multiple equal amounts in a span of a few minutes.the value of these purchases was credited to the account at carter bank and trust that abdelbary used for his business,and he then withdrew this money,totaling,from that account in amounts less than.
abdelbary met with a bankruptcy attorney in july.abdelbary initially told this bankruptcy attorney that he wanted to get back at jordan oil,but abdelbary eventually concluded that he would file for bankruptcy.when abdelbary submitted his bankruptcy filing,he denied having made any gifts within one year or having transferred any property within two years of the filing.additionally,abdelbary stated at the bankruptcy creditors meeting that he had not transferred any assets to a family member.despite these statements,abdelbary had sent to his brother in egypt during those previous two years.
based on these events,abdelbary was charged in a indictment with wire fraud,money laundering,u.a b i and ii,currency structuring,a and and d,bankruptcy fraud,and perjury.a jury convicted abdelbary on all counts.
after the jury returned its verdict,the district court granted abdelbary rule motion for judgment of acquittal on the wire fraud and money laundering counts.the district court read the indictment as requiring the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that abdelbary incurred the credit card charges in june with the intention of filing for bankruptcy and thus not repaying those companies.the district court held that the government had not met this burden and therefore dismissed those counts of the indictment.
at sentencing,the district court sentenced abdelbary to months in prison.the court entered a criminal forfeiture judgment against abdelbary for and also ordered abdelbary to pay restitution to jordan oil of for attorney fees incurred during the bankruptcy proceeding.the district court cited both the voluntary,and mandatory,restitution provisions during the hearing without ever specifying the provision on which it was relying.
id.at footnote omitted.
on appeal,we affirmed abdelbary conviction for currency structuring,reversed the judgment of acquittal on the wire fraud and money laundering convictions,and remanded for reinstatement of the jury verdict and entry of the judgment against abdelbary.see id.at.additionally,we vacated the restitution award and remanded for further proceedings,holding that the district court had not specified whether the award was pursuant to the victim and witness protection act vwpa,see,or the mandatory victim restitution act mvra,see,and the court had overlooked making the factual findings required by the appropriate act.see abdelbary,fed.app x at.
on remand,the district court sentenced abdelbary to months imprisonment.the parties disagreed,as they did during abdelbary first sentencing,regarding whether abdelbary should be required,as part of his sentence for the bankruptcy fraud offenses,to make restitution to jordan oil for the attorneys fees it incurred in the bankruptcy proceeding.the parties agreed that the mvra governs the question.see c a ii providing that mvra applies to an offense against property under this title,including any offense committed by fraud or deceit.the district court found as a factual matter that the attorneys fees at issue were incurred as a result of the bankruptcy fraud,and abdelbary did not dispute that point.however,abdelbary argued,as he had during his initial sentencing,that jordan oil could not recover its attorneys fees incurred in the bankruptcy proceeding as part of restitution.abdelbary maintained that attorneys fees could never be included as compensable costs as part of restitution under the mvra.he alternatively argued that attorneys fees were not includable based on the facts of this case as jordan oil was not a victim of abdelbary offense since abdelbary failed in his attempt to discharge his debts in bankruptcy.abdelbary maintained that jordan oil incurrence of attorneys fees was at most a consequential loss,not a direct one,and thus the fees were not compensable as part of restitution 
the government disagreed and urged the district court to again require abdelbary to pay jordan oil restitution in the amount of the attorneys fees it incurred as a result of abdelbary bankruptcy fraud offenses.the government denied that there was any sort of blanket prohibition against attorneys fees as a class of expense and argued that they were includable as part of restitution so long as they resulted directly from the crime.the government asserted that jordan oil fees resulted directly and proximately from the bankruptcy fraud because jordan oil incurred the fees defending its rights in the same proceeding abdelbary bankruptcy in which the fraud occurred.in other words,the position of the government was that in order to avoid paying jordan oil and its other creditors,abdelbary tried to hide his money,assert insolvency,and file for bankruptcy.jordan oil was then forced to obtain legal representation to keep its claim against abdelbary alive.as the bankruptcy proceedings progressed,abdelbary persisted in his lies about his assets and what he had done with his money.the lies he told became the bases for his convictions for bankruptcy fraud and required the continuation of the bankruptcy proceedings that caused jordan oil litigation expenses to reach.the government distinguished the facts of the present case from those in which a victim suffers a loss and then sometime later incurs attorneys fees attempting to recover from the defendant.
the district court rejected abdelbary arguments,agreed with the government,and again ordered abdelbary under the mvra to pay to jordan oil in restitution,representing the amount of the legal fees jordan oil incurred during bankruptcy proceedings.the district court found that the attorneys fee expenditures were directly and proximately caused by abdelbary bankruptcy fraud insofar as jordan oil incurred the fees defending its rights in the very same proceeding in which the bankruptcy fraud occurred.the district judge specifically stated that i not thinking of this as.i thinking of it as a direct harm from the filing of this.as the government has indicated,jordan oil was essentially dragged into bankruptcy court.
abdelbary now argues on appeal that the district court erred in requiring him to pay jordan oil attorneys fees incurred in the bankruptcy proceeding as part of restitution.we disagree.
in the sentencing context,we review findings of fact for clear error and questions of statutory construction de novo.see united states moore,cir.we review the application of the court factual findings in this context for abuse of discretion.see id.
some background concerning the enactment of the vwpa and the mvra is helpful to an understanding of the issue abdelbary raises.although restitution has long been authorized at common law,there was no statutory authorization for requiring restitution as part of a criminal sentence outside of the probation context prior to the enactment of the vwpa,see,at united states amato,cir.congress enacted the vwpa in,see,stat.currently codified at under the vwpa,as originally enacted,restitution could be made only to a victim of the offense of conviction and only for specified types of losses that were caused by the specific conduct that is the basis of the offense of conviction.hughey united states,even concerning victims who have suffered the specified type of losses,the decision whether to order restitution under the vwpa is discretionary.see a.
as originally enacted,the vwpa identified particular types of losses that could be included in restitution for certain types crimes involving damage to or loss or destruction of property,see b,and other types of losses that could be included for crimes involving bodily injury,see b.in,congress added to the types of losses that could be included under the vwpa by adding subsection b.see violence against women act of,title iv,stat.that subsection provides that,for any type of crime,restitution orders may be used to reimburse the victim for lost income and necessary child care,transportation,and other expenses related to participation in the investigation or prosecution of the offense or attendance at proceedings related to the offense.b.
in,congress enacted the mvra as part of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of,see,stat.the mvra made payment of restitution as part of a criminal sentence mandatory for certain categories of offenses that directly and proximately caused a victim to suffer either a physical or a pecuniary loss.see mvra,stat.at united states squirrel,cir.while the vwpa substantive requirements are codified at,the mvra are primarily set out at section structure mirrors that of,and much of is identical or nearly identical to language in.additionally,the mvra amended definition of victim to match the definition in,which is,as is relevant here,a person directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of an offense for which restitution may be ordered.a see a.
section b,like its vwpa counterpart,b,specifically identifies the types of losses includable in a restitution award under the mvra.this appeal primarily concerns b,which provides 
b the order of restitution shall require that such defendant 
in the case of an offense resulting in damage to or loss or destruction of property of a victim of the offense 
a return the property to the owner of the property or someone designated by the owner or 
b if return of the property under subparagraph a is impossible,impracticable,or inadequate,pay an amount equal to 
i the greater of 
i the value of the property on the date of the damage,loss,or destruction or 
ii the value of the property on the date of sentencing,less 
ii the value as of the date the property is returned of any part of the property that is returned 
here,the district court found that jordan oil was a victim of abdelbary offense because his offenses directly and proximately caused jordan oil to expend for attorneys fees,see a,such than an award in the amount of those fees was proper under subsection b.on this basis,the court ordered abdelbary to make restitution to jordan oil in that amount.
abdelbary does not challenge the district court determination that jordan oil incurred the attorneys fees as a result of his bankruptcy fraud.abdelbary maintains,though,that the restitution order was erroneous because attorneys fee expenditures are never compensable under the mvra as is demonstrated by our decision in united states mullins,cir we conclude,however,based on the district court findings,that the fees were includable under subsection b 
in mullins,the defendant was convicted of aiding and abetting the commission of wire fraud,which involved obtaining worth of kitchen equipment.see id.at.the district court ordered the defendant to pay in restitution as part of his sentence under the vwpa.see id.as is relevant here,the defendant argued that the amount improperly included consequential damages in the form of attorneys fees and other amounts expended by the equipment owner in repossessing the equipment.see id.at.in analyzing the scope of the losses includable in the restitution order,we observed that b which is essentially identical to its mvra described the amount of restitution the district court was authorized to award.see id.construing this language,we concluded that i n cases involving the damage,loss,or destruction of property,restitution must be limited to that which the statute authorizes return of the property,or payment of the property value,either on the date of damage or loss or on the date of sentencing,less the value of any part of the property that is returned.id.at.regarding mullins argument,we h e ld that an award of restitution under the vwpa can not include consequential damages such as attorney and investigators fees expended to recover the property that was the target of the crime.id.
abdelbary contends that mullins is consistent with the american rule,under which each party is responsible for his own attorney fees and the related rule that courts are not authorized to deviate from the american rule unless an express contractual or statutory provision specifically provides for an attorneys fee award.see fox vice,crescent city estates,llc draper in re crescent city estates,llc,cir.he claims that in light of mullins and the american rule,b mvra counterpart,b,should not be construed to authorize the restitution ordered here.we disagree.
initially,we note that the american rule has no application here.that rule provides that i n the united states,the prevailing litigant is ordinarily not entitled to collect a reasonable attorneys fee from the loser.alyeska pipeline serv.wilderness society.but we are not reviewing a question of entitlement to fee shifting as between parties to a case that would be a matter for the bankruptcy court.rather,what is before us is the separate question of what losses can be includable as part of criminal restitution.see united states scott,cir the line between criminal restitution and common law damages is important to maintain.in this context,there is no reason to presume that congress intended to preclude the inclusion of amounts expended on attorneys fees as part of restitution in the exceptional scenario in which the fees were the direct and proximate result of the defendant crime.
rather,this case is governed by the rule explained in united states elson,cir 
generally,attorney fees incurred in civil litigation against the defendant for the same acts at issue in the criminal proceedings are consequential damages that are not recoverable.however,where a victim attorney fees are incurred in a civil suit,and the defendant overt acts forming the basis for the offense of conviction involved illegal acts during the civil trial,such as perjury,such fees are directly related to the offense of conviction and therefore are recoverable as restitution under the mvra.
