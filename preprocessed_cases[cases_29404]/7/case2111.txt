under civil code section,subdivision e,the trustors under a deed of trust have the right to cure a default and reinstate the loan at any time until five business days prior to the date of sale set forth in the initial or subsequent notice of sale or orally declared on the date of any postponement.under section,subdivision d,a foreclosure sale may not be held until seven calendar days after expiration of an injunction or bankruptcy stay that required the postponement of a sale.the issue here is whether the postponement of a foreclosure sale numerous times for five or fewer business days during the time a sale was enjoined or stayed thereby precluding revival of an expired reinstatement period violates legislative intent.as an apparent matter of first impression,we conclude it does not.we also hold that under the circumstances here,the serial postponements did not violate the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.accordingly,we affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural history 
in richard hicks and mafalda hicks borrowed from bank of america bank and executed a promissory note and deed of trust encumbering their lajolla property bank recorded a notice of default in june after the hickses became delinquent in their payments.
in september the hickses filed a chapter bankruptcy proceeding on behalf of a family trust to which they had transferred the property.the proceeding was dismissed several months later because the trust was an ineligible debtor.
in february bank sold its interest in the security instruments to norman salter,salter,for.salter immediately sold its interest in the security instruments to legg associates legg for.under an arrangement negotiated by philip ram,who was associated with salter,legg agreed to pay salter an additional if legg ultimately acquired the property through foreclosure.ram also expected to be legg consultant or agent during foreclosure proceedings.
in,executive trustee services,executive,recorded a notice of trustee sale on march.the hickses transferred the property to themselves individually and on march filed another chapter bankruptcy proceeding.on june the bankruptcy court granted legg motion for relief from automatic stay.the court explained that there had been a lengthy history of nonpayment by the hickses,and their recent agreement to consider possibly listing the property is too little,too late.the court,however,ordered that a foreclosure sale could not be held until july to give the hickses a small window of time to reinstate the loan if they can.legg instructed executive to postpone the sale to july.
on july the hickses made a written request for reinstatement information from legg.legg asked ram to calculate the amount to cure the default,and he provided the information to legg counsel,paul brent,on friday,july.on july,shortly after,brent sent the hickses counsel,george mcgill,a letter by facsimile stating the amount to cure the default was then.brent advised that b y providing this information,legg is not waiving any rights,nor does it concede that the hickses have the right to reinstate the loan.
on july the hickses filed a complaint against legg and executive for declaratory and injunctive relief.the hickses alleged that b y virture of legg failure and refusal to earlier provide the reinstatement amount,they are in dire jeopardy of being irreparably injured,in that their statutory reinstatement period is now contended by legg to have expired.the hickses also objected to the inclusion of appraisal,consulting and attorney fees in the reinstatement amount.
on the same date,the hickses obtained a temporary restraining order tro prohibiting a foreclosure sale,even though they filed no declaration showing they gave legg hours notice of the ex parte hearing as required by local rule.according to brent,he was notified by mcgill on july of an ex parte hearing on july.legg nonetheless did not move to have the tro dissolved.
ram instructed executive to postpone the foreclosure sale from july to august.on july the hickses offered to pay legg to reinstate the loan under section et the hickses,however,did not deposit that amount in an account in legg name legg rejected the offer,stating a review of section of the civil code reveals that your correspondence is not a formal tender.legg also complained that the hickses wrongfully obtained the tro.
on august ram instructed executive to begin postponing the foreclosure sale for periods of five or fewer business days until a sale could legally be conducted.executive complied and postponed the sale for short periods times between august and december.
on october and november,and,the hickses offered to pay legg the following amounts,respectively,to reinstate the loan,and.legg expressly rejected the october offer on the ground the reinstatement period had expired.legg did not respond to the other offers.
on november the court denied the hickses request for a preliminary injunction and dissolved the tro.the court found the tro was issued without proper notice to legg and would therefore have been subject to dissolution during the time of its effectiveness.
on november the bankruptcy court appellate panel issued a temporary stay of the foreclosure sale,effective through november.a sale was held on december,at which legg acquired the property for million.
in a fourth amended complaint,the hickses added a cause of action against legg and executive to set aside the foreclosure sale,and a cause of action against legg for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing the hickses again alleged legg did not provide them with reinstatement information in a timely manner,improperly included appraisal,consulting and attorney fees in the reinstatement amount,and wrongfully rejected their offers to cure the default.the hickses also alleged the defendants thwarted their statutory reinstatement rights by repeatedly postponing the foreclosure sale for periods of five or fewer business days,when a sale could not be held until seven days after the tro was extinguished.the hickses sought to have the sale set aside,or damages for wrongful foreclosure.
at trial,the hickses argued the serial postponements were prohibited as a matter of law by the foreclosure statutes.the court,however,declined to decide the issue as one of law.rather,it instructed the jury to determine whether the defendants conduct was a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing the jury found in defendants favor on all counts and judgment was entered for them on august.

istatutory scheme 
the legislature has provided a comprehensive framework for the regulation of a nonjudicial foreclosure sale pursuant to a power of sale contained in a deed of trust.et the purposes of this comprehensive scheme are threefold to provide the with a quick,inexpensive and efficient remedy against a defaulting to protect the from a wrongful loss of the property and to ensure that a properly conducted sale is final between the parties and conclusive as to a bona fide purchaser.citations.moeller lien th,d.

legislative intent 
the hickses contend the defendants repeated postponement of the foreclosure sale for periods of five or fewer business days violated legislative intent.they assert that sections,subdivision e,and,subdivision d,must be harmonized to guarantee revival of an expired reinstatement period when an injunction,bankruptcy proceeding or other legal impediment precludes a sale for an indeterminate time 
issues of statutory interpretation are subject to our independent review.board of retirement lewis d.the objective of statutory interpretation,of course,is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent.if the words are clear,a court may not alter them to accomplish a purpose that does not appear on the face of the statute or from its legislative history.citation.at the same time,however,a statute is not to be read in isolation it must be construed with related statutes and considered in the context of the statutory framework as a whole.citation.a court must determine whether the literal meaning of a statute comports with its purpose or whether such a construction of one provision is consistent with other related provisions.gomes county of mendocino th,d.
in march assemblyman gerald eaves introduced assembly bill ab.to amend section,subdivision d.the purpose of the amendment was not to extend the trustor reinstatement rights,but to provide sufficient time for a trustor to find out when a foreclosure sale is going to occur following the expiration of a court order which required the sale postponement and provide the trustor with the opportunity to attend the sale and to ensure that his or her interests are protected.assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as ameded may.the bill was sponsored by the western center on law and poverty in response to an incident in which a foreclosure sale was held one day after a tro was dissolved.the property was sold substantially below fair market value.the trustor,who had obtained a purchaser for the property,did not learn of the new sale date and was unable to protect his interests at the sale.
assembly bill originally required the trustee to publish a new notice of sale when a sale was indefinitely postponed by court order or by operation of law,thus giving the trustor at least days notice of the new sale date.ab reg.sess.as introduced.the measure was opposed by lenders and title companies because the requirement of a new published notice of sale would increase the debtor costs of foreclosure proceedings.david milton,cal.league of savings,letter to assemblyman eaves,may,kenneth cooley,cal.land title,letter to assemblyman eaves.therefore,the requirement of a new published notice was deleted and a minimum day interval was required between the expiration of an injunction or stay precluding a sale and the date of sale.assem.amend.to ab reg.sess.may.
trustees objected to a rule that would invariably delay a foreclosure sale after expiration of an injunction or stay.in their view,ab would actually allow sophisticated trustors to an additional procedural device to extend the entire process t he proposed day period arises at the conclusion of a lengthy process a month period of delinquency on the loan,plus months from recording of the notice of default,plus month from the notice of sale which averages a minimum of to months.during these to months the trustor is entitled to numerous ways to cure the default,whereas the lender is not receiving payment on the loan.however,the experience of trustees evidences a pattern of abuse by defaulting trustors whereby frivolous legal devices are used to unfairly extend the nonjudicial foreclosure process 
for example,a trustor will file bankruptcy and be granted a stay of the nonjudicial foreclosure sale notwithstanding the fact that secured property is always granted a relief from the stay order,seek a tro to set aside the sale for alleged impropriety,or a combination of both and i t is not uncommon for to years to elapse from the initial delinquency to the actual sale.during this time the borrower owns the property,payment free,whereas the lender is deprived of its entitled payments.ab no.would exacerbate these examples by allowing a sophisticated trustor an additional days to strategize to delay the sale.ralph simoni,letter to assemblyman eaves,original underscoring.
western center on law and poverty proposed a compromise that would give the court discretion to waive the day waiting period based on the trustor fraud.lenders,however,preferred that the court be given broader authority to waive the waiting period.michael arnold,mortgage brokers,letter to assemblyman eaves,july,stanley zimmerman,home budget loans,letter to william powers,july.a lender also urged shortening the day interval to days in order to encourage standardized trustee sales dates.ibid.in the final version of assembly bill,section,subdivision d was amended to substantially its current form,requiring a minimum day interval between the expiration of an injunction or stay precluding a sale and the date of sale,absent a court order allowing an earlier sale.assem.amend.to ab reg.sess.september.
the addition of section,subdivision e was proposed only in the fifth and final version of ab,and the legislative history contains scant information on the measure.in his statement to the senate committee on judiciary,assemblyman eaves explained my bill will extend the period during which reinstatement of a defaulted mortgage loan may occur.under existing law,the debtor is granted a three month period within which to effect a reinstatement of his loan.my bill will extend that reinstatement period to five business days prior to the date of sale.in effect,this amendment grants debtors a minimum additional two weeks during which they may cure their loan and reinstate their deed of trust or mortgage.assemblyman eaves,author statement to comm.on judiciary reg.session.
contrary to the hickses position,the waiting period of section,subdivision d appears wholly unrelated to the reinstatement provisions of section,subdivision e.moreover,in section,subdivision e,the legislature expressly provided for revival of the trustors reinstatement rights when a sale is postponed and a subsequent notice of sale must be recorded.the trustee has the discretion to postpone a foreclosure sale,but a new recorded notice of sale is required if there are more than three postponements,subd.c.had the legislature desired to revive the reinstatement period when a sale is orally postponed because of an injunction or bankruptcy stay,it could easily have done so.it is a well recognized principle of statutory construction that when the legislature has carefully employed a term in one place and has excluded it in another,it should not be implied where excluded.citations.citation.suman bmw of north america,th,d.
further,we must presume the legislature was aware of judicial interpretations of the foreclosure statutes when it enacted ab.people cruz cal th,d.in united states cold storage great western savings loan d,which was decided several months before the final version of ab was considered,the court held the lender postponements of a sale to dates a bankruptcy stay was in effect were valid.the court found no authority declaring that postponements are invalid if made during an automatic stay period.id.at.see also california livestock production credit sutfin d.discussion regarding serial pos
