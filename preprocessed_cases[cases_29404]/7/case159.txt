mary ragosa appeals from an order of the bankruptcy court granting summary judgment to robert and joan canzano.the canzanos,acting as trustees,purchased a parcel of real estate at west bay road in osterville,massachusetts,from the trustee in bankruptcy for michael and mary colarusso,who held legal title to the property.ragosa brought suit in the land court for the commonwealth of massachusetts,seeking to establish her claim of ownership of a portion of the west bay road property by adverse possession.the canzanos commenced this adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy court to enforce the bankruptcy court order approving the sale of the property and to enjoin ragosa from proceeding with her land court action.the bankruptcy court granted the canzanos motion for summary judgment and denied ragosa motion for summary judgment.ragosa appealed to the bankruptcy appellate panel,which affirmed.ragosa contends that the bankruptcy court should have abstained from hearing this case,that the court should never have included the disputed parcel in the bankruptcy estate,and that the disputed parcel could not be sold free and clear of her interest.we affirm.
the entire property at west bay road in osterville,massachusetts,including the parcel now being disputed,was deeded to michael and mary colarusso in.on november,the colarussos filed a petition for relief under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code when the colarussos filed their petition,they held record title to the entire tract.
during the bankruptcy proceedings,the chapter trustee listed the property at west bay road for public sale.the trustee received offers of from four sources,including one from mary ragosa and one from joan and robert canzano.both the canzanos and ragosa were neighbors of the debtors,each owning real estate that abutted west bay road.ragosa bid as trustee of the re trust and the canzanos bid as trustees for j b realty trust.to submit a bid,the bankruptcy trustee requested that each offeror sign the same purchase and sale agreement.the rider to the agreement stated that the sale would be free and clear of all liens,encumbrances,and interests pursuant to bankruptcy code section f.
the bankruptcy trustee filed a motion seeking approval for a private sale,proposing that the bankruptcy court hold a sealed bid auction at which the four offerors would be allowed to bid.the highest offer for the property would win the auction.the sale motion specifically described the land to be sold,stating 
the legal description for the property is contained in the standard form purchase and sale agreement that is attached hereto as exhibit a and is also set forth on the original deed into the debtors and attached hereto as exhibit b.
emphasis in original.both the purchase and sale agreement and the original deed used a metes and bounds description of the property that included the disputed parcel.
the trustee sale motion sought to sell the property free and clear of all liens,claims and encumbrances under b f.the sale motion specifically stated,the prospective buyers listed above have no connection with the debtor or the creditors or parties in interest in this bankruptcy proceeding except that the husband of mary rigosa sic is listed as a disputed creditor of the debtors on schedule f in the amount of.it said that the property was presently occupied by the debtors and that each of the prospective buyers is aware of the debtors occupancy and the end thereof.
the trustee contemporaneously issued a notice of intended private sale that named ragosa as one of the potential buyers.like the motion,it stated that the property at west bay road was to be sold free and clear of all liens,claims and encumbrances.the sale notice imposed a june,deadline for filing objections and higher offers.the sale notice set june,as the date for the hearing,during which any objections would be heard and,if possible,the property would be sold.no objections were filed by the deadline.
after the objection deadline had passed,the four potential purchasers submitted sealed bids.the bankruptcy court held the hearing as scheduled.ragosa was represented by counsel and personally attended the hearing.however,the canzanos bid for the property was the highest.the bankruptcy court issued an order approving the sale of the property to the canzanos on the terms proposed by the trustee,namely by the description contained in the sale motion and free and clear of any and all liens,claims and encumbrances on the property.the court found that the canzanos had acted in good faith,at arm length,and without collusion,and are therefore purchasers in good faith within the meaning of section m.the court directed the trustee to transfer the property to the canzanos.because ragosa was the bidder,the sale order specified that if the canzanos failed to close,the trustee was authorized to complete the sale to ragosa.
the canzanos did close,and on july,the trustee delivered the deed to the entire property at west bay road to the canzanos.ragosa did not appeal from the sale order or file a motion to stay the sale pending appeal.instead,on october,ragosa filed suit in the land court department of the massachusetts trial court,seeking a declaratory judgment establishing her title by adverse possession to a square foot parcel of west bay road.ragosa alleged that the disputed parcel was physically separated from the rest of west bay road by a row of stones and a hedge,and that from until august she and her predecessor in interest had used the area exclusively to park cars and store boats and rubbish containers.ragosa obtained,ex parte,a lis pendens,clouding the canzanos title to the property.two weeks later,the canzanos filed suit in bankruptcy court,seeking specific enforcement of the sale order and a preliminary injunction restraining ragosa from advancing her claim in the land court.the canzanos argued,inter alia,that because ragosa participated in the bankruptcy sale as a bidder,had notice of the property being sold,and did not object,she was now estopped from asserting an ownership interest in the land.
the bankruptcy court held a hearing on november,attended by lawyers for the canzanos,the debtors,ragosa,and the chapter trustee.at the hearing,the debtors attorney,mcauliffe,stated that he had actual knowledge and could testify that before the sale of the property to the canzanos,the ragosas had been fighting with the debtors over the parcel,that colarusso had posted no trespassing signs,and that counsel for the debtors and the ragosas had discussed whether the ragosas would waive their claim against the debtors if the debtors would give them greater rights in the property 
after hearing arguments from both parties,the court preliminarily enjoined ragosa from prosecuting the land court action.the court addressed ragosa participation in the bidding process 
your client was here and did not object.your client did not stand up before the trustee sold the property and say,wait a minute.anything you sell,you trying to sell by this metes and bounds description,my client owns a piece of the property within that metes and bounds description by adverse possession.
you can not do now what you should have done then,when others have relied upon your silence,your clients silence,to their detriment,as they have done in this case 
the canzanos purchased the piece of property from this estate by a metes and bounds description,by an order of mine which said they were good faith purchasers buying free of all liens and encumbrances and the trustee purported to sell,if your client did think the trustee had any right to see it,your client should have spoken up.indeed,your client bid on the property,and why should they spend money for that which they already own 
so certainly they your client wished to press the adverse possession argument,i think they should have objected to the sale i wo let you do it now.i believe you are estopped by your prior lack of objection to the sale process to continue now.
ragosa then filed a motion to dismiss the bankruptcy court action for failure to state a claim or to abstain because the court lacked jurisdiction.she also filed a motion to amend the preliminary injunction to prevent the canzanos from doing construction work on the disputed parcel.after the bankruptcy court denied those motions,the parties filed opposing motions for summary judgment pursuant to bankruptcy rule.the bankruptcy court granted the canzanos summary judgment motion and denied ragosa.canzano ragosa in re colarusso.
ragosa appealed to the bankruptcy appellate panel,which affirmed the judgment of the bankruptcy court.canzano ragosa in re colarusso,cir.ragosa then appealed to this court,arguing that the bankruptcy court should have abstained from hearing the case,that the court erred in including the property in the bankruptcy estate and then selling the disputed parcel free and clear,and that the court erred in ruling she was estopped from asserting her adverse possession claim.
ragosa first argues that the bankruptcy court should have abstained from hearing this case under c,which governs permissive abstention in bankruptcy cases.under section c,a bankruptcy court that has subject matter jurisdiction may nevertheless abstain from hearing a case in the interest of justice,or in the interest of comity with state courts or respect for state law.beyond these three factors enumerated in the statute itself,courts have also looked to factors such as the extent to which state law issues predominate over bankruptcy issues,the presence of a related proceeding commenced in state court,and the likelihood that the commencement of the proceeding in bankruptcy court involves forum shopping by one of the litigants.new england power marine,town of tyngsborough in re middlesex power equip.marine,cir.we review the bankruptcy court permissive abstention decision for abuse of discretion.new england power,at.
the bankruptcy court declined to abstain because ragosa sole argument for abstention was that the court lacked jurisdiction,and the bankruptcy court held that it did have jurisdiction.the bankruptcy court held that the canzanos suit required the court to determine the validity and scope of its previous order to sell west bay road,including the disputed parcel therefore,the court had jurisdiction over the matter as one arising in or under a title case.see new england power,at.the bankruptcy court also found that the canzanos suit did not threaten judicial economy and comity since the land court action had not yet been heard.the court also noted that the validity of the sale order was an issue of federal law.
ragosa argues that abstention is appropriate because state law issues predominate and because she has a pending state lawsuit to resolve her state law claim.she also contends that resolution of her land court proceeding will have a beneficial impact on the efficient administration of the estate.ragosa fails to explain how the bankruptcy court abstention and the land court adjudication of the adverse possession claim would have a beneficial impact on the administration of the estate,and it is not immediately apparent to us.
we are similarly unpersuaded by her other arguments.the scope of the bankruptcy court sale order under the code is an issue of federal law that weighs against abstention.new england power,at.the state law issues,such as whether ragosa has acquired an interest in the disputed parcel by adverse possession,can not be said to predominate,as ragosa claims.moreover,the state law issues are governed by massachusetts law,which also weighs against abstention.see in re chicago,milwaukee,paul pac,cir noting significance of existence of unsettled issues of state law as a factor favoring abstention if state law is settled,the bankruptcy court is qualified to decide the issue.
finally,there is little damage to judicial economy from interference with a state suit that had been pending for a mere two weeks when the federal suit was filed.see id.at.to the contrary,judicial economy will be served by the bankruptcy court adjudication of this case,as it is already familiar with the property at issue,the parties,and their conduct in the prior proceeding.considering that federal courts generally should exercise their jurisdiction if properly conferred and that abstention is the exception rather than the rule,id.at,we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to abstain.
we turn to the merits of the bankruptcy court grant of summary judgment to the canzanos.
a bankruptcy court order granting or denying summary judgment is reviewed de novo.in re varrasso,cir.in bankruptcy proceedings,federal rule of bankruptcy procedure incorporates the standards of federal rule of civil procedure.thus,a motion for summary judgment should be granted only when there are no genuine issues of material fact and when the moving party is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.c celotex catrett,d.
ragosa first argues that the disputed parcel was never part of the bankruptcy estate because she had already obtained good title in the parcel by adverse possession.ragosa cites the principle that adverse possession of real estate for the period prescribed in the statute of limitations not only bars a suit to recover it,but gives good title against the former owner.daley daley,citing currier studley.because she already had title,she asserts,the debtors had no interest in the land.we review this legal issue de novo.city of springfield ostrander in re lan tamers,cir.
section of the bankruptcy code provides that upon the commencement of a bankruptcy case,an estate is created out of all legal or equitable interests of the debtor,wherever located and by whomever held.a.what property interest the debtors had at the commencement of the case is defined by massachusetts law.butner united states,d.at the time of filing,the debtors held record title to property and the right to contest ragosa undeclared adverse possession claim the debtors had an interest in property,albeit an encumbered interest.
to establish title by adverse possession in massachusetts,a claimant must offer proof of nonpermissive use which is actual,open,notorious,exclusive and adverse for twenty years.ryan stavros,typically,a claim of adverse possession may be established in two ways.first,an adverse possessor may bring an action to claim title to the land.see,lyon parkinson,ruling that petitioners were entitled to register land acquired by adverse possession.second,the claimant may assert adverse possession as a defense to a claim such as a writ of entry.richard powell et,powell on real property.massachusetts law provides 
an action for the recovery of land shall be commenced,or an entry made thereon,only within twenty years after the right of action or of entry first accrued,or within twenty years after the demandant or the person making the entry,or those under whom they claim,have been seized or possessed of the premises 
laws ch.as the bankruptcy appellate panel explained,although the time period is often described as the time necessary to achieve title by adverse possession,it actually is a limitations period,after which the true owner may not recover possession of the land from the adverse possessor.lawrence town of concord,describing statutory period as the time the true owner has to bring claim to recover land.
because ragosa had not yet asserted her claim of adverse possession against the debtors at the time they filed their bankruptcy petition,the extent of the debtors interest in the property at that time is indeterminate.however,the debtors clearly held record title to the property.see collier on bankruptcy alan resnick henry sommer eds.ed.the debtor interest in property also includes title to property,which is considered an interest in property just as a possessory interest or a leasehold interest would be.moreover,that title could be conveyed despite the occupancy of a potential adverse possessor 
a conveyance of land shall,if otherwise valid,notwithstanding disseisin or adverse possession,be as effectual to transfer the title of the grantor as if he were actually seized and possessed of such land,and shall vest in the grantee the rights of entry and of action for recovery of the estate incident to such title.
