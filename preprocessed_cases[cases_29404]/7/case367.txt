on june,ati filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code in the united states bankruptcy court hardin.on october,warex filed a secured claim for,alleging that this amount was the remaining debt on the notes.warex and ati negotiated and entered into a settlement agreement whereby ati would transfer two gas stations ati properties,which at the time were leased to hqp,to warex in satisfaction of warex claim under the notes.ati submitted an application to settle this claim to the bankruptcy court on december,which stated that t he settlement agreement settles all claims between the debtor ati and warex relating to or in connection with the properties and the notes,respectively.application in support of settlement at,record at.on january,the bankruptcy court issued an order approving the settlement settlement order,in part,because it would result in release,by operation of law,of warex secured claims in excess of against the debtor including a release of any deficiency claim against the debtor and its estate.the settlement order,however,would become null and void unless hqp surrendered its leases and subleases to warex for,and in consideration of,the release from liability to warex in proportion to its interest therein.
annexed to the settlement order is a contract of sale between ati and,warex nominee to take the ati properties.section of the rider to the contract provides 
this agreement and the obligations of the parties hereunder are also expressly conditioned hereby upon i surrender of its lease with ati and sublease with of the premises to purchaser for,and in consideration of,the release from liability to warex in proportion to its interest therein

the ati properties,however,were not transferred until september,and only after the bankruptcy court twice extended ati time to perform.
in july,hqp also filed a petition for chapter protection in the bankruptcy court.warex filed a proof of claim alleging hqp liability under the notes,which it valued at less,plus various.the theory underlying its claim was that its prior settlement with ati did not fully satisfy the debt owing on the notes.hqp,as of the notes,was responsible for paying additional amounts due under the notes,including the interest that had accrued during the two years between ati bankruptcy filing and hqp bankruptcy filing.
during the reorganization process,hqp sought to dispose of several properties improved by gas stations.ati leased these properties to hqp,which sublet some of them to hqp properties for a term of ten years.objected to hqp plan to sell the leases on properties that it subleased from free and clear of its sublease,but withdrew its objection when hq p agreed to sell the leases subject to the subleases.the auction,conducted by the bankruptcy court,took place on march.warex,the only bidder,purchased the hqp properties at request and with funds.on june,the bankruptcy court approved the sale and assignment of ati and hqp interests in the hqp properties to warex

on november,the bankruptcy court,after receiving extensive briefing and hearing oral argument,dismissed both warex claim regarding the notes and claim regarding the auction of ati and hqp leasehold interest in the hqp properties.the bankruptcy court rejected warex claim by finding that since the settlement agreement released any and all obligations owed under the notes,there was no claim remaining against either ati or halstead quinn in respect of those three notes because that liability was released and discharged by the conveyance.it further found that ati settlement with warex regarding the notes was intended and written in such a manner as to release both ati and halstead quinn of liability.thus,once the settlement agreement was made,according to the bankruptcy court,there was no longer any debt owed to warex by hqp or ati,and hqp was therefore not obligated to pay any additional amounts or accrued interest as a matter of law.the bankruptcy court found that,pursuant to fundamental principles of law,hqp was released once ati was released.
claim for,the amount it allegedly gave warex to pay for the leases,was based on its theory that hqp materially breached the sublease by rejecting the unexpired subleases,which thereby entitled to pursue hqp for the promised.the bankruptcy court,characterizing this argument as next to frivolous,rejected this claim because right to the under the sublease remained valid and enforceable against warex,the purchaser and assignee of the lease.
both and warex appealed to the district court hellerstein,which affirmed the bankruptcy court rulings.the district court rejected warex claim because i t a proposition of law that failure to reserve any rights against the joint obligor when the rights are released against the other joint obligor constitutes an extension sic of the debt against both,and because the notes represented only one debt,which the transfer of the ati properties released.tr.of hearing may,record at.it also adopted the bankruptcy court reasoning for rejecting claim that hqp improperly rejected the sublease when it sold the hqp properties to warex.

warex claim promissory notes 
although ati transferred the two ati properties to warex in satisfaction of warex claim on the notes,warex argues that it was nonetheless entitled to recover additional sums,including accrued interest,from hqp.hqp responds by arguing that the parties intended the settlement agreement,specifically the purchase price of the ati properties referenced in schedule c,to represent warex full claim under the notes.we agree with warex and hold that there was insufficient evidence in the r
