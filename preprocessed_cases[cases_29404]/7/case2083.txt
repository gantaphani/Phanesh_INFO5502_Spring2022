in july,the casa eva i homeowners association casa eva filed a complaint for breach of implied warranty of merchantability,breach of implied warranty of fitness for intended purpose,strict liability and negligence against project developer overland development and its individual partners for the defective construction of the casa eva property casa eva later amended its complaint to name general contractor spilat construction corporation and numerous subcontractors.in april,spilat filed a for express indemnity,equitable indemnity and equitable contribution.
in may,in an unrelated contract action,paykar construction,obtained a judgment against spilat general contractor in the casa eva construction defect litigation at issue here in the amount of plus attorneys fees,costs and interest.in october,paykar filed a notice of judgment lien on personal property against spilat in the amount of in this action.the notice contained the notations reference code of civil procedure sections,and.
in january,paykar filed a motion to intervene in the casa eva litigation which the trial court denied because it found,although paykar had a judgment lien,paykar had failed to show an interest in the action.nevertheless,all parties to the action were ordered to include paykar on its service lists for all documents filed with the court.
after casa eva and the defendants prepared and exchanged repair estimates,mediation sessions were held in january and february,but some of the defendants either did not attend mediation or were unwilling to contribute an amount that would yield a global settlement.casa eva,spilat,the developer and a number of subcontractors reached a settlement which included the following terms spilat insurers scottsdale insurance company and west american insurance company would pay casa eva on spilat behalf and the remaining settling defendants including the developer paying and several subcontractors would pay for a total of to casa eva casa eva would assign its causes of action against all the parties to spilat insurers all settling parties released and dismissed their actions against each other except for casa eva claims and spilat claims against the subcontractors and the settlement would be conditioned on the court determination that the settlement was in good faith under section as well as the court approval of the settlement pursuant to section,subdivision b determining that no consideration paid or received by spilat insurers was subject to paykar lien against spilat 
in may,spilat joined by overland,the developer filed a motion for determination of good faith settlement and request that paykar judgment lien be deemed not applicable to this settlement.three subcontractors and paykar filed opposition.after argument on the first hearing date june,the hearing was continued for days to july for the parties to clarify for the court who going to be left and for what money.at the time of the continued hearing,the insurers,as assignees of casa eva claims,stipulated that their recovery against aaa gonzalez,for stucco defects would be limited to and that their recovery against the subcontractors connected to master bathroom defects lasco bathware tomkins industries,familian pipe supply and ani construction tile would be limited to.the trial court granted the motion for good faith settlement on these terms and approved the settlement pursuant to section 
in september,spilat insurers now prosecuting the action in casa eva name,spilat and aaa gonzalez entered into a settlement which provided aaa gonzalez would pay the insurers casa eva,spilat and aaa gonzalez released and dismissed their actions against each other,except for casa eva actions and spilat actions against the parties and the settlement was conditioned on the court determinations that the settlement was in good faith under section and approved pursuant to section,subdivision b such that no consideration paid or received by the insurers was subject to the judgment lien against spilat.aaa gonzalez filed a motion for determination of good faith settlement only which was approved in november.
in april,spilat filed a chapter bankruptcy petition resulting in an automatic stay of the action.at a voluntary settlement conference in june,the insurers and the remaining subcontractors reached a settlement which provided the remaining defendants would pay the insurers the entire action would be dismissed with mutual releases of claims and the settlement was conditioned on a lifting of the bankruptcy stay and determinations that the settlement was in good faith and no consideration paid or received by the insurers was subject to paykar judgment lien.
the insurers obtained a stipulation from spilat trustee in bankruptcy for relief from the bankruptcy stay.the stipulation contained the following recitals debtor insurers have been providing insurance coverage for the action,and are currently paying the costs of defense associated with the action.debtor insurers have been pursuing the remaining subcontractor defendants in subrogation as well as in the name of plaintiffs via assignment of the causes of action for recover of the monies paid,including defense costs and attorney fees,to plaintiffs.
debtor will not be paying any insurance deductible with respect to the casa eva action and debtor has not nor will it ever receive any of the settlement proceeds related to the insurers subrogation action.debtor does not possess any monetary or interest in the casa eva action.the insurers are pursuing their subrogation rights in the name of debtor in accordance with the terms of the debtor insurance policies.
the insurers then moved the bankruptcy court for relief from the bankruptcy stay,serving all parties and paykar.as grounds for relief,the insurers stated the claim is insured.movant seeks recovery only from applicable insurance,if any,and waives any deficiency or other claim against the debtor s or estate property.no opposition was filed,and,in november,the bankruptcy court granted the motion,provided no recovery against debtor or debtor estate without further order of this court.
in february,casa eva and spilat filed another motion for good faith settlement and dismissal of all which the trial court granted.later that month,casa eva filed notice of intent to distribute settlement funds with service on paykar,and on march,all settlement proceeds were distributed to the insurers as casa eva assignees no funds were ever distributed to either spilat or spilat counsel.
two months later on may,paykar filed its motion pursuant to section for order to apply debtor money,property and other rights toward satisfaction of lien,for order restraining property and for entry of judgment against transferors of property subject to lien.casa eva and spilat filed opposition with joinders by some of the subcontractors involved in the third settlement.
in june,the trial court issued a tentative ruling that became the order of the court denied.paykar is not a party to this action and has no standing to make this motion in this case.in addition,the money transferred was not subject to any lien.the money transferred was the money owned by the opposing parties.spilat had no control and never assumed control over the money.the money was not paid to spilat or its attorney.thus,paykar is not entitled to any relief under section because it has no standing in this action,because the money transferred was not subject to paykar lien,and because no money was transferred to spilat.paykar appeals.
discussion 
standard of review.
generally speaking,a trial court approval of a settlement subject to certain conditions related to a judgment lien is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard.section,subdivision a,provides that any party may seek a court order authorizing a compromise,settlement,dismissal or satisfaction of the pending action in lieu of the written consent thereto of the judgment creditor.in other words,the trial court may order an action subject to a judgment creditor lien compromised on such terms as it thinks are necessary.citations.however,its power to impose terms is limited by the fact that it is an abuse of discretion for a trial court to make an order that deprives any party of the legal rights to which it is entitled in terms of the priority of its lien,in the absence of appropriate equitable considerations.pangborn plumbing carruthers skiffington pangborn th,d,footnote omitted.
however,section,subdivision c provides if the court determines that a party other than the judgment debtor having notice of the lien created under this article has transferred property that was subject to the lien or has paid an amount to the judgment debtor that was subject to the lien,the court shall render judgment against the party in an amount equal to the lesser of the following the value of the judgment debtor interest in the property or the amount paid the judgment debtor.the amount of the judgment creditor lien created under this article.pangborn,supra,th at,d.in that case,the question on appeal is whether or not,as a matter of law,the trial court complied with the applicable statutory law.ibid.
these judgment lien statutes are subject to strict construction because they are purely the creation of the legislature.citations.thus,where a statute requires a court to exercise its jurisdiction in a particular manner,follow a particular procedure,or be subject to certain limitations,an act beyond those limits is in excess of its jurisdiction and void.pangborn,supra,th at,d epstein abrams epstein th,d.
ii.paykar was not entitled to relief under section.
first,paykar notice of lien was a form notice of judgment lien on personal property against spilat it specifically r eference d code of civil procedure sections,and.it did not,however,comply with the mandatory requirements of section.more particularly,paykar notice contained none of the requisite warnings that paykar was invoking the provisions of section et and specifying the necessary procedures to be followed in settling with spilat as judgment debtor as well as the consequences of failing to do so none of these warnings were required under sections,and,and the reference in paykar notice to these sections did nothing to inform the parties to the casa eva litigation of the procedures to be followed or the risks in failing to do so.as a result,it appears paykar notice was not effective to create a lien under this statute,as one of the subcontractors contended in the trial court and maintains in this appeal.pangborn,supra,th at,d these judgment lien statutes are subject to strict construction because they are purely the creation of the legislature and see ahart,cal.practice guide enforcing judgments and debts,supra,the notice must also include several warning statements to the judgment debtor otherwise,the notice is not effective to create a lien,and form aaa approved judicial council form meeting these requirements.
even if paykar notice sufficed,the first two subdivisions of section provide as follows 
a if the judgment debtor is entitled to money or property under the judgment in the action or special proceeding and a lien created under this article exists,upon application of any party to the action or special proceeding,the court may order that the judgment debtor rights to money or property under the judgment be applied to the satisfaction of the lien created under this article as ordered by the court.application for an order under this section shall be on noticed motion.the notice of motion shall be served on all other parties.service shall be made personally or by mail.
b if the judgment determines that the judgment debtor has an interest in property,the court may order the party having custody or control of the property not to transfer the property until it can be levied upon or otherwise applied to the satisfaction of the lien created under this article.
again,t hese judgment lien statutes are subject to strict construction.pangborn,supra,th at,d.w here a statute requires a court to exercise its jurisdiction in a particular manner,follow a particular procedure,or be subject to certain limitations,an act beyond those limits is in excess of its jurisdiction and void.pangborn,supra,th at,d epstein abrams,supra,th at,d.although paykar relied on subdivisions a and b in addition to subdivision c of section in its briefing,it acknowledged at oral argument that there was no judgment in this case.the case was settled.without a judgment entitling spilat to money or property or determining that spilat had an interest in property,the trial court lacked jurisdiction to act under subdivisions a and b of section.accordingly,at oral argument,paykar conceded that it was operating under subdivision c alone.
turning to subdivision c of this statute,what is specifically allowed,in fact,what is specifically mandated,is that if the court determines that a party other than the judgment debtor having notice of the lien created under this article has transferred property that was subject to the lien or has paid an amount to the judgment debtor that was subject to the lien,the court shall render judgment against the party in an amount equal to the lesser of the following the value of the judgment debtor interest in the property or the amount paid the judgment debtor.the amount of the judgment creditor lien created under this article.pangborn,supra,th at,d,first italics in original,further italics added.the party seeking the section order bears the burden of persuading the court that the order should be granted.brown superior court th,d ahart,cal.practice guide enforcing judgments and debts,supra.
under subdivision a of section,paykar judgment lien extended to a ny cause of action of judgment debtor spilat for money or property that was the subject of the casa eva action as well as t he rights of spilat to money or property under any judgment subsequently procured in the casa eva action.here,the court determined that spilat received no money or property and,consequently,there was nothing subject to paykar lien 
according to paykar,there is no doubt the money and the property transferred to spilat i nsurers is subject to paykar lien because spilat and spilat i nsurers have interdependent legal rights and responsibilities when it comes to spilat i nsurers rights of subrogation for payments made on behalf of its insured.italics added.the problem is that paykar ignores the fact that,in addition to the subrogation rights they were also entitled to pursue,the insurers obtained an assignment of casa eva claims against the parties,and paykar presents no persuasive argument that the fact that the insurers pursued this alternative or that their motive was to recoup their costs of defending spilat and paying casa eva on its behalf required the court to grant its motion.
the insurers were not obligated to pursue their subrogation rights,and paykar identifies no legal obligation of the insurers to do so for paykar sole benefit.employers mutual liability ins.cal th,d,subrogation is a right,not an obligation new plumbing contractors,nationwide mutual ins.th,d because subrogation is a right,not an obligation,the insurer presumably has the option of not pursuing subrogation recovery at all.
casa eva was free to assign its claims against the remaining defendants,and the insurers were free to accept this assignment.the civil code defines a chose or thing in action as a right to recover money or other personal property by a judicial proceeding.c ivil c ode.choses in action are assignable when they arise out of an obligation or out of the violation of a right of property.civil code,citations.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.contracts.
