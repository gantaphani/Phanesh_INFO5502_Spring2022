unable to pay his debts,appellant jon rosson filed a voluntary petition for protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code.for almost a year,rosson assured the court and his creditors that he would soon be receiving several hundred thousand dollars in an arbitration award,and that he would use that money to fund his proposed chapter plan.when the money finally came in,however,rosson failed to deliver it to the chapter trustee as the bankruptcy court had ordered him to do.upon discovering that the arbitration proceeds had not been delivered to the trustee,the bankruptcy court found that rosson was rebelliously horsing around with estate assets and,on its own motion,converted the chapter case to one under chapter.before the court filed the formal conversion order,rosson invoked his right to voluntarily dismiss his chapter petition under b.the bankruptcy court denied the request for dismissal and converted the case.
relying on a holding from the bankruptcy appellate panel,see beatty traub in re beatty,rosson brought this appeal asserting that b afforded him an absolute right to voluntarily dismiss his chapter case at any time prior to the filing of a conversion order,and that the bankruptcy court therefore abused its discretion by denying his request for dismissal.we write to clarify that,after marrama citizens bank of massachusetts,d,a debtor right to voluntarily dismiss a chapter case under b is not absolute,but is qualified by an implied exception for conduct or abuse of the bankruptcy process.the bankruptcy court did not clearly err in finding conduct here.moreover,although the bankruptcy court failed to provide rosson with adequate notice and hearing before converting the case to chapter,as required by and c,rosson can not show prejudice from the bankruptcy court deficient procedures.therefore,we affirm.
background 
rosson filed his voluntary petition for bankruptcy protection under chapter on august.at that time,rosson was involved in an arbitration concerning the breakup of an entity called bleu,llc.over the next nine months,while attempting to confirm a chapter plan over objections from creditors and the united states trustee,rosson repeatedly assured the bankruptcy court that he would soon be receiving several hundred thousand dollars as the result of the arbitration proceeding,and that the funds would be used to pay his debts under the plan 
on july,rosson reported to the court that the arbitrator had awarded him approximately.on july,the court ordered rosson to deposit the arbitration funds with the chapter trustee.rosson admits that he did not deposit the funds with the trustee until early september,at which time he deposited only 
meanwhile,on august,rosson attorney,harris,moved to withdraw as attorney of record,stating that there was a breakdown in communication with his client.a hearing on the motion to withdraw was set for august.
at the august,hearing on harris motion to withdraw,the court was informed that rosson had not yet complied with the order to deliver the to the trustee.the court gave rosson less than one hour to deliver the money before the court,on its own motion,would convert rosson case to chapter.rosson did not deliver the money,and the bankruptcy court docket reflects that the case was converted to chapter on august,although a formal order was not filed or entered until later.as the district court later concluded,the bankruptcy court converted the case with essentially no notice.the bankruptcy court explained that there was too much money involved to be horsing around with and the court was left with only one course of action,to convert the case so there a chapter trustee to go after the money.the same day august rosson filed a notice of dismissal notifying the court that he was voluntarily dismissing his chapter case under b and asked the court to enter an order dismissing the petition on september,the court entered an order converting the case to a chapter proceeding and denying the request for dismissal on september,rosson appeared through new counsel and moved for reconsideration on the basis that his right to voluntary dismissal was absolute.in an order entered september,the court denied the motion,stating that it would be a gross miscarriage of justice to allow rosson to dismiss this case and abscond with estate proceeds.in denying the motion for reconsideration,the court applied a local rule stating that such motions are disfavored and will be granted only upon a showing of manifest error or new facts or legal authority which could not have been raised earlier with reasonable diligence.local civ.h see also.local.h applying local civil rule h to bankruptcy cases.
rosson appealed to the district court,which affirmed.he then timely appealed to this court,raising essentially the same arguments that he raised before the district court the right to dismiss a chapter case under b is absolute and when the bankruptcy court converted his case to chapter,it violated his right to notice and a meaningful hearing under and c.
jurisdiction 
the district court had jurisdiction to review final bankruptcy court orders under a,and we have jurisdiction,under d,to review bankruptcy court orders originally reviewed under a.we have not previously considered whether an order converting a bankruptcy case to chapter is final and appealable but pioneer liquidating united states trustee in re consol.pioneer mortgage entities,cir reviewing order converting case from chapter to chapter without addressing finality.we have no trouble,however,concluding that such an order is sufficiently final to permit review under a and d.
we have adopted a pragmatic approach to finality in bankruptcy that emphasizes the need for immediate review,rather than whether the order is technically interlocutory.bonham compton in re bonham,cir internal quotation marks omitted.a bankruptcy court order is considered to be final and thus appealable where it resolves and seriously affects substantive rights and finally determines the discrete issue to which it is addressed.id.internal quotation marks omitted see also allen old bank of in re allen,cir per curiam bankruptcy orders that determine and seriously affect substantial rights can cause irreparable harm if the losing party must wait until bankruptcy court proceedings terminate before appealing.
an order converting a case under another chapter to one under chapter determines finally the discrete issue to which it is addressed,whether or not the case will be converted.see vista foods,unsecured creditors comm.in re vista foods,per curiam conversion ends the litigation regarding the discrete controversy of whether the case should proceed under chapter or chapter.moreover,because a conversion to chapter takes control of the estate out of the hands of the debtor,it seriously affects substantive rights and may lead to irreparable harm to the debtor if immediate review is denied.see mason young in re young,cir explaining that under chapter,once the debtor assets have been liquidated,it is virtually impossible to reassemble them,and therefore an order converting to chapter is necessarily more final in nature than an order converting to chapter see also in re firstcent shopping,holding that c onversion of a bankruptcy case to chapter is final and appealable and quoting in re rebeor,i mmediate review i s necessary to protect debtor substantive rights to reorganize in chapter and to prevent irreparable harm through the potential loss of his property sold to good faith purchasers.we therefore hold,in accordance with all other courts of which we are aware that have considered the issue that a bankruptcy court order converting a case from one under another chapter of the bankruptcy code to one under chapter is a final and appealable order.

discussion 
as noted,rosson argues that he was improperly denied his right to voluntarily dismiss his chapter case and he was denied procedures when the bankruptcy court converted his case without notice and a meaningful hearing.we address these arguments in turn.
denial of right to voluntarily dismiss a chapter case 
sections b and c of the bankruptcy code provide as follows 
b on request of the debtor at any time,if the case has not been converted under section,or of this title,the court shall dismiss a case under this chapter.any waiver of the right to dismiss under this subsection is unenforceable.
c o n request of a party in interest or the united states trustee and after notice and a hearing,the court may convert a case under chapter to a case under chapter of this title,or may dismiss a case under this chapter,whichever is in the best interests of creditors and the estate,for cause 
b c.these two,that the court shall dismiss a case on request of the chapter debtor,but that the court also may convert a chapter case to chapter for cause can conflict where,on the one hand,a debtor requests voluntary dismissal,while,on the other hand,a party in interest or the trustee moves to the court,acting on its own,case to chapter 
the conflict between b and c has divided courts,including two of our sister circuits,with some courts holding that a debtor has an absolute right to dismiss under b,notwithstanding pending motions to convert under c,while other courts hold that a bankruptcy court retains the power to convert a case under c,even in the face of a debtor request for dismissal under b.compare,barbieri raj acquisition in re barbieri,cir holding that,at any time prior to an actual order of conversion,a debtor has an absolute right to dismiss a chapter petition under b,subject only to the limitation explicitly stated in that provision,with,molitor eidson in re molitor,cir rejecting absolute right of dismissal under b in cases involving bad faith or abuse of process,because the purpose of the bankruptcy code is to afford the honest but unfortunate debtor a fresh start,not to shield those who abuse the bankruptcy process in order to avoid paying their debts.see generally in re jacobsen,collecting cases on both sides of the split.
although we have not weighed in on this question our circuit bankruptcy appellate panel bap adopted the absolute right approach in beatty.see beatty,at the better reasoned view is that a court must dismiss the case upon the debtor request for dismissal under section b if that request is made prior to the formal order converting the case to chapter.see also croston,at reaffirming and following beatty.in his opening brief,rosson argues that we should follow and adopt beatty and hold that the bankruptcy court abused its discretion by refusing to grant his request for dismissal,which was filed prior to the court formal order converting the case to chapter 
after rosson filed his opening brief,however,the supreme court issued marrama citizens bank of massachusetts,d.in marrama,the court firmly rejected the analysis that the bap applied in case that followed and reaffirmed implicitly abrogated beatty as well.indeed,in his reply brief,rosson acknowledges that the absolute right to dismissal under b,as recognized in beatty,is no longer viable after marrama because that right must be qualified by the court power to convert a case based on the debtor conduct or abuse of the bankruptcy process.nevertheless,rosson argues that he did not engage in any conduct,and that he therefore had a right to dismiss his case.below,we first briefly clarify the effect of marrama on the rule announced in beatty and then address rosson argument that he should prevail,even under the new rule.
status of beatty absolute right rule after marrama 
as noted,courts have split on the question of the absolute nature of the right to dismissal of a chapter case under b.after marrama,however,the absolute right position is no longer viable.
in marrama,the court took up the same question addressed by the bap in right of a debtor,under a,to convert his chapter case to chapter.see marrama.at identifying the issue as whether even a debtor has an absolute right to convert at least one chapter proceeding into a chapter case.as the bap recognized in croston,this question is analytically indistinguishable from the question in beatty,the absolute right of a debtor to voluntarily dismiss his chapter case.as croston held,the text of a is indistinguishable from the parallel language of b and it follows that beatty analysis of the absolute nature of b applies to the same question under a.croston,at.thus,in croston,the bap followed beatty and held that a debtor had an absolute,right to convert his case from chapter to chapter,and that this was true notwithstanding a bankruptcy court concern with perceived dysfunction or bad faith manipulation of the bankruptcy process.id.at.
in marrama,however,a majority of the court unequivocally rejected the croston position,holding that the right to convert to chapter was impliedly limited by the bankruptcy court power to take any action necessary to prevent conduct or abuse of the bankruptcy process.see id.at noting that the bankruptcy code specifically grants bankruptcy judges broad authority to take any action necessary or appropriate to prevent an abuse of process quoting a.thus,the court held that bankruptcy judges had the power to differentiate between the vast majority of honest but unfortunate debtors who do possess an absolute right to convert their cases from chapter to chapter and the atypical litigant who has demonstrated that he is not entitled to the relief available to the typical debtor.id.at.
although the court declined to decide with precision what conduct qualifies as bad faith,the court emphasize d that the debtor conduct must,in fact,be atypical.id.at.applying the rule to the facts before it,the court concluded that marrama had made a number of statements about his principal asset a house that were misleading or inaccurate,id.at,and that he had therefore forfeited his purportedly absolute right to proceed under chapter.id.at.
there is no doubt that after marrama,croston is no longer good law.marrama expressly cited croston as one of the cases recognizing a debtor absolute right to convert a chapter case to chapter approach that the court then rejected.see id.at.moreover,although marrama did not address the exact issue decided in beatty,it is clear that,after marrama,beatty too is no longer good law,insofar as it holds that a chapter debtor has an absolute right to dismiss under b.as noted above,croston was at pains to explain that there was no analytical distinction between the legal issue in that case and the issue in beatty.see croston,at.we agree,and accordingly we conclude that the court rejection of the absolute right theory as to a applies equally to b therefore,in light of marrama,we hold that the debtor right of voluntary dismissal under b is not absolute,but is qualified by the authority of a bankruptcy court to deny dismissal on grounds of conduct or to prevent an abuse of process.a.see jacobsen,at reaching same conclusion.but see in re polly,holding that right to voluntarily dismiss chapter case is absolute distinguishing marrama.
application of marrama to rosson case 
rosson acknowledges in his reply brief that,after marrama,conduct can justify the bankruptcy court denial of the right to voluntarily dismiss a chapter petition,but he attempts to distinguish his case from marrama on the facts,insisting that his conduct is nothing like that of the dishonest debtor described in marrama.rosson states that marrama involved a debtor who consciously lied to the court,attempted to remove assets from the court jurisdiction,and took efforts to conceal what he had done.rosson argues that,by contrast,he merely pledged the arbitration proceeds for use in his chapter case,and that it is not at all obvi
