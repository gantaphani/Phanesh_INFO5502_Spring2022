petitioner midland funding filed a proof of claim in respondent johnson chapter bankruptcy case,asserting that johnson owed midland debt and noting that the last time any charge appeared on johnson account was more than years ago.the relevant statute of limitations under alabama law is six years.johnson objected to the claim,and the bankruptcy court disallowed it.johnson then sued midland,claiming that its filing a proof of claim on an obviously debt was false,deceptive,misleading,unconscionable,and unfair within the meaning of the fair debt collection practices act.the district court held that the act did not apply and dismissed the suit.the eleventh circuit reversed.
held the filing of a proof of claim that is obviously time barred is not a false,deceptive,misleading,unfair,or unconscionable debt collection practice within the meaning of the fair debt collection practices act.
a midland proof of claim was not false,deceptive,or misleading.the bankruptcy code defines the term claim as a right to payment,a,and state law usually determines whether a person has such a right,see travelers casualty surety of america pacific gas.the relevant alabama law provides that a creditor has the right to payment of a debt even after the limitations period has expired.
johnson argues that the word claim means enforceable claim.but the word enforceable does not appear in the code definition,and johnson interpretation is difficult to square with congress intent to adopt the broadest available definition of claim,johnson home state bank.other code provisions are still more difficult to square with johnson interpretation.for example,b says that if a claim is unenforceable it will be disallowed,not that it is not a claim.other provisions make clear that the running of a limitations period constitutes an affirmative defense that a debtor is to assert after the creditor makes a claim.the law has long treated unenforceability of a claim due to the expiration of the limitations period as an affirmative defense,and there is nothing misleading or deceptive in the filing of a proof of claim that follows the code similar system.
indeed,to determine whether a statement is misleading normally requires consideration of the legal sophistication of its audience,bates state bar of,which in a chapter bankruptcy includes a trustee who is likely to understand that a proof of claim is a statement by the creditor that he or she has a right to payment that is subject to disallowance,including disallowance based on untimeliness.
b several circumstances,taken together,lead to the conclusion that midland proof of claim was not unfair or unconscionable within the terms of the fair debt collection practices act.
johnson points out that several lower courts have found or indicated that,in the context of an ordinary civil action to collect a debt,a debt collector assertion of a claim known to be time barred is unfair.but those courts rested their conclusions upon their concern that a consumer might unwittingly repay a debt.such considerations have significantly diminished force in a chapter bankruptcy,where the consumer initiates the proceeding,see,a where a knowledgeable trustee is available,see a where procedural rules more directly guide the evaluation of claims,see fed.rule bkrtcy.proc.c a and where the claims resolution process is generally a more streamlined and less unnerving prospect for a debtor than facing a collection lawsuit,in re gatewood.
also unpersuasive is johnson argument that there is no legitimate reason for allowing a practice like this one that risks harm to the debtor.the bankruptcy system treats untimeliness as an affirmative defense and normally gives the trustee the burden of investigating claims to see if one is stale.and,at least on occasion,the assertion of even a stale claim can benefit the debtor.
more importantly,a change in the simple approach,carving out an exception,would require defining the exception boundaries.does it apply only where a claim staleness appears on the face of the proof of claim does it apply to other affirmative defenses or only to the running of the limitations period neither the fair debt collection practices act nor the bankruptcy code indicates that congress intended an ordinary civil court applying the act to determine answers to such questions.the act and the code have different purposes and structural features.the act seeks to help consumers by preventing consumer bankruptcies in the first place,while the code creates and maintains the delicate balance of a debtor protections and obligations,kokoszka belford.applying the act in this context would upset that delicate balance.
contrary to the argument of the united states,the promulgation of bankruptcy rule did not resolve this issue.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit 
justice breyer delivered the opinion of the court.
the fair debt collection practices act,stat,et,prohibits a debt collector from asserting any false,deceptive,or misleading representation,or using any unfair or unconscionable means to collect,or attempt to collect,a debt.in this case,a debt collector filed a written statement in a chapter bankruptcy proceeding claiming that the debtor owed the debt collector money.the statement made clear,however,that the statute of limitations governing collection of the claimed debt had long since run.the question before us is whether the debt collector filing of that statement falls within the scope of the aforementioned provisions of the fair debt collection practices act.we conclude that it does not.
in march,aleida johnson,the respondent,filed for personal bankruptcy under chapter of the bankruptcy code or code,et seq,in the federal district court for the southern district of alabama.two months later,midland funding,llc,the petitioner,filed a proof of claim,a written statement asserting that johnson owed midland a debt of.the statement added that the last time any charge appeared on johnson account was in may,more than years before johnson filed for bankruptcy.the relevant statute of limitations is six years.see.code.johnson,represented by counsel,objected to the claim midland did not respond to the objection and the bankruptcy court disallowed the claim.
subsequently,johnson brought this lawsuit against midland seeking actual damages,statutory damages,attorney fees,and costs for a violation of the fair debt collection practices act.see.the district court decided that the act did not apply and therefore dismissed the action.the court of appeals for the eleventh circuit disagreed and reversed the district court.midland filed a petition for certiorari,noting a division of opinion among the courts of appeals on the question whether the conduct at issue here is false,deceptive,misleading,unconscionable,or unfair within the meaning of the act.compare ibid.finding the fair debt collection practices act applicable with in re dubois,finding the act inapplicable owens lvnv funding,llc,same and nelson midland credit management,same.we granted the petition.we now reverse the court of appeals.
like the majority of courts of appeals that have considered the matter,we conclude that midland filing of a proof of claim that on its face indicates that the limitations period has run does not fall within the scope of any of the five relevant words of the fair debt collection practices act.we believe it reasonably clear that midland proof of claim was not false,deceptive,or misleading.midland proof of claim falls within the bankruptcy code definition of the term claim.a claim is a right to payment.a.state law usually determines whether a person has such a right.see travelers casualty surety of america pacific gas.the relevant state law is the law of alabama.and alabama law,like the law of many states,provides that a creditor has the right to payment of a debt even after the limitations period has expired.see ex parte healthsouth,passage of time extinguishes remedy but the right remains see also,sallaz rice,idaho,similar notte merchants mut.ins,similar potterton ryland group,similar summers connolly,ohio,similar devries secretary of state,similar fleming yeazel,similar fidelity cas.of lackland,similar insurance dunscomb,similar but see.code ann.expiration of the limitations period extinguishes the remedy and the right.stat.same.
johnson argues that the code word claim means enforceable claim.she notes that this court once referred to a bankruptcy claim as an enforceable obligation.pennsylvania of public welfare davenport.and,she concludes,midland proof of claim was false or deceptive or misleading because its claim was not enforceable.brief for respondent brief for united states as amicus curiae making a similar argument.
but we do not find this argument convincing.the word enforceable does not appear in the code definition of claim.see.the court in davenport likely used the word enforceable descriptively,for that case involved an enforceable debt,at.and it is difficult to square johnson interpretation with our later statement that congress intended to adopt the broadest available definition of claim.johnson home state bank.
it is still more difficult to square johnson interpretation with other provisions of the bankruptcy code.section b of the code,for example,says that,if a claim is unenforceable,it will be disallowed.it does not say that an unenforceable claim is not a claim.similarly,a says that a claim is a right to payment,whether or not such right is fixed,contingent,or disputed.if a contingency does not arise,or if a claimant loses a dispute,then the claim is unenforceable.yet this section makes clear that the unenforceable claim is nonetheless a right to payment,hence a claim,as the code uses those terms.
johnson looks for support to other provisions that govern bankruptcy proceedings,including a of the bankruptcy code,which states that a claim will be allowed in the absence of an objection,and rule f of the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure,which states that a properly filed proof of claim shall constitute prima facie evidence of the validity and amount of the claim.but these provisions do not discuss the scope of the term claim.rather,they restate the bankruptcy code system for determining whether a claim will be allowed.other provisions make clear that the running of a limitations period constitutes an affirmative defense,a defense that the debtor is to assert after a creditor makes a claim.the law has long treated unenforceability of a claim due to the expiration of the limitations period as an affirmative defense.see,fed.rule civ.proc.c encyclopaedia of pleading and practice mckinney ed.and we see nothing misleading or deceptive in the filing of a proof of claim that,in effect,follows the code similar system.
indeed,to determine whether a statement is misleading normally requires consideration of the legal sophistication of its audience.bates state bar of.the audience in chapter bankruptcy cases includes a trustee,a,who must examine proofs of claim and,where appropriate,pose an objection,a,b including any timeliness objection,b.and that trustee is likely to understand that,as the code says,a proof of claim is a statement by the creditor that he or she has a right to payment subject to disallowance including disallowance based upon,and following,the trustee objection for untimeliness.a,b,a,b.we do not address the appropriate standard in ordinary civil litigation.
whether midland assertion of an obviously claim is unfair or unconscionable within the terms of the fair debt collection practices act presents a closer question.first,johnson points out that several lower courts have found or indicated that,in the context of an ordinary civil action to collect a debt,a debt collector assertion of a claim known to be time barred is unfair.see,phillips asset acceptance,llc,holding as much kimber federal financial,supp,md same huertas galaxy asset management,indicating as much castro collecto,same freyermuth credit bureau,same.
we are not convinced,however,by this precedent.it considers a debt collector assertion in a civil suit of a claim known to be stale.we assume,for argument sake,that the precedent is correct in that context a matter this court itself has not decided and does not now decide.but the context of a civil suit differs significantly from the present context,that of a chapter bankruptcy proceeding.the lower courts rested their conclusions upon their concern that a consumer might unwittingly repay a debt.thus the seventh circuit pointed out that few unsophisticated consumers would be aware that a statute of limitations could be used to defend against lawsuits based on stale debts.phillips,supra,at quoting kimber,supra,at.the passage of time,the circuit wrote,dulls the consumer memory of the circumstances and validity of the debt and the consumer may no longer have personal records.at quoting kimber,supra,at.moreover,a consumer might pay a stale debt simply to avoid the cost and embarrassment of suit,at.
these considerations have significantly diminished force in the context of a chapter bankruptcy.the consumer initiates such a proceeding,see,a,and consequently the consumer is not likely to pay a stale claim just to avoid going to court.a knowledgeable trustee is available.see a.procedural bankruptcy rules more directly guide the evaluation of claims.see fed.rule bkrtcy.proc.c a advisory committee notes on rule.and,as the eighth circuit bankruptcy appellate panel put it,the claims resolution process is generally a more streamlined and less unnerving prospect for a debtor than facing a collection lawsuit.in re gatewood,see also,outlining generally the claims resolution process.these features of a chapter bankruptcy proceeding make it considerably more likely that an effort to collect upon a stale claim in bankruptcy will be met with resistance,objection,and disallowance.
second,johnson argues that the practice at least risks harm to the debtor and that there is not a single legitimate reason for allowing this kind of behavior.brief for respondent.would it not be obviously unfair,she asks,for a debt collector to adopt a practice of buying up stale claims cheaply and asserting them in bankruptcy knowing they are stale and hoping for careless trustees the united states,supporting johnson,adds its view that the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure make the practice open to sanction,and argues that sanctionable conduct is unfair conduct.brief for united states as amicus curiae.see fed.rule bkrtcy.proc.b sanction possible if party violates the rule that by presenting to the bankruptcy court any paper,a party is certifying that to the best of his or her knowledge,the claims therein are warranted by existing law 
we are ultimately not persuaded by these arguments.the bankruptcy system,as we have already noted,treats untimeliness as an affirmative defense.the trustee normally bears the burden of investigating claims and pointing out that a claim is stale.see supra,at.moreover,protections available in a chapter bankruptcy proceeding minimize the risk to the debtor.see supra,at.and,at least on occasion,the assertion of even a stale claim can benefit a debtor.its filing and disallowance discharge s the debt.a.and that discharge means that the debt even if unenforceable will not remain on a credit report potentially affecting an individual ability to borrow money,buy a home,and perhaps secure employment.see a debt may remain on a credit report for seven years.code statute of limitations.cts.jud.proc.code ann.statute of limitations cfr pt,app,a credit report may include discharged debt only if the debt is reported as having a zero balance due to reflect the fact that the consumer is no longer liable for the discharged debt ftc,years of experience with the fair credit reporting act an ftc staff report with summary of interpretations similar.
more importantly,a change in the simple approach,carving out an exception,itself would require defining the boundaries of the exception.does it apply only where as johnson alleged in the complaint a claim staleness appears on the face of the proof of claim does it apply to other affirmative defenses or only to the running of a limitations period 
at the same time,we do not find in either the fair debt collection practices act or the bankruptcy code good reason to believe that congress intended an ordinary civil court applying the act to determine answers to these questions.the act and the code have different purposes and structural features.the act seeks to help consumers,not necessarily by closing what johnson and the united states characterize as a loophole in the bankruptcy code,but by preventing consumer bankruptcies in the first place.see,a recognizing the abundant evidence of the use of abusive,deceptive,and unfair debt collection practices which contribute to the number of personal bankruptcies see also b existing laws and procedures are inadequate to protect consumers e statute seeks to eliminate abusive debt collection practices the bankruptcy code,by way of contrast,creates and maintains what we have called the delicate balance of a debtor protections and obligations.kokoszka belford.
to find the fair debt collection practices act applicable here would upset that delicate balance.from a substantive perspective it would authorize a new significant remedy in the absence of language in the code providing for it.administratively,it would permit postbankruptcy litigation in an ordinary civil court concerning a creditor state of mind a matter often hard to determine.see c safe harbor for any debt collector who shows by a preponderance of evidence that the violation was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error procedurally,it would require creditors who assert a claim to investigate the merits of an affirmative defense typically the debtor job to assert and prove lest the creditor later be found to have known the claim was untimely.the upshot could well be added complexity,changes in settlement incentives,and a shift from the debtor to the creditor the obligation to investigate the staleness of a claim.
unlike the united states,we do not believe that the advisory committee on rules of bankruptcy procedure settled the issue when it promulgated bankruptcy rule.the committee,in considering amendments to the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure in,specifically rejected a proposal that would have required a creditor to certify that there is no valid statute of limitations defense.see agenda book for meeting.it did so in part because the working group did not want to impose an affirmative obligation on a creditor to make a prefiling investigation of a potential defense.ibid.in rejecting that proposal,the committee did note that rule imposes a general obligation on a claimant to undertake an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances to determine that a claim is warranted by existing law and that factual contentions have evidentiary support,and to certify as much on the proof of claim,at.the committee also acknowledged,however,that this requirement would not addres s the statute of limitation issue,but would only ensure the accuracy of the information provided.ibid.
we recognize that one bankruptcy court has held that filing a claim without a prefiling investigation of a potential defense merits sanctions under rule.in re sekema,bkrtcy.nd.but others have held to the contrary.see,in re freeman,bkrtcy.ed in re jenkins,bkrcty.nd in re keeler,bkrtcy.ed see also in re andrews,bkrtcy.ednc recognizing that m any courts have found that sanctions under rule were not warranted for filing stale claims 
these circumstances,taken together,convince us that we can not find the practice at issue here unfair or unconscionable within the terms of the fair debt collection practices act.
for these reasons,we conclude that filing in a chapter bankruptcy proceeding a proof of claim that is obviously time barred is not a false,deceptive,misleading,unfair,or unconscionable debt collection practice within the meaning of the fair debt collection practices act.the judgment of the eleventh circuit is reversed.
it is so ordered.

the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa or act prohibits professional debt collectors from using false,deceptive,or misleading representation s or means in connection with the collection of any debt and from us ing unfair or unconscionable means to collect a debt.the court today wrongfully holds that a debt collector that knowingly attempts to collect a debt in bankruptcy proceedings has violated neither of these prohibitions.
professional debt collectors have built a business out of buying stale debt,filing claims in bankruptcy proceedings to collect it,and hoping that no one notices that the debt is too old to be enforced by the courts.this practice is both unfair and unconscionable.i respectfully dissent from the court conclusion to the contrary 
americans owe trillions of dollars in consumer debt to creditors credit card companies,schools,and car dealers,among others.see fed.reserve bank of,quarterly report on household debt and credit.most people will repay their debts,but some can not do so.the debts they do not pay are increasingly likely to end up in the hands of professional debt collectors companies whose business it is to collect debts that are owed to other companies.see consumer financial protection,fair debt collection practices act annual report,cfpb report.debt collection is a lucrative and growing industry.last year,the nation debt collection agencies earned over billion in revenue.ibid.
although many debt collectors are hired by creditors to work on a basis,more and more collectors also operate as debt buyers purchasing debts from creditors outright and attempting to collect what they can,with the profits going to their own accounts see ftc,the structure and practices of the debt buying industry ftc report cfpb report.debt buyers now hold hundreds of billions of dollars in consumer debt indeed,a study conducted by the federal trade commission ftc in found that nine of the leading debt buyers had purchased over billion in debt just in the previous three years.ftc report,at,table.
because creditors themselves have given up trying to collect the debts they sell to debt buyers,they sell those debts for pennies on the dollar,at.the older the debt,the greater the discount while debt buyers pay close to eight cents per dollar for debts under three years old,they pay as little as two cents per dollar for debts greater than six years old,and effectively nothing for debts greater than years old,at.these prices reflect the basic fact that older debts are harder to collect.as time passes,consumers move or forget that they owe the debts creditors have more trouble documenting the debts and proving their validity and debts begin to fall within state statutes of limitations time limits that operate to bar a plaintiff suit once passed.cts waldburger,slip,at.because a creditor or a debt collector can not enforce a debt in court,the debt is inherently worth very little indeed.
but statutes of limitations have not deterred debt buyers.for years,they have filed suit in state courts often in courts,where formal rules of evidence do not apply to collect even debts too old to be enforced by those courts see holland,the one hundred billion dollar problem in court,bus.tech.importantly,the debt buyers only hope in these cases
