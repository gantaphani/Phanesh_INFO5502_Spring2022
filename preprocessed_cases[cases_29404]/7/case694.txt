this consolidated appeal,which involves the cases of kurt and jean kielisch and david and elizabeth lawrence collectively,the debtors,requires us to resolve whether their creditor,educational credit management corporation ecmc,is precluded from applying chapter plan payments from the debtors bankruptcy estates to postpetition interest on their nondischargeable student loan debts.the bankruptcy courts in the debtors cases each held that ecmc violated b west by applying the debtors chapter plan payments to interest,and the district courts each affirmed.because we conclude that creditors are not precluded from applying bankruptcy estate payments to accrued postpetition interest on nondischargeable student loan debts,we reverse.
a.the kielisches 
on december,kurt and jean kielisch submitted a chapter petition for relief pursuant to the united states bankruptcy code.on february,great lakes higher education guaranty corporation great lakes filed proofs of claim for the kielisches student loans,one in the amount of for kurt kielisch and one in the amount of for jean kielisch.the proofs of claim included only principal and prepetition interest.on march,the kielisches filed an amended chapter plan,replacing the december plan.the amended plan,which was confirmed on june,provided that the accepted unsecured claims of great lakes higher education,in the amounts of and,will be paid in full through the trustee.at.pursuant to the amended plan,the trustee paid great lakes for kurt kielisch and for jean kielisch,and on june,the bankruptcy court entered an order discharging the kielisches 
after the discharge,ecmc,the assignee of the kielisches student loans,pursued collection efforts against them.ecmc asserted that,notwithstanding the payments made under the amended plan and the discharge order,its claims were never fully paid because postpetition interest continued to accrue during the pendency of the chapter proceedings.ecmc also argued that it was proper to apply plan payments first to accrued postpetition interest before principal and that,as a result,the kielisches still owed a substantial amount on their loans.the kielisches,in response to ecmc claims,filed a complaint in bankruptcy court to determine the dischargeability of their student loan debt and the proper application of plan payments to that debt.
after a hearing,the bankruptcy court held that although ecmc was entitled to postpetition interest on the nondischargeable student loans,it was improper to apply any of the plan payments to interest.accordingly,the bankruptcy court required ecmc to recalculate and reapply the payments received by great lakes from the estate to determine what amount of postpetition interest on the loans,if any,remained unpaid.the bankruptcy court left it to the parties to determine the extent to which ecmc claim has been satisfied.
on january,ecmc filed a notice of appeal to the district court.the district court,after reviewing the briefs and the record and without oral argument,affirmed the bankruptcy court decision.
b.the lawrences 
on may,david and elizabeth lawrence filed a chapter bankruptcy petition.listed in their schedules was student loan debt consisting of two promissory notes.these notes were held by american student loan assistance asla and consumers bank and were subsequently transferred to the guarantor,ecmc,which now holds the notes.in their chapter plan,which was confirmed july,the lawrences provided for their student loans as follows 
the debtors shall pay of the following student loans inside their chapter plan,as they are nondischargeable in chapter american student loan assistance.consumer bank.
at.these amounts included only principal and prepetition interest.the lawrences chapter trustee thereafter began making payments to asla according to the plan the trustee paid the entire to asla as provided in the plan and proof of claim,and,on october,the bankruptcy court discharged the lawrences.the case was closed on october,but the bankruptcy court reopened the case on november,at the request of the lawrences,to determine the dischargeability of their debt to ecmc as assignee of the asla and consumers bank notes.
after a hearing,the bankruptcy court held that although ecmc was entitled to recover from the lawrences accrued interest on its claims,barred it from applying payments made under the chapter plan to postpetition interest.the bankruptcy court left it to the parties to determine to what extent ecmc claim had been satisfied,based upon the court ruling.on march,ecmc appealed to the district court,which affirmed the bankruptcy court decision.after ecmc appealed the orders relating to both the kielisches and lawrences,we consolidated both cases for appeal 
the sole issue on appeal is whether the lower courts properly determined that ecmc was precluded from applying the debtors chapter plan payments to interest on the debtors nondischargeable student loans.we review the district court decision by applying the same standard of review that it applied to the bankruptcy court decision.that is,we review findings of fact for clear error and conclusions of law de novo.in re deutchman,cir internal citations omitted.whether the application of plan payments to postpetition interest on nondischargeable student loans violates is a question of law that we review de novo.
we begin our analysis with a review of the relevant statutory provisions.under the guaranteed student loan program the federal government serves as guarantor of unsecured student loans and subsidizes interest payments on those loans.student loan mktg.riley.pursuant to a west supp,student loans are nondischargeable in bankruptcy proceedings absent a showing of undue hardship section a provides,
a a discharge under section,a,b,or b of this title does not discharge an individual debtor from any debt 
for an educational benefit overpayment or loan made,insured or guaranteed by a governmental unit,or made under any program funded in whole or in part by a governmental unit or nonprofit institution,or for an obligation to repay funds received as an educational benefit,scholarship or stipend,unless excepting such debt from discharge under this paragraph will impose an undue hardship on the debtor and the debtor dependents 
a.thus,under a,the debtors remain personally responsible for their nondischargeable student loan debts,and those debts pass or ride through the bankruptcy unaffected and are a postbankruptcy liability of the former debtor.in re cousins,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
section a was enacted to prevent indebted college or graduate students from filing for bankruptcy immediately upon graduation,thereby absolving themselves of the obligation to repay their student loans.in re hornsby,cir.the nondischargeability of student loans originally applied only to chapter bankruptcies and not chapter bankruptcies.this provided debtors seeking to discharge student loan debt an incentive to file chapter plans because courts permitted borrowers to discharge their student loan debts under chapter without a showing of undue hardship.see in re klein,cir.bap permitting discharge of student loan under chapter because a reasonable construction of the statute requires reading chapter discharge provisions separately from chapter and that congress intended student loans to be dischargeable under chapter internal citations omitted.in,congress responded by extending the nondischargeability of student loans to chapter filings.see in re andersen,cir stating that prior to,student loan obligations were dischargeable in chapter after completion of plan payments but that i n,congress amended a,adding a as an exception to discharge citing student loan default prevention initiative act of,stat.
section f of title of the code of federal regulations addresses the manner in which a creditor must apply payments from a student loan debtor such as the debtors it provides,
f application of borrower payments.a payment made to a guaranty agency by a borrower on a defaulted loan must be applied first to the collection costs incurred to collect that amount and then to other incidental charges,such as late charges,then to accrued interest and then to principal.
f.based on a and f,congress has determined that absent proven undue hardship,student loans are nondischargeable and,thus,pass unaffected through the bankruptcy estate for purposes of the debtor liability,and congress has approved that the creditor,in applying a debtor defaulted student loan payments,generally must apply those payments first to accrued interest before principal.this,of course,is how ecmc treated the debtors student loans it deemed that the debtors student loan debts were unaffected by their bankruptcies,and it applied the payments from their bankruptcy estates to interest before principal.the question,then,is whether congress intended another provision,to preclude ecmc from treating the debtors in the same manner,with respect to their nondischargeable student loan debts,as it does other debtors who have not declared bankruptcy.
section provides,
b except as provided in subsections e,f,g,h and i of this section,if such objection to a claim is made,the court,after notice and a hearing,shall determine the amount of such claim in lawful currency of the united states as of the date of the filing of the petition,and shall allow such claim in such amount,except to the extent that 
such claim is for unmatured interest 
b emphasis added.it is undisputed,based on,that ecmc could file claims with the debtors estates only for prepetition interest and principal and not for unmatured,postpetition interest.the purpose of this provision is to protect other creditors,as well as to avoid administrative inconvenience,by ensuring that it is possible to calculate the amount of claims easily and that creditors at the bottom rungs of the priority ladder are not prejudiced by the delays inherent in liquidation and distribution of the estate.in re hanna,cir.section does not freeze the debt of the student loan debtor interest continues to accrue during the pendency of the bankruptcy proceedings and,as noted above,the debtor remains personally liable for the full amount of the student loan debt.see cousins,at.
the lower courts in each case reasoned that although the debtors postpetition interest remained nondischargeable and could be recovered from the debtors personally upon completion of the chapter plans,ecmc could not apply payments to postpetition interest from the bankruptcy estates because prohibits the application of bankruptcy estate funds to unmatured,postpetition interest in other words,these courts concluded that because barred ecmc from claiming postpetition interest from the bankruptcy estates,it also barred ecmc from applying the estates payments to postpetition interest.
the lower courts and the debtors rely on bruning united states,d,and leeper pennsylvania higher educ.assistance agency,cir,for the proposition that under b postpetition interest can not be recovered from the bankruptcy estate.lawrence educ.credit mgmt,see also in re pardee,cir.bap stating that precludes the payment of postpetition interest from the bankruptcy estate in re wagner,same.
in bruning,the supreme court addressed whether the united states is entitled to recover,out of assets acquired by a debtor after his adjudication of bankruptcy,interest on a tax assessment which under of the federal bankruptcy act,stat,as amended,was not discharged in the bankruptcy proceedings.bruning,at.the court stated that 
initially,one would assume that congress,in providing that a certain type of debt should survive bankruptcy proceedings as a personal liability of the debtor,intended personal liability to continue as to the interest on that debt as well as to its principal amount.thus,it has never been seriously suggested that a creditor whose claim is not provable against the trustee in bankruptcy loses his right to interest in a postbankruptcy action brought against the debtor personally.in most situations,interest is considered to be the cost of the use of the amounts owing a creditor and an incentive to prompt repayment and,thus,an integral part of a continuing debt.interest on a tax debt would seem to fit that description.thus,logic and reason indicate that interest on a tax claim excepted from discharge by of the act should be recoverable in a later action against the debtor personally,and there is no evidence of any congressional intent to the contrary.
id.at.the court also stated,
we find no indication in the wording or history of a that the section was meant to limit the government right to continuing interest on an undischarged and unpaid tax liability.nor is petitioner aided by the principle that one main purpose of the bankruptcy act is to let the honest debtor begin his financial life anew.as the court of appeals noted,is not a compassionate section for debtors.rather,it demonstrates congressional judgment that certain,those of financing the value of giving the debtor a wholly fresh start.congress clearly intended that personal liability for unpaid tax debts survive bankruptcy.the general humanitarian purpose of the bankruptcy act provides no reason to believe that congress had a different intention with regard to personal liability for the interest on such debts.
id.at.internal footnote omitted.
the debtors argue that bruning clearly distinguishes between personal liability and liability of the estate for purposes of postpetition interest on nondischargeable debts and,therefore,that bruning supports their argument that ecmc can not apply estate payments to postpetition interest even though they remain personally liable for the postpetition interest.bruning,however,only addressed whether bruning could be personally liable for postpetition interest that was not paid out of the estate it did not address the propriety of applying estate payments to postpetition interest.
in leeper,the third circuit concluded that bruning applied to the chapter context and that postpetition interest did accrue on nondischargeable student loan debt during the pendency of chapter proceedings.leeper,at.leeper,however,addressed only whether postpetiton interest could accrue on a nondischargeable student loan after the filing of a chapter bankruptcy petition and not whether the creditor could apply estate payments to postpetition interest.moreover,the leeper court explicitly recognized that the creditor did not argue that plan payments made by the debtors could be applied beyond its bankruptcy claims,which only included outstanding principal and prepetition interest.id.at noting that in its answer,the creditor conceded that all plan payments made by the debtors should be applied only to their bankruptcy claims,which include the outstanding principal balances of the loans and all interest.thus,leeper did not address the issue before us,which is whether prohibits the application of estate payments to postpetition interest on nondischargeable student loan debt that was not included in the bankruptcy claims,but for which the debtors remain personally liable.
section bars creditors from making claims from the bankruptcy estate for unmatured interest it is undisputed,therefore,that ecmc could not have included the debtors postpetition interest in its proofs of claim to their bankruptcy estates.section of the bankruptcy code defines a claim as follows 
claim means 
a right to payment,whether or not such right is reduced to judgment,liquidated,unliquidated,fixed,contingent,matured,unmatured,disputed,undisputed,legal,equitable,secured,or unsecured or 
b right to an equitable remedy for breach of performance if such breach gives rise to a right to payment,whether or not such right to an equitable remedy is reduced to judgment,fixed,contingent,matured,unmatured,disputed,undisputed,secured,or unsecured 
west supp.notably,however,a claim is defined differently under the bankruptcy code than a debt,which is liability on a claim.thus,although limits ecmc ability to file claims for postpetition interest with the debtors bankruptcy estates,it does not purport to limit the liability on those claims,debts.
we believe that the lower courts conflated these two concepts by effectively treating a claim as the equivalent of a debt for purposes of such that,under the lower cou
