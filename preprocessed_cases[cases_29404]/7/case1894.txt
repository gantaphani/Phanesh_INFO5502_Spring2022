rule c ruling 
the question of excusable neglect under rule c is by its very nature left to the discretion of the bankruptcy court whose decision should not be set aside unless the reviewing court,a district court or bap or court of appeals,has a definite and firm conviction that the court below committed a clear error of judgment.eck dodge chem.in re power recovery,cir.thus,the governing standard of review and the ruling at which it is directed are the same for us as it was for the bap.see lang,at.we agree fully with the opinion of the bap and,as we have on other appropriate occasions,we formally adopt the decision,attached as an appendix hereto,as our own see,hollytex carpet mills.employment sec.comm in re hollytex carpet mills,cir.
lack of appellate jurisdiction to review bankruptcy court jurisdiction 
lang devotes a large portion of her appellate briefing to an attack on the bankruptcy court jurisdiction over the adversary proceeding resolved in favor of lang as summarized above.recognizing the procedural discontinuity between the judgment concluding the adversary proceeding and the collateral ruling before us,she seeks to bridge the gap by invoking the familiar principle that s o long as a case is pending,the issue of federal court jurisdiction may be raised at any stage of the proceedings either by the parties or by the court on its own motion.ramey constr.apache tribe,cir.this argument has some facial appeal,but is undercut here by another,even more basic jurisdictional principle.
the supreme court has made it clear that a court threshold determination of its jurisdiction is a prerequisite to any judicial action without jurisdiction the court can not proceed at all in any cause,and,thus,when it ceases to exist,the only function remaining to the court is that of announcing the fact and dismissing the cause.steel citizens for a better env t,d quotation omitted.this principle applies with equal force to appellate jurisdiction.see,united states,cir,cert.denied,d butler biocore med,cir.
because our power to review any decisions involving a lower court subject matter on our appellate jurisdiction,o n every appeal,the first and fundamental question is that of jurisdiction,first,of this court,and then of the court from which the record comes.steel,at.quotation omitted and emphasis added.thus,the question of this court jurisdiction,our appellate jurisdiction is antecedent to all other questions,including the question of the subject matter of the district court.petroleos mexicanos refinacion king a,cir holding appellant challenge to district court subject matter jurisdiction could not be reached until appellate jurisdiction was established accord resolution trust sonny old land,cir before addressing the district court jurisdiction on removal,we must decide our own jurisdiction.while this court has not stated the point so explicitly,we have adhered to its substance.see,amazon,dirt camp,cir having established our appellate jurisdiction,we now turn to the merits of this appeal regarding the district court subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiff state law claims.
two concrete examples will illustrate this important point and help to flesh out its application here.suppose a party moved to dismiss a case for lack of jurisdiction and the district court denied the motion.such a ruling is generally not subject to interlocutory appeal.see magic circle energy drilling program lindsey in re magic circle energy,cir citing catlin united states.john burns drilling cent.bank of denver,cir same.but this prohibition on interlocutory review would be left meaningless if,as lang contends,the lack of appellate jurisdiction did not preclude review of questions of trial court jurisdiction following the denial of a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction,the movant could bring an unauthorized appeal and still insist that the appellate court decide the jurisdictional issue on the basis that such matters can be raised at any time.
or,more directly germane to the present circumstances,suppose the same case proceeded to final judgment and no appeal was taken.then months later,the unsuccessful movant filed an untimely notice of appeal.one of the most firmly rooted and fundamental principles of appellate practice is the rule that a timely appeal is a prerequisite to appellate review.yet lang would have us hold that the untimely appellant could still insist on appellate review because a jurisdictional challenge was involved.
the direct application of the jurisdictional point made above is obscured here somewhat by the presence of two complicating circumstances that may divert attention away from the salient procedural facts,but in the end neither should have any effect on the analysis.first,the appellate jurisdictional deficiency here lang failure to take a timely appeal from the underlying judgment arose at the bap level,not our circuit level.but for this fact to have any pertinence,it would have to be possible for a party to cure an untimely appeal to one court by appealing the resultant dismissal of that appeal to the next higher court while actually seeking review of the underlying ruling of the trial court.that is not the law.many decisions in the bankruptcy context demonstrate that an untimely appeal to an intermediate appellate court,a district court or bap,precludes a subsequently reviewing circuit court from reaching the underlying bankruptcy court ruling even when the intermediate court has erroneously done so.see,deyhimy rupp in re herwit,cir arbuckle first bank of oxford in re arbuckle,cir per curiam ramsey ramsey in re ramsey,cir.and,consistent with the authority discussed earlier,the fact that the untimely appeal challenged the bankruptcy court subject matter jurisdiction would not alter that result.see arbuckle,at.
second,this case concerns the denial of lang motion for extension of time to file the bap appeal,not the dismissal of the bap appeal itself.but this also is immaterial to the analysis.an unsuccessful motion to cure an untimely appeal can not itself be the vehicle for review of the matter not timely appealed.generally,a ruling on a motion is subject to independent appeal separate from the underlying judgment,and this is true of proceedings on motions for extension of time.charles alan wright,et,federal practice and procedure,at,ed see,bishop corsentino,cir.the scope of this appeal should be restricted to the questions properly raised by the motion and should not extend to revive lost opportunities to appeal the underlying judgment.wright et,supra,at see,mirpuri act,cir stubblefield windsor capital group,cir discussing rule b cases.this principle is especially apt here,where the limited reach of the appeal is clear as a matter of logic and common a party appealing the denial of an extension motion were allowed to challenge the underlying substantive order,the whole proceeding on the motion actually under review would be rendered meaningless.
in sum,we adopt the bap decision affirming the denial of lang motion to extend the time for appeal from the bankruptcy court disposition of the underlying adversary proceeding.with that disposition,we fully resolve the appeal before us.accordingly,we do not reach any other matters pressed by lang,in particular her challenge to the bankruptcy court jurisdiction over the claims disposed of in the adversary proceeding from which no timely appeal was taken.

michael,bankruptcy judge.
marsha mcquarrie lang lang appeals from a decision that found the press of other business in her legal practice did not excuse the failure to timely file a notice of appeal in addition,lang contends that the lower court erred when it refused to stay its judgment of pending her appeal.we find no error in either decision.
factual background 
this appeal arises out of an adversary proceeding in which robert lang,lang contended that certain obligations owed to him by lang were under of the united states bankruptcy code on november,the bankruptcy court ruled that these obligations were,and awarded a money judgment to lang.lang appealed this decision to this court.she also obtained a stay of the judgment pending appeal from the bankruptcy court.
on may,this court rendered its decision.while the court agreed that the debt owed to lang was not dischargeable,it disagreed with the bankruptcy court as to the manner in which damages were calculated,and remanded the case to the bankruptcy court for further proceedings one of the judges dissented in part,taking the position that bankruptcy courts lack the authority to enter monetary judgments in dischargeability actions 
on august,lang filed in the bankruptcy court a motion the stay motion asking the court to continue the stay pending appeal in effect,anticipating a further appeal of the bankruptcy court decision in the body of the stay motion,lang asked the bankruptcy court to stay the second judgment which will enter as per remand of the bankruptcy appellate panel.the stay motion was cryptic in nature.although it contained a recital of the legal elements required to obtain a stay pending appeal,it contained no factual allegations to support those legal elements.lang responded to the stay motion on august,
on august,after remand,the bankruptcy court entered its memorandum opinion and its final order and judgment on remand,again finding the obligations to be and entering a monetary judgment against lang in the amount of plus interest on august,the bankruptcy court amended its memorandum opinion,but did not alter its order and judgment.lang filed a notice of appeal the notice of appeal from the judgment on august,fifteen days after its entry.
because it appeared that the notice of appeal was untimely this court entered an order to show cause why appeal should not be considered for dismissal as untimely.lang timely responded,and the matter was referred to a motions panel of this court for determination.on october,this court entered its order dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction,finding that the notice of appeal had not been timely filed 
on september,more than ten days after the bankruptcy court entered its judgment,lang filed with the bankruptcy court a pleading entitled motion for extension of time to file appeal the extension motion in the extension motion,lang alleged that 
defendant,debtor,marsha mcquarrie lang,failed to file the notice of appeal on monday,august,through excusable neglect.lang has been involved in a disputed case concerning the goff children of a magnitude that has required hours of travel between salt lake city,provo and manti on the following dates in august august.the case has also consumed hours between august and august,not counting travel time of over thirty hours for which the clients were not billed.see attached billing statements.because of the demands of this case,in addition to lang regular hearings,mediations,depositions and office appointments,the first deadline of august,august,was a sunday was inadvertently missed and lang filed her notice of appeal on august,four days later 
lang did not assert any grounds for an extension other than the time devoted to the goff litigation.lang filed a response to the extension motion,arguing that lang involvement in other matters did not constitute excusable neglect.
the bankruptcy court held a hearing on the extension motion and the stay motion on september.both parties made oral argument however,lang presented no evidence in support of either motion.at the conclusion of that hearing,the bankruptcy court denied both motions.a written order memorializing the bankruptcy court decision was entered on september,this appeal followed.
ii.jurisdiction 
this court has jurisdiction to hear appeals from final judgments,order,and decrees of bankruptcy courts within the tenth circuit,unless one of the parties elects to have the district court hear the appeal neither party elected to have this appeal heard by the united states district court for the district of utah,thus consenting to review by this court.
iii.standard of review 
we review the bankruptcy court rulings denying an extension of time and refusing to grant a stay pending appeal for abuse of discretion under the abuse of discretion standard,a trial court decision will not be disturbed unless the appellate court has a definite and firm conviction that the lower court made a clear error of judgment or exceeded the bounds of permissible choice in the circumstances.an abuse of discretion occurs when the trial court decision is arbitrary,capricious or whimsical or results in a manifestly unreasonable judgment.as one court has put it,t he question is not how the reviewing court would have ruled,but rather whether a reasonable person could agree with the bankruptcy court decision if reasonable persons could differ as to the issue,then there is no abuse of discretion.
iv.discussion 
a.the extension motion 
the notice of appeal has been found to be untimely.we must decide whether the bankruptcy court abused its discretion in refusing to extend the time for filing a notice of appeal.in seeking the extension,lang relied upon fed.c,which provides that 
a request to extend the time for filing a notice of appeal must be made by written motion filed before the time for filing a notice of appeal has expired,except that such a motion filed not later than days after the expiration of the time for filing a notice of appeal may be granted upon a showing of excusable neglect.an extension of time for filing a notice of appeal may not exceed days from the expiration of the time for filing a notice of appeal otherwise prescribed by this rule or days from the date of entry of the order granting the motion,whichever is later 
lang claims that her involvement in state court litigation during the time in question constituted excusable neglect for purposes of this rule,and that the bankruptcy court abused its discretion in failing to allow the late filing of the notice of appeal.
in support of her position,lang relies upon the decision of the united states supreme court in pioneer investment services brunswick associates.partnership the facts of pioneer are dissimilar to the case at bar.pioneer involved the filing of a proof of claim in a chapter case.in pioneer,the claimants filed their claims after the claims bar date.the bankruptcy court refused to recognize the claims due to their untimeliness.the claimants argued that the bankruptcy court should consider the claims as timely filed under fed.b,which allows a late claim to considered timely if the late filing is the result of excusable neglect.they also argued that excusable neglect was present because a claims deadline was unusual in a chapter bankruptcy case and the claims deadline was buried in the fine print of the notice of meeting of creditors.the court of appeals reversed the decision of the bankruptcy court in its entirety,finding that excusable neglect had been shown,and ordered that the claims be treated as timely.
