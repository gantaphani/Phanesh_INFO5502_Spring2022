exercising its appellate jurisdiction to review orders of the bankruptcy court,the district court dismissed an appeal for want of prosecution after the appellant missed the deadline for filing its brief.this appeal presents two questions whether the district court had jurisdiction to dismiss the case in view of the fact that appellant had previously filed an appeal to this court,and if so,whether the district court properly exercised its discretion to dismiss for failure to prosecute.we conclude that the district court retained jurisdiction,but because it failed to explain why the harsh sanction of dismissal was necessary under the circumstances of this case,we reverse.
in,the union esu,an organization established to promote strong relations among commonwealth nations,sold its washington,branch headquarters to james and geraldine johnson,who,before paying esu its note for part of the building purchase price,filed for bankruptcy.in november,the united states bankruptcy court for the district of columbia entered a settlement order dismissing esu claim to funds from the estate and favoring appellee the elm company elm.see union johnson,slip op.at.
dissatisfied with the bankruptcy court conclusions,esu appealed to the united states district court for the district of columbia.the district court,exercising its appellate jurisdiction over final orders of the bankruptcy court,see a supp.iii,docketed esu appeal on march,starting the clock ticking on the fifteen days allotted for esu to file its brief.see fed.a unless the district court excuses the filing of briefs or specifies different time limits t he appellant shall serve and file a brief within days after entry of the appeal on the docket.before that deadline arrived,esu filed a motion for an extension of time,explaining that the transcript of the bankruptcy court proceedings was not yet complete.the district court granted esu request and gave it until june,warning t here will be no further extensions.union johnson,slip op.at.
on june,with the transcript still unavailable,esu filed a second motion requesting an additional extension of time.eight days later,the district court,unaware that esu had submitted such a motion,dismissed esu appeal with prejudice for failure to prosecute.union johnson,slip op.at june,june dismissal order.in that order,the district court also dismissed esu second amended appeal,which esu had filed after its original appeal to the district court in order to include in its appeal a may bankruptcy court order requiring esu to pay certain costs incurred by its adversaries.the district court found that it lacked jurisdiction over this cost appeal because esu had failed to file a timely notice of appeal.id.at.on july,esu filed a motion to vacate the june dismissal order pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure,arguing that it had in fact filed a pleading by the june deadline and that its cost appeal was timely.
on july,while its motion to vacate was still pending in the district court,esu appealed to this court,seeking reversal of the district court june dismissal order.in august,after the appeal was docketed,the district court granted part of esu motion 
for a reason unknown to the court,counsel,or the clerk office staff,appellant motion to amend the briefing schedule never appeared on the docket in this action,nor was the court copy sent to chambers.as such,when the court issued its june,order dismissing the appeal for want of prosecution,it was without appellant motion to extend the time in which to file its brief.despite the court admonition in its april,order to counsel that no further extensions of the briefing schedule would be permitted,the court would have allowed appellant the opportunity to late file its brief,had it received appellant motion,because counsel should have a certified transcript when preparing briefing for an appeal.
union johnson,slip op.at.the court thus resurrected esu appeal but not its cost appeal and gave the organization until september to submit its brief.id.at.
the september deadline passed without esu filing a brief.on september,the district its own dismissed esu appeal for want of prosecution.union johnson,slip op.at,september dismissal order.in response,esu amended its appeal to this court to include this second dismissal order.because that order constitutes a final judgment,we have jurisdiction to consider esu challenge here.see d.
we begin with esu challenge to the district court dismissal of its appeal.in esu view,the district court lacked jurisdiction to enter its september dismissal order because the organization july notice of appeal to this court divested the district court of authority to issue orders in this case.whether the district court retained jurisdiction to dismiss esu appeal following the organization appeal to this court turns on whether esu motion to vacate was governed by bankruptcy rule as the district court ruled or federal rule of civil procedure as esu argues a legal question that we review de novo.see herbert acad.of.
bankruptcy rule expressly authorizes litigants to ask district courts exercising bankruptcy appellate jurisdiction to reconsider unfavorable rulings and tolls the time for seeking further review in the courts of appeals.it states 
unless the district court by local rule or by court order otherwise provides,a motion for rehearing may be filed within days after entry of the judgment of the district court if a timely motion for rehearing is filed,the time for appeal to the court of appeals for all parties shall run from the entry of the order denying rehearing or the entry of a subsequent judgment.
fed.if despite this tolling provision a litigant files an appeal while the rule motion is pending,the rules of appellate procedure postpone appellate review until the district court decides the motion a notice of appeal filed after the district court announces or enters a judgment,order,or before disposition of the motion for rehearing under bankruptcy rule becomes effective when the order disposing of the motion for rehearing is entered.fed.b a i.therefore,district courts retain jurisdiction over pending rule motions whether or not the litigant simultaneously seeks appellate court review.
federal rule of civil procedure also enables parties to challenge adverse district court decisions.it authorizes district courts to correct clerical errors,see.a,or to relieve parties from judgments in cases of mistake,inadvertence,surprise,excusable neglect,newly discovered evidence,or fraud,among other reasons,see.b.like bankruptcy rule motions,rule motions filed within ten days of judgment toll the time for appealing to the court of appeals and preclude appellate review during their pendency.federal rule of appellate procedure provides 
if a party timely files in the district court a rule motion within ten days after judgment is entered,the time to file an appeal runs for all parties from the entry of the order disposing of the motion if a party files a notice of appeal after the district court announces or enters a before it disposes of any motion for relief under rule if the motion is filed no later than ten days after judgment is entered the notice becomes effective to appeal a judgment or order,in whole or in part,when the order disposing of the last such remaining motion is entered.
fed.a.this rule,however,does not apply to challenges to district court bankruptcy appellate orders.see fed.b a stating that federal rule of appellate procedure a does not apply to appeals from district court orders when the court acts in its bankruptcy appellate capacity.as a result,appeals court review could begin,at least in theory,before the district court disposes of the rule motion,which in turn would divest the district court of jurisdiction to grant the motion.see hoai vo,stating that a district court may consider but not grant a pending rule b motion while appellate review is ongoing unless the court of appeals remands the case.
in this case,even though esu filed its motion to vacate pursuant to rule,the district court held that bankruptcy rule represented the only mechanism available to the organization.see september dismiss
