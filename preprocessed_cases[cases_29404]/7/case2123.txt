this dispute arises out of highly contentious bankruptcy proceedings.during the bankruptcy proceedings,a committee representing bond and trade unsecured creditors vigorously disputed the valuation of the debtor as presented by the debtor management.the committee sought to replace the debtor management with a bankruptcy trustee,based in part on allegations of intentional undervaluation of the debtor.in addition,the committee objected to the debtor plan of reorganization,again raising allegations of intentional undervaluation.over two years after the bankruptcy court entered its order confirming the reorganization plan proposed by the debtor,a class of bondholders brought this suit.the class of bondholders alleges that the officers and directors breached their fiduciary duties by intentionally undervaluing the debtor during the bankruptcy proceedings.the trial court granted summary judgment against the class and entered a judgment.we consider whether the class claims,based on conduct occurring during bankruptcy proceedings,can be maintained in state court years after the bankruptcy court final order confirming the debtor reorganization plan.we conclude that the claims can not.
background and procedural history 
bankruptcy proceedings 
on october,national gypsum company and its parent holding company,aancor holdings collectively national gypsum,filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code.the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of texas,dallas division,consolidated and jointly administered the cases.
national gypsum had three classes of publicly traded debt senior notes,senior debentures,and junior bonds.the senior notes and senior debentures were held by several entities known collectively as the senior bondholders.the junior bonds were held by persons and entities referred to as junior bondholders,and include jeff prostok and the class members he represents.in addition,there were parties holding actual or potential claims against national gypsum arising from personal injury and property damage related to asbestos products,the asbestos claimants.this case stems from conflicts that arose during the bankruptcy proceedings between the junior bondholders and asbestos claimants,on one side,and the senior bondholders and national gypsum management,on the other.
during the bankruptcy proceedings,national gypsum operated as under the bankruptcy code in november,the united states trustee appointed a committee of bond and trade unsecured creditors the bt committee to serve as a statutory creditors committee in the chapter proceedings section of the bankruptcy code authorizes the bankruptcy court to replace a with an appointed trustee upon a determination that it would be in the best interest of the debtor stakeholders or upon a determination of cause,including fraud,dishonesty,incompetence,or gross management.a in january,the bt committee moved to replace national gypsum management with a bankruptcy trustee for the national gypsum estate.the bt committee claimed,among other things,that national gypsum management had intentionally undervalued national gypsum by understat ing all its forecasts to hide its objective views of the company.after a hearing on the motion in march,the bankruptcy court held that the bt committee did not meet its burden on this issue and denied the bt committee motion.
national gypsum submitted a plan of reorganization to the bankruptcy court based on a million valuation of national gypsum.as part of national gypsum proposed plan,a second corporate entity,a new national gypsum company new ngc,would receive national gypsum operating assets and ongoing business.the plan provided that the officers and directors of national gypsum would remain as the initial management of new ngc.new ngc stock would be largely owned by the senior bondholders,with junior bondholders receiving warrants to acquire new ngc stock.
however,the bt committee was not satisfied with the plan and proposed a competing plan based on a million valuation of national gypsum.in november,the bt committee filed its objections to national gypsum plan of reorganization.the bt committee alleged that national gypsum m anagement knowingly misrepresented national gypsum future business prospects and value.the bt committee explained that 
i n exchange for greater than recovery and control of the reorganized company board of directors,certain post petition acquirors of senior notes publicly accepted the national gypsum plan,including its and enrichment provisions.hence,management deceived national gypsum creditors with a misrepresentation of the value of the company to coax a small creditor faction into supporting its plan and opposing the bt plan.
confirmation proceedings on the competing plans of reorganization began in december.at the conclusion of the valuation phase of the proceedings,the bankruptcy court concluded that the bt committee plan could not be confirmed because it failed to prove the value of national gypsum as of the effective date of the plan of reorganization.the order confirming the national gypsum reorganization plan was entered on march,and was effective as of july.
an interested party may contest a bankruptcy confirmation order within days after its entry on the basis that it was procured by fraud.the period expired on september.no interested party requested that the order be set aside within the period or otherwise appealed the confirmation order.in october,new ngc announced a new plan that allegedly resulted in an annual reduction of expenses of to million dollars.
current litigation 
prostok,individually and on behalf of all other junior bondholders,filed the current case in state court in october against the former officers and directors of national gypsum officers and directors and their financial advisor,donaldson,lufkin jenrette securities corporation dlj prostok amended his petition to add one of the senior bondholders,tcw prostok sued for breach of fiduciary duties,fraud and constructive fraud,and civil conspiracy against all the defendants.prostok also brought claims against dlj and the officers and directors for gross negligence,and alternative claims against tcw and dlj for participating,aiding,assisting,inducing breach of fiduciary duties.
prostok alleges that during the course of the bankruptcy proceedings,the senior bondholders,the officers and directors,and their financial advisors intentionally undervalued national gypsum by concealing a plan to dramatically reduce the company operating expenses.specifically,prostok alleges that the officers and directors represented that national gypsum was worth to million,based on management best estimate and intention of how the company would operate once out of bankruptcy,though the officers and directors were fully aware of the plan later announced in october.prostok alleges that this plan resulted in an increase in the market value of new ngc outstanding stock from million to almost billion.according to prostok,had the officers and directors disclosed the plan to cut expenses to the bankruptcy court,the value assigned to national gypsum would have been higher,and the distribution to the junior bondholders would have been greater.prostok claims that as a result of the plan,the value in stock acquired by senior bondholders by reorganization far exceeded its initial value,resulting in a windfall for senior bondholders.prostok alleges that in exchange for their participation in concealing the plan,the officers and directors maintained their positions in new ngc and received lucrative incentive deals.
on november,the officers and directors and dlj the only defendants at the time removed the case to federal district court.the bankruptcy court remanded the case to state court for lack of federal jurisdiction.the federal district court affirmed the remand order.
on march,new ngc intervened in the action.new ngc asserted that under the terms of the reorganization plan,it owned the claims asserted by prostok,and thus prostok class lacked standing to raise the claims.new ngc sought a declaratory judgment to that effect 
on february,the officers and directors,dlj,new ngc,and tcw except the tcw group,joined in a motion for summary judgment asserting that texas law did not recognize prostok claims tcw except the tcw group,filed a separate supplemental motion for summary judgment against prostok,asserting statute of limitations,res judicata,collateral estoppel,and lack of a fiduciary duty 
on march,the trial court specifically denied tcw motion for summary judgment on limitations grounds but granted summary judgment in favor of the officers and directors,tcw,and new ngc without specifying grounds.on april,the trial court signed a final judgment and dismissed new ngc plea in intervention as moot.
prostok appealed the trial court final judgment.subsequently,dlj and several of the officers and directors settled their disputes with prostok and the class.accordingly,the court of appeals severed the claims between these parties and remanded them to the trial court to effectuate their settlements.thus,the remaining parties on appeal were prostok,the officers and directors tcw,and new ngc.
prostok complained on appeal that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on his claims against the officers and directors and tcw.the court of appeals held that none of the theories asserted by the officers and directors could support summary judgment.the court of appeals reversed the summary judgment granted in favor of the officers and directors against prostok.
tcw the trial court denial of its motion for summary judgment on statute of limitations grounds.the court of appeals held that tcw motion for summary judgment on statute of limitations grounds was meritorious.thus,the court of appeals effectively affirmed the trial court judgment in favor of tcw on different grounds than the trial court articulated in its judgment new ngc,complaining that the trial court erred in failing to consider and sustain new ngc standing argument as an alternative ground for dismissal the court of appeals reversed the trial court dismissal of new ngc intervention as to the surviving causes of action.the court of appeals remanded this ownership issue to the trial court as a challenge to capacity to sue,instead of as a standing issue as it was raised by new ngc.therefore,the court of appeals held that prostok take nothing from tcw because of statute of limitations but remanded all other pending claims to the trial court.
the officers and directors petitioned this court for review,arguing that the court of appeals erred in reversing summary judgment.specifically,they argue that summary judgment was proper because prostok claims are an impermissible collateral attack on the bankruptcy court final judgment texas law does not recognize the duty on which prostok claim relies prostok claims,which arise from alleged misconduct in prior litigation,are precluded under this court holding in trevino ortega,the court of appeals erred in reversing summary judgment on the ground that prostok could rely on federal bankruptcy law for the existence of a fiduciary duty in state court and summary judgment was proper on prostok conspiracy claim because it derives from prostok other alleged tort claims.
new ngc also petitioned this court for review arguing that the court of appeals erred in holding that its claim of ownership merely raised an issue of capacity to sue.new ngc argues that prostok lacks standing to bring claims for harm suffered by the estate.lastly,prostok petitions this court for review arguing that the court of appeals erred in holding that its claims against tcw were barred by limitations.
ii.standard of review 
in a summary judgment motion brought under texas rule of civil procedure c,the moving party has the burden of showing that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.provident life ins.knott.
the trial court order specifically rejected the motions based on statute of limitations but does not specify which of the remaining grounds asserted formed the basis of its summary judgment.thus,we may affirm the summary judgment if any of the theories presented to the trial court and preserved for appellate review are meritorious.id.at.
iii.finality of confirmation orders 
section of the united states bankruptcy code provides that upon proper request made within days of the entry of the confirmation order and after notice and a hearing,the bankruptcy court may revoke the order if and only if the order was procured by fraud.section provides the exclusive means for revoking a confirmation order.dale eckert orange tree assocs.in re orange tree assocs,cir quoting in re longardner,cir in re newport harbor,cir.any attempt to revoke a confirmation order after expiration of the limitations period is barred even if the alleged fraud is not discovered until then.in re orange tree,at see also farley coffee cupboard,in re coffee cupboard,the day time limit in section has been strictly enforced by the courts even to the extent of enforcing it in those cases where the alleged fraud of the debtor is not discovered until after the limitations period.citations omitted.
in accordance with these principles,the first circuit in newport harbor held that notwithstanding the court traditional equitable powers or powers conferred by federal rule of civil procedure b,a motion seeking to revoke an order confirming a chapter reorganization plan filed three years outside the applicable limitations period was filed too late.at.however,the first circuit also recognized that while the revocation provision provides the exclusive means for revoking a confirmation plan for fraud,it does not necessarily provide the exclusive remedy for debtors or creditors who have been injured by fraud.id.at applying the bankruptcy act predecessor to bankruptcy code section and stating,our opinion should not be read to suggest that the debtors or other creditors who may have been injured by fraud are necessarily without other remedies in other forums.the court recognized that the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel would not bar such an action,at least where the alleged fraud could not have been asserted in the bankruptcy proceedings,the underlying factual claims were not actually adjudicated,and the relief sought would not upset the confirmed plan of arrangement.id.emphasis added.
some federal courts have held that section is not the exclusive remedy for debtors or creditors subject to a fraudulently obtained confirmation order if an independent action may otherwise be maintained for the fraudulent conduct.see see also in re coffee cupboard,at section does not act as a bar to truly independent courses of action based on a debtor wrongful conduct.however,debtors and creditors may not attack confirmation orders by simply characterizing their attempt as an independent cause of action.in re coffee cupboard,at.the fifth circuit has also determined that even though an action has an independent purpose and contemplates some other relief,it is a collateral attack if it must in some fashion overrule a previous judgment.miller,cir.
an action is not truly independent when maintenance of the action would violate established finality doctrines or constitute an impermissible collateral attack on the confirmation order.see in re newport harbor,at recognizing that a subsequent action could be barred by res judicata and collateral estoppel.section provides a means,within a prescribed time limit,to revoke a confirmation order under limited circumstances.f m marquette bank emmer.in re emmer.a collateral attack brought outside section strict time limit represents nothing more than an impermissible attempt to enlarge the time limit.see id.at noting that the section time limit can not be enlarged,and later noting that if an action for fraud is construed as an attempt to revoke the confirmation order,then it is barred by the limitations period in section.an attempt to revoke a confirmation order in a separate proceeding is a collateral attack on the order.see id.holding that creditors complaint was not an attempt to revoke or otherwise collaterally attack the confirmation order that is subject to the limitations period of section.an action which,in effect,attempts to revoke a confirmation order is also a collateral attack.see miller,at i t is a collateral attack if it must in some fashion overrule a previous judgment.thus,if prostok claims constitute an impermissible collateral attack on the confirmation order,section of the bankruptcy code provides his exclusive remedy.we now turn to whether prostok claims constitute an impermissible collateral attack.
iv.collateral attack 
collateral attacks on final judgments are generally disallowed because it is the policy of the law to give finality to the judgments of the courts.tice city of pasadena,quoting crouch mcgaw.
t he mischief of retrying every case in which the judgment or decree rendered on false testimony,given by perjured witnesses,or on contracts or documents whose genuineness or validity was in issue,and which are afterwards ascertained to be forged or fraudulent,would be greater,by reason of the endless nature of the strife,than any compensation arising from doing justice in individual cases.
united states throckmorton.this policy of finality is especially important in a chapter bankruptcy,where the proceedings are intended to rehabilitate a business.a confirmation plan affects the rights of,and restructures the relationships between,the debtor and its creditors.in re newport harbor,at.if the rehabilitative purpose of chapter is to be realized,chapter proceedings must be concluded with reasonable expedition and finality so as to allow certainty for future business planning.see also kaufman pub.serv.in re pub.serv,cir t he willingness of future claimants and creditors to compromise in chapter proceedings depends on giving the reorganization court approval a due measure of finality.christopher am.universal ins.group in re christopher,a strong policy favors enforcement of the plan of reorganization because too many rights of too many interests have relied on the finality of the confirmation order.a collateral attack runs counter to this strong policy of finality because a collateral attack attempts to bypass the appellate process in challenging the integrity of a judgment.
a collateral attack is an attempt to avoid the binding force of a judgment in a proceeding not instituted for the purpose of correcting,modifying,or vacating the judgment,but in order to obtain some specific relief which the judgment currently stands as a bar against.crawford mcdonald,see also biaza simon,dist,writ denied citing crawford,at.only a void judgment may be collaterally attacked.browning placke.a judgment is void only when it is apparent that the court rendering judgment had no jurisdiction of the parties or property,no jurisdiction of the subject matter,no jurisdiction to enter the particular judgment,or no capacity to act.id.citing austin indep.sch.dist.sierra club.a confirmation order issued by a bankruptcy court has the effect of a judgment rendered by a district court.miller,at in re emmer,at.prostok does not argue that the bankruptcy order was void therefore,any collateral attack is improper.
the heart of prostok complaint is that the alleged misconduct of the officers and directors and tcw during the bankruptcy proceedings resulted in the bankruptcy court undervaluation of national gypsum.in turn,he argues,the junior bondholders received less than what they would have received had the estate been properly valued.to calculate the damages incurred by prostok and the junior bondholders he represents,a court would need to determine not only how much larger the bankruptcy estate would have been but for the defendants conduct,but also what percentage of the estate each class of creditors would have been entitled to if the bankruptcy court had considered the larger estate.thus,while prostok action contemplates relief other than revoking the confirmation order,it necessarily challenges the integrity of the order and results in a review,perhaps a recalculation,of the bankruptcy determinations of the assets to which some claimants are entitled.see miller,at holding an unsecured creditor suit against a secured creditor for fraudulent misrepresentation at a creditors meeting constituted a collateral attack on the confirmation order mitchell village creek drainage,cir state law defining collateral attack generally as a separate proceeding in which the integrity of the judgment is challenged even if brought with some independent purpose in re french gardens,though an action may have an independent purpose and may contemplate some other relief,it is a collateral attack if it must in effect overrule a previous judgment.the success of prostok state court suit necessarily turns upon what the judgment of the bankruptcy court should have been.see miller,at.
the court of appeals held that prostok claims do not collaterally attack the confirmation order because they are based on conduct extrinsic to the confirmation order.this court has held that when a party does not seek to set aside a prior judgment,but instead brings suit based on extrinsic fraud,the action is not a collateral attack.state durham,recognizing,in a suit brought by the state for fraud in obtaining court approval for an oil and gas lease,that the state had not sought to set aside the judgment but had alleged fraud extrinsic to the judgment,and invoke d the equity powers of the court to impose a constructive trust spera fleming,hovenkamp grayson,dist,no pet.holding that extrinsic conduct that formed the basis of claims for attorney malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty were not a collateral attack on trial court order apportioning attorneys fees.in contrast,the underlying issues resolved by a judgment are considered intrinsic.see king ranch,chapman,issues underlying the judgment attacked by a bill of review are intrinsic and thus have no probative value on the fraud necessary to support a bill of review.an attack on a final judgment,otherwise constituting a collateral attack,can not be maintained on grounds that the judgment was obtained through fraudulent conduct intrinsic to the judgment.see neill neill,writ dism neither a collateral nor a direct attack upon a prior judgment can be based upon intrinsic fraud.
extrinsic fraud is fraud that denies a losing party the opportunity to fully litigate at trial all the rights or defenses that could have been asserted.montgomery kennedy,citing alexander hagedorn.it generally includes wrongful conduct occurring outside of the adversarial proceedings.see hagedorn,at citing phillips petroleum jenkins,cir.the fraud must be collateral to the matter tried and not something which was actually or potentially in issue.montgomery,at.for example,a fiduciary concealment of material facts to induce an agreed or uncontested judgment,which prevents a party from presenting his legal rights at trial,is extrinsic fraud.id.at.
intrinsic fraud,by contrast,relates to the merits of the issues that were presented and presumably were or should have been settled in the former action.tice,at.intrinsic fraud includes fraudulent instruments,perjured testimony,or any matter which was actually presented to and considered by the trial court in rendering judgment.see also montgomery,at it is particularly that the alleged perjury of a witness on a contested issue,which the opposing party had the opportunity to refute,is intrinsic fraud.allegations that a plaintiff conspired to suborn perjury is an allegation of intrinsic fraud.tice,at.in addition,when the fraudulent acts themselves are in issue,or could have been in issue,in the prior proceeding,the fraud is intrinsic.montgomery,at citing mills baird,writ ref.this court has noted that while concealment of a material fact by a fiduciary charged with the duty of full disclosure generally is extrinsic fraud,where the alleged specific fraudulent acts were known and in issue in the prior suit,the fraud is intrinsic.id.at.similarly,the first circuit affirmed a bankruptcy court injunction barring a civil action for fraud occurring in chapter proceedings b ecause the alleged inaccuracies could have been,and in part were,litigated in the bankruptcy court.in re pub.serv,at.
the distinction between extrin
