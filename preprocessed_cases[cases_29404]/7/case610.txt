in this case,a chapter bankruptcy trustee,timothy branigan the trustee,challenges confirmation orders,entered by the bankruptcy court and affirmed by the district court,stripping off junior liens against debtors residences.the trustee argues that the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of bapcpa creates a per se rule barring in chapter cases bapcpa,however,does not bar the orders entered by the bankruptcy court,and the stripping off of valueless liens that is a lien secured by collateral without a single penny of value to support it is otherwise consistent with the bankruptcy code.we therefore affirm.
we begin with a general overview of the relevant statutory framework,and then summarize the procedural history of the appeals.
chapter of the bankruptcy code governs liquidation of a bankruptcy estate and offer s debtors limited relief in return for the relinquishment of their nonexempt assets for ratable distribution among creditors.collier on bankruptcy ed.for an individual debtor,this process involves the collection,liquidation,and distribution of nonexempt property.see id.the process culminates in a discharge,which eliminates personal liability for debts not excepted from discharge,but leaves intact in rem claims.johnson home state bank,d.in addition,the discharge serves as an injunction against efforts to collect discharged debts,unless the debtor has reaffirmed them.see collier on bankruptcy.
chapter of the bankruptcy code,adjustment of debts of an individual with regular income,on the other hand,is primarily focused on a plan of reorganization rather than liquidation.unlike chapter,chapter permits the debtor to deal comprehensively with both unsecured and secured debts,particularly large secured claims.id.in a chapter case,a debtor may propose a plan for paying creditors primarily out of the debtor income.thus,creditors receive ratable recoveries from future income,a protection not available to creditors in liquidation proceedings.the chapter plan can provide for the payment of secured claims to permit the debtor to retain collateral for those claims and may provide for the cure of arrearages on debts,such as home mortgages.id.in addition,a chapter discharge excepts fewer types of debt than a chapter discharge.id.
congress enacted bapcpa in to correct perceived abuses of the bankruptcy system.milavetz,gallop milavetz,united states,d.an overarching goal was to help ensure that debtors who can pay creditors do pay them.ransom fia card,d.to that end,bapcpa altered the chapter regime by adding 
new requirements to make payments to holders of domestic support obligations,requirements to file prepetition tax returns,changes in maximum plan length,protection for pension contributions and pension loan repayments,requirements for scheduling of the confirmation hearing,requirements for greater payments on many secured debts,new methods of calculating disposable income under section b,new requirements for preconfirmation payments,new requirements to obtain a discharge,including postpetition credit education in addition to the prepetition credit counseling briefing required for all debtors,new exceptions to the chapter discharge,new limits on obtaining a chapter discharge after a prior bankruptcy discharge and new provisions permitting plan modification to obtain health insurance.
collier on bankruptcy footnotes omitted.relevant to this appeal,bapcpa provides additional protection for secured creditors.for example,creditors retain allowed secured claims until either payment of the underlying debt pursuant to nonbankruptcy law or discharge.moreover,if a chapter case is dismissed or converted without completion of the bankruptcy plan,the holder of an allowed secured claim retains the lien to the extent recognized by applicable nonbankruptcy law.see a b.
bapcpa further provides that a debtor may not receive a chapter discharge within four years of filing a chapter petition that results in a discharge.f.despite the discharge limitations imposed by bapcpa,a chapter debtor may still wish to seek later relief under chapter in order to cure a default through a plan,or simply to seek protection of the bankruptcy court and the automatic stay while paying debts in an orderly fashion through a plan.collier on bankruptcy.
on june,bryan matthew davis and carla denise bracey davis filed a chapter bankruptcy petition with the united states bankruptcy court for the district of maryland.at the time,they ran a large monthly deficit,and bracey davis was unemployed.the davises sought to discharge their unsecured debt,strip liens on their primary residence and a rental property,and obtain a loan modification to address mortgage arrears on the properties.after learning that was prohibited under chapter,they nevertheless chose to proceed with their chapter case because they were ineligible to convert to a chapter case.they hoped,however,that their mortgage lenders would approve their pending loan modification applications.on september,they received a chapter discharge,which absolved them of personal liability on nonexempt debts but left their mortgage debt unchanged.
thereafter,the davises obtained gainful employment.they still had no savings,however,and large mortgage arrears,which they could not bring current,accrued.on september,they filed a chapter petition to reorganize their debts,repay mortgage arrears and consumer debt,and strip off junior liens.at the time,their principal home was valued at,and was encumbered by a lien with a balance of,a lien with a balance of,and a lien with a balance of.
on march,bankruptcy judge wendelin lipp granted the davises amended motion to avoid lien,which sought to strip off the lien on the davises home upon completion of the chapter plan.judge lipp reasoned that bapcpa did not create a per se rule against in the chapter context.the court proceeded to consider,as it always does in any chapter case,whether the debtors filed their petition in good faith.finding that the davises had acted in good faith,judge lipp entered an order stripping off the lien on the davises home.judge lipp subsequently entered orders stripping off the second and third liens on the davises rental property and confirming the davises bankruptcy plan.both the trustee and the holder of the lien against the davises home,td bank,appealed to the district court,which affirmed.
marquita moore filed a chapter petition on february,for which she received a discharge on october.one week later,moore filed a chapter petition.moore sought to pay an internal revenue service priority claim and strip off a second lien,which had no value,on her principal home.the trustee never contended that moore filed her chapter petition in bad faith.on january,the bankruptcy court granted moore motion to strip off the second lien.subsequently,the bankruptcy court confirmed moore plan and adopted judge lipp rationale to overrule the trustee objection to the component of the confirmation order.the trustee appealed,and the district court affirmed 
we have jurisdiction to consider these appeals under d.
the question presented is whether bapcpa precludes the stripping off of valueless liens by chapter debtors ineligible for a discharge.in a bankruptcy appeal,we review the district court decision de novo,effectively standing in its shoes to consider directly the findings of fact and conclusions of law by the bankruptcy court.morris quigley in re quigley,cir internal quotations omitted.w e review legal conclusions by the bankruptcy court de novo and may overturn its factual determinations only upon a showing of clear error.id.internal quotations omitted.
before reaching the issue raised by the trustee,we consider the threshold question of whether a bankruptcy court may strip off a valueless lien in a typical chapter proceeding.the answer,in the view of those circuits to have considered the question,is that a bankruptcy court may grant such relief.see zimmer psb lending in re zimmer,cir lane interstate bancorp in re lane,cir pond farm specialist realty in re pond,cir tanner firstplus fin.in re tanner,cir bartee tara colony homeowners ass in re bartee,cir mcdonald master fin.in re mcdonald,cir.we too have affirmed,albeit in unpublished opinions,the stripping off of valueless liens against principal residences in chapter cases.see first mariner bank johnson in re johnson,app x cir suntrust bank millard in re millard,app x cir.
to exercise this authority,bankruptcy courts rely on sections and b of the bankruptcy code first,courts apply the valuation procedure in section a 
an allowed claim of a creditor secured by a lien on property in which the estate has an interest is a secured claim to the extent of the value of such creditor interest in the estate interest in such property and is an unsecured claim to the extent that the value of such creditor interest is less than the amount of such allowed claim.
in other words,a claim status as secured or unsecured depends on the value of the collateral.next,courts look to section b,which provides that,subject to certain exceptions not relevant here,a chapter bankruptcy plan may 
modify the rights of holders of secured claims,other than a claim secured only by a security interest in real property that is the debtor principal residence,or of holders of unsecured claims,or leave unaffected the rights of holders of any class of claims.
applying this framework,a completely valueless lien is classified as an unsecured claim under section a.only then does a bankruptcy court consider the rights of lienholders under section,which affords protection to holders of secured claims against principal residences.section,however,expressly permits modification of the rights of unsecured creditors.the end result is that section a,which classifies valueless liens as unsecured claims,operates with section b to permit a bankruptcy court,in a chapter case,to strip off a lien against a primary residence with no value.see,zimmer,at lane,at.
we recognize that the supreme court has interpreted section b as precluding a strip down of a partially secured lien against a principal residence in chapter.that is,a debtor may not reduce an underwater mortgage to the value of the principal residence because partially secured are holders of secured claims protected against lien modification.nobelman am.sav.bank,d.nobelman notwithstanding,however,courts have generally permitted a strip off of completely valueless liens in chapter cases because,unlike the lienholder in nobelman,holders of such liens are not holders of secured claims and,therefore,are not entitled to the protection of section b.
we see no reason to depart from the conclusion of our sister circuits,as well as our own unpublished dispositions,on this issue.accordingly,we hold that the bankruptcy code permits the stripping off of valueless liens in chapter proceedings.
we are left with the question raised in this appeal whether the enactment of bapcpa precludes the stripping off of valueless liens by chapter debtors.
under bapcpa,after filing for chapter relief and receiving a discharge,a debtor is ineligible for a discharge in a chapter proceeding for four years.f.as previously noted,following a chapter discharge,creditors may not seek a personal judgment against the debtor but may pursue recovery against the property securing the debt.
notwithstanding the bar on discharges imposed by bapcpa,we have held that a debtor may still take advantage of the protections offered by chapter short of a discharge.see branigan bateman in re bateman,cir.in doing so,we said that it is the ability to reorganize one financial life and pay off debts,not the ability to receive a discharge,that is the debtor holy grail.id.we recognized that a debtor might pursue this course to cure a mortgage,deal with other secured debts,or simply pay debts under a plan with the protection of the automatic stay.id.internal quotations omitted.
bankruptcy courts are split on whether a debtor may strip off liens in a chapter case.compare in re fisette,bap cir concluding a chapter debtor may strip off liens,and in re dang,same,and in re okosisi,same,and in re tran,same,with in re gerardin,holding that chapter debtors could not permanently strip off wholly unsecured junior liens,and in re victorio,same,and in re fenn,same,and in re jarvis,same.
the trustee contends that is contingent on a debtor ability to receive a chapter discharge.in support of this proposition,the trustee points first to section a b i i of the bankruptcy code,which provides that a holder of a secured lien retains the lien until either the underlying debt is paid or there is a discharge.because the debtors here are not eligible for a discharge,the trustee contends that the liens must survive until paid in full.next,the trustee relies on section a b i ii which reinstates liens if the case is dismissed or converted without completion of the plan for the proposition that congress intended to preserve liens absent a discharge.see also b c providing that any lien stripped under section d is reinstated upon dismissal,f c i providing that a creditor holding security shall continue to be secured by that security unless the claims have been paid in full as of the date of conversion,notwithstanding any valuation.finally,the trustee contends that,under section,a discharge operates as an injunction against any action to enforce a debt.absent this injunction,which is precluded in the chapter context by section f,the trustee says there is no mechanism to enforce the stripping off of a lien.
the trustee also urges that supreme court precedent reinforces his statutory argument.specifically,the trustee directs our attention to dewsnup timm,d,where,says the trustee,petitioners were not allowed,in a chapter case,to strip down junior liens on claims that had been fully allowed pursuant to section,despite the fact that there was no equity in the collateral.
in dewsnup,the court considered whether section d providing that t o the extent that a lien secures a claim against the debtor that is not an allowed secured claim,such lien is void permits a chapter debtor to strip down a creditor lien to the value of the collateral.see at.the court held that d does not allow petitioner to strip down a creditor lien,because the creditor claim is secured by a lien and has been fully allowed.id.at.the court noted that section and its relationship to other provisions of the bankruptcy code do embrace some ambiguities.id.at.given that ambiguity,the court declined to give allowed secured claim the same meaning in section d as in section a and concluded that section by itself is insufficient to effectuate.
the trustee contends that the debtors are attempting an end run around dewsnup prohibition of chapter and that construing sections a and f to bar by chapter debtors is consistent with bapcpa goal of rebalancing the scales in favor of creditors.
the debtors respond that because bapcpa left intact the operative provisions of the code,congress did not intend to alter the ability of bankruptcy courts to enter orders in chapter cases.and this is so regardless of the availability of a discharge.a discharge,the debtors say,extinguishes only in personam liability.see johnson,at a bankruptcy discharge extinguishes only one mode of enforcing a,an action against the debtor in personam while leaving intact,an action against the debtor in rem.because the debtors here have already discharged their in personam liability in the prior chapter proceedings,they have no need for a discharge with respect to the liens.the debtors also say that once the bankruptcy court has entered an order stripping off liens,no provision of the bankruptcy code reinstates the liens once the plan is completed and the case closed.thus,the provisions of the plan become permanent upon completion of the plan,and a order is,similarly,permanent.okosisi,at.
the debtors also contend that the provisions relied on by the trustee are inapplicable.specifically,section a,which provides generally for the treatment of allowed secured claims,comes into play only after the claims have been valued under section a,and is therefore irrelevant to the unsecured claims at issue here.similarly,the debtors say that the trustee improperly relies on other provisions of the code that apply when a case is dismissed or con
