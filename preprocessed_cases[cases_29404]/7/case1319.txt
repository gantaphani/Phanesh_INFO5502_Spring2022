the united states department of education,pennsylvania higher education assistance agency,and educational credit management corporation appeal from the district court affirmance of the bankruptcy court order,which held that laura susan reynolds student loans were discharged in bankruptcy.the creditors contend that the bankruptcy court erred in discharging the debts on the ground of undue hardship when that court had previously found that reynolds had the financial resources to pay some portion of the student loans.reynolds contends that undue hardship is not a strictly pecuniary test and that the bankruptcy court correctly held that the detrimental effect of the loans on reynolds precarious mental health warranted discharging the debts.we affirm.
reynolds began suffering from depressive symptoms as early as middle school and high school,but did not receive treatment or diagnosis at that time.during her junior year at claremont mckenna college,she suffered a mental health crisis while traveling in scotland and had to drop out of a study abroad program on arriving home,she was treated by a psychiatrist for agoraphobia and depression.she received counseling,and,despite a continuing struggle with depression and panic attacks,she was able to make up the missed coursework and to graduate cum laude in.she went on to attend the university of michigan law school,where her depression worsened,but she nevertheless graduated in,in the middle of her class.she passed the colorado bar exam and was admitted to practice law in that state.
she undertook an extensive search for a job as a lawyer,participating in interviews,sending out more than resumes,contacting michigan alumni,and eventually using a legal employment consultant.unfortunately,she was never able to find any work as an attorney,other than two hours work for a friend of her father.she finally began taking temporary assignments through an employment agency,working as a secretary or administrative assistant.in october,she took a permanent job as an administrative assistant at the paul foundation,where she worked until the spring of.she left that job,but began another permanent job as at a roofing contractor,where she still works,earning about per year.she is married,and her husband makes about per year driving a school bus.
after leaving school,reynolds began payments on the loans,but she was only able to make the payments by paying for everything else with credit cards.eventually,she stopped making payments.
since graduating from law school,reynolds has seen a number of mental health professionals and has taken a number of medications,such as,and medications.in august,she was diagnosed with major depressive illness and chronic dysthymic disorder,which is a depression that does not meet the full criteria for major depressive illness.she also suffers from anxiety and panic disorders.in addition to the anxiety,panic attacks and depression,reynolds has a persistent personality disorder.her psychiatric expert,robert jones,reported that the combination of major depression and personality dysfunction often present with the personality disorder being more dysfunctional than would actually be the case if adaptation were not impaired by the affective disorder.her medications reduce her symptoms,but their effectiveness tends to wane the longer she takes them.jones opined that no regimen of medication has been able to bring about a sustained partial remission of her mental illness.reynolds said that at the time of trial she habitually slept at least ten hours a night during the week and sixteen hours a night on weekends,and she testified that she engaged in,such as cutting herself.reynolds suffers side effects from her various medications,including numbness in her extremities,drowsiness,distraction,and itching.
jones testified that reynolds student loans caused her stress,and that stress can make it more difficult for an individual to respond to treatment for a mood disorder.he stated,to the extent that she is overwhelmed by indebtedness and ca see the possibilities of her life beyond that indebtedness,the debts made it harder for her to sustain improvement in her depressive illness.reynolds herself testified that her inability to pay the loans made her feel like a failure and hopeless and ashamed.
jones opined that reynolds was not able to practice law because she would not be able to provide interpersonal consultative services due to personality characteristics and because of the cognitive deficits associated with intermittent exacerbations of depressive illness.although reynolds could be expected to suffer exacerbations of her depression,she ought to be able to function in a job setting similar to that of her most recent jobs.but he concluded,despite her capacity to return to employment,the inconsistencies in her performance as a result of both depressive illness and characterologic instability,may present challenges to employers who rely on consistency at the level of teamwork and work group membership.
reynolds owed outstanding student loans to five creditors amounting to more than in march.if amortized over ten years,the monthly payments would be,and if amortized over twenty years.two of the creditors,hemar insurance corporation of america and the educational resource institute,did not appeal from the discharge order,so reynolds is no longer responsible for those debts,which would account for of her monthly liability under a payment plan or under a plan.the debts to the three remaining creditors are eligible for consolidation under the william ford direct loan program,which would allow reynolds to pay the loans over a period,beginning with an initial monthly payment amount of.
reynolds and her husband combined monthly income was about,and the bankruptcy court found their household expenses were,at,although as we will discuss later,both sides dispute those figures.
reynolds filed a voluntary bankruptcy petition under chapter on june.she initiated an adversary proceeding for a determination of dischargeability of the student loans under a under section a,a discharge in bankruptcy does not discharge a debtor for an educational loan made,insured or guaranteed by a governmental unit,or made under any program funded in whole or in part by a governmental unit or nonprofit institution,unless excepting such debt from discharge will impose an undue hardship on the debtor.the bankruptcy court therefore was required to determine whether exempting the student loans from reynolds discharge in bankruptcy would impose an undue hardship on her.
the bankruptcy court applied the totality of the circumstances test this court set out for determining undue hardship in in re long,cir.reynolds.higher educ.assistance agency.under that test,the court considers the debtor past,present and future financial resources,the debtor reasonable and necessary living expenses,and any other relevant circumstances.see long,at.the bankruptcy court observed that the burden of proving undue hardship lay with reynolds.id.at.
to determine probable financial resources,the bankruptcy court examined the medical evidence and found that there was no prospect that reynolds condition would improve to such an extent that she could practice law or even work as a paralegal id.at.the court found that the best reynolds could do was to remain in the type of job she currently holds,if indeed she is able to perform that job without lapsing into depression or engaging in behavioral incidents connected with her personality disorder,which would be likely to cause her to lose her job or quit.id.therefore,the court used reynolds current income and expense figures to decide whether reynolds could pay any or all of the debts without undue hardship.id.at.the court figured that reynolds and her husband had per month of income in excess of their expenses.id.the bankruptcy court stated 
in the last instance,the debtor did not establish,as a matter of fact,that she lacked all means to pay down all of the component loans in her educational debt structure.
so this proceeding presents a debtor who has some repayment ability in fact,which could be applied to a portion of the referent debt.
however,the bankruptcy court found that there was an important countervailing the existence of the debts was injurious to reynolds fragile mental health.
here,the debtor has been most accurately diagnosed as suffering from m ajor depressive episode,recurrent,severe,p anic disorder with history of agoraphobia,and p ersonality disorder with borderline,histrionic,and narcissistic features,including some evidence of dissociation under stress.she has been professionally recognized as subject to p sychosocial stressors related to problems with,inter alia,economic problems and problems related to the interaction with the legal system.her notabl e distress with regard to her financial obligations,previous bankruptcy experience,and the continuing struggle to remain solvent in the face of her experience of overwhelming indebtedness was recognized on evaluation as a major stressor.her depression,panic attacks,and brief suicidal thoughts and dissociative episodes continued during the pendency of this litigation despite the fact that she was taking concerted action to try to cope with this problem.
at.the bankruptcy court concluded that 
it is a matter of inference,but one that has ample support in the record the extraction of her liability from her financial picture would lessen her overall stress level,mitigate her distractability,and significantly reduce the chances of recurring depression and decompensation.on the other hand,there is really no doubt that preserving the debtor liability for even a portion of her education loan burden would impose a hardship on her and,as it must be said,under the totality of her circumstances,the hardship would be undue.
id.at.the court acknowledged that subordinating financial circumstances to ones under andrews student loan assistance,cir should be reserved only for the extraordinary case,one where the potential of hardship is manifest,palpable,and of great magnitude.this is one such.id.at.accordingly,the bankruptcy court held that the debts were discharged.id.
all five student loan creditors appealed to the district court.the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court holding that the deleterious effect of the debts on reynolds mental health could establish undue hardship notwithstanding her financial ability to pay some portion of the debts.united states dep t of educ.reynolds,wl,adm,slip op.at.the court further held that the bankruptcy court findings of fact concerning reynolds inability to increase her income and concerning her household income and expenses were not clearly erroneous,slip op.at,wl.the district court therefore affirmed the holding of dischargeability.
three of the five creditors,the united states department of education,the pennsylvania higher education assistance agency,and the education credit management corporation,have appealed to this court.
in a bankruptcy appeal,this court sits as a second court of review we therefore apply the same standards of review to the bankruptcy court decision as the district court does.in re mba poultry,cir.we review the bankruptcy court findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.id.the question of whether declining to discharge the debts would pose an undue hardship to reynolds is a question of law,which we review de novo.in re long,cir.subsidiary findings of fact on which the legal conclusion is based are reviewed for clear error.see id.undue hardship determination requires a conclusion regarding the legal effect of the bankruptcy court findings as to the debtor circumstances.student assistance hornsby,cir factual findings underlying undue hardship determination will not be set aside unless clearly erroneous.
a specifies that student loans will not be discharged unless failure to discharge would work an undue hardship on the debtor or the debtor dependents,but the statute does not define the term.in we interpreted undue hardship to require examination of the totality of circumstances,quoting in re wegfehrt,
e ach bankruptcy case involving a student loan must be examined on the facts and circumstances surrounding that particular bankruptcy for the court to make a determination of undue hardship.the bankruptcy court must determine whether there would be anything left from the debtor estimated future income to enable the debtor to make some payment on student loan without reducing what the debtor and dependents need to maintain a minimal standard of living.
andrews student loan assistance,cir.after andrews was decided,the second circuit adopted a different test in brunner state higher educ.serv,cir,a sequential analysis which has attracted a wide following.see educ.credit mgmt.polleys,cir collecting cases.however,in long we rejected the brunner test and reaffirmed our reliance on the andrews totality of the circumstances test.at.we explained,
we prefer a less restrictive approach to the undue hardship inquiry.see andrews,at.we are convinced that requiring our bankruptcy courts to adhere to the strict parameters of a particular test would diminish the inherent discretion contained in a b.therefore,we we first did in embrace a approach to the undue hardship inquiry.we believe that fairness and equity require each undue hardship case to be examined on the unique facts and circumstances that surround the particular bankruptcy.
we then summarized the totality of circumstances test as applied in this circuit 
in evaluating the,our bankruptcy reviewing courts should consider the debtor past,present,and reasonably reliable future financial resources a calculation of the debtor and her dependent reasonable necessary living expenses and any other relevant facts and circumstances surrounding each particular bankruptcy case.simply put,if the debtor reasonable future financial resources will sufficiently cover payment of the student loan still allowing for a minimal standard of the debt should not be discharged.certainly,this determination will require a special consideration of the debtor present employment and financial assets,expenses,and with the prospect of future or the debtor financial position.
id.at citations omitted.
the creditors argue that if the debtor has the economic ability to repay the debt,this fact ends the inquiry as to undue hardship,and the bankruptcy court had no further warrant to consider the effect of the continuing student loan liability on reynolds health.the creditors base their argument on one passage from long simply put,if the debtor reasonable future financial resources will sufficiently cover payment of the student loan still allowing for a minimal standard of the debt should not be discharged.at.
we are of the thought that the creditors read this language too narrowly.in long,we reaffirmed our adherence to the totality of circumstances analysis,and we did so particularly in order to preserve the inherent discretion we found in the statutory language and to safeguard the flexibility to be able to respond appropriately to unique facts and circumstances.id.at.to espouse the creditors proposed interpretation,we would have to ignore the in many cases a debtor health and financial position are inextricably intertwined.this reality was discussed at length in andrews,at,where the court expressly stated that the bankruptcy court had properly considered the debtor disease as a factor in determination of undue hardship.as recognized in andrews,illness often affects both a debtor ability to earn and her expenses in such cases,factors affecting the debtor health also have a financial significance.where the evidence shows that financial obligations are likely to undermine a debtor health,which in turn will affect the debtor financial outlook,we think it entirely consistent with andrews and long to take such facts and circumstances into account.we will not adopt an interpretation of undue hardship that causes the courts to shut their eyes to factors that may lead to disaster,both personal and financial,for a suffering debtor.
here,in findings that are not clearly erroneous,the bankruptcy court found that the continuing liability from the debts would pose a threat to reynolds fragile mental health.at.although reynolds may be performing adequately at her current job and may therefore have some disposable income available to dedicate to the debts,the bankruptcy court found that she was at risk for recurrence of symptoms that would cause voluntary or involuntary termination of that employment.id.at.the court found the mere existence of this debt burden clearly is a significant block to the debtor recovery from mental illness.id.at.conversely,eliminating the debt would mitigate her symptoms and reduce the possibility of recurring depression and decompensation.id.at.these conclusions are inferences by the record evidence of reynolds condition.
another compelling reason for affirming the order of the bankruptcy court is the diagnosis articulated by both the doctors.jones stated that reynolds diagnostic evaluation included major depressive episode,recurrent,dysthymia,and as we have observed before,he stated that there has been no sustained partial remission of her illness.gratzer stated that the diagnostic impression,axis i,was major depressive disorder,recurrent,in near full remission,and dysthymia.
we evaluate reynolds condition in light of long requirement that determination of undue hardship requires consideration of reasonably reliable future financial resources and any other relevant facts and circumstances surrounding each case and must include the prospect of future or debtor financial position.at.we take this together with andrews statement,serious illness all too often requires extensive treatment and medication.serious illness may affect an individual ability to work.at.the diagnosis of the doctors gives further compelling reason to affirm the order of the district court.a condition that is recurrent by its very terms is one that will occur again.see dorland illustrated medical dictionary ed recurrent means returning after remissions.a remission is an abatement of the symptoms of a disease.id.at.thus,the issue stressed by the bankruptcy court with reference to the stressors affecting reynolds must also be considered with the recurring nature of her illness and the impact on not only her future health,but her future financial situation 
we therefore see no error in the bankruptcy court holding that excepting the student loans from the discharge would cause an undue hardship to reynolds because of the effect of the debts on reynolds mental health.
two of the creditors,the pennsylvania higher education assistance agency and the educational credit management corporation contend that the bankruptcy court erred in its factual findings concerning the details of reynolds household expenses and in determining reynolds earning potential.a related issue,not briefed by the parties until after it surfaced at oral argument,was whether the bankruptcy court should have included reynolds husband income as if it were her own,even though the husband is not a debtor in bankruptcy.because the bankruptcy court holding was not ultimately based on financial details of whether reynolds could afford monthly payments,we conclude that the resolution of these arguments would not affect our holding,and we therefore need not reach them.
the pennsylvania higher education assistance agency has moved to strike portions of reynolds brief and appendix that rely on her deposition testimony.the challenged testimony is substantially reiterated in reynolds trial testimony,and so no part of our holding relies on the challenged testimony.we therefore dismiss the motion as moot.
we affirm the district court order in turn affirming the judgment of the bankruptcy court.
i join in judge john gibson opinion affirming the judgment in this case.i add another dimension to the reasons for the determinations of the bankruptcy court and the district court on appeal discharging the student loans for undue hardship.
the dissent asserts the debtor has sufficient surplus per month to pay her student loans per month on an extended repayment plan.infra at.that analysis is incorrect based on the record in this case,which is the record before the bankruptcy court and the district court 
the total loans prior to this appeal amounted to in march.the debtor owed her five student lenders either per month over ten years,per month over twenty years,per month for the first ten years of a plan two of the lenders do not participate in the ford loan program,thus not allowing for a repayment period,or per month for the first twenty years of a plan.however the loan obligations are added,the per month in disposable income that the bankruptcy court allocated to reynolds and her husband does not sufficiently cover any of these payments.
moreover,the per month surplus results from combined compensation of both reynolds and her husband john turner minus family living expenses.the record shows in a rough way that each contributed about equally to the family income and each incurred about equally to the family living expenses.
the appellants here would apply all of the surplus to the debtor educational debts.yet,these debts were incurred prior to reynolds marriage.the appellants and the dissent give no consideration to turner interests.turner is not a party to these proceedings,and there is no showing that he assumed to pay his wife loans.attributing the entire surplus of to the debtor loans requires turner to pay for loans on which he is not obligated.
there is no warrant for such treatment of turner.equitably speaking,turner should be entitled to approximately half of the surplus to put to his use to educate his children,to save for the future,or for any other reason.that is,the part of the surplus remaining after contribution to the basic household expenses and attributable to his income.thus,in fact,under this record only about of the surplus remains in the household budget that could be attributed to the debtor income.
this analysis is supported by the following cases in re innes,t he bankruptcy court correctly considered all of the spouse disposable income and applied the proportionate share of her income to the family essential or basic living expenses.to require her to do more would essentially force her or her children to pay debts for which she is not liable and support the debtor husband while being denied the right to apply some of her income to reasonable items,such as the children education,and a modest retirement fund.in re berndt,holding,in a chapter consumer debt case,t he spouse income is not rendered liable for the debts of the debtor but rather is simply considered in determining whether the debtor himself has available discretionary income by virtue of the fact that he and the spouse share a joint household.
the strongest case in support of the creditors view is in re white,where the court combined the spouse and debtor incomes and then deducted household expenses to determine if a surplus existed.however,white is distinguishable because the debtor in that case attempted to avoid paying student loan debt by contributing toward household expenses far in excess of a minimal standard of living.see id.at.this case is also distinguishable from the context where a debtor chooses not to work to her earning capacity then seeks to discharge her student loans for lack of income.in re murphy,see in re oyler,cir choosing a job can not merit undue hardship relief.
while it is true that the income and expenses of husband and wife are combined for the purpose of examining a household finances,it does not seem proper,in the circumstances where the debtor and spouse have contributed about equally to the family income and expenses,to attribute the entire surplus to the debtor in favor of the debtor creditors 
there is no showing that applying the per month surplus,attributable to the debtor income,would reduce or retire the loans,considering interest growth on the debt.additionally,given the nature of the debtor illness,the per month cushion for various aspects of her medical condition,infra at,does not allow her a realistic reserve for possible deterioration of her health condition.
this court precedents allow a bankruptcy court,when determining whether declining to discharge a student loan constitutes an undue
