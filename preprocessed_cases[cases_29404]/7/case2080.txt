appellant holly boyer appeals from a judgment in favor of respondents russell jensen and his employer valley mechanical services,valley mechanical on her for injuries arising out of an automobile accident.valley mechanical was dismissed on statute of limitations grounds and jensen was dismissed because he had been discharged in bankruptcy.we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
this case derives from a motor vehicle accident that occurred in october.the drivers involved were appellant and jensen.jensen was employed by valley mechanical at the time.
on september,just short of one year after the accident occurred,jensen brought suit against boyer,alleging that her negligence caused the accident.approximately five months later,on february,appellant against jensen,accusing him of negligence.there was no reference in the to jensen acting as anyone agent or in the course and scope of his employment.during discovery,appellant obtained information that indicated jensen,who was driving his own car,may have been engaged in travel when the accident occurred.on august,appellant amended her to add valley mechanical as doe.valley mechanical answered and raised the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense.
the case was proceeding towards trial when,in march,jensen filed for bankruptcy protection and obtained an automatic stay.the bankruptcy court issued a discharge,and in late,he filed a motion to dismiss the underlying litigation due to bankruptcy discharge.his motion,supported by a declaration and exhibits,contended appellant had never petitioned the bankruptcy court for relief from stay and that jensen entire insurance policy had been tendered to and accepted by appellant in exchange for a covenant not to execute against jensen insurance company,penn american.
in the letter discussing payment from penn american,counsel for jensen and appellant a cknowledged and agreed t his does not,in any way,limit or otherwise impair appellant right to prosecute her claims,to secure a judgment in this case,to pursue satisfaction of that judgment from jensen employers any insurers other than penn american.in an earlier letter,counsel for appellant had said as authorized and explained in forsyth jones th,d,jensen name will remain in the case in order to pursue payment from other insurers the employers so there will be no release of claims.
while jensen motion to dismiss was pending,valley mechanical submitted a separate motion for judgment on the pleadings.valley mechanical argued that it was clear from the face of the pleadings that the claim against it was barred by the applicable statute of limitations since the accident occurred in october,appellant original was not filed until february,and valley mechanical was not added as a doe defendant until august.
in opposition to jensen motion,appellant argued that all remedies,through entry of judgment,can be pursued in the name of a discharged,bankrupt tortfeasor,in order to pursue any and all recovery against any third parties who are obligated to guarantee or satisfy the judgment obtained in name against the tortfeasor,and that she was seeking a judgment against jensen in order to proceed against his employer,valley mechanical,its insurer.in opposition to valley mechanical motion,appellant argued that because the action against jensen was timely due to jensen status as plaintiff,and valley mechanical was potentially liable under a theory of respondeat superior,the action against valley mechanical must be deemed timely.
at the time the oppositions to the defense motions were filed,appellant moved for leave to file a first amended in order to make new allegations.these allegations included that jensen was operating his motor vehicle in the course and scope of employment with valley mechanical and that appellant was genuinely ignorant and unaware of the identity of valley mechanical,jensen operation of his motor vehicle in the course and scope of employment,the existence of a theory of respondeat liability as against valley mechanical or the fact that jensen was an employee at the time of the accident.
one day before the hearing on the motion for judgment on the pleadings,appellant sought,ex parte,to have the hearing on jensen motion to dismiss and valley mechanical motion for judgment on the pleadings set for the later date on which her motion for leave to amend had been calendared.the ex parte motion was denied and the hearing took place as scheduled on january.on the record,the court stated that jensen motion was to be taken under submission and valley mechanical motion granted.in accordance with the court decision,valley mechanical served a notice of ruling that stated its motion had been granted.however,the minute order entered on january said that jensen motion for dismissal had been submitted and valley mechanical motion for judgment on the pleadings had been denied.
a month later,on february,appellant motion for leave to amend the came on for hearing.the only appearance noted on the record was counsel for appellant.the court inquired whether the prior motions had been denied or taken under submission.before counsel could finish his response,the court reviewed its file and drew the conclusion from the january minute order that the motion for judgment on the pleadings had been denied.the court minute order dated february stated that appellant motion for leave to amend was granted jensen motion to dismiss was denied and valley mechanical motion for judgment on the pleadings was denied.appellant counsel served a notice of ruling that mirrored the minute order.
once it received appellant notice of ruling,valley mechanical filed a motion to correct the clerical errors.the motion was set for hearing on april.jensen scheduled a hearing on a motion for reconsideration of the motion denying his motion to dismiss for the same date.jensen argued that the grant of valley mechanical motion for judgment on the pleadings was a new fact that justified reconsideration of the denial of the motion to dismiss.
on april,the court entered a minute order that stated valley mechanical motion for order correcting the clerical error was granted and jensen motion to dismiss was granted.on april,the court entered a minute order setting aside its april minute order.on april,the court issued a minute order which stated after considering all the materials filed in this case,the court reinstates its ruling of as follows the minute order for indicating the court denied the motion for judgment on the pleading was in error as the court actually granted the motion.jensen motion to dismiss is granted based upon the corrected minute order.appellant motion to file a first amended complaint is denied as it was granted based upon the incorrect minute order.
on april,appellant filed a notice of appeal from the o rder of dismissal on april,and preceding orders of february,january,and january,regarding motion to dismiss,motion for judgment on the pleadings,motion for reconsideration,and motion for leave to file an amended supplemental 
subsequently,in may,the court signed a separate order granting valley mechanical motion for judgment on the pleadings,and valley mechanical served a notice of entry of order in july,a judgment of dismissal was entered in favor of jensen and in august,a notice of entry of judgment of dismissal was served by appellant.a second notice of appeal was filed on behalf of appellant on september,from the judgment of dismissal.that led to the opening of a second file bearing case no.that was subsequently dismissed for failure to designate a record.
discussion 
we first deal with the procedural issue of whether the current appeal was premature.the notice of appeal filed on april,after entry of the minute order,was followed by a separate order granting valley mechanical motion for judgment on the pleadings and a judgment of dismissal in favor of jensen.generally,courts of appeal strictly adhere to the one final judgment rule.see eisenberg et,cal.practice guide civil appeals and writs the rutter group.but we have discretion to entertain a premature appeal as long as a judgment was actually entered,there is no doubt concerning which ruling appellant seeks to have reviewed,and respondents were not misled to their prejudice.see,forsyth jones,supra,th at,d.given the confused state of the underlying record in this matter,we do not believe any purpose would be served by penalizing appellant for taking a premature appeal.nor do we see any evidence that respondents were prejudiced or misled.accordingly,our discretion is exercised in favor of hearing the matter on the merits.
we turn to the question of whether valley mechanical motion for judgment on the pleadings was properly granted.
it is clear from the pleadings that the accident occurred in october.former code of civil procedure section,subdivision c,applied a statute of limitations to actions for injury caused by the wrongful act or neglect to another jensen complaint against appellant was filed in september,just within the deadline.appellant was filed in.thus,unless some exception applies,her claims were necessarily.
with regard to appellant claims against jensen,the filing of his complaint caused the statute of limitations to be tolled or suspended as to causes of action arising out of the same set of facts alleged in the complaint.sidney superior court d.the principle underlying the rule is that the plaintiff has by filing the complaint thereby waived the statute of limitations claim and permitted the defendant to make all proper defenses to the cause of action pleaded.id.at,quoting trindade superior court d,italics added.since new parties can not be said to have engaged in any sort of waiver,the rule does not apply to them.see,trindade superior court,supra,at.as to against codefendants or new parties it has regularly been held that the statute of limitations is not tolled by the commencement of the plaintiff action.citations.the rationale for this distinction was discussed in western.tuolumne.d,where the court stated the principle underlying the rule that a statute of limitations is suspended by the filing of the original complaint is that the plaintiff has thereby waived the claim and permitted the defendant to make all proper defenses to the cause of action pleaded.but,where the controversy is limited to,none of whom has done any act in the nature of a waiver the reason for the rule does not exist.
appellant advances the theory that,because valley mechanical is jensen employer and potentially liable under principles of respondeat superior,its statute of limitations defense should be tied to jensen.that is,since jensen waived the statute of limitations defense by asserting a claim against appellant,valley mechanical should not be able to assert the defense because of its status as his potentially vicariously liable employer.appellant cites no authority that supports this novel proposition.she attempts to rely on this court decision in massa southern cal.rapid transit dist.th,d,a case that arose in a wholly different factual and legal setting.the plaintiff there claimed to have suffered injury at the hands of a police officer employed by the southern california rapid transit district scrtd police.claims against the scrtd,a governmental entity,fell under provisions of the tort claims act,which required written notice of claim to be given to the entity and permitted suit to be filed within six months after the claim was denied,even though that date was more than one year after the cause of action arose.the issue presented in massa was whether the plaintiff claim against the individual officer should be subject to the same limitations period,or whether the more general provisions of former section of the code of civil procedure applied.
to resolve the issue,we relied on the familiar postulates that the more recently enacted law will prevail over an earlier one and that a specific statute relating to a particular subject will govern over a general one the plain language of the tort claims act and the legislative purpose of providing a parallel scheme for suing government entities and their employees evidenced in the act.massa,supra,th at,d.after review of the relevant statutes,the legislative history,and a leading treatise on the act,we concluded t he legislative intent was to maintain a consistency between governmental entities and employees.this consistency is achieved by applying the same statute of limitations bar to suits against a government employee for conduct within the course and scope of employment as applies to suits against the employing entity on the theory of respondeat superior culpability based on the employee negligence.it would be defeated by applying a different period of limitation.id.at,d.
appellant attempts to convince us that our holding in massa has some relevance to the present situation.we do not see a connection.in massa,both the employer and the employee had been named as defendants within the tort claims act limitations period.the issue was whether that period or the more general limitations period contained in the code of civil procedure should be applied to the employee.here,valley mechanical was not sued within the bounds of any arguably applicable limitations period.appellant concedes it was named outside the period specified in former code of civil procedure section,subdivision c.
nor does appellant identify any other exception that might apply.she attempts an equitable argument,asserting that the principle of avoiding stale claims does not apply in this case and that valley mechanical should have foreseen a potential respondeat superior claim and was not prejudiced.application of the statute of limitations defense,unlike the equitable doctrine of laches,requires no showing of prejudice.castro sacramento county fire protection dist.th,d.statutes of limitations are adamant rather than flexible in nature and are upheld and enforced regardless of personal hardship.id.at,d,quoting kupka board of administration d.appellant claim against valley mechanical was filed outside the applicable limitations period and was,therefore,untimely.we turn to whether valley mechanical its insurer could be pursued indirectly by continuation of the action against jensen.
appellant contends that her claim against jensen should not have been dismissed because bankruptcy discharge does not prevent litigation against the debtor from going forward where the claimant ultimately intends to obtain recovery from a third party.the third parties appellant has in mind are valley mechanical its insurer.to support her argument,appellant relies primarily on forsyth jones,supra,th,d.we first address whether that case is controlling.
in forsyth,plaintiff claim for medical malpractice was dismissed after his physician obtained a bankruptcy discharge.plaintiff complaint expressly asserted that the purpose of the action was to establish the physician liability as a precondition to recovering from his liability insurer.addressing the narrow issue of whether a plaintiff may proceed against a discharged debtor solely to recover from the debtor insurer,the court join ed the vast majority of courts who have considered the issue by answering that question in the affirmative.forsyth jones,supra,th at,d.citing a number of federal cases the court stated i t is clear that,following discharge,a plaintiff or other creditor may not seek to hold the debtor personally liable for any debt,but may proceed against either a codebtor or a surety or guarantor who guaranteed the debtor payment of that debt.forsyth,at,d.
appellant claims that her situation is on all fours with that in forsyth,but that is obviously not so.plaintiff in forsyth was seeking to recover from the debtor insurer.that situation is governed by insurance code section,subdivision b,which states that insurance policies sold in california must contain the following provisions a provision that the insolvency or bankruptcy of the insured will not release the insurer from the payment of damages for injury sustained or loss occasioned during the life of such policy and a provision that whenever judgment is secured against the insured in an action based upon bodily injury,death,or property damage,then an action may be brought against the insurer on the policy and subject to its terms and limitations,by such judgment creditor to recover on the judgment.
procedure under insurance code section requires the injured party to bring two lawsuits to collect a judgment from the liability insurer first against the insured and then,after judgment is obtained in the first suit,a separate action against the insurer.rose royal ins.th,d.it is well established that the insured liability must be established independently and not in an action brought directly against the insurer and the insurer may not be joined in the action against the insured,italics added,quoting zahn canadian indem.d.it is only after obtaining a judgment against the insured that the injured party independent cause of action against the insurer arises.shafer berger,kahn,shafton,moss,figler,simon gladstone th,d.at that point,the injured party may proceed directly against any liability insurance covering the defendant,and obtain satisfaction of the judgment up to the amount of the policy limits.ibid.
appellant cites labor code section in an attempt to convince us that a similar procedure is triggered when an injured party seeks to hold an employer liable under a theory of respondeat superior.section provides that a n employer shall indemnify his or her employee for all necessary expenditures or losses incurred by the employee in direct consequence of the discharge of his or her duties,or of his or her obedience to the directions of the employer there are significant differences between an insurer and an.for example,u nlike an insurer,the employer need not defend whenever there is a mere potential for liability.jacobus krambo th,d see also heppler peters th,d insurers have a distinct and duty to defend their insureds citation as opposed to indemnitors,whose duty to defend is not triggered until it is determined that the proceeding against the indemnitee is embraced by the indemnity.in addition,insurers agree to compensate the insured for the consequences of his or her own negligence,whereas indemnitors generally do not.see mel clayton ford ford motor th,and,d.more importantly,labor code section does not mandate that an action by an injured first party must first be brought against the employee or that third parties may pursue the employer only after obtaining a judgment against the employee.
with respect to appellant apparent intent to use a judgment in jensen name to recover from valley mechanical insurer,several cases have interpreted section as creating no rights between employees sued by an injured third party and the employer insurance company.in republic indemnity schofield th,d,the employees of a professional law corporation sought to sue the corporation insurer for bad faith and failure to defend,contending that labor code section creates an implication that all employees of a corporation are insureds under a policy that names the corporation as the sole insured.id.at,d.the court fail ed to see how this indemnification provision creates an implication that all corporate employees are automatically insureds under a policy naming only the corporation as the insured.it is true the insurer may have to indemnify the corporation to the extent it is legally liable for losses its employees suffer.however,this does not mean the employees are insureds under the policy for the purpose of maintaining a breach of contract or bad faith action against the insurer.id.at,d.
this court relied on the holding in republic in seretti superior nat.ins.th,d,where the individual owners of a corporation sued its workers compensation carrier for bad faith for failing to defend actions brought as the result of injury to two of the corporation employees.we concluded that the owners lacked standing to assert a claim against the corporation insurer.when and if the individual owners assert ed an indemnification claim against the insured,then that claim could be tendered to the corporation insurance company.id.at,d.
in seretti,we cited alex robertson imperial casualty indemnity th,d.that case involved an agreement between a contractor and an architectural firm to provide architectural plans and specifications.the architectural firm was to indemnify the contractor for its negligence,and carry professional liability insurance.when the contractor was sued for breach of contract and negligence in connection with the project,he tendered the defense to the architectural firm insurer and brought suit when the tender was rejected.the appellate court concluded that the contractor had sued the wrong party.id.at,d.its indemnity agreement is with the architectural firm,not with its insurer under the policy,the insurer agreed to pay on behalf of the architectural firm all sums which the architectural firm shall become legally obligated to pay by reason of liability arising out of any negligent act in rendering or failing to render professional services the architectural firm has not yet become legally obligated to pay anything.until such event,any claim by the contractor against the insurer under the policy is premature.ibid.
the above authorities make clear that even where a party is legally obligated to indemnify a second party,the first party insurer is not the insurer of the second.labor code section provisions,like the provisions in the agreement in alex robertson,promise the employee he will be indemnified by the employer.they do not provide access to the employer or its insurer pocketbook through a third party suit against the employee.accordingly,forsyth and the federal authorities on which it relied are not controlling.we turn to consideration of whether the holding should be expanded to apply to the present situation.
although neither party discusses them,a number of bankruptcy courts have considered whether to apply the holding of the federal authorities cited in forsyth to situations where the plaintiff seeks to pursue the debtor employer or an insurer other than the debtor own.for example,in in re catania,the debtor allegedly caused injuries to plaintiff by negligently operating a motor vehicle owned by his employer which was covered by the employer insurance.the court concluded that plaintiff could proceed,but set forth three conditions that should be present first,the movant can maintain the action against the debtor only when it is necessary to join the debtor in order to establish liability against a third party.if the debtor need not be joined as a party,if the third party liability can be established in the debtor absence,then the movant may not bring suit against him.fn.omitted.that the debtor would be an important witness in a suit against the third party is not sufficient reason to join him as a party to the suit.the debtor must be a party in whose absence the suit against the third party would be dismissed under applicable tort and procedural laws.second,the movant can maintain the negligence action against the debtor only if the debtor bears none of the costs of defense the third,most important,and most obvious condition is that the movant may not execute on any judgment he may obtain against the debtor,either against the debtor personally or against his assets.id.at.
catania has been cited by other bankruptcy courts that find themselves in analogous situations.in in re czuba,the debtor was the president of a corporate franchisee,and was accused of sexual harassment by plaintiff.after discharge,plaintiff sought to continue the action against the debtor in order to reach the corporation and the franchisor.the court stated that for the litigation against the debtor to proceed,the moving party must establish that the debtor is a necessary party in the pending litigation and dismissal of the debtor will result in the moving party not being able to pursue its remedies against the pursuit of the action with the debtor involved will not impose a financial hardship on the debtor that derogates the sweeping effect of the discharge and the parties agree that the modification is confined to establishing liability for damages and does not allow pursuit of a judgment against the discharged debtor.id.at.after reviewing state law concerning necessary parties,the court concluded that
