this bankruptcy appeal presents a question of first impression in this circuit what is the proper way to calculate the projected disposable income of an chapter debtor under amendments to the bankruptcy code effected by the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of,stat.bapcpa in this case,the united states bankruptcy court for the district of kansas adopted the approach,which is the method adopted by the majority of bankruptcy courts and bankruptcy appellate panels baps that have considered the question.under that approach,a chapter debtor,disposable income as defined by statute is presumed to be the debtor projected disposable income for purposes of establishing the monthly sum that the debtor must commit to repayment of unsecured creditors in order to advance a confirmable payment plan and overcome objections to it.the approach permits the amount of projected disposable income to be rebutted upon a showing of special circumstances at the time of plan confirmation.
in the course of its analysis,the bankruptcy court rejected a different method,the mechanical approach,which equates a chapter debtor projected disposable income with the statutorily defined disposable income and then projects that amount over the length of the applicable commitment period.it does not permit adjustment to projected disposable income to account for special circumstances at the time of plan confirmation.
in affirming the bankruptcy court decision,the tenth circuit bap also adopted the approach and its rebuttable presumption.see in re lanning,cir.bap.for the reasons discussed below,we also adopt the approach.exercising our jurisdiction under d and,we affirm the bap decision.
factual background 
the parties stipulated to the relevant facts.the debtor,stephanie kay lanning,is a single woman with no children and a kansas resident.she filed a chapter petition on october,to address in unsecured debt.her annual gross income was in,and in.during the period before filing her petition,lanning took a buyout from her employer,payless,that increased her monthly gross income to in april and in may.
as part of her petition,lanning filed schedule i current income of individual debtor s,which showed a monthly net income of annually,apparently reflecting actual income from a job she started after leaving payless.app.at.she also filed schedule j current expenditures of individual debtor s,which showed actual monthly expenses of and,consequently,excess monthly income of.id.at.in addition,lanning completed form now denominated form,statement of current monthly income and disposable income calculation.id.at.form first requires a debtor to calculate current monthly income as an average of income for the six calendar months immediately preceding the month in which the petition is filed.id.at.under this formula,lanning current monthly income was,which included the buyout from payless.when that figure was annualized,her income was greater than the median income for a family of one in kansas,so she was required to complete the remainder of form,on which most expenses and other deductions are calculated by reference to standard sums issued by the internal revenue service national and local irs standards.id.at.according to her form,lanning total monthly expenses were,leaving her with monthly disposable income under b of.id.at.
based on the excess monthly income of shown on schedule j,lanning proposed a repayment plan of per month for months as satisfaction of the in unsecured debt.she moved the bankruptcy court to determine that b b did not require her to commit the in monthly disposable income calculated on form which included her buyout to repayment of the unsecured creditors.section b b is the primary statute involved in this case,and when,as here,a chapter debtor proposes a plan that contemplates less than full repayment of all allowed unsecured claims and there is an objection,that section conditions plan confirmation as follows 
b if the trustee or the holder of an allowed unsecured claim objects to the confirmation of the plan,then the court may not approve the plan unless,as of the effective date of the plan 
b the plan provides that all of the debtor projected disposable income to be received in the applicable commitment period beginning on the date that the first payment is due under the plan will be applied to make payments to unsecured creditors under the plan.
b b emphasis added 
although none of the unsecured creditors objected to the proposed plan,the chapter trustee did,arguing that b b provides a rigid formula for determining projected disposable income that is based on a debtor historical monthly income as calculated on form.the trustee proposed that a monthly payment of less than lanning form monthly disposable income of for sixty months would repay the unsecured creditors in full,despite acknowledging that lanning did not have the means to fund such a plan.
ii.the bankruptcy court decision 
the bankruptcy court rejected the mechanical approach that the trustee advocated.the court noted that the term projected disposable income is not defined in b b,but that b,as amended by the bapcpa,defines disposable income 
for purposes of this subsection,the term disposable income means current monthly income received by the debtor other than child support payments,foster care payments,or disability payments for a dependent child made in accordance with applicable nonbankruptcy law to the extent reasonably necessary to be expended for such child less amounts reasonably necessary to be expended 
a i for the maintenance or support of the debtor or a dependent of the debtor,or for a domestic support obligation,that first becomes payable after the date the petition is filed and 
ii for charitable contributions that meet the definition of charitable contribution under section d to a qualified religious or charitable entity or organization as defined in section d in an amount not to exceed percent of gross income of the debtor for the year in which the contributions are made and 
b if the debtor is engaged in business,for the payment of expenditures necessary for the continuation,preservation,and operation of such business.
b emphasis added.
in turn,the bankruptcy court looked to the statutory definition of current monthly income that congress added with the bapcpa.in relevant part,current monthly income 
a means the average monthly income from all sources that the debtor receives without regard to whether such income is taxable income,derived during the period ending on 
i the last day of the calendar month immediately preceding the date of the commencement of the case if the debtor files the schedule of current income required by section a b ii,schedule i.
id.a i.the court also found relevant a new clause added to b by the bapcpa that,for debtors,requires the use of the standardized expenses and deductions calculated on form as the a mounts reasonably necessary to be expended under b with the exception of charitable contributions under b a ii.id.b 
in light of these statutory provisions,the bankruptcy court presumed that the monthly disposable income reflected on form constituted projected disposable income under b b,subject to a showing that there has been a substantial change in circumstances such that the numbers contained in form are not commensurate with a fair projection of the debtor budget in the future.app.at quotation omitted.the court observed that the words projected and to be received in b b would be superfluous if a debtor historical average income was the only consideration.id.at.the court also placed significance on schedule i mandate that a debtor provide an e stimate of average or projected monthly income at time case filed,an estimate of monthly overtime,and a description of any increase or decrease in income reasonably anticipated to occur within the year following the filing of schedule i.id.at quoting schedule i the court reasoned that schedule i tries to capture what income debtors actually will have to fund a plan.id.at.the court also noted that the prefatory portion of b requires the determination of projected disposable income to be made as of the effective date of the plan.id.quoting b.as to each of these observations,the court pointed out that schedule i assists courts in determining whether the plan is properly committing all this income,and clearly calls for the court to consider income to be received during the life of the plan.id.
finally,the bankruptcy court reasoned that the mechanical approach leads to absurd results that are at odds with both congressional purpose and common sense.id.specifically,where a debtor income at the time of confirmation has dropped significantly from the average,the current monthly income calculated on form,the court observed that the debtor would be unable to file a feasible and confirmable plan under the mechanical approach.id.this would deny chapter protection to those most in need of bankruptcy whose financial situation has significantly deteriorated over the six months prior to filing.id.at.the court further noted that even when,at the time of plan confirmation,a debtor has more disposable income than indicated by form,the mechanical approach would require confirmation of a plan over objection even though the debtor would not be paying all that she was able to pay to unsecured creditors.id.at.
applying its interpretation of b b,the bankruptcy court determined that the monthly disposable income shown on lanning form was not controlling.instead,the court used her schedule i income and then subtracted her form expenses,which yielded a negative number.the court stated,however,that if lanning were to pay nothing to the unsecured creditors,she could not formulate a feasible plan that meets the requirements of a,which,among other things,requires a showing that the debtor will be able to make all payments under the plan and to comply with the plan,a.the court then concluded that n othing prevents debtors from electing to pay more than the statutory means test requires,in order to meet the requirement that a plan must be feasible.app.at.accordingly,the court agreed to confirm lanning plan provided that it continued for sixty months rather than months 
iii.the bap decision 
the trustee appealed to the bap,which affirmed,holding that if it is shown that form disposable income fails accurately to predict a debtor actual ability to fund a plan,that figure may be subject to modification.in re lanning,at.the bap discussed the judicial camps of thought on the issue,then pointed out that the bapcpa added a definition of disposable income but left unchanged the term projected disposable income,which had an established meaning under schedule i income minus schedule j expenses,subject to adjustment if there was reason to believe that those schedules did not accurately predict a debtor actual ability to pay.the bap concluded that although the bapcpa amendments specify the formula by which to determine a debtor median standing,as well as the monthly disposable income as of the date of the petition,they give us no reason to believe that congress intended to eliminate the bankruptcy courts discretion to deviate from an application of that formula where significant circumstances support doing so.id.at see also id.quoting cohen de la cruz,d,for the proposition that the bankruptcy code should not be read to erode past bankruptcy practice absent a clear indication that congress intended such a departure further quotation omitted.the bap adopted a rebuttable presumption that the form figures were correct subject to a showing of a substantial change in circumstances by way of documentation similar to that required by chapter debtors under the means test.in re lanning,at.the bap emphasize d that deviation from the form determination of disposable income will be the exception rather than the rule.id.
unsuccessful before the bap,the trustee filed the present appeal.lanning has not participated in this appeal and she did not participate in the appeal to the bap,but the united states and the united states trustee have filed a combined amicus brief opposing the trustee position as they did before the bap.
iv.standard of review 
on appeal from bap decisions,we independently review the bankruptcy court decision.lampe williamson in re lampe,cir.the issue in this case is one of statutory interpretation,which is reviewed de novo.see office of thrift supervision overland park fin.in re overland park fin,cir.
bapcpa amendments and interpretive judicial decisions 
the issue to be resolved is whether the projected disposable income referred to in b b is calculated by mechanical application of the definitions of disposable income and current monthly income set forth in b and a i,respectively,or whether it is permissible to adjust the monthly disposable income calculated on form to account for a debtor actual ability to fund a plan as of the effective date of the plan.it is well established that when a statute language is plain,the sole function of the least where the disposition required by the text is not to enforce it according to its terms.lamie trustee,d quotation omitted.here,the statutory language may be plain,but it is unclear in its meaning.thus,before turning to an analysis of the statutory language,we briefly will review the relevant changes congress made and did not make when it enacted the bapcpa,and then consider a number of judicial decisions representative of the two methods used to calculate projected disposable income.
bapcpa amendments 
in passing the bapcpa,congress left b b substantially unchanged for present purposes,the only differences being that the version referred to a period rather than the applicable commitment period as the relevant time period over which the debtor plan must apply projected disposable income to plan payments now three years for debtors and five years for debtors and required all such projected disposable income to be applied to make payments under the plan,b b,rather than,more narrowly now,to make payments to the unsecured creditors.thus,the relevant language of b b is substantially the same now as it was before passage of the bapcpa,that all projected disposable income to be received in the applicable commitment period will be applied to make payments.as the bap pointed out,the language meant that projected disposable income was the difference between a debtor schedule i income and her schedule j expenses,subject to adjustment by the court if there was reason to believe that those schedules did not accurately predict a debtor actual ability to pay.in re lanning,at see also in re nahat.
next,prior to passage of the bapcpa,disposable income was defined as income which is received by the debtor and which is not reasonably necessary to be expended for the debtor maintenance,support,charitable contributions,and business expenses.b a.with the bapcpa,congress changed the definition of disposable income by tying it to a new term,current monthly income,b,and adding the definition of current monthly income that in relevant part,as noted above,looks at the debtor income,id.a i.finally,the bapcpa added a new clause to b that,for debtors,requires the use of the standardized expenses and deductions calculated on form as the a mounts reasonably necessary to be expended under b with the exception of charitable contributions under b a ii.see id.b.
with this understanding of the relevant changes to the bapcpa,we now turn to judicial decisions representative of the two interpretations of b b.
courts adopting the approach 
the first court to address the issue appears to be in re hardacre,in hardacre,the court expressed concern about the consequences when current monthly income derived from form is used as the sole determinant of the income side of the projected disposable income calculation.id.at.the court reasoned that a debtor expecting a significant increase in future income would file as quickly as possible,resulting in the commitment of less money to repay unsecured creditors than the debtor would actually be capable of paying during the commitment period.id.conversely,the court observed that a debtor who experiences a decrease in income after filing might not be able to confirm a plan because she would be unable to commit the amount of disposable income calculated on form.id.
the hardacre court offered three justifications in support of its conclusion that projected disposable income must be based upon the debtor anticipated income during the term of the plan,not merely an average of her prepetition income.id.first,noting the rule of statutory construction that requires a court to presume that congress acts intentionally when it includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another,the court reasoned that congress must have intended projected disposable income to be different than disposable income when it chose to define only the latter term.id.at quoting bfp resolution trust,d.second,the court viewed the phrase to be received in b b as an expression of congressional intent to refer to the income actually to be received by the debtor during the commitment period,rather than the prepetition average income an alternative interpretation,the court said,would render to be received superfluous.id.and third,the court considered b s prefatory language as of the effective date of the plan to be an indication that projected disposable income refers to income that a debtor reasonably expects to receive during the term of her plan.id.
a number of other courts,including one circuit court recently,have applied hardacre reasoning in adopting the approach.see,coop frederickson in re frederickson,wl cir hildebrand petro in re petro,cir.bap kibbe sumski in re kibbe,per curiam in re watson,in re pak,aff,abrogated by maney kagenveama in re kagenveama,cir in re grady,and in re jass.most courts applying this approach view form as presumptively correct regarding income 
courts adopting the mechanical approach 
to date,only one circuit court other than a bap has adopted the mechanical approach.see maney kagenveama in re kagenveama,cir.there the court reasoned 
the substitution of any data not covered by the b definition in the projected disposable income calculation would render as surplusage the definition of disposable income found in b.there can be no reason for b to exist other than to define the term disposable income as used in b b.if disposable income is not linked to projected disposable income then it is just a floating definition with no apparent purpose.in re alexander.the plain meaning of the word projected,in and of itself,does not provide a basis for including other data in the calculation because projected is simply a modifier of the defined term disposable income.therefore,to give meaning to every word of b,disposable income,as defined in b,must be projected in order to derive projected disposable income.
id.at.regarding the treatment of projected disposable income,the court concluded that 
a ny change in how projected disposable income is calculated only reflects the changes dictated by the new disposable income calculation it does not change the relationship of projected disposable income to disposable income,projected disposable income was determined by taking the debtor disposable income,under b a b,and projecting that amount over the applicable commitment period.
id.at footnote omitted.the court refused to read the word projected to be synonymous with the word anticipated in this context.id.at.
in addition to kagenveama,a number of bankruptcy courts have adopted the mechanical approach.see,in re austin,in re kolb,in re hanks,in re miller,in re tranmer,in re alexander,and in re barr.three of these cases,in re alexander,in re hanks,and in re austin,discuss matters of particular note.
in in re alexander,the court observed that congress elected to adopt the redefinition of disposable income in b as written despite the warnings of chapter trustees that strict use of the form formula would lead to an anomalous result in some cases,namely,that some debtors would pay less than they would prior to bapcpa.at.the trustees apparently asked that deducting expenses from current monthly income result in a a repayment to unsecured creditors.see id.the alexander court reasoned that the legislature nonresponse to this concern supported a presumption of legislative awareness and intent regarding the consequences of the language with respect to making debtors pay what they can and preventing abuse.id.at.
in the second case of note,in re hanks,the court followed in re alexander,concluding that under the bapcpa,the new function of the word projected in b b is solely to multiply the net disposable income figure as calculated on form by the applicable commitment period.no more,no less.at.hanks viewed the interpretation given to the statute by the majority line of cases to mean that,nothing had changed with regard to the calculation of projected disposable income.id.alternately,the court opined that the word projected could be deleted as surplusage because it is repugnant to the rest of the bapcpa.id.
hanks also rejected policy arguments the majority camp has relied on,such as affording bankruptcy protection and a fresh start to debtors who voluntarily and in good faith seek to repay creditors with money they have on hand.id.at.the court pointed to competing policies that might have informed congress choice of language 
it is not at all clear that congress did not actually intend to keep people out of bankruptcy altogether if possible or perhaps to push them into individual chapter cases,nor is it clear that a fresh start is still the overriding policy of the portions of the bankruptcy code at issue in this case.perhaps the concept of current monthly income is an expression of congress intent that debtors should attempt to resolve their financial difficulties outside of bankruptcy for a period of time before filing.indeed,this view would jibe with the new prepetition briefing requirement in h that contemplates meaningful credit counseling and the performance of budget analyses within six months of filing as well as the requirement in b that the debtor file a copy of any debt repayment plan developed during the prepetition counseling session.
in re hanks,at.the court found statements such as the one in the purpose and summary section of the bapcpa house report expressing the view that the means testing mechanism is intended to ensure that debtors repay creditors the maximum they can afford,part i,bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of,to be insufficient to overcome both the plain language of the statute and the statements apparent conflict with other policies at play in the bapcpa.id.at.
the chapter trustee quotes at length from the third case of note,in re austin,where the debtors form monthly disposable income was negative but their calculation left some excess income.the relevant point made in austin is that,in the bapcpa,
congress declared that the historical income data from the six months prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition is a more reliable indicator of a debtor future financial situation than the income on the day the debtor filed for bankruptcy relief,and has directed courts to adjust their starting point for analyzing chapter plans accordingly.
at.if this statement is accurate,then an obvious problem arises in cases like lanning,where the factual circumstances differ despite the view under austin that lanning income is a more reliable indicator of her future financial situation,and hence would lead one to believe that she would be capable of paying her form disposable income to unsecured creditors,she can not get her plan confirmed because she can not show that she will be able to make all payments under the plan and to comply with the plan,as required for confirmation by a.
vi.analysis 
as is evident from the foregoing discussion,each interpretation of the statutory language is not without problems.the difficulty with the approach is that it renders the new definition of disposable income,with its link to historic current monthly income,nearly meaningless unless one reads a presumption into the the defined term disposable income is just the starting can be rebutted by showing a substantial change in circumstances bearing on how much the debtor realistically can commit to repayment of unsecured creditors as of the effective date of the
