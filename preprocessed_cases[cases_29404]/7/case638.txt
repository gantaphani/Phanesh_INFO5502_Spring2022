in this bankruptcy appeal we must decide whether a court should toll the mandatory period a debtor must wait to obtain a second chapter discharge,during the pendency of any intervening chapter proceeding filed by the debtor.for the reasons stated below,we agree with the bankruptcy and district courts that tolling does not apply here,and so affirm.
the bankruptcy code offers individual debtors two primary avenues of relief chapters and of the code under chapter,a debtor liquidates his assets the proceeds are then distributed to creditors pursuant to a schedule of priorities.et.west see collier on bankruptcy alan resnick henry sommer,ed.hereinafter collier.at the conclusion of a chapter proceeding,the debtor normally receives a discharge.see west.the discharge provides the debtor with a fresh start by enjoining the collection of any remaining debts,unless the code excepts those debts from discharge.see west.
alternatively,an individual may attempt to repay his debts through the procedure set forth in chapter.et.west.chapter provides a reorganization remedy for consumer debtors and proprietors with relatively small debts.johnson home state bank,d.under chapter,the debtor submits a repayment plan to the bankruptcy court,which will confirm the plan if it meets statutory criteria that protect creditors interests.see collier.if a debtor successfully completes a confirmed plan,he receives a discharge of remaining eligible debts.see id.because congress intended chapter proceedings to be entirely voluntary,a debtor,as a matter of right,may at any time dismiss his chapter petition or convert it to a chapter proceeding.see id.
the initiation of either chapter or chapter proceedings triggers an automatic stay under a west.this automatic stay bars creditor collection activity for the duration of the proceeding,although creditors may petition the court to terminate,suspend,or condition the stay.see collier.
the case at hand involves a west.that section of the bankruptcy code governs discharges in chapter cases and requires a court to grant a discharge unless certain conditions apply.see id.the condition at issue here,a,provides that a debtor is not entitled to a discharge if he has been granted a discharge under chapters or,in a case commenced within six years before the date of the filing of the petition.id.a in other words,a requires debtors to wait at least six years,after filing a chapter or case that resulted in a discharge before initiating a later chapter case,in order to be entitled to a discharge in the later case.
the parties do not dispute the material facts of this case.on october,deborah williams filed a petition under chapter she later received a discharge.almost two years later,on september,williams initiated a chapter proceeding,which was dismissed on november.williams initiated a second chapter case on may,which was dismissed on january.
on july,tidewater finance company tidewater obtained a judgment for,plus accrued interest and costs,against williams based on her default on an auto loan.after obtaining this judgment,tidewater did not initiate proceedings to either enforce it or secure it through a lien or other device 
williams initiated a third chapter proceeding on august,it was dismissed on september.tidewater has neither alleged nor presented evidence that williams filed for chapter relief in bad faith.based on the record before us,we have no reason to doubt that each time williams filed for chapter,she did so in a sincere effort to manage and pay her debts.
on march,williams initiated the chapter petition at issue in this case.tidewater commenced an adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy court objecting to discharge and then moved for summary judgment,arguing that williams was ineligible for a discharge under a.tidewater acknowledged that a requires only that a debtor wait six years after filing a chapter petition that resulted in a discharge before filing a subsequent chapter action and that seven years,days had passed since williams filed the petition that resulted in her first discharge.nevertheless,tidewater argued that the a period was equitably tolled during williams three chapter proceedings,including the two that occurred prior to accrual of tidewater claim against williams.if the waiting period were in fact tolled during the three chapter proceedings,for a total duration of two years and days,williams would not be entitled to obtain a second chapter discharge under a.
the bankruptcy court denied tidewater motion for summary judgment and granted summary judgment to williams,holding that a did not provide grounds for denial of a discharge in her case.tidewater fin.williams in re williams.the court reasoned that e quitable tolling is not applicable here because a does not define a limitations period for tidewater,a creditor,to assert its claim rather,it defines a condition that williams was required to satisfy in order to qualify for a discharge of her debts.id.at.tidewater appealed to the district court,which affirmed.tidewater fin.williams.
tidewater appeals the district court judgment affirming the order of the bankruptcy court.we review de novo the judgment of a district court sitting in review of a bankruptcy court.in re,cir.we apply to the bankruptcy court judgment the same standard employed by the district court.id.thus,we review the bankruptcy court factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.id.
on appeal,tidewater contends that a establishes a statute of limitations that must be tolled and failure to toll a would create a loophole in the bankruptcy code.we address each contention in turn.
tidewater first argument is that the waiting period in a is a limitations period that the bankruptcy court should have equitably tolled during williams chapter proceedings.in assessing this statutory argument,we begin,as always,with the text of the statute.limtiaco camacho,d.section a provides 
the court shall grant the debtor a discharge,unless the debtor has been granted a discharge under chapters or,in a case commenced within six years before the date of the filing of the petition.
plainly,the statute other code not expressly provide for tolling.c extending statutes of limitation for creditors when the automatic stay bars their collection efforts.notwithstanding this plain language,tidewater argues that tolling applies here because of the principle that statutes of limitation are customarily subject to equitable tolling,irwin dep t of veterans affairs,d,unless tolling would be inconsistent with the text of the relevant statute.united states beggerly,d.
tidewater argument rests on a faulty premise that a is a statute of limitations.in fact,a imposes no limitations period.a statute of limitation requires a litigant to file a claim within a specified period of time.rector approved fed.sav.bank,cir see also black law dictionary ed statutes of limitation set maximum time periods during which certain actions can be brought or rights enforced.section a does not require a litigant here,tidewater to file its claim within a specified period of time.rector,at.instead,a conditions the ability of a debtor,like williams,to obtain a chapter discharge,by requiring her to wait six years after initiating earlier proceedings that ended in a discharge.thus,as the bankruptcy court explained,a does not define a limitations period for tidewater,a creditor,to assert its claim,rather it defines a condition that the debtor williams was required to satisfy in order to qualify for a benefit,namely,a discharge of her debts.tidewater,at emphasis added.
despite the fact that a does not set forth a specified period of time in which tidewater can assert its claim,rector,at,tidewater insists that a is a limitations period subject to equitable tolling.tidewater principally relies on young united states,d,in which the court held that other provisions in the bankruptcy code create a limitations period subject to equitable tolling.but young offers tidewater no support because the provisions at issue there differ vastly from a.
the provisions at issue in young are a a i and a a.the latter,a a,excepts from a discharge any tax of the kind and for the periods specified in a section a in turn grants priority to unsecured income tax claims for which a return was due after three years before the date of the filing of the petition.id.a a i as the young court explained,these two provisions combine to provide that i f the irs has a claim for taxes for which the return was due within three years before the bankruptcy petition was filed,the claim enjoys eighth priority under a a i and is nondischargeable in bankruptcy.at.
the court in young held that this period was a limitations period because it prescribe d a period within which certain rights namely,priority and nondischargeability in bankruptcy may be enforced by the claimant,there the irs.id.at.emphasis added.moreover,the court noted that,like other statutes of limitations,the period in young commence d when the claimant the irs ha d a complete and present cause of action,when the taxpayer return was due.id.at.
not only limitations periods,but all statutory periods to which courts have applied equitable tolling principles,contain these same two characteristics.first,they provide a plaintiff in the bankruptcy context,a creditor with a specified period of time within which the plaintiff must act to pursue a claim in order to preserve a remedy.see,young,at.plaintiff irs must act to collect tax debt or perfect tax lien within three years zipes trans world airlines,d plaintiff must act to file charge of discrimination with eeoc within days icc of locomotive eng rs,d plaintiff must petition for review of final order of icc within days irwin,at.plaintiff must act to file title vii action within days of receipt of notice from eeoc.second,such periods commence when the plaintiff has or discovers that he has a complete and present cause of action.see young,at.period commences with failure to file tax return zipes,at.period commences with discriminatory conduct icc,at.period commences with service of final administrative order irwin,at.period commences with receipt of notice when these two circumstances exist,a court will often toll a period if it concludes that equitable considerations excuse a plaintiff failure to take the required action within the time period.see young,at.explaining that tolling is permitted when claimant has actively pursued his judicial remedies or has been induced or tricked by his adversary misconduct into allowing the filing deadline to pass internal quotation marks omitted.
in stark contrast,the provision at issue here,a,does not contain either of these critical characteristics first,it does not prescribe a period of time within which a certain right may be enforced by the claimant,tidewater.see young,at.instead,a prescribes a period of time a debtor must wait before becoming eligible for a discharge.second,the period in a does not commence when the claimant tidewater ha d a complete and present cause of action.young,at.rather,the period commences when the debtor initiates a bankruptcy proceeding that led to a prior discharge,which may be,as here,well before the claimant had a complete and present cause of action.
although a creditor may incidentally benefit from the debtor inability to obtain a discharge during the period,the extent of that benefit is entirely contingent on when the creditor claim arose,when the debtor defaulted.under the statute,the creditor may benefit for a very long period five years and days,a very short period one day,or any time in between.if the debt accrued shortly after the first discharge,the creditor could wait more than five years to collect the debt,confident that the debtor could not obtain a discharge but in a case like that at hand,in which the creditor did not obtain a judgment against the debtor until more than four years after the initial discharge,the debtor will become eligible for another discharge in less than two years.if congress had intended a to guarantee creditors six years of nondischargeability to enforce their claims,the statutory period would run from the accrual of the creditor of running from the initiation of a proceeding that may,as here,well predate that claim 
tidewater utterly ignores the critical differences between a and the provisions at issue in young.instead,tidewater contends that because both a and the young provisions set forth lookback periods,both must set forth limitations periods.the contention is meritless.lookback simply describes how a statutory provision measures a period of time,not whether it constitutes a period subject to tolling.the court tolled the period in young not because it happened to measure time by looking backwards,but because it was a limitations period and equity required the application of tolling principles.in contrast,as demonstrated above,a lacks the defining characteristics of a limitations period.moreover,a advances different policies than those served by limitations periods.as the supreme court has explained,limitations periods like that in young further policies of repose,elimination of stale claims,and certainty about a plaintiff opportunity for recovery and a defendant potential liabilities.young,at.emphasis added.in contrast,a serves an entirely different purpose deterring serial chapter bankruptcies by requiring defendant debtors to wait a specified period of time between chapter discharges.
furthermore,as the district court recognized,adopting tidewater position would be at odds with the overall statutory scheme set forth in the bankruptcy code.under tidewater view,a debtor,like williams,could only attempt to utilize chapter to reorganize and pay down her debt if she were willing to extend the period she would have to wait before possibly receiving a discharge under chapter.this would discourage honest debtors from using chapter to pay their debts with the hope of avoiding a second chapter an unsuccessful chapter proceeding,even one filed in good faith,would extend the waiting period set by a.
in addition,as the district court also observed,tidewater approach would allow all creditors to benefit from equitable those that were not at all affected by the chapter proceeding that caused the tolling.see tidewater,at.this case provides an example.tidewater claim against williams arose after her second chapter proceeding.yet tidewater contends that somehow it should receive the benefit of tolling the a period during williams first two chapter in which it had no claim against williams that could have been affected by the automatic stay in those proceedings.under tidewater theory,it would still benefit from tolling during the first two chapter proceedings even if williams had already paid the debts of all those creditors affected by the automatic stay in those proceedings.
for all of these reasons,we can only conclude that the bankruptcy and district courts properly held that a is not a limitations period and tolling has no place here.
tidewater also argues that failing to toll a leaves a loophole in the bankruptcy code,which allows a debtor to file a petition for relief under chapter and receive a discharge,then file,dismiss,and refile chapter petitions and cloak themselves sic with the automatic stay until six calendar years elapse.this contention must necessarily fail given our conclusion that a is not a statute to which tolling principles could apply.in any event,however,the loophole argument is singularly unpersuasive.for congress has provided bankruptcy courts with several tools to remedy any loophole of the sort feared by tidewater.
first,a authorizes bankruptcy courts to issue any order,process,or judgment that is necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of title.it states that n o provision of this title providing for the raising of an issue by a party in interest shall be construed to preclude the court from,sua sponte,taking any action or making any determination necessary or appropriate to enforce or implement court orders or rules,or to prevent an abuse of process.id.emphasis added.if a bankruptcy court found that a debtor was abusing chapter in the manner tidewater fears,a empowers the court to remedy that abuse.
moreover,although the automatic stay that accompanies chapter filings bars creditor collection efforts,allows creditors to request relief from the stay for cause.thus,if a creditor demonstrated that a debtor had filed a chapter proceeding in bad faith,the creditor could request relief from the stay from the court.furthermore,if a debtor sought to dismiss a chapter action in order to avoid the bankruptcy court judgment on that relief,such dismissal would bar the debtor from filing another bankruptcy petition for days,giving creditors a window in which to pursue their claims.g.
additionally,the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of provides that if a debtor files a chapter petition within a year of dismissing a prior one,the automatic stay generally dissolves after days.see c west.and if the debtor dismisses and refiles more than two chapter petitions within a year,the automatic stay does not go into effect upon the filing of a third or subsequent petition.see id.c.although a debtor can argue that the stay should be in effect,the debtor bears the burden of rebutting,by clear and convincing evidence,a presumption that he or she filed the most recent petition in bad faith.see id.c 
further,a debtor who successively files and dismisses chapter cases risks losing,forever,her ability to obtain a discharge of the debts that would have been dischargeable in those chapter proceedings.the bankruptcy code,a,allows a court dismissing a bankruptcy petition,for cause,to order that the dismissal of the petition bars the later discharge of any debts that could have been discharged in the initial proceeding.
thus,congress has provided bankruptcy courts with numerous measures to ward off the dire loophole scenario tidewater forecasts.significantly,each of the measures discussed above allows the bankruptcy court to make an individualized determination of whether the debtor is acting in good faith.this permits honest debtors to make full use of the bankruptcy system,while empowering bankruptcy courts to screen out petitioners,precisely as congress intended.
our dissenting colleague would instead defy congressional intent by tolling the a period during the pendency of a debtor chapter proceeding.to reach this result,the dissent must contend that a is something that it manifestly is limitations period.the weakness of the argument offered by the dissent in support of this contention actually demonstrates the critical differences between a and limitations periods like that in young.
the dissent concedes that a,unlike typical limitations that in young,does not set forth a specified period of time that commences when the plaintiff here tidewater has or discovers it has a complete and present cause of action.young,at.emphasis added see post at.the dissent attempts to dismiss this difference by maintaining it has no intrinsic significance because a statute may operate as a limitations period by referencing any measuring point.post at.tellingly,the dissent offers no support for this contention.
the treatises on which the supreme court relied in young clearly reject this novel theory.they teach that s tatutes of limitation commence to run against a cause of action from the time it accrues,or from the time when the holder thereof has the right to apply to the court for relief,and to commence proceedings to enforce his rights.wood,limitation of actions,at dewitt moore,ed,cited approvingly in young,at.see also id,at t he statute of limitations only begins to run from the time when the right of action accrues id,at t he statute of limitations does not begin to run until there is a demand capable of present enforcement id,at t he different periods within which the remedies for the cases provided for are to be pursued are to be reckoned from the time the respective causes of action accrue accord calvin corman,limitation of actions,at because statutes of limitations do not begin to run against a cause until the action accrues,they are useful in preventing stale claims.the plaintiff can not be charged with delay before his or her cause of action has accrued,as it would be unreasonable for any legal system to commence the running of its statute of limitations before suit can legally be brought,cited approvingly in young,at.
thus,it has been long established that limitations periods begin to run when the claim they govern accrues.that continues to be the law.see,teamsters employers welfare trust gorman.ready mix,cir posner,a statute of limitations cuts off the right to sue at a fixed date after the cause of action accrued.stuart am.cyanamid,cir a statute of limitations establishes the time period within which lawsuits may be commenced after a cause of action has accrued.d limitation of actions ed a statute of limitations establishes a fixed period of time within which lawsuits must be commenced after a cause of action has accrued see also ledbetter goodyear tire rubber,d.
in sum,contrary to the dissent unsupported assertion,limitations periods run from the accrual of the cause of action they from any measuring point.because the a period does not begin to run from the accrual of the creditor claim,it does not cut off a remedy at a fixed date after th at cause of action accrued and so is not a limitations period.gorman,at.
moreover,although the dissent argues to the contrary,a fails to serve one of the critical purposes of all limitations periods,including that in young.
the supreme court in young held that all limitations provisions serve the purposes of repose,elimination of stale claims,and certainty regarding parties rights.at.quoting rotella wood,d emphasis added.the dissent contends generally that a serves the same purposes as the limitations period in young,post at,but then does not even attempt to demonstrate that a eliminat es stale claims.see post at discussing the statute furtherance of policies of repose,certainty,but omitting any discussion of how a furthers elimination of stale claims.
this omission is startling,since the elimination of stale claims is the raison of statutes of limitations.see,beach ocwen fed.bank,d t he object of a statute of limitation is to keep stale litigation out of the courts internal quotation marks omitted united states kubrick,d statutes of limitations represent a pervasive legislative judgment that the right to be free of stale claims in time comes to prevail over the right to prosecute them.internal quotation marks omitted guaranty trust united states.the statute of limitations is designed to protect the citizens from stale and vexatious claims weber bd.of harbor comm rs,wall.statutes of limitation protect parties from the prosecution of stale claims see also lekas united airlines,cir t he policy for limitations periods is that at some point the right to be free of stale claims comes to prevail over the right to prosecute them.omission in the original internal quotation marks omitted.surely it was for this reason that the supreme court in young held that one of the purposes served by all limitations provisions is eliminat ing stale claims.at.quoting rotella,at.emphasis added.
the dissent must avoid discussing whether a eliminates stale claims because the statute obviously does not serve this purpose.the expiration of the a period bears no relation to the age of a creditor claim.some creditors may benefit from the debtor ineligibility for discharge for nearly six years other creditors may lose the benefit the very day after their claim arises.to the extent a eliminates claims,it arbitrarily cuts down stale and very fresh claims alike.for this reason,it does absolutely nothing to further a critical stale by all,young,at,limitations periods.
in sum,the dissent own arguments conclusively demonstrate that a neither constitutes a statute of limitations nor serves the purposes animating such statutes.
for the foregoing reasons,the judgment of the district court is 
i concur in the majority opinion in this case.i briefly write separately because i am not unsympathetic to the concerns articulated by the dissent i simply disagree that this is the appropriate forum in which to address them.
under the bankruptcy code,the only relevant limitation imposed on williams is that she not have been granted a discharge under chapters or,in a case commenced within six years before the date of the filing of the petition.a.congress may well wish to comprehensively address the problem,identified by the dissent,created by a debtor who initiates multiple chapter proceedings between separate chapter petitions.congress has already constrained the relief available to chapter by expanding the waiting period between such filings from six to eight years.a west.it may similarly wish to exclude from that period any length of time during which chapter petitions are pending.to date,however,congress has not done so,and i am reluctant to fill that gap in a manner that does not comport with the express statutory language.
my reluctance is compounded by the fact that tidewater had several avenues of relief that were available to it here,but that it chose not to pursue.obviously,it could have sought to protect its claim during the significant period available to it,instead of choosing,for unexplained reasons,not to do so.further,it could have petitioned the court to terminate or condition the stays williams received.d.such relief would have been particularly appropriate if,as tidewater insinuates although never actually alleges,williams filings were in bad faith.given its lack of diligence and absence of prejudice,tidewater seems an unlikely candidate to claim the benefit of equitable tolling.
in lieu of the relief that was available to tidewater on these facts,the dissent view of the statute would turn the waiting period imposed on debtors into a statute of limitations subject to equitable tolling for the benefit of all creditors,whether or not prejudiced or deserving.i would prefer clearer congressional guidance before interpreting a statutorily defined waiting period in such a manner.
this chapter bankruptcy proceeding is the fifth bankruptcy proceeding that deborah williams has commenced since.tidewater finance company,a creditor of williams,contends that williams is not entitled to a discharge of debts because her petition was filed without allowing for the period of nondischargeability of debts to elapse.see a precluding discharge in chapter proceeding if debtor had been granted a discharge in a chapter proceeding filed within six years before the commencement date of the present proceeding.even though more than six calendar years elapsed between the filing dates of williams two chapter proceedings,tidewater finance argues that the period of nondischargeability should be calculated by excluding periods during which williams was pursuing three chapter proceedings and collection of her debts was stayed under a.
i agree.under the fully applicable reasoning of young united states,d,a period of nondischargeability should have been tolled during the pendency of williams three chapter petitions,when her creditors were denied their rights to enforce and collect her debts due to the bankruptcy code automatic stay.see a.therefore,williams is ineligible to receive a discharge in this proceeding,and tidewater finance is entitled to summary judgment to that effect.accordingly,i would reverse.
deborah williams financed the purchase of an automobile in october,signing a purchase money note and security agreement.after the note and security agreement were assigned to tidewater finance company,williams defaulted,and the automobile was repossessed and sold.in july,tidewater finance obtained a deficiency judgment against williams in virginia state court in the amount of plus interest.tidewater finance has not yet obtained satisfaction of the judgment,in large part because williams has lingered in multiple bankruptcy proceedings.
over the course of eight years,from to,williams filed five bankruptcy petitions,as follows 
she first filed a chapter bankruptcy petition on october,and obtained a discharge of debts.having received this fresh start,williams incurred new debts,including the automobile debt owed to tidewater finance.after incurring the tidewater finance debt,she filed chapter bankruptcy petitions on three separate occasions september,may,and august.williams voluntarily dismissed each of them,as authorized by b,before completing payments and obtaining a discharge.lastly,she filed her second and currently pending chapter petition on march,seeking a discharge of all dischargeable debts,including her debt to tidewater finance.
even though this last chapter petition was filed over seven years after williams commenced her previous chapter proceeding,the seven years were interspersed with three chapter proceedings that williams commenced.during the nearly three years that her chapter proceedings were pending,williams benefited from automatic stays of her creditors efforts to collect debts.see a.
tidewater finance commenced this action and filed a motion for summary judgment to oppose discharge in the currently pending chapter proceeding,claiming that williams was not eligible for a discharge because she did not allow six years of nondischargeability to elapse between filings,as required by the lookback period of a tidewater finance acknowledged that williams commenced her initial chapter case,in which a discharge was granted,more than six years before she filed the pending chapter petition.but it argued that the two years and days during which williams chapter petitions were pending and debt collection was stayed are excluded from the lookback period,under the principle of equitable tolling.therefore,her current chapter petition was filed too soon to allow creditors the period provided for in a.accordingly,she is ineligible for a discharge of debts in her present chapter case.
the bankruptcy court rejected tidewater finance equitable tolling argument and denied its motion for summary judgment,and the district court affirmed.reasoning as the bankruptcy court did,the district court stated that equitable tolling is inconsistent with the text of a and that even if a were subject to equitable tolling,it would be inappropriate to apply that doctrine here because tidewater voluntarily chose not to protect its rights during the period between williams chapter cases.
from the order of the district court,tidewater finance filed this appeal,raising the sole issue of whether a period should exclude the time during which williams was protected by chapter proceedings from the creditors efforts to collect debts.
because the resolution of this issue involves the construction of several provisions of the bankruptcy code,i begin with a recitation of the statutory scheme in which a functions.
chapter of the bankruptcy code provides for the liquidation and distribution of the assets of a debtor upon being adjudged bankrupt and discharged of debts.see et.under this proceeding,creditors usually receive a portion of the proceeds in lieu of full repayment of debts,and the debtor receives a fresh start through the discharge.see collier on bankruptcy ed.the discharge absolves the debtor of all debts existing when the chapter petition was filed,except for certain debts deemed nondischargeable by.see b.
because a chapter discharge is such strong medicine,the debtor may receive it only upon satisfying the conditions stated in a.see a see also kontrick ryan,d.one of these conditions is the passage of a period of nondischargeability,as provided in a 
the court shall grant the debtor a discharge,unless the debtor has been granted a discharge under chapter or chapter in a case commenced within years before the date of the filing of the petition.
a.section a thus prescribes a period during which a debtor is not entitled to protection against period of nondischargeability of debts incurred after a debtor obtained a fresh start under chapter.
section a unmistakable purpose is to prevent the creation of a class of habitual who might repeatedly escape their obligations as frequently as they chose by going through repeated bankruptcy.perry commerce loan,d.this purpose,the prevention of recurrent avoidance of debts,id.at,is clearly evident from the history of the period of nondischargeability.through an oversight,the bankruptcy act of placed no restrictions on how often a debtor could obtain discharges under chapter.concerned that certain individuals were obtaining repeated,frequent discharges in bankruptcy,congress enacted the limitation in.see act of february,ch,stat.see also in re seaholm,cir recounting the legislative history.accordingly,a period of nondischargeability of debts must now follow a debtor discharge under chapter.
because the limitation is imposed on the current petition and is determined by looking back to the previously filed petition in which a discharge was obtained,it is referred to as a lookback period.see young united states,d.
section a period of nondischargeability defines certain rights of a creditor in tandem with those of a debtor.the very term debtor implies the existence of a creditor who would enforce his right to collect monies owed from the debtor.the creditor rights are the inverse of the debtor.by making debts nondischargeable for six years,a provides a creditor a period within which to lend monies to the debtor and collect them without risk that the debtor may avoid his obligations through a discharge under chapter.
chapter provides individual debtors with an alternative method,distinct from chapter liquidation method,for dealing with debts in bankruptcy,altering the rights of such debtors and their creditors during the period of nondischargeability.chapter permits debtors,who often lack substantial assets,to repay their debts,under the bankruptcy court protection,according to an extension or composition plan funded out of future earnings.see collier on bankruptcy.while the chapter plans often permit the debtor to repay less than the full amount of their debts,chapter nonetheless promotes repayment by providing a framework for the orderly payment of debts out of future income that would be unavailable if the creditor tried to enforce its judgment by the liquidation of a debtor few assets.see,at,the benefit of chapter to creditors is their losses will be significantly less than if their debtors opt for straight bankruptcy.
generally speaking,under the code,a debtor could file a chapter petition and receive a discharge at any point,even immediately after obtaining a chapter discharge young,at.noting that the code does not prohibit chapter and chapter filings see also collier on bankruptcy.but this possibility of a debtor entering chapter proceedings soon after a chapter discharge was not intended to undermine a goal of preventing debtors from repeatedly escaping their obligations and granting creditors a period to lend and collect money safely.see perry,at.see also deans,cir congress never intended,of course,that chapter serve as a haven for debtors who wish to receive a discharge of unsecured debts without making an honest effort to pay those debts.while a debtor could avail himself of chapter within a period of nondischargeability,the intended function of chapter remained the facilitation of the debtor payment,not avoidance,of debts.indeed,upon a debtor receiving a chapter discharge,the period of nondischargeability under chapter began again.see a denying a chapter discharge if debtor received a chapter discharge within preceding six years.
contrary to the intended operation of chapter,however,certain features of its procedure created a loophole through which debtors could avoid their obligations through serial bankruptcy filings,thereby undermining a period of nondischargeability.as noted,upon the filing of a chapter petition,a debtor benefits from an automatic stay of any creditor action during the pendency of the petition.see a.yet,in keeping with the voluntary nature of chapter proceedings,b provides that o n request of the debtor at any time the court shall dismiss a case filed under chapter.emphasis added.section b thus permits the debtor to exit chapter at any point,having enjoyed the protection of the automatic stay and yet without having had to pay anything to creditors,nor having had to proceed to a discharge that would restart the clock on chapter period of nondischargeability.because the debtor controls the initiation and termination of the chapter proceeding,he could file a series of chapter proceedings,obtaining a stay with each filing,and thereby erode or even destroy the period of nondischargeability afforded creditors by a.thus,a debtor could obtain a chapter discharge incur new debts that would be nondischargeable during the period immediately file a chapter petition and invoke the automatic stay of a dismiss the chapter petition after the period has run but before receiving a chapter discharge and then file a chapter petition and receive a discharge of debts that were previously nondischargeable under a.
the supreme court in young,d,confronted this loophole in a related context and closed it by applying principles of equitable tolling.i would do the same here.
in young,the internal revenue service attempted to prevent debtors from obtaining a chapter discharge of a tax debt that appeared to fall outside of the lookback period of nondischargeability of tax debts,established by a a and a.at.section a a deems nondischargeable,among other debts,a tax of the kind and for the periods specified in section a.section a a in turn establishes priority of unsecured claims of governmental units for an income tax for a taxable year ending on or before the date of the filing of the bankruptcy petition for which a return,if required,is last due,including extensions,after three years before the date of the filing of the petition.read together,these sections provide that if a governmental unit has a claim for taxes for which the return was due within the three years that preceded the bankruptcy petition filing,the tax debt is deemed nondischargeable by a a.see young,at.
like williams,the debtors in young had filed and voluntarily dismissed a chapter petition,the pendency of which triggered the a automatic stay and prevented the irs from collecting the debt during the lookback period.after the lookback period ended,the debtors filed a chapter petition,seeking a discharge of the tax debt.the young court described the loophole,which is the same i described above,as follows 
since the code does not prohibit chapter and chapter filings as long as the debtor did not receive a discharge under chapter,see a,a debtor can render a tax debt dischargeable by first filing a chapter petition,then voluntarily dismissing the petition when the lookback period for the debt has lapsed,and finally refiling under chapter.during the pendency of the chapter petition,the automatic stay of a will prevent the irs from taking steps to collect the unpaid taxes,and if the chapter petition is filed after the lookback period has expired,the taxes remaining due will be dischargeable.
to close the loophole,the court applied equity,reasoning that the lookback period is a limitations period subject to traditional principles of equitable tolling.at.the court affirmed that limitations periods are customarily subject to equitable tolling,unless tolling would be inconsistent with the text of the relevant statute.id.at.quotation marks and citations omitted.traditionally,tolling has been applied in cases where the claimant has actively pursued his judicial remedies by filing a defective pleading during the statutory period,or where the complainant has been induced or tricked by his adversary misconduct into allowing the filing deadline to pass.id.at.quoting irwin dep t of veterans affairs,d.despite the absence of these traditional reasons for tolling,the young court concluded that tolling of the lookback period was appropriate in bankruptcy to close the loophole the youngs chapter petition erected an automatic stay under,which prevented the irs from taking steps to protect its claim.when the youngs filed a petition under chapter,the lookback period therefore excluded time during which their chapter petition was pending.id.at.the very fact that the irs was disabled from protecting its claim during the pendency of the chapter petition justified the tolling of the period.id.emphasis added.
the instant case resembles young in all material respects.young concluded that the lookback period of a a is a limitations period because it prescribes a period within which certain rights namely,priority and nondischargeability in bankruptcy may be enforced.see young,at.likewise,the period of a is a limitations period because it prescribes a period within which a certain under chapter be enforced.the young court then focused on the fact that the lookback period serves the same basic policies furthered by all limitations provisions repose,elimination of stale claims,and certainty about a plaintiff opportunity for recovery and a defendant potential liabilities.id.at.quoting rotella wood,d.section a provides a measure of repose after the lookback period elapses,debts become fully dischargeable,subject to chapter provisions.and a provides creditors and debtors with certainty that during the lookback period,debts may not be discharged under chapter.given the similarities between the lookback periods in young and this case,as well as the reasoning of young,one must conclude that a is a limitations period and therefore subject to tolling.
the majority opinion,however,reaches the opposite conclusion,holding that a is not a limitations period and therefore is not subject to tolling.ante at.citing cases that do not purport to define a limitations period,the majority declares two required elements of a limitations period subject to tolling the provision of a specified period of time within which the plaintiff must act to pursue a claim in order to preserve a remedy,and the period commenc ement when the plaintiff has or discovers that he has a complete and present cause of action.ante at citations omitted.
while these elements accurately describe many statutes of limitations,neither young,the most applicable precedent,nor any other authority cited by the majority suggests that these are necessary conditions for deeming a lookback period to be a limitations period.rather than elaborating a formal doctrine of the metaphysics of a limitations period,young instead assessed the lookback period a period within which certain rights may be its,certainty of parties rights.see at.
following young,bankruptcy courts have tolled a limitations period that lacks the majority elements and that is closely related to the limitations period at issue here.section a a imposes another condition on obtaining a chapter discharge,stating that the court shall grant the debtor a discharge,debtor,with intent to hinder,delay,or defraud a creditor has transferred,removed,destroyed,mutilated,or concealed property of the debtor,within one year before the date of the filing of the petition.this lookback period,which focuses on the debtor conduct,neither prescribes a period of time within which a claimant must act nor commences when the claimant has a complete cause of action.bankruptcy courts have nevertheless held that a a lookback period is tolled during the pendency of a debtor prior bankruptcy proceeding.see in re womble,aff.cir in re seeber,wl.july,in re riley,wl i april.
similarly,courts have tolled the lookback period in g of the bankruptcy code,even though it contains neither of the majority elements and functionally resembles a.section g prevents one from being a debtor under the bankruptcy code within days of having obtained a voluntary dismissal of an earlier filed case.see g.section g does not,on its face,prescribe a period of time within which a claimant must act.it operates with reference to the debtor conduct and does not commence when a cause of action of the creditor accrues.nonetheless,courts have routinely tolled g lookback period when a debtor conduct prevented creditors from being able to enforce their debts within its time frame.see,in re dickerson,in re moody,in re rives,in re berts,in re wilson.
even taking the majority on its own terms,only by a superficial reading of a can one say that it does not provide a specified period of time within which the creditor must act to preserve certain remedies.while a does not,on its face,address creditors,the obvious and undisputed operation of a is to set a time limit on the nondischargeability of debts,and thereby to set a time limit on creditors rights to enforce the nondischargeability of debts 
as for its second criterion,the majority notes that a lookback period is measured not from the time a creditor has a present cause of action but from the time a debtor files the first chapter petition.this distinction has no intrinsic significance,though.a statute may operate as a limitations period,prescribing a time within which rights may be enforced,by referencing any measuring point.and congress,of course,may choose any point it wishes from which to measure a limitations period.the majority is troubled that a could provide varying periods of time to enforce the nondischargeability of various debts,depending on the date the debts were incurred.while this result differs from the typical statute of limitations,it simply reflects congress choice of a different measuring point.indeed,the supreme court in young rejected a similar argument that a and a a did not constitute a limitations period because those sections create the potential for situations in which the irs would have less than three years to collect a tax debt.see at.
given that a is a limitations period under the fully applicable reasoning of young,it should be tolled unless tolling would be inconsistent with the text of the relevant statute.see young,at.quoting united states beggerly,d.tolling is appropriate here for the same reason the supreme court found it appropriate in chapter petition erected an automatic stay under a,which destroyed or reduced tidewater finance time for collecting the debt or enforcing its judgment.see id.at.because tidewater finance was so disabled during the pendency of the chapter petition,this period of disability tolled the lookback period when williams filed her chapter petition.id.at.
far from being inconsistent with a,tolling the lookback period during the pendency of a debtor chapter petitions promotes its purpose.section a is meant to require a debtor who has received a fresh start under chapter to spend six years acting financially responsibly,not avoiding debts through a discharge.see perry,at.in the same vein,a is meant to create certainty for creditors that the debts they are owed will not be discharged within that period.not only does this certainty benefit creditors,it also benefits debtors.with the protection afforded by the period of nondischargeability,creditors become more willing to lend money to debtors with poor credit histories due to a previous chapter discharge at lower rates than they would without the protection of a.
section a leaves open,of course,the possibility that a debtor might resort to chapter during the period,and so the period of nondischargeability is not unqualified.but a debtor who resorts to chapter and performs her obligations under the chapter plan will have made at least some payments to creditors out of her income.and creditors in a chapter proceeding are given certain protections,including the right to object to the chapter plan.see b.if a creditor makes such an objection,the plan may not be confirmed unless the creditor claim is paid in full or the plan directs that the full amount of the debtor disposable income in a period be paid to unsecured claims.id.then,upon the debtor completion of the chapter plan and the entry of a discharge,a new period of nondischargeability under chapter begins.see a.in these ways,the qualification on a lookback period posed by a chapter proceeding affords significant protections to creditors and works in harmony with the policies of a.it is the filing and dismissing of chapter petitions without taking steps toward making payments under a plan that eviscerates the a period of nondischargeability.tolling the period during these aborted chapter of whether they were deliberate attempts to avoid the period of dischargeability or therefore both necessary and appropriate to prevent the circumvention of a.
indeed,consider the perverse incentives the bankruptcy code would create if a period of nondischargeability were not tolled.one debtor who enters chapter and completes her chapter plan as intended by chapter,making payments to credi
