opinion of the court 
raymond ross appeals from a broad filing injunction issued against him by the bankruptcy court after he and his wife used the bankruptcy process to stave off the sheriff sale of their home.ross argues that,as a matter of law,a bankruptcy court may never issue a filing injunction against a chapter debtor who requests voluntary dismissal under b because doing so would undermine the debtor statutory rights.we disagree,and hold that a bankruptcy court does indeed have the authority to issue a filing injunction even in the context of approving a debtor b voluntary dismissal because nothing in the bankruptcy code express terms says otherwise.
however,we also find that the bankruptcy court filing injunction against ross can not survive this appeal due to this case particular circumstances.the bankruptcy court provided no reasoning for the broad nature of its filing injunction,which went well beyond what had been requested and what the bankruptcy court found appropriate in the case of ross wife.accordingly,we will vacate the injunction and remand this matter for further proceedings.

raymond appeal raises two main issues whether the bankruptcy code prohibits a bankruptcy court from issuing a filing injunction against a debtor who requests voluntary dismissal under b,and whether this case particular facts and circumstances indicate that the bankruptcy court abused its discretion in issuing a broad filing injunction.we hold that the answer to the first question is no,but find the answer to the second is yes.
raymond first argument is that bankruptcy courts may not impose a filing injunction after a debtor has motioned for voluntary dismissal pursuant to b.bankruptcy courts possess a general statutory authority to issue any order,process,or judgment that is necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of the bankruptcy code.a.and bankruptcy courts may also possess inherent power to sanction abusive litigation practices.law siegel,quoting marrama citizens bank of.but these broad equitable powers are not without limitation.in re combustion eng g,cir.as relevant here,for example,a bankruptcy court general authority does not extend to actions that conflict with specific,explicit,and express terms of the bankruptcy code.law,at.
