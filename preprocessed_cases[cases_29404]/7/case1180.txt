this appeal requires us to consider the relation between two statutes of illinois.one,the uniform commercial code,adopted in illinois as in all states,provides that the rights of an assignee of an account debtor are subject to a all the terms of the contract between the account debtor and the assignor and b any other defense or claim of the account debtor against the assignor which accrues before the account debtor receives notification of the assignment.ucc,ilcs.effective late to affect this was amended and renumbered,becoming ucc,ilcs.the language we have quoted was not materially changed,however.an account debtor is basically someone who owes money as a result of a contractual undertaking.ucc a,ilcs a see newcombe sundara,d,factofrance heller precision machinery.assignments of accounts are subject to article of the ucc.james white robert summers,uniform commercial code,ed.
the other statute,the illinois comptroller act,provides,so far as bears on this case,that whenever the state owes money to someone who owes the state money the comptroller may deduct the entire amount due and payable to the state.ilcs.in other words,the state has a right of setoff.furthermore,no sale,transfer or assignment of any claim or demand against the state,or right to a warrant on the treasurer,shall prevent or affect the right of the comptroller to make the deduction and provided in the foregoing section.ilcs.the potential tension between the comptroller act and the ucc lies in the fact that the former purports to create an unqualified right in the state to a setoff against an assignee while the latter makes assignees subject only to the terms of the original contract plus those defenses of the account debtor against the assignor that while they do not arise from the contract do at least accrue before the account debtor the assignor debtor,the state in this case learns of the assignment.the state defense in this case,namely a tax claim that it seeks to set off against a claim of payment for services to medicaid recipients,arose after the state received notice of the assignment.but if the right of setoff constituted a term of the assigned contract,the state can enforce the comptroller act without violating the ucc,common law,and explicitly contractual,and whether in favor of government entities or private commonplace.but illinois statute is unusual in providing that a class of setoffs is not to be affected by assignment.
the facts,at any rate,are simple.the law is complex and uncertain,as we shall see.doctors hospital assigned its accounts receivables to daiwa,and the receivables included money owed the hospital by the state under a contract whereby the state had agreed to reimburse the hospital for expenses incurred by the hospital in providing services to medicaid patients.the contract did not contain a clause authorizing the state to offset,against any amount it owed the hospital,tax or other obligations that the hospital might owe it had the contract contained such a clause,daiwa would have no ground for an appeal.see commerce bank,chrysler realty,cir kansas law.
doctors hospital went broke,and the state moved to lift the automatic stay against creditors enforcement actions to the extent necessary to enable the state to set off against the money it owed daiwa,as the hospital assignee,taxes that the hospital owed the state plus a small amount of medicaid overpayments that the state had made to the hospital.daiwa acknowledged that the latter setoff actually recoupment,as we see in a moment was proper,but not the former.the bankruptcy court agreed with daiwa and denied the state motion to lift the automatic stay,but the district court disagreed and allowed the setoff of the state taxes as well,rev,and daiwa appeals.the district court order granting the state motion to lift the automatic stay was final and therefore appealable to us.colon option one mortgage,cir see also in re james wilson associates,cir.
the state persuaded the district court that the comptroller act created an implied term in the contract between the state an account debtor by virtue of its medicaid contract with the hospital and the hospital the assignor of the accounts receivable arising from the contract that bound the assignee daiwa.if this is right,then there is no inconsistency between the two statutes and we would not have to consider which prevails if they do ucc because it was adopted in illinois before the latest version of the comptroller act and repeals by implication are said to be disfavored,posadas national city bank,and because it deals specifically with assignments or the comptroller act because the original act,an antique dating back to la pine scientific lenckos,d,preexisted the ucc and deals specifically with setoffs arising from state contracts whichever statute were held to prevail would necessarily be repealing the other by implication,since the current comptroller act is newer than the ucc making the ucc repealed by implication if the comptroller act prevails but the ucc is newer than the original comptroller act making the comptroller act repealed by implication if the ucc prevails.
daiwa has,as we have indicated,no quarrel with the state deducting from what daiwa is owed the overpayments that the state made to the hospital.the state never owed the hospital the full amount of the accounts receivables because it had overpaid,and so the full amount was not the hospital to assign to daiwa.recoupment of that amount merely conformed the assignee debt to the express terms of the contract between the account debtor and the assignor.in re tlc hospitals,cir united states consumer health services of america.but the taxes are an unrelated debt of the hospital to the state,and while the medicaid contract could have contained a provision expressly entitling the state to set off any taxes the hospital owed it against any medicaid payments that it owed the hospital,it did not.
the state does not rely on a common law right of setoff we not sure why.although we said in another case that common law setoffs are permitted only when the debts are mutual,and debts arising at different times out of different circumstances are not mutual,soo line escanaba lake superior,cir,the general rule is that mutuality is satisfied when the offsetting obligations are held by the same parties in the same capacity that is,as obligor and obligee and are valid and enforceable,and if the issue arises in bankruptcy both offsetting obligations arise either prepetition or postpetition,even if they arose at different times out of different transactions.in re davidovich,cir see,in re bevill,bresler schulman asset management,cir in re bay state york,in re thurston.
there is disagreement,however,over whether different agencies of the same state government are one party or more than one party for mutuality purposes if the latter,the held by the same parties requirement of mutuality is not satisfied.compare in re lakeside community hospital,state agencies not one entity for setoff purposes,aff,with in re bison heating equipment,state agencies,as creatures of the state are a single entity capable of holding mutual credits and debts,and in re bennett,same.in united states maxwell,cir,we held that different federal agencies are to be treated as one for setoff purposes,but there does not appear to be a definitive ruling concerning the status of illinois state agencies.
because the state is not invoking a common law right of setoff and there is no express setoff provision in the medicaid contract,the state needs the comptroller act to have any right to deduct the taxes that the hospital owes it from the money that it owes daiwa by virtue of the hospital assignment of its accounts receivables to the latter.
the district court ruled,as we said,that the act created an implied term in the contract between doctors hospital and the state,binding daiwa as the assignee of doctors hospital rights under the contract.s tatutes are a source of implied contractual uniform commercial code being the most common such like common law doctrines,such as the duty of good faith,which in illinois is read into all contracts.selcke new england ins,cir citations omitted see schiro gould.it seems plain enough that if an illinois statute expressly provided that every medicaid contract entitled the state to a setoff of any money owed it by the medicaid contractor,a right of setoff would become a term in all such contracts by operation of law.in re estate of dierkes,brandt time ins,d,lincoln towers ins.agency,boozell,d.daiwa would still argue that implied terms,though effective between the parties to the contract,should not be deemed within the reach of section a of the ucc,because section which persists in the successor provision,ucc d provides that a term in any contract between an account debtor and an assignor is ineffective if it prohibits assignment in addition,as we noted in bank of america,moglia,cir,the common law of illinois is hostile to antiassignment clauses,though less so than the common law of many states.see piasecki liberty life assurance,d,henderson roadway express,d.but the argument would fail.a prohibition against assignment is just that,a prohibition,which is not the same thing as subjecting an of course that assignment has not been his assignor contractual duties.section a does that explicitly,and we can not find any cases,whether interpreting section of the uniform commercial code or applying the common law policy against antiassignment clauses,that suggest that such clauses allow an assignment to wipe out all defenses against assignors.few people would agree to contracts that allowed the other party,by assigning the contract,to escape all its contractual obligations.
still,bearing in mind the objective of the policy against antiassignment clauses,namely the objective of facilitating assignment by protecting assignees against unsuspected obligations of their assignors,one might want to distinguish between a duty giving rise to a defense stated in the contract itself,and therefore obvious to the assignee at the time of the assignment,and a duty that could be discovered only by searching the statute books.an analogy might be drawn to the distinction in property law between covenants that do and covenants that do not run with the land.the former are effective against subsequent purchasers but the latter are not unless expressed in the subsequent sale contract.spencer case,eng,see also fidelity guarantee old orchard plaza limited partnership,d,purvis shuman.the reason for the difference is that covenants are allowed to run with the land only if they regulate the use of the land for example,a covenant against building a fence and so are discoverable by a search of the title records or by visual inspection if they arise from unrelated contracts,they are not readily discoverable and so they do not bind subsequent purchasers unless repeated in the contracts with those purchasers.susan french,toward a modern law of servitudes reweaving the ancient strands,cal.daiwa could glean the express terms of its assignor medicaid contracts just by reading the contracts.but it could discover the comptroller act by reading the contracts and anyway the act itself is not as specific not quite,at any rate as the variant of it that we hypothesized in the previous paragraph.
these arguments prove too much they imply that no implied contractual terms are enforceable against assignees,which is false.hasse contracting kbk financial.an assignor can assign only what he has,and so,as the cases say,the assignee stands in the shoes of the assignor.collins carboline,block pepper construction,d,bank of waunakee rochester cheese sales,cir national city bank columbian mutual life ins,cir.otherwise assignment would be a method of shucking off contractual obligations without the consent of the obligee.section a of the uniform commercial code,and its successor provision,are explicit in subjecting the assignee to the contractual duties assumed by the assignor.and the binding terms of a contract include implied as well as express terms.for example,in illinois a duty of good faith is,as we noted earlier,read into every contract.can an assignee nevertheless collect a debt based on his assignor bad faith surely not.and if common law doctrines create implied terms that bind assignees,so,obviously,should statutory doctrines.
we are mindful that bank of kansas hutchinson health services,the principal case on which daiwa relies,analyzed the kansas statutory right to setoff.stat.ann,which is much the same as section of the illinois comptroller act,under section b of the ucc.but it is not a compelling precedent.the court did not discuss the possibility that the applicable subsection was actually a even though kansas law accepts the proposition that applicable or relevant and valid statutes,ordinances,regulations,and settled law at the time the contract was made become a part of the contract and must be read into it,unless a contrary intention is shown.heartland premier,group b b,d.other cases as well treat statutory and common law setoff rights under subsection b,see bank of waunakee rochester cheese sales,supra,at in re davidson lumber sales,cir chase manhattan bank state,but again without considering the applicability of a.hasse contracting kbk financial,supra,is to the contrary,treating a new mexico statute that required prompt payment of contractual obligations in public works projects as incorporated into the contracts,thus giving rise to a defense governed by section a.
bringing implied terms within the reach of section a does not make subsection b superfluous.a contract party might have a defense that did not arise out of the contract itself and therefore was not subject to subsection a.suppose that a and b have two contracts,the first is silent on setoff,there is no applicable statute entitling either party to an offset,and the contracts are not related closely enough for common law setoff to be available.the second contract,however,contains a provision entitling a to set off any debt to b arising from that contract against any debt of b to a arising from the first contract.if b had assigned the first contract to c before making the second one,a,which let assume is owed money by b on the second contract,could not defend against c on the basis of the setoff clause in the second contract,because c when it took the assignment had no notice of a setoff right.a more common example for we can not find any cases corresponding to our hypothetical would be where the second contract modified the first but that example is the subject of a separate provision of section,section.perhaps,then,we should have said that bringing implied terms within the reach of section a does not make subsection b completely superfluous.
the state wants to be able to set off taxes and other money owed it against any state debts,and this policy would be compromised if the right of setoff could be defeated by section of the comptroller act.without a right of setoff it is unlikely that the state will be able to collect any of the taxes owed it by doctors hospital.according to its chapter petition,doctor hospital when it declared bankruptcy had total assets of some million and total liabilities of million of which million was secured debt,an amount greatly in excess of the hospital assets.so if there is no right of setoff,the state will get nothing.assignments of accounts receivables are common and would on daiwa approach render state taxes uncollectible in many cases in which an assignor owed money by the state assigns his right to collect the money and then becomes insolvent owing secured debt.the principal effect of ruling for daiwa might be to induce the state to include explicit setoff rights in its contracts,in which event such a ruling would merely have increased the costs of transacting.
the problem of notice that we mentioned earlier is not a compelling objection to deeming the comptroller act to have created an implied term in the contract between the state and the hospital.daiwa when it took the assignment of that contract knew that it was getting rights against the state,and in the exercise of the normal due diligence for a substantial transaction would have looked up any state laws that might limit those it is well known tha
