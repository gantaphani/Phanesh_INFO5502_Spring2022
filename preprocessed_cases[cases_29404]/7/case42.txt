this is a bankruptcy case,though the parties go at it like a couple of brawlers,hurling a barrage of arguments and trash talk at each other at every turn.we need not jump too deeply into the fray,however,because we lack jurisdiction over the appeal.we will explain our holding which makes new law for this circuit shortly.first,some background.
the combatants 
in one corner,we have pinpoint it services,llc.pinpoint is a virginia company with a principal place of business in virginia.in the other corner,we have noemi landrau rivera,the chapter bankruptcy trustee for atlas it export.atlas was a puerto rico company with a principal place of business in puerto rico.
dueling federal court lawsuits 
during late and early,pinpoint and atlas filed dueling actions based on a contract between them.here is the cliffnotes version of what happened.atlas sent pinpoint a letter requesting that it preserve certain evidence in anticipation of future litigation.pinpoint then threw what it hoped would be a knockout blow,suing atlas in the eastern district of virginia the virginia action on the theory that atlas and not pinpoint had breached the contract between them.after some procedural dustups not relevant here,atlas moved to change venue to the district of puerto rico.but before the judge could rule,atlas sued pinpoint in the district of puerto rico the puerto rico action.pinpoint filed its answer and counterclaim in the puerto rico action,the latter of which simply said that pinpoint incorporates by reference its complaint in the virginia action.a few weeks later,the judge in the virginia action denied atlas motion,emphasizing among other things that a plaintiff choice of forum is entitled to substantial deference,that pinpoint picked a forum where most of the events giving rise to the virginia action occurred,and that the balance of convenience did not favor the district of puerto rico.atlas filed its answer and counterclaim in the virginia action.and pinpoint asked the judge in the virginia action to enjoin the puerto rico action from continuing.
squaring off in the bankruptcy court 
about two months after answering and counterclaiming pinpoint in the virginia action,atlas filed for bankruptcy under chapter of the bankruptcy code.what typically happens in a chapter bankruptcy is that the debtor gives up assets and in exchange gets relief from certain debts thus scoring a fresh start of sorts.marrama citizens bank of.anyway,pinpoint filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy case,claiming atlas owed it.and landrau rivera became the trustee in the case,called into service by the united states trustee office.
atlas filing automatically stayed the virginia and puerto rico actions,naturally.see a.the judges in both actions entered orders recognizing that reality.but atlas and the trustee which is how we will refer to landrau rivera from now on asked the bankruptcy court to modify the stay so the puerto rico action could go forward.pinpoint then renewed its request that the judge in the virginia action enjoin the puerto rico action,noting that the judge in the virginia action did not rule on its original injunction request before the automatic stay.but that judge denied that motion.acting on atlas and the trustee request for stay relief,the bankruptcy court heard from the trustee that the stay modification should cover not only atlas continued prosecution of its complaint in the puerto rico action but also pinpoint prosecution of its counterclaim.the bankruptcy court asked pinpoint counsel how modifying the stay like this would prejudice his client.his answer was that the puerto rico action was duplicative of the virginia action.unpersuaded by pinpoint protests,the court modified the stay as atlas and the trustee had requested,allowing the puerto rico action both atlas claims and pinpoint counterclaims to proceed to judgment.
apparently feeling like it had been sucker punched,pinpoint asked the bankruptcy court to modify the stay so the virginia action could go forward too.the gist of pinpoint argument was that the stay kept the judge in the virginia action from applying the rule.what that rule basically says is that if two district courts have jurisdiction over the same controversy,then the court with the action should typically get first dibs on deciding the case.see codex milgo,cir noting that,like most,this rule is not without exceptions,and adding that w hile the rule may ordinarily be a prudent one,it is so only because it is sometimes more important that there be a rule than that the rule be particularly sound and pinpoint insisted that because the bankruptcy court had modified the automatic stay to let the action the puerto rico action proceed first,it would turn the rule on its head not to allow the action the virginia action to proceed too but,the bankruptcy court stressed,pinpoint had not shown how it might be harmed if the parties had to spar over the rule before the judge in the puerto rico action.and because the issue can be actively litigated in the district court of puerto rico,the bankruptcy court expressly avoided taking a position on that issue.also,the court said,lifting the stay in the virginia action would adversely affect the bankruptcy estate.that is so,to quote the court,because as proffered by the trustee,the estate does not have counsel in virginia and sufficient funds on hand to hire counsel to defend itself against pinpoint claim in virginia or to prosecute its counterclaim in the virginia litigation.and,the court found,granting pinpoint stay relief would disserve efficiency concerns,because a similar case,the puerto rico action is already going forward.so having found that pinpoint had not shown cause to lift the automatic stay,the court denied the motion.see d letting bankruptcy courts lift automatic stays for cause.
an unhappy pinpoint appealed to the bap.but the bap eventually concluded that the order did not amount to a final decision from which pinpoint could appeal as a matter of right.the challenged order,the bap reasoned,only decided that pinpoint could not presently proceed in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia,based upon principles related to judicial economy,as well as the best interests of the estate and creditors.but to quote the bap again the order did not bar pinpoint from trying to prove its case,or from arguing the rule,in the united states district court for the district of puerto rico.consequently,the bap dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.not willing to throw in the towel,pinpoint appealed that decision to us which is what this opinion deals with.
pinpoint then asked the judge in the virginia action to enjoin the puerto rico action,arguing that the trustee litigation tactics in puerto rico federal district court flew in the face of the rule.atlas counterpunched by filing an adversary complaint in the bankruptcy case,charging pinpoint with violating the automatic stay and asking for sanctions plus injunctive relief against its foe.unimpressed,pinpoint moved to dismiss the adversary proceeding letting the trustee proceed with the puerto rico action offended the first filed rule and thus entitled pinpoint to file defensive pleadings like the injunction request without running afoul of the automatic stay or so pinpoint argued.but given pinpoint appeal here from the denial of its request,the judges in both actions opted to suspend all proceedings in their courts and defer ruling on the motions pending our decision.
our jurisdiction 
what is before us is pinpoint appeal from the bap judgment dismissing pinpoint challenge to the bankruptcy court order.true to form,the parties bloody each other with arguments,this time tussling over our jurisdiction to hear pinpoint appeal we have it,pinpoint insists not so,says atlas as well as the merits of that appeal the decisions of both the bankruptcy court and the bap violated the rule,pinpoint exclaims hardly,argues atlas.we begin and ultimately end with the jurisdiction issue.
pinpoint bases our jurisdiction on d,which so far as relevant here lets us review appeals from final decisions,judgments,orders,and decrees by the bap the question then is whether the bap dismissal of pinpoint bap appeal for lack of finality amounts to a final order.but the answer depends on whether the bankruptcy court order denying pinpoint stay relief constitutes a final order.we think that it does not,though we readily admit that this is no easy legal issue.
first principles 
normally we treat a action as a single judicial unit from which only one appeal can be made.in re saco local dev,cir breyer.but because a bankruptcy case is quite often a conglomeration of separate cases that lives on for many years,we take a flexible approach to finality here,giving that requirement a practical rather than a technical construction.in re parque forestal,cir quoting gillespie steel,overruled in part on other grounds by hartford underwriters ins.union planters bank,parque,from here on out see also bullard,wl,at.for example,we have stamped an order final where there is no possibility at the time of appeal that the order will be changed or become moot,or that piecemeal appeals will waste the time of this court or the parties indicators of finality,one and all.see parque,at.what this means is that in the world of bankruptcy,final does not just describe the last order entered at the case end you know,the one that ultimately disposes of all the debtor assets on the basis perhaps of the results of many individual proceedings and controversies taking place over many years within the context of the overall bankruptcy case.tringali hathaway mach,cir breyer.no,final includes an order that decides all repeat,all the issues of a discrete dispute within a larger case.id.quoting in re am.colonial broad,cir henceforth,colonial see also bullard,wl,at.
extra circuit caselaw on orders denying stay relief 
now consider orders dealing with requests.orders granting stay relief are orders disposing of a discrete dispute and so are final and appealable as of right on this point every circuit including this one that has considered the question agrees they are final,we have said,echoing the third circuit,because n othing more need be done by the district court or the bankruptcy court on the matter of the automatic stay.as for orders denying stay relief which is the focus of our attention today the vast majority of the circuits that have reviewed the matter consider all such edicts final and appealable too,regardless of circumstances judge kayatta dissent emphasizes this point.we do not diminish the importance of the other circuits supporting the blanket rule which is what we call it.but we see nothing inherently troubling about contributing to a circuit split.the numbers favoring a rule do not necessarily mean that the rule is the best one.indeed,there is an observable phenomenon in our courts of appeal and elsewhere sometimes called herding or cascading where decisionmakers who first encounter a particular issue,the first court to consider a question are more likely to rely on the record presented to them and their own reasoning,while later courts are increasingly more likely to simply go along with the developing group consensus.andrew daughety jennifer reinganum,stampede to judgment persuasive influence and herding behavior by courts,am.econ.we think it is always incumbent on us to decide afresh any issue of first impression in our circuit.
lots of courts reached that blanket rule primarily by way of analogy,saying things like a denial of relief from an automatic stay in bankruptcy is equivalent to a permanent injunction and is thus a final order.even there,an important factor was whether the order fully decided the issue that sparked the request in the first place 
but not every circuit that has confronted this question has signed on to that blanket rule we have in mind the third circuit,whose approach is of a decidedly less categorical stripe,reflecting a,style of analysis take west,for example.the government there moved for relief from the automatic stay so that it could try to cancel its contract with the debtor the bankruptcy court denied the motion,the district court affirmed,and the government appealed discussing ordinary signs of finality,the third circuit noted that finality in bankruptcy matters occurs when nothing remains for the lower court to do.canvassing the authorities elsewhere broadly holding that an order denying relief from the automatic stay is final,the third circuit stressed that those edicts had conclusively decided the contested issue so that from the creditor perspective the bankruptcy court had nothing further to do the third circuit then contrasted the challenged order from one that denied stay relief without prejudice because the record was incomplete,discovery was ongoing or the court required further research on the issue before it each a sign of nonfinality ultimately,the third circuit concluded that the edict was indeed final because the bankruptcy court had considered and rejected the government legal arguments about whether it was entitled to cancel the contract the consequence of the bankruptcy court decision,the court wrote,was to reject the government legal positions as the passage of time would not have made them more tenable.note too that the third circuit did not get bogged down over whether the government argument was it simply eyed the bankruptcy court order to see if the lower court had decided that discrete issue.
pinpoint thinks the blanket rule should be the law in this circuit.atlas,not so much.until today we have found it unnecessary to take a position on the issue.see united states fleet bank of in re calore express,cir calore,for the rest of the opinion declining to reach the question whether a bankruptcy court refusal to lift the automatic stay may ever lack finality.but the opening bell has sounded for us to address this issue and so we go the distance.
calore actually helps point the way.there we highlighted the caselaw underlying the blanket rule,see id.explaining that n umerous circuits have held that a district court affirmance or reversal of the bankruptcy court decision whether to lift the automatic stay is final,often without qualifying that holding the very caselaw pinpoint pins its jurisdictional hopes on.but we chose not to embrace the blanket rule right then and there.instead we found finality existed there because a the bankruptcy court order decide d the relevant dispute that prompted the request,whether the court should lift the stay so the government could set off claims of two federal agencies including the irs against the debtor contract claims against the government and because b the appellant would have no recourse if we did not consider it final.see id.at.
what we did in calore jibes with our past decisions spotlighted above,which a require us to keep in mind the uniqueness of bankruptcy litigation,with its multiple layers of proceedings within proceedings and its many moving parts and which b command us to scout for finality indicators,like whether the disputed order conclusively decided a discrete,issue an order that,at the time of the appeal,will not be changed or be mooted and is not reviewable elsewhere.see,parque,at tringali,at.and respect for the path marked by our prior cases tringali,parque,and calore,for example requires us to reject the blanket rule that denials of stay relief are always final,no ifs,ands,or buts.as we see things,that rule clashes with our caselaw because it turns a cold shoulder to bankruptcy unusual nature and makes an order appealability turn on the label affixed to it order denying stay relief,and the like rather than on finality telltales.
as for what appears to be one of the blanket rule animating ideas that an automatic stay is like an injunction and so is final and appealable here is our take yes,an automatic stay enjoins parties from acting.see soares brockton credit union in re soares,cir.but it is different from an injunction.that is because the operation of the stay is the default position.see id.congress in its wisdom has already decided that the parties interests are best protected by automatically staying litigation against the bankrupt.see id.in other words,congress has already decided the balance of equities with that balance being one of the four elements for a preliminary injunction.see mercado salinas bart enters.int l,cir listing likelihood of success,risk of irreparable harm,balance of equities,and the public interest as the four factors.consequently,the automatic stay continued operation thanks to the denial of stay relief should not be treated for finality purposes like an injunction entered at the case start after a judge has sifted the familiar injunction factors.see generally sunshine,fdic,cir commenting that b ecause the automatic stay is exactly what the name implies automatic it operates without the necessity for judicial intervention.
as for the other benefits of this and frankly any other blanket rule uniformity and judicial economy we are not convinced that these ends are best served by stamping all denials of automatic stay relief immediately appealable.indeed,it is a narrow view of judicial economy that attributes time savings to a blanket jurisdictional rule here.sure,it would make the section of our opinions a onesentence pronouncement that requires little,if any,analysis.but it is far from certain that a particular bankruptcy case or bankruptcy cases in the aggregate would be more efficient with a blanket rule of appealability.bankruptcy courts deny relief from the automatic stay based on circumstances that are often rapidly changing and on records that are not fully developed.letting parties appeal as of right in such situations inevitably will result in appeals that are superseded by events in related proceedings.a more nuanced approach avoids this unnecessary judging.also,without a blanket rule,parties will not reflexively appeal from the denial of a request for relief from the automatic stay.instead,they will have to think through the finality issue themselves given the guidance provided here.that by the parties will contribute to overall judicial economy in bankruptcy cases.
the short of this long analysis is that we reject pinpoint preferred approach.like the third circuit,we think it possible that in some cases an order denying stay relief may lack finality.everything depends on the circumstances,naturally taking into account the particular order reasoning and effect,an inquiring court must determine consistent with our past opinions on finality whether that edict definitively decided a discrete,issue that is not reviewable somewhere else.see tringali,at.if yes,the order is final if no,it is not.lawyers and judges please take note,however the inquiry turns not on whether the order conclusively decided the merits of the underlying litigation a mistake made in some bap,but rather as we just said on whether the order conclusively decided the,issue that triggered the fight below.
application 
when measured against the correct standard,the order denying stay relief here is not final though it certainly is a close call.here is why.
what prompted pinpoint plea was a venue concern that the rule requires the lifting of the stay so that the judge in the virginia action can referee the contract dispute.that is the relevant discrete issue,not to be clear which party should win the contract suit.but in concluding that pinpoint had not shown cause for stay relief,the bankruptcy court specifically avoided deciding the issue remember,the court relied instead on its finding that pinpoint bid clashed with other considerations,including important efficiency interests.critical to the court reasoning was the fact that pinpoint can litigate the issue in the puerto rico action,which the court had so that the parties could duke it out on the contract claims.
the judge in the puerto rico action has not yet had a chance to weigh in on the,issue.but once he does,he could conclude that the rule applies and that he must stay his own proceedings or consolidate them with the virginia action thereby shipping the whole case to virginia.and if that happens,then pinpoint can ask the bankruptcy court for stay relief based on that turn of events.if,however,the judge in the puerto rico action decides that the rule does not apply and that venue is proper there,pinpoint can again ask the bankruptcy court to lift the stay against the virginia action,on the theory that it has no other way to stop the parallel action in puerto rico.either way,the bankruptcy court will get to decide the question again,this time on a betterdeveloped record.and the court may very well lift the stay,depending on how the question is decided 
or,to look at this another way basically what the bankruptcy court did was specify the venue the puerto rico district court that gets first crack at deciding the issue a decision that will reveal which federal court puerto rico or virginia gets to preside over the contract case.so,as the situation now stands,pinpoint can litigate everything the issue and the contract imbroglio.it just has no guarantee that it will litigate in its preferred venue.generally codex milgo,cir holding that orders granting or denying venue transfer are customarily not appealable as of right.ultimately this concatenation of circumstances an order that does not decide the issue the very issue that prompted pinpoint stayrelief effort,but instead leaves pinpoint free to go with atlas on that issue in another forum,with a possibility that pinpoint will get what it wants in the end undercuts pinpoint finality claim 
on the ropes,pinpoint tries to pound away on several fronts.but not a single blow lands.
for openers pinpoint pounces on a passage in calore saying that we have jurisdiction to review an order of the bankruptcy court refusing to lift the automatic stay when the order resolves all issues between the parties.at.according to pinpoint,that excerpt must mean that an order denying stay relief is final if there are no unresolved issues between the parties pending in the bankruptcy court and only in the bankruptcy court.it matters not the thesis runs that the order leaves an issue like the rule resolvable in a forum.and to pinpoint way of thinking,since the order denying stay relief left zero unresolved issues between the parties pending resolution by the bankruptcy court,that order is final and appealable as a matter of right.
unfortunately for pinpoint,a large problem looms.even assuming for argument sake only that its reading of calore is correct and we intimate no view on the subject,there is an adversary action in the bankruptcy court that could resolve the issue in pinpoint favor recall,pinpoint put that issue front and center there in moving to dismiss atlas adversary complaint,telling the bankruptcy court things like the rule demands that if atlas claim against pinpoint is to proceed,it must proceed in the virginia federal court.and that fact knocks the legs out from under pinpoint leadoff argument.
wait a second,exclaims pinpoint.atlas initiated adversary proceedings after the bap deemed the order denying stay relief and dismissed pinpoint appeal for lack of jurisdiction.so unless the bap was reading tea leaves when it took that step,pinpoint adds,there was no pending bankruptcy court adversary proceedings to legitimize the bap dismissal.how this chronology affects our jurisdiction pinpoint does not say.but even continuing to assume again,without deciding that the presence of an adversary proceeding matters for jurisdictional purposes and we whisper no hint either way the record before us does include an unresolved adversary proceeding in place.and that fact kiboshes this line of argument.
in something of a parting shot,pinpoint says that it is up to the judge in the virginia action to decide the issue,not the judge in the puerto rico action.to lend plausibility to its point,pinpoint leans heavily on cadle whataburger of alice,cir.but even assuming that cadle squares with our circuit law and we say nothing about whether it does or does not,that opinion holds that the court can decide if the issues in the two cases might substantially overlap.id.at quoting mann hortex,cir.a yes answer,cadle says,means that the court must then transfer the case to the court to decide which case should continue.id.at.the import of all this is clear even under pinpoint caselaw,the judge in the puerto rico action can participate in any slugfest over the rule which means pinpoint final argument sails wide of the mark.
last words 
our work complete,we dismiss pinpoint appeal for lack of jurisdiction.costs to atlas.so ordered.
i agree with my respected colleagues that pinpoint appeal provides no basis upon which to reverse the ruling of the bankruptcy court refusing to lift the automatic stay.i nevertheless dissent from the judgment of dismissal,because this court should decide this case by ruling on the merits,rather than by creating a circuit split in order to find the challenged order of the bankruptcy court.bankruptcy law is an area in which uniformity has particular value.see daniel austin,bankruptcy and the myth of uniform laws,seton hall,erwin chemerinsky,decision makers in defense of courts,am.pointing to expertise and uniformity as the two major advantages of specialized bankruptcy courts.and as my colleagues acknowledge,seven of the eight other circuits that have ruled on the appealability of orders denying relief from the automatic stay have held that such orders are categorically appealable even the third circuit,which was until now the only federal court of appeals to so much as feint in the direction of a rule admitting of an exception,has itself never encountered an order that fell within the exception it hypothesized.indeed,in the dictum in which it postulated such an exception,the court sketched that exception contours so narrowly as to ensnare only tentative that deny relief without prejudice because the record is incomplete,discovery is ongoing,or the court require s further research on the issue before it.see in re west elecs,cir 
the majority is certainly correct that we should not join our sister circuits simply to form a herd.at the same time,though,the majority can not dispute the notion that,at the margins and this case is certainly there,see majority,at,uniformity has a positive value,especially in setting federal bankruptcy law.see,art.i,cl.granting congress the power to adopt uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies throughout the united states.and while the majority speculates that its more nuanced approach preserves resources and inhibits unnecessary appeals as compared to the uniform approach of seven other circuits,my knowledgeable colleagues point to no appeal in any would have been precluded or rendered less difficult by adoption of the majority rule.in this important respect,the majority approach values abstraction borne of theory rather than pragmatism borne of experience.
my colleagues are also correct,of course,that relief from the automatic stay differs from a typical injunction because congress has effectively determined that,in bankruptcy,an injunction is the default position.and i need not quibble with the conclusion that this determination represents an implicit judgment that the equities in bankruptcy are more likely to weigh in favor of an injunction,at least initially.in this manner,congress has placed on the party opposing the automatic stay the burden of seeking and justifying a change in the status quo.so far,so good.where the majority then errs conceptually is in finding the reallocation of the burden of changing the status quo to justify a heightened degree of stinginess in allowing an appeal from a ruling preventing such a change.this can not be correct.history,custom,and practice make the default position in ordinary,civil cases no injunction,thereby placing the burden of seeking and justifying an injunction on the party desiring to change the tentative status quo.yet it is clear that appeals by parties who are unsuccessful in securing a injunction are routinely allowed.in short,the question of which party has the burden of changing the default status quo has no logical bearing on the question of appealability.in each instance,the lower court has exercised its equitable jurisdiction in a manner that immediately resolves a putative claim of irreparable harm.and in each instance,an appeal should be allowed to review that decision.
even under the majority new test,the justification for refusing to hear this appeal is weak.in concluding otherwise,the majority swims even against the current in our own circuit.as the majority correctly concedes,in re calore,cir,did not decide whether a refusal to lift the automatic stay is or is not always appealable.rather,it did only what it needed to do it decided that the refusal to lift the automatic stay in that particular case was appealable.and in making that finding,the court relied simply on the fact that the bankruptcy court clearly did decide the relevant dispute between the parties.id.in the case now before us,the relevant dispute concerns not which court hears the merits of the case,but rather,which court will decide that question.and by sending the case to puerto rico for a resolution of the firstfiled issue,the bankruptcy court did indeed decide that dispute finally against pinpoint that relevant dispute may be rarified,and any harm speculative.but those are reasons to deny the appeal on the merits,not to create an idiosyncratic exception to the norm that such orders are appealable.
years ago,judge winter observed that the purpose of the finality rule,judicial economy,would not be served by an ad hoc,case sensitive approach to determining jurisdiction over orders denying relief from the stay.in re sonnax,at.the reasoning the majority provides today proves that warning prescient,as the court finds itself unable to decline jurisdiction without resting explicitly on an rejection of pinpoint argument that,as an incident of its status as,it is entitled to litigate not only the merits of its case,but also its venue challenges,in virginia.see majority op,at e ven under pinpoint caselaw,the judge in the puerto rico action can participate in any slugfest over the rule,which means pinpoint final argument sails wide of the mark,so,as the situation now stands,pinpoint can litigate everything,the issue and the contract imbroglio.it just has no guaranty that it will litigate in its preferred venue.compare sonnax,at warning that t he jurisdictional ruling will necessarily require a full briefing of all issues and consume as much judicial resources as an appeal as i understand the majority rule,if pinpoint were correct in claiming an entitlement,notwithstanding any countervailing consideration,to litigate venue in virginia,we would take jurisdiction.indeed,under the majority rule,the only cases in which there will be no jurisdiction are precisely those cases,such as this one,in which the merits decision is straightforward.because the majority jurisdictional rule requires us to analyze the merits even while it purports to shield us from having to do so,the rule which can not be said to flow from either a constitutional or a statutory requirement fails even to further the single could provide it a justification.
the majority objects to this characterization,suggesting that instead of deciding the merits,it need only characterize the effect of the bankruptcy court ruling.but parsing out the degree and extent of an injunction effects on the parties will often be not only an issue,but the key issue in considering the merits of an appeal from an order denying relief from the automatic stay.moreover,even in cases such as this one,in which the merits could be easily disposed of,divining the effect of the bankruptcy court combined rulings,see majority,at,may be no easy task.
here,for example,my colleagues compare the order of the bankruptcy court to an order transferring venue,which is not appealable even if entered by a district court.see id.at first blush,this seems a reasonable point.actually,though,an order transferring venue is an order by one federal court surrendering venue to another in a given action.what has happened in this case,by contrast,is that one federal court the bankruptcy court has,by refusing to lift the automatic stay,left in place an injunction barring pinpoint from continuing to pursue a lawsuit in another federal court,which has not surrendered venue,but has instead determined that it is the proper venue for t
