rita patel appeals the trial court entry of a judgment of dismissal after granting terminating sanctions striking her complaint under code of civil procedure section all further statutory references are to this code.the court concluded patel filed the complaint for an improper purpose without evidentiary or legal support because her claims were barred by res judicata based on her previous adversary action in federal court opposing victor ali bankruptcy petition after victor ali obtained his bankruptcy discharge,however,patel did not sue him in this action for fraud and related claims,but rather his business partners,including ana alonso,and their company crown diamonds,crown.principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel do not apply to insulate defendants from answering for what patel claims are their fraudulent activities.we therefore reverse the trial court entry of judgment based on terminating sanctions against patel and entry of monetary sanctions again patel and her attorney.
factual and procedural background 
patel filed this action in march against crown,alonso,and a host of other individual named and doe defendants whom she alleged,along with alonso and victor ali,owned crown and operated it to defraud her of hundreds of thousands of dollars after her husband died her complaint alleged against all the defendants causes of action for fraud,false promises,negligent misrepresentations,negligent infliction of emotional distress,negligence per se,accounting,and unfair business practices.
according to patel complaint,alonso,victor ali,and the other defendants all owned and operated crown,but they utilized the corporate structure for fraudulent purposes.patel therefore sought to pierce crown corporate veil based on allegations that defendants deliberately undercapitalized their business and are the alter egos of one another,unfairly seeking to deceive and mislead plaintiff.
patel alleged defendants,as crown owners and operators,hatched a plan to strip her of all of her money and assets for their own use.once defendants obtained patel assets,she alleged they conspired to hide the assets,and she alleged they fraudulently transferred them to and among each other and to does.according to patel,another aspect of the plan involved victor ali tak ing all responsibility for the by fil ing bankruptcy.this way,they would have the money and the debt would be discharged,and plaintiff would not be able to find the hidden assets.
more specifically,patel alleged t he saga of defendants fraud against her began back in.her husband died in october,leaving her with two young children to support.she had only the equivalent of a sixth grade education,no experience in business,and did not read,write,or understand english well,which she claimed the defendants exploited to obtain her funds.according to patel complaint,by design,defendants always and only dealt with plaintiff when she was alone.defendants did not want plaintiff to get any professional advice from an outsider or friend.
they plied her with gifts.according to her complaint,about a week after her husband died,the defendants presented plaintiff and her two children with gifts.these were presented under false pretense,to gain plaintiff trust.patel complaint alleged,the gifts were designed to loosen up the plaintiff and to make her feel beholden to these defendants.defendants knew that plaintiff was emotionally weak,vulnerable,alone,depressed,lonely and sad,and that they could take advantage of the plaintiff and her lack of education and experience.
according to patel complaint,victor ali,a smooth salesman,acted as the lead spokesman for the other defendants.he was their pitchman,acting on behalf of the other defendants.after learning patel would receive in life insurance proceeds,victor ali contacted her at defendants behest and offered to help her with her paperwork and bills.he persuaded her to add him as a cosigner on her bank account.next,according to patel complaint,defendants,with ali taking the lead,convinced plaintiff to withdraw all from the retirement account that her husband had set up before he died,and to deposit those funds in her checking account.
patel then met victor ali and another,unknown agent of the other defendants at crown office,where she signed a stack of papers based on their instruction that it was necessary and beneficial to her and her children.she received no copies of the paperwork,but later learned it was for a loan of taken against her home.
according to patel complaint,once her checking account and financial position had been plumped up,defendants began to entice her to turn over money to the defendants,apparently in exchange for a position at crown as a means to support herself and her children.thus,o ne of the promises that ali and the others made,was to put plaintiff on the crown diamond payroll.in december,for example,victor ali promised to put plaintiff on crown payroll in exchange for a loan.patel wrote him a check for from her bank account,and two weeks later victor ali increased the amount by writing another check on the account for.in early january,victor ali and the others shared in an additional of patel funds as the proceeds,minus a broker fee,of the loan in her name,again with promises she would be placed on crown payroll.
patel alleged defendants obtained a total of from her with no intention of putting her on the payroll.instead,d efendants intended to deceive plaintiff with this false promise and others.when patel attempted to contact victor ali about her promised payroll position,he talked her in circles and ignored the question.according to patel complaint,when she sought something in writing from defendants,victor ali simply used the occasion to gain further advantage on defendants behalf,ha ving plaintiff sign an interest free loan for years o n,involving defendants.
soon,patel began to receive late notices on the mortgage encumbering her home.patel called victor ali and the others,trying to find out why the payment s,which they had promised to make,had not been made.while defendants had been easy to reach before they obtained her funds,calling her all the time,on a daily basis,patel asserted in her complaint that a fter defendants got her money,they avoided plaintiff and avoided all contact with her and would not return her phone calls.patel finally reached victor ali in march to demand he reimburse her funds,but he refused,stating he did have the money.
a year later in march,it appears defendants or victor ali may have made at least token repayments because,as patel acknowledged in her complaint,the principal amount they owed her declined from the original sum of to.as patel phrased it in her complaint,defendants finally agreed to pay per month,at interest,on the princip al of,which defendants had taken from plaintiff.but patel came to view the agreement as only another false promise or fraud in defendants continuing pattern of falsehoods to defraud her.she alleged in her complaint that the march repayment agreement was merely a further effort to carry out the conspiracy and to pacify her the agreement was executed,but defendants had no intention of ever completing payments.instead,defendants conspiracy was to make payments for awhile,and then have victor ali declare bankruptcy.italics added.
it is not clear how or why defendants allegedly believed a discharge in bankruptcy for victor ali would absolve them of their repayment obligation.to the contrary,patel alleged in her complaint that defendants and not just victor ali had promised in march to repay her.specifically,she alleged she reasonably relied upon representations,the mannerisms sic,and the statements and promises of defendants.these representations were repeated on or about march,at which time defendants promised to repay plaintiff.italics added.
in any event,plaintiff alleged defendants conspiracy to take her funds without fully repaying her reached its fulfillment in december,after victor ali obtained a discharge in his personal bankruptcy proceeding.patel alleged before that date,defendants were paying the agreed amount of per month to plaintiff.once the conspiracy was completed,and the bankruptcy was granted to victor ali,defendants then stopped paying.as noted,patel then filed her complaint in this action in march alleging claims against defendants but not victor ali for fraud,false promises,negligent misrepresentations,negligent infliction of emotional distress,negligence per se,accounting,and unfair business practices.
defendants filed both a demurrer and a motion for sanctions under section.defendants included as an exhibit a march agreement in which crown and victor ali had agreed to repay patel as she alleged in her complaint.defendants pointed out that the agreement followed and served to settle a lawsuit patel filed in,in which she alleged victor ali,with alonso and the other defendants knowledge and participation,fraudulently induced her to loan money to crown,and then refused to return the money.defendants did not claim a res judicata bar based on the settlement and dismissal of patel lawsuit rendered her new lawsuit worthy of sanction for lack of an evidentiary or legal basis.
rather,defendants premised their sanctions motion on the bankruptcy court dismissal under federal rules of civil procedure,rule b of patel adversary action opposing victor ali bankruptcy discharge.defendants asserted that dismissal rendered patel lawsuit against them in this action wholly untenable and improper.
in its tentative ruling,the trial court overruled defendants demurrer as to patel causes of action for fraud,false promises,negligent misrepresentations,accounting,and unfair business practices,and sustained the demurrer with leave to amend on her causes of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress and per se negligence.the court also denied defendants motion for sanctions and to strike patel complaint,observing that it overruled the demurrer on which defendants based their sanctions motion.
neither patel nor her attorney appeared at the hearing on the sanctions motion,where the trial court took the matter under submission and then reversed course from its tentative ruling and granted the motion.the court struck patel complaint with prejudice and granted defendants motion for in monetary sanctions against patel and her attorney,to compensate for defendants attorney fees defending the case.the court summarized its ruling as follows defendants have sufficiently established that the claims alleged in this case have been previously litigated and are therefore barred by the doctrine of res judicata and collateral estoppel.therefore,the court finds that plaintiff allegations and factual contentions lack evidentiary support,the legal contentions made by plaintiff are not warranted by existing law,the claims made by plaintiff in this action were brought for an improper purpose such as to harass or cause unnecessary delay or increase the cost of litigation,and that plaintiff and her attorney of record have made omissions that appear to be in bad faith designed to mislead the court.
the court did not specify patel or her attorney alleged omissions,but granted defendants request for judicial notice of several documents,including patel adversary complaint pleadings opposing victor ali bankruptcy petition,the bankruptcy court orders dismissing those complaints for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted in federal bankruptcy court,and the bankruptcy court order granting victor ali bankruptcy discharge
