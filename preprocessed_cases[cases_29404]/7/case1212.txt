jerry watson appeals from the decision of the district court affirming the bankruptcy court confirmation of edwin smith chapter plan.watson contends that smith filed his chapter reorganization plan in bad faith and,therefore,that he should have been denied discharge.for the reasons set forth in this opinion,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
backgrounda.facts 
edwin smith is a certified public accountant who,in the late,fraudulently induced jerry watson to loan to william compton.smith claimed,falsely,that watson investment was secured by real property owned by compton.smith,using the power of attorney conferred on him by watson,also used her credit cards to their limit,took out a mortgage against her home and put her in debt to her life insurance company.smith also borrowed from watson to buy his daughter a car he has not repaid the loan.
watson brought an action in a state court in kentucky to recover the loan proceeds that had been fraudulently taken.the jury awarded her a judgment of,including punitive damages that judgment was later affirmed on appeal.with interest,the judgment is now worth about.watson domesticated the judgment in the circuit court of harrison county,indiana,where smith resides.
bankruptcy court proceedings 
in march,smith filed for chapter bankruptcy in the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of indiana.watson filed an adversary proceeding challenging the dischargeability of smith debt to her.on july,the bankruptcy court granted watson motion for summary judgment and declared that smith debt was nondischargeable because of smith fraudulent representations and his fraud while serving as watson fiduciary.see a.
smith then filed this chapter proceeding and a reorganization plan the plan.watson is smith only remaining creditor.under the more liberal rules of chapter,smith debt to watson is dischargeable,subject to certain limitations,which will be discussed below.watson again filed an adversary proceeding,arguing that the plan is not proposed in good faith,that the income has been underreported,that the expenses have been overstated,and that there is more money available to pay on this plan than the debtor is indicating.bankruptcy tr.at.
the bankruptcy court held an evidentiary hearing regarding watson objection to confirmation of the plan.the focus of the hearing was watson charge that smith had padded his expenses in the plan and underreported his income.watson counsel smith,suggesting that he claimed household expenses that were not characterized properly as such,that he failed to estimate properly his income over the course of the plan and that his wife income was not properly documented.the court also examined smith.watson presented documentary evidence in support of her claims.
watson also testified,describing smith fraudulent conduct while he was serving as her fiduciary.watson described her precarious financial condition,made more difficult by smith fraud,which had deprived her of much of her savings.she also testified that smith remarked to me after i found out what he had been doing,that he knew how to make it that i would never be able to collect a dime from him i do think he done it in good faith.at.watson counsel argued that with the fraud that was involved in this particular debt,i think you ought to hold the debtor to a very high standard of proof that he really does spend each month what he claims to spend each month t here comes a point where you padding your expenses so bad that your chapter plan just is a good faith plan.at.
after hearing the evidence,the court,ruling from the bench,adjusted,and then confirmed,smith chapter plan.the court stated,i just have to make sure that this debtor puts all his disposable income into the plan.at.the original plan called for payments of per month the court accepted this number for the first five months of the plan.after that period,however,smith would pay per month for the next seven months,then per month for a year,and then per month for the final three years of the plan.as adjusted,the plan would increase smith payments to account for any pay raises he receives.after describing these adjustments,the court concluded that b ased upon payment of that adjusted level,the court would find that the plan as submitted is proposed in good faith.at.the bankruptcy court issued a written order,using a form,which confirmed the details of the plan as amended at the hearing 
district court proceedings 
watson appealed to the district court she argued that the bankruptcy court had erred in concluding that the plan was filed in good faith.watson submitted to the district court that the disparity between the amount of her state judgment with interest,and the amount of the proposed pay out,around,and smith actions were evidence that the plan was filed in bad faith.after examining the record made in the bankruptcy court,the district court concluded that watson had not raised this latter argument before the bankruptcy court and therefore had waived the right to make it in appellate proceedings.the district court then determined that there was insufficient evidence to support watson claim that the bankruptcy court had determined erroneously smith financial situation and thereby had confirmed a plan with too low a payout.the district court affirmed the judgment of the bankruptcy court on these grounds.
discussion 
we apply the same standard of review to the bankruptcy court decision as did the district court.the bankruptcy court findings of fact are reviewed for clear error,see in re generes,cir its conclusions of law are reviewed de novo,see meyer rigdon,cir.a bankruptcy court determination that a plan was filed in good faith is a factual finding therefore,we shall reverse only if the court finding was clearly erroneous.see in re love,cir.
we can not accept the district court determination that watson good faith argument had been waived by her failure to raise it in the bankruptcy hearing.watson,in both her written objections and her counsel argument at the hearing,objected to confirmation of smith plan on the ground that it was not filed in good faith.she based her objection on three grounds.first,watson pointed to smith prepetition conduct,including his fraudulent conduct and a statement he made to her that he had arranged things so as to preclude her from recovering her judgment against him,as evidence of his bad faith.the bankruptcy court had some of the records from the fraud trial and was aware of smith conduct,having previously held that this debt was nondischargeable in smith chapter proceeding.second,watson contended that smith plan was in bad faith because of the low amount of the pay out,relative to the overall debt.third,watson argued that smith was padding his expenses,understating his income and had structured his assets in such a way as to prevent her from recovering what she was owed.
we note at the outset that the obligation of good faith is imposed on the debtor at two stages of a chapter proceeding.first,the debtor must file his petition for chapter bankruptcy in good faith.see in re love,at.second,the debtor must file his chapter plan in good faith.see in re schaitz,cir see also lawrence king et,collier on bankruptcy,at ed.at different times,and at different places in her brief to this court,watson has objected to a finding of good faith both in filing the petition and the plan.
in our earlier cases,we have read c,which provides for dismissal of a chapter provision for cause,to include a dismissal premised on a debtor bad faith in filing the petition.see in re love,at in re smith,cir.although watson has not cited c,her brief to this court asks us to reverse the bankruptcy court and conclude that neither the petition nor the plan was filed in good faith.most of her brief focuses on whether smith plan was proposed in good faith,as did almost all of the bankruptcy hearing.
we turn first to the petition.on this record,only smith conduct bears on his good faith in filing the petition.watson has not pointed toward anything leading up to bankruptcy that would point to a finding of bad faith other than smith fraudulent conduct with respec
