the bankruptcy court made the following findings of fact.the debtor,jon goulet,is years old,lives with his mother in eau claire,wisconsin,and helps her around the house since his father recently died.goulet has an son,of whom he does not have custody.he owes per month in child support.at the time of the bankruptcy court proceedings,goulet mother was paying of the monthly payment on his behalf and he was in arrears on the child support obligation.goulet mother generally supports him from her own income,including her social security payment,and does not charge him any rent or lodging expenses.he does not receive any form of public assistance.
after graduating high school in wisconsin in,goulet attended the university of claire periodically from through.in,he transferred to regis university in denver,colorado at that time known as loretta heights and,in,he earned his bachelor degree in history,graduating with a gpa.between and,he worked at various jobs in denver,including bartending and restaurant management.in,he moved back to eau claire and became a life insurance agent.for the next few years,he made a steady,comfortable living and his income ranged from approximately to.
then,goulet fortunes took a turn for the worse.in,he had his insurance license revoked due to a charge of insurance fraud.he was also arrested for felony possession of cocaine,with intent to deliver after attending counseling,he worked as a bouncer and bartender from through.from to,goulet went back to school,attending the university of and completing all the required courses for a master in psychology with a gpa.however,he did not obtain his degree because he failed to complete a statistical analysis for his thesis.goulet also testified that he did not complete his master degree work because a counseling job requires hours of experience and certification,which he believed he would be unable to achieve in light of his felony conviction.
after quitting the master degree program,goulet applied for and was rejected from some counseling positions.since then,he has held various bartender positions and managed a restaurant for a short time.as recently as the district court proceeding,he was employed as a real estate agent for edina realty,but had yet to make a sale or obtain a listing his income for the year was and his monthly expenses,excluding his child support obligation,are approximately or annually.
while attending graduate school at,goulet obtained student loans totaling,with accrued interest,approximately the debt is accruing at a interest rate.in september,when his first payment was due,goulet requested and received a forbearance agreement on the loans.he also timely requested and received additional forbearance agreements when subsequent payments became due,the last in may.at that time,ecmc stopped granting forbearances and goulet subsequently filed his petition for bankruptcy,seeking relief from the debt.goulet never made a single payment on his student loans.
goulet testified that he has suffered from a drug and alcohol problem for approximately years.he has never sought treatment,but he has had some counseling,notably through alcoholics anonymous.the bankruptcy court heard the testimony of john siebold,the manager of the club at the eau claire golf and country club where goulet had been a bartender.siebold testified that he had never observed any indication that goulet had an alcohol or drug abuse problem,but the court discounted this testimony,concluding that we know as lawyers many of our colleagues go home and they drinking every night.the bankruptcy court then concluded that goulet was a smart guy and has great capabilities and also has a significant problem in that he has an addiction.the bankruptcy court also investigated whether goulet would have the ability to make payments in the future.during the hearing,it heard the testimony of jim theisen,an owner of a successful real estate business,who testified that real estate agents made to and agents made to.the court,however,discounted theisen testimony,noting that although we know you can make good money in the real estate business there are many people i know who wash out in that industry.
after considering the foregoing facts and circumstances,the bankruptcy court,applying our circuit test for undue hardship,determined that goulet did not have the money to make payments,that his inability to pay would persist for the significant future,and that he had made a good faith effort to repay the debt.the court thereby discharged goulet student loans.ecmc appealed the bankruptcy court decision and the federal district court reversed.goulet appeals.
we must decide whether goulet established that he would suffer undue hardship if his student loans were not discharged.student loans are not dischargeable in bankruptcy unless they will constitute an undue hardship on the debtor.see a the bankruptcy code does not define undue hardship,but this circuit has adopted the second circuit brunner test,see brunner new york state higher educ.serv,cir,for evaluating such a claim.in the matter of roberson,cir.under this test,the debtor must demonstrate that he can not maintain,based on current income and expenses,a minimal standard of living for himself and his dependents if forced to repay the loans that additional circumstances exist indicating that the state of affairs is likely to persist for a significant portion of the repayment period of the student loans and that the debtor has made good faith efforts to repay the loans.roberson,at adopting test from brunner,at.the debtor has the burden of establishing each element of the test by a preponderance of the evidence.grogan garner,d standard of proof for the dischargeability exceptions in a is the ordinary standard.if the debtor fails to establish any one of the elements,the test has not been met and the court need not continue with the inquiry.roberson,at.see also in re brightful,cir.
we now turn to the inquiry of whether goulet circumstances meet that test,a question of law subject to de novo review.roberson,at.in doing so,we are mindful that the trier of fact was the bankruptcy court,and therefore we are in as good a position as the district court to review the findings of the bankruptcy court,so we review the bankruptcy court findings by the standards the district court should employ,to determine whether the district court erred in its review.brightful,at citation omitted.see also in re platter,cir.we accept the bankruptcy court findings of fact,with the exception of those that are clearly erroneous,and place the burden on the debtor to establish that his circumstances warrant discharge of his loans.roberson,at internal citation omitted.see also fed.f indings of fact,whether based on oral or documentary evidence,shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous,and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the bankruptcy court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.
in examining the first brunner prong,goulet financial condition,both parties agree that goulet can not maintain,based on his current income and expenses,a minimal standard of living for himself.at the time of the bankruptcy hearing,goulet yearly expenses,without factoring in his student loan debt,were approximately.this amount easily exceeds his most recent annual income of.therefore,he has clearly established the first prong of the brunner test.
turning to the second prong,we look at whether additional circumstances exist indicating that goulet state of affairs is l
