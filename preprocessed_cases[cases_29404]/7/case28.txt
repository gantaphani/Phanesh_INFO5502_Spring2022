these appeals involve the application of certain provisions of the puerto rico oversight,management,and economic stability act promesa,see,a statute enacted by congress in june to address puerto rico financial crisis.as relevant here,promesa provides for a temporary stay of litigation against the puerto rico government.see id.a b.but the statute does not leave creditors entirely without recourse during the presumptive pause.rather,it allows them to move for relief from the stay and directs district courts to grant such relief after notice and a hearing for cause shown.id.e.because we conclude that peaje investments llc peaje failed to set forth a legally sufficient claim of cause to lift the promesa stay,we affirm the district court denial of its motion.by contrast,the various appellants in altair global credit opportunities fund a,llc the altair movants and,together with peaje,the movants presented sufficient allegations to entitle them to a hearing.accordingly,we vacate the district court denial of their motion and remand for the court to hold such a hearing.
peaje is the beneficial owner of certain bonds issued by the puerto rico highways and transportation authority prhta.the bonds are secured by a lien on toll revenues,among other things.in july,peaje initiated the instant action in district court by filing a motion to lift the promesa stay so that it could challenge the diversion of prhta toll revenues pledged as collateral for the bonds.peaje alleged that,acting pursuant to the puerto rico emergency moratorium and financial rehabilitation act moratorium act,see laws act,the puerto rico government was diverting the toll revenues to other uses,thereby diminishing the value of peaje collateral.
about two months later,the altair movants,holders of certain bonds issued by the commonwealth employees retirement system ers,filed a similar motion to lift the promesa stay.the altair movants claimed that the commonwealth had suspended required transfers to the fiscal agent of employer contributions pledged as collateral for the bonds.
promesa stay of the commencement of certain actions until february,applies to the lawsuits the movants seek to pursue.see d a i.the stay may be extended until as late as april,if the district court determines that additional time is needed to complete a voluntary restructuring process,or to may if the financial oversight and management board board makes a similar finding.see id.d b c.the district court is directed to grant relief from the promesa stay for cause shown after notice and a hearing.id.e.
after consolidating the actions,the district court scheduled a november hearing on the motions to lift the promesa stay for cause.on the eve of the hearing,however,the court issued an order denying the motions.in seeking to define the cause standard,the court looked to the bankruptcy code automatic stay provision.the court held that lack of adequate protection for creditors constitutes cause for lifting the promesa stay,just as it does under the bankruptcy code.turning to the movants specific claims,the court held that neither peaje nor the altair movants lacked adequate protection.because the toll revenues are constantly replenished,peaje continued to hold a security interest in a stable,recurring source of income that will eventually provide funds for the repayment of the prhta bonds.similarly,the employer contributions in which the altair movants claimed an interest are a perpetual revenue stream whose value is not decreased by the commonwealth acts of temporary suspension.the movants timely appealed.
appellate jurisdiction 
as an initial matter,we address our appellate jurisdiction under.in the analogous bankruptcy context we have held that the denial of relief from a stay is not necessarily a final decision sufficient to confer appellate jurisdiction.see in re atlas it exp,cir.but such a decision is final where it conclusively decide s the,issue that triggered the fight.id.the order on appeal here did precisely that.it rejected the movants substantive arguments,holding that their interests in the collateral were adequately protected.after that ruling,there was nothing left for the district court to do.
denial of relief from stay 
turning to the merits of the motions,the parties primarily dispute two issues concerning whether actions by puerto rico that impair or remove the collateral securing the pertinent bonds is cause for lifting the stay whether such an impairment or removal satisfies promesa cause standard if it leaves the creditor interest in having the debt repaid inadequately protected and if so,did the district court commit reversible error by failing to conduct a hearing on whether the movants here were inadequately protected.on the record in this case,we answer the first question in the affirmative.on the second question,we issue a split decision.because peaje failed even to make a legally sufficient claim that it lacked adequate protection,we conclude that the district court did not commit reversible error in denying its motion without an evidentiary hearing.the altair movants,on the other hand,were entitled to such a hearing.
on the threshold issue of whether lack of adequate protection constitutes cause to lift the promesa stay,appellees,and ers together,the appellees point out that the relevant section of the bankruptcy code,unlike promesa,expressly defines cause to include lack of adequate protection.compare d,with e.they contend that promesa omission on this point is meaningful and reflects congress intent that cause not be defined to include actions impairing the collateral in a manner that leaves the interest in having the debt repaid inadequately protected.
but the appellees contention runs headlong into the cardinal principle of constitutional avoidance.crowell benson.under this canon,when confronted with a statute of questionable constitutional validity,we must first ascertain whether a construction is fairly possible by which the constitutional question may be avoided.id.if so,we adopt that construction.in the bankruptcy context,congress explicit designation of lack of adequate protection as cause to lift a stay was based,at least in part,on constitutional concerns.see,at,reprinted in,explaining that the concept of adequate protection is derived from the f ifth a mendment protection of property interests.indeed,prior to the enactment of the current bankruptcy stay provision,the supreme court had recognized that creditors are constitutionally entitled to protection to the extent of the value of the ir property.wright union cent.life ins,see also united states sec.indus.bank,applying principle of constitutional avoidance to provision of bankruptcy code where a contrary reading would result in a complete destruction of the property right of the secured party in its collateral.the promesa stay implicates these same constitutional concerns.under the appellees reading of the statute,the commonwealth could expend every penny of the movants collateral,leaving the debt entirely unsecured.because we doubt the constitutionality of such a result,we hold that lack of adequate protection for creditors constitutes cause to lift the promesa stay 
in the bankruptcy context,one common form of adequate protection is the existence of an equity cushion.collier on bankruptcy d i alan resnick henry sommer,ed.hereinafter collier see also ralar,cir.such an equity cushion exists if the value of the collateral available to the creditor exceeds by a comfortable margin the amount of the creditor claim.collier d i.the widespread acceptance of an equity cushion as a form of adequate protection makes eminent sense.indeed,the interest for which the bankruptcy stay statute requires protection is the right of a secured creditor to have the security applied in payment of the debt.united sav.ass of timbers of inwood forest,emphasis added.therefore,an oversecured creditor can not demand to keep its collateral rather than be paid in full.in re pac.lumber,cir.
here,in denying the motions,the district court,while not using the precise term,relied on the existence of an equity cushion.it cited future toll revenues and employer c
