on direct appeal,we are asked to resolve this narrow but significant issue of whether a debt that is not dischargeable in chapter bankruptcy as a debt for money or property obtained by actual fraud extends beyond debts incurred through fraudulent misrepresentations to also include debts incurred as a result of knowingly accepting a fraudulent conveyance that the transferee knew was intended to hinder the transferor creditors.concluding that it does.see mcclellan cantrell,cir 
having adopted this new standard,we vacate and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.we decline to reach the issue of the adequacy of sauer pleadings of actual fraud under rule b,and the possibility of amendment if inadequate.because we have adopted a new standard,the bankruptcy court should address these issues in the first instance.am.catholic educ.programming,cardinale,cir boudin.
we recount the facts as alleged in sauer first amended complaint,accepting them as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in sauer favor.see ruivo wells fargo bank,cir.in brief,sauer alleges that lawson incurred the debt at issue by knowingly receiving a fraudulent conveyance from her father,james,that was designed to prevent sauer from collecting a judgment against him.the details are as follows.
in january,sauer sued james in providence superior court based on their previous business dealings.three years later,on february,the superior court found those transactions to be fraudulent,and awarded sauer a judgment against james in the amount of,including punitive damages.
just before the judgment was entered,lawson had formed a shell entity,commercial construction m c,llc commercial construction upon entry of judgment,james transferred to commercial construction,allegedly to impede sauer collection.commercial construction is owned by lawson,but controlled by james 
lawson then transferred of the from commercial construction to herself sometime over the course of the following year,from february through early.in march,james filed for chapter bankruptcy.
pursuant to the rhode island uniform fraudulent transfer act,laws et ufta,sauer traced portions of its original judgment against james first to commercial construction,and then to lawson.the providence superior court found these transfers to be fraudulent under the ufta,and issued executions against both commercial construction and lawson for the full amounts transferred and,respectively.the latter judgment entered against lawson is the debt at issue.
lawson filed for chapter bankruptcy the same month that the providence superior court issued the execution against her,in march.sauer initiated this adversary proceeding in june,objecting to the discharge of this debt under a a as being for money obtained by actual fraud.in particular,sauer alleged that because lawson knowingly receiv ed the fraudulent transfer and acted in a willful and malicious manner toward sauer,her acceptance of the fraudulent conveyance constitutes actual,not merely constructive,fraud 
the bankruptcy court dismissed sauer adversary proceeding.the court reasoned that it was constrained by first circuit and supreme court precedent to find that a misrepresentation is a required element of actual fraud under a a.see sauer,at,citing field,d spigel,at.because sauer concededly could not allege that lawson had made a misrepresentation,sauer could not establish that a a barred discharge of lawson debt.see id.at.
sauer appealed to the bankruptcy appellate panel and,shortly thereafter,petitioned for direct appeal to the first circuit.see d.the panel granted certification on the ground that the order involves a matter of public importance,d a i,and agreeing,we granted authorization.
the sole issue on appeal is whether the bankruptcy court erred in concluding that a misrepresentation by a debtor to a creditor is an essential element of establishing a basis for the nondischarge of a debt under a a.sauer,at.this is a question of law,which we review de novo.see am.catholic,at united states nippon paper indus.co,cir.
a.the fraud exception of a a 
the bankruptcy code aims to strike a balance between providing debtors with a fresh start by discharging debts upon plan confirmation,and avoiding abuse of the system.see spigel,at.to this end,the code exempts from discharge certain types of debt in an attempt to limit th e opportunity for discharge to the honest but unfortunate debtor.id.at second and third alteration in original quoting brown felsen,d.such exceptions are narrowly construed and the claimant must show that its claim comes squarely within an enumerated exception.id.first alteration in original quoting century balfour real estate menna in re menna,cir.
this case concerns an exemption to chapter discharge.although discharge under chapter is broader than the discharge received in any other chapter,chapter still restricts or prohibits entirely the discharge of certain types of debts.united student aid funds,espinosa,d quoting collier on bankruptcy ed.as relevant here,chapter does not discharge any debt for money to the extent obtained by false pretenses,a false representation,or actual fraud a a emphasis added id.a making a a expressly applicable to chapter.
although many courts have assume d that fraud under this provision equals misrepresentation,mcclellan,at collecting cases,it remains an open question in this circuit whether actual fraud includes fraud effected by means other than fraudulent misrepresentation,such as through schemes of fraudulent conveyance,spigel,at expressly declining to reach the issue 
the supreme court has directed us that in construing the meaning of actual fraud under this provision,we are to rely on the common law concept of actual fraud as it was understood in when that language was added to a a.field,at.then,as now,the most widely accepted distillation of the common law of torts was the restatement second of torts,published shortly before congress passed the act.id.accordingly,we look to the same restatement as relied upon in field.
that restatement recognizes several types of fraud,including both fraudulent misrepresentations and fraudulent interference with property rights,a tort that is broader than misrepresentation itself.see restatement second of torts,index,fraud see also id.one who intentionally deprives another of his legally protected property interest or causes injury to the interest is subject to liability to the other if his conduct is generally culpable and not justifiable under the circumstances.the comments to the relevant restatement provision,make clear that this includes fraudulent conveyance,like that alleged here.id.cmt.a t he rule applies when title to land has been obtained by fraud and has been transferred to one other than a bona fide purchaser,in which case,until its sale by the transferee,the original owner sole redress against the transferee is by an action seeking its recovery.that is,the common law concept of fraud as distilled by the restatement to which the court directs us extends beyond fraudulent misrepresentations to at least include fraudulent conveyances.see see also id.
this comports with other examples of the common understanding of fraud.see mcclellan,at no learned inquiry into the history of fraud is necessary to establish that fraud is not limited to misrepresentations and misleading omissions.as the leading treatise on bankruptcy explains,a ctual fraud,by definition,consists of any deceit,artifice,trick,or design involving direct and active operation of the mind,used to circumvent and cheat another collier on bankruptcy e resnick sommer,ed.this generic term has frequently been used to embrace all the multifarious means which human ingenuity can devise and which are resorted to by one individual to gain an advantage over another by false suggestions or by the suppression of truth.mcclellan,at quoting stapleton holt.and,as relevant here,when a debtor transfers property to a third party without adequate consideration to hinder her creditors,this is deemed fraud on her creditors.id.at collecting cases see also,e,ufta,laws et providing remedies for fraudulent conveyances spaziano spaziano,jorden ball,
we adopt this common law understanding and hold that actual fraud under a a is not limited to fraud effected by misrepresentation.see field,at applying the established practice of finding congress meaning in the generally shared common law to a a.rather,we hold that actual fraud includes fraudulent conveyances that are intended to hinder the relevant creditors.mcclellan,at.consistent with our precedents,our holding is limited to cases of actual,as opposed to merely constructive,fraud.see spigel,at w e have said that the statutory language does not remotely suggest that nondischargeability attaches to any claim other than one which arises as a direct result of the debtor fraudulent conduct.quoting century,at palmacci,at emphasizing that a a requires a showing of actual or positive fraud,not merely fraud implied by law quoting anastas am.sav.bank in re anastas,cir.that is,the must herself be guilty of intent to defraud and not merely be the passive recipient of a fraudulent conveyance.see mcclellan,at noting that fraud is constructive if the only evidence of it is the inadequacy of the consideration.such intent may be inferred from her acceptance of a transfer that she knew was made with the purpose of hindering the transferor creditor s,but it may not be implied as a matter of law.see neal clark.distinguishing actual fraud from constructive fraud which may exist without the imputation of bad faith or immorality.
our reading is confirmed by the structure of the text and the legislative history.a ctual fraud was added as a ground for exception from discharge under a a in,at,at.that provision now explicitly lists both actual fraud and false representations as grounds for denying a discharge.spigel,at.we agree with the seventh circuit that this distinction must have meaning,and that the most obvious meaning is the one that comports with common law understanding actual fraud is broader than misrepresentation.mcclellan,at.
indeed,this is confirmed by the legislative statements concerning the change,which reveal that the drafters specifically contemplated not only a broader reading of actual fraud,but that debt incurred through actually fraudulent conveyances would be barred from discharge under a a.the legislative statement concerning a a is express that the addition is intended to codify current case law,like neal clark.see,legislative statements explaining that a a is limited to actual or positive fraud rather than fraud implied by law.that case,neal clark,presumed that the bankruptcy code exempted from discharge as a debt created by fraud at least some debts incurred through receipt of a fraudulent conveyance.see neal,at holding that debt created through receipt of a fraudulent conveyance must be actual fraud,not merely constructive fraud,to bar from discharge in bankruptcy bankruptcy act of,ch,stat,id.ch,stat.at 
the history of the fraud exception reinforces our reading of a a.cohen de la cruz,d.the bankruptcy practices at issue in neal and codified by a a concerned section of the bankruptcy act of,which barred debts created by fraud.bankruptcy act of,ch,stat.at.the bankruptcy act of similarly prohibited discharge of debts that are judgments in actions for frauds,or obtaining property by false pretenses or false representations,or for willful and malicious injuries to the person or property of another under section a bankruptcy act of,ch,a,stat,cohen,at.subsequent amendments retained the willful and malicious injuries language until,when willful and malicious conversion of the property of another was substituted.see a act of,a,a,stat.this substituted language preserved the breadth of the fraud exception articulated in section a,the predecessor of a a black law dictionary ed defining conversion as an act or series of acts of willful interference,without lawful justification,with an item of property in a manner inconsistent with another right,whereby that other person is deprived of the use and possession of the property.
we will not read the bankruptcy code to erode past bankruptcy practice absent a clear indication that congress intended such a departure.cohen,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the alteration of this language in in no way signals an intention to narrow the established scope of the fraud exception along the lines suggested by lawson,nor have the parties identified anything in the legislative history that would suggest such a change.see id.at.rather,a a continues the tradition of affording relief only to an honest but unfortunate debtor by excepting from discharge any debt obtained by false pretenses,a false representation,or actual fraud.see id.at quoting grogan garner,d a a.we hold that the fraud exception to discharge codified at a a continues to bar from discharge debts incurred through knowing and intentional receipt of fraudulent conveyances as it has since.williams.proof of facts ed.t here is a great deal of continuity between the former bankruptcy act and the bankruptcy code,and between fraud and nondischargeability under code a.even the language of the statute is continuous.
declining to shoehorn fraudulent conveyance into a 
lawson next argues that because her bankruptcy case arises under the more forgiving provisions of chapter,not chapter,we should avoid construing a a to extend beyond fraud effected by misrepresentation.
her argument,charitably read,begins with the assertion that lawson alleged conduct more readily falls within the nondischargeability provision of a mcclellan,at ripple,concurring.because that provision bars discharge of any debt for willful and malicious injury by the debtor to another entity,a,lawson argues that it provides a far more direct avenue for dealing with a situation such as this where the debtor allegedly accepted a fraudulent conveyance specifically to impede the injured party attempt to collect from another.mcclellan,at ripple,concurring.as judge ripple observed,a has been used to prevent discharge of exactly this sort.see id.at discussing murray bammer in re bammer,cir en banc but see id.at conceding that the ninth circuit later limited its holding where the fraudulent transferee filed for bankruptcy before the plaintiff,who did not have a security interest,obtained a judgment against the transferee for the transfer.
against this backdrop,lawson argues that the distinction between chapter and chapter discharge provides a reason to follow judge ripple suggested construction,and to find the alleged conduct to be covered under a,not a.this is because chapter,which provides for a broader discharge than chapter,does not bar the discharge of debts specified in a,except in limited circumstances not relevant here see a united student aid funds,at d ischarge under chapter is broader than the discharge received in any other chapter.quoting collier on bankruptcy ed.
this argument is foreclosed by the statutory history of a,the historical pedigree of the fraud exception in a a,and the general policy underlying the exceptions to discharge.see cohen,at.we begin with the history of the proposed alternative,a.
the discharge of debts for willful and malicious injuries to the person or property of another was originally included in the fraud exception of section a.that changed in,when the provision that is now codified in a was added to the statute as section a.see act of,a,a,stat.at formerly codified at a.
