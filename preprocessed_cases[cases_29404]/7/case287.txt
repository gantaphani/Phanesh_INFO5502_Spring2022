this case requires us to decide whether a is barred from bringing fraudulent conveyance claims against three banks because it actively participated in and facilitated a sale of the assets of a different,to which it was a creditor,while remaining silent about the possibility that it would bring fraudulent conveyance claims with respect to its prior of loans secured by those assets.the bankruptcy court kaplan.concluded that such a claim was barred as against only one of the banks,because only that bank actively participated in the hearing to confirm the sale.the district court arcara,affirmed in part and reversed in part,and held that the fraudulent conveyance claims were barred as to all of the banks by four separate and independent doctrines ratification,res judicata,judicial estoppel,and.
as we shall explain,we perceive difficulties with the district court ratification analysis,but agree with it that res judicata bars the fraudulent conveyance actions with respect to the bank that actively participated in the sale hearing.we also agree with the district court that judicial estoppel bars those actions against the other two banks,and we therefore affirm that court judgment.
i.the parties and other relevant entities 
because this case has many corporate players and has played out in numerous forums across the years,we set forth the following dramatis person.
adelphia communications corporation adelphia 
adelphia was once the cable television company in the united states.it was founded by john rigas in the early,and became a public corporation in.in june,adelphia filed for bankruptcy,all shareholder value was lost,and john rigas and his son timothy rigas were subsequently convicted of bank fraud and securities fraud for looting the company.see united states rigas,cir.adelphia bankruptcy proceedings took place in the bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york the adelphia bankruptcy.in this opinion,the term adelphia corp.shall be used exclusively to refer to the corporation.when referring to actions taken by the company after it filed for bankruptcy but before its chapter plan of reorganization was confirmed,this opinion will refer to the adelphia adelphia.
adelphia recovery trust the art 
the art,the appellant here,is a delaware statutory trust created pursuant to the chapter plan of reorganization that was confirmed by the adelphia bankruptcy court in february.it is the successor entity to the official commit tee of unsecured creditors of adelphia the committee,and it is authorized by the plan to pursue certain causes of action held by adelphia and to administer the proceeds from those causes of action on behalf of holders of interests in the art.under the terms of the plan,adelphia creditors and its equity holders received various combinations of interests in the art,cash,stock in time warner cable whose stock was used as part of the purchase price of adelphia at the bankruptcy sale,and rights to excess reserves.see generally.aspx last visited january.this case arises from one of the many causes of action the art is authorized to pursue.
niagara frontier hockey,nfhlp 
nfhlp was a delaware partnership formed in march,and its main assets were the buffalo sabres a franchise of the national hockey league and an interest in the hsbc arena,home to the sabres.nfhlp ran the hockey team and the arena through subsidiary companies,including crossroads arena,llc crossroads and buffalo sabres concession,llc bsc.in july,john rigas and his sons,using adelphia money,bought out the limited partners of nfhlp.in january,nfhlp and it subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy in the bankruptcy court for the western district of new york the nfhlp bankruptcy.
patmos is a delaware corporation incorporated in march.john rigas was the president of patmos,and his sons were executive vice presidents.patmos was wholly owned by john rigas and members of his immediate family.in july,patmos became the general partner of nfhlp.
sabres,is a delaware corporation incorporated in may and a wholly owned subsidiary of adelphia.as of,john rigas and his sons comprised all of the directors of sabres.this opinion will always refer to this corporate entity as sabres,and to the hockey team itself as the sabres or the hockey team.sabres,was nfhlp largest creditor at the time nfhlp filed for bankruptcy,for reasons that will become apparent.sabres,filed for bankruptcy in june,simultaneously with adelphia,its parent.
f.the banks 
the appellees here are three national banking associations hsbc bank usa,hsbc,fleet national bank fleet,and key bank,key.this opinion will refer to the three collectively as the banks.
ii.the loans are made 
in the,nfhlp and its wholly owned subsidiaries took out the following three loans with the banks.pursuant to these three loans,the banks had security interests in substantially all of nfhlp assets.
a.the construction loan 
in may,crossroads borrowed million pursuant to a building loan contract agreed to by crossroads,hsbc,key,and fleet.on this loan,hsbc was the agent,and hsbc,key,and fleet were all lenders.the purpose of this loan was to enable the construction of a new arena for the hockey team.
b.the concession loan 
at the same time that crossroads took out the construction loan,bsc borrowed million pursuant to a concession loan agreement agreed to by bsc,fleet,and key.on this loan,fleet was the agent,and fleet and key were the lenders.the purpose of this loan was to finance food and concession equipment at the hockey team new arena.
c.the revolver loan 
in february,time borrowing in its own name rather than through any a revolving line of credit,up to a maximum of million,with fleet.the purpose of this loan was to give the hockey team an operating line of credit.
iii.two of the loans are sold 
in march,sabres,entered into assignment agreements with the banks to purchase all of the banks interests in the construction loan and the revolver loan thus,it acquired interests from all three banks with respect to the construction loan and the interests of fleet with respect to the revolver loan.as a result of these transactions,nfhlp was thereafter required to make all payments due on these two loans to sabres,rather than to the banks.thus,adelphia,through its wholly owned subsidiary sabres,paid approximately million to acquire the two loans to fleet,to hsbc,and to key the sale of these loans to sabres,occurred simultaneously with the rigases acquisition of nfhlp via patmos.
although the banks had intended to sell the concession loan as well,this did not occur because the consent of a necessary third,the holder of the contract to operate the arena concession stands in which fleet held a security not be obtained.instead,adelphia made certain continuing principal and interest payments on the concession loan on nfhlp behalf.
according to the art view of the facts,all of this occurred because the hockey team was losing money.because nfhlp was in default on the loans and was at risk of bankruptcy,the art asserts,john rigas and the banks came to an agreement if adelphia through sabres,were to buy the loans,the banks whose losses as a result of any default on the loans would thereby be cut would give the necessary consent for rigas through patmos,wholly owned by the rigases to buy out the limited partners in nfhlp and become the sole owner of the hockey team.by acquiring the construction and revolver loans,adelphia through sabres,inc.became nfhlp major secured creditor,and the art calculates that between and the date of adelphia bankruptcy,john rigas caused adelphia to invest more than million in nfhlp.
in short,the art takes the position that john rigas caused adelphia to prop up nfhlp and the hockey team despite inadequate economic benefit to adelphia from doing so.the nfhlp bankruptcy court,for its part,recognized that although patmos was nominally the owner of nfhlp and nfhlp the nominal owner of the hockey team,adelphia was the likely equitable owner of the sabres entities,in light of what seems to be the use of adelphia funds to purchase the sabres for rigas.op.at emphasis added.
in a form disclosure filed with the securities and exchange commission in may,adelphia disclosed that it had created a special commit tee to investigate transactions between adelphia and certain entities.after summarizing the buffalo transactions,including the loans between the banks and nfhlp,the form stated that t he special commit tee is also investigating whether the company received fair value for payments it made pursuant to the foregoing arrangements.adelphia commc ns.form filed may.
as noted above,adelphia filed for bankruptcy in the southern district of new york in june.several months later,the adelphia hired independent accountants to analyze various transactions adelphia had entered into in its final prepetition years,including its transactions involving nfhlp and its subsidiaries.one such accountant,robert dibella,testified at a subsequent deposition that he first became aware of adelphia takeout of the nfhlp loans sometime between september and december,and discussed it with an officer of adelphia in the same time frame.in a report initially prepared in december and later updated in december and september,dibella set forth a proposed methodology for calculating the value of the loan takeouts to adelphia.in addition,billing records submitted by the adelphia in the same time period showed that some of the attorneys were investigating the payments made by sabres,to the banks.
iv.nfhlp sells the hockey team to a third party 
nfhlp filed for bankruptcy in the western district of new york in january.in its proceeding,nfhlp reported million in assets and million in liabilities,with the majority of the liabilities owed to adelphia.after the nfhlp bankruptcy proceeding began,the adelphia bankruptcy court gave the adelphia permission,as nfhlp largest creditor,to appear in the nfhlp bankruptcy court to promote the sale of the hockey team assets.specifically,the adelphia bankruptcy court ordered that the adelphia was authorized in the exercise of its business judgment to consent to the sale of certain assets of nfhlp in connection with any sale process under the bankruptcy code and that conveyance of the adelphia interest in nfhlp in connection with any sale process shall be free and clear of any liens,interests or encumbrances of any of the adelphia creditors or lenders,with such liens,if any,to attach to the net proceeds,subject to the rights and defenses of adelphia with respect thereto.order at.
the nfhlp bankruptcy court gave notice of a sale pursuant to u,and only one bidder appeared hockey western llc hockey western.the sale hearing was held in april.the proposed asset purchase agreement,entered into between hockey western on one side and nfhlp,bsc,and crossroads on the other side,provided that the hockey team a ssets will be sold free and clear of all liens,claims,interests and encumbrances.mot.for approval of asset purchase agreement at.the adelphia,for its part,executed a stipulation waiving any and all rights it might have to receive any part of the consideration paid by hockey western for the hockey team assets sold by nfhlp and its subsidiaries and releasing all liens and claims against those assets.
of course,this only accounted for the construction loan and the revolver loan,because adelphia march attempt to purchase the concession loan from fleet had been blocked by the operator of the concession stands.thus adelphia held no lien interests via the concession loan,and fleet unlike hsbc and key was still a party in interest in the nfhlp bankruptcy at the time of the asset sale because it continued to own that loan.for that reason,a different resolution had to be reached with respect to the concession loan in order to enable a sale.accordingly,the adelphia agreed to allow the concession loan to be paid in full from the proceeds of the asset sale,and fleet gave the adelphia an for million in payments adelphia had made earlier in of nfhlp.
at the asset sale hearing,counsel for the adelphia explained for the bankruptcy court the consideration that the adelphia was receiving from the sale 
there are two elements of consideration in this transaction that we will receive.one is a surrender of two letters of credit that back up the concession loan once it been paid off,and the other is the cure amount that is reflected in a new provision in the order,in respect to the assumption of the broadcast agreement regarding the hockey team games.
other than that,the adelphia ha s agreed,given the size of its claims which would have completely warped the other trade creditors in the case,to waive any entitlement to participate in the balance of the consideration to be paid under the sale agreement.
tr.of sale at.later,the bankruptcy court stated 
i guess what we have,having read the stipulations,is that everybody who anybody thinks actually has legal or equitable or beneficial interest in some kind of ownership or lien on the assets of these debtors have all signed the same stipulation essentially identical stipulations,so that we need worry about that unless there some entity that slipped through the cracks,but i doubt that would have happened with the quality of representation that we have here.
id.at.immediately after this remark,counsel for the nfhlp the bankruptcy court echoed the any party wished to be heard in objection to the sale.no adelphia a word.in an april order,the bankruptcy court approved the sale free and clear.
v.the adelphia brings a fraudulent conveyance action against the banks 
in july than three months after the nfhlp bankruptcy court approved the sale of the hockey team assets to hockey adelphia brought a fraudulent conveyance action in the adelphia bankruptcy court against banks,including hsbc,key,and fleet.the premise of this action was that t he rigas f amily used adelphia as its piggy bank to fund personal expenses at will and to maintain voting control over adelphia.compl.at.the complaint alleged that the banks had knowingly and eagerly loaned money to rigas family entities despite the banks awareness that only adelphia could have had the wherewithal to repay those debts and that the rigases had used the proceeds of the loans to enrich themselves at adelphia corp.expense.id.at.the complaint alleged that the transactions at issue,including the loans made to facilitate operation of the hockey team,did not benefit adelphia.id.at.the claims relevant here are counts through,wherein the adelphia contended that the million paid by adelphia via sabres,in march to acquire the construction loan and revolver loan was greater than fair consideration under debtor and creditor law and that the banks had not been transferees under new york law and b.id.at.with respect to fleet and the concession loan,the complaint alleged that the payments adelphia had made to fleet between june and may,the payments that resulted in the million at the time of the asset fraudulent.
the banks reacted to the initiation of this fraudulent conveyance action in two ways.first,they filed proofs of claim in the nfhlp bankruptcy proceeding,asserting that if the adelphia were successful in its fraudulent conveyance claims,the banks would have a claim against the nfhlp debtors in the amount of any judgment against them because it was no longer possible to rescind the transfer of the assets that were sold free and clear,leaving the banks with no ability to remedy the fraudulent conveyance claims by getting the loans back.second,after the nfhlp debtors brought a declaratory judgment action seeking a declaration that the banks claims should be subordinated to other claims,the banks filed in the nfhlp bankruptcy court seeking to bar the fraudulent conveyance claims in the adelphia bankruptcy court.faced with the prospect of dueling litigations,the two bankruptcy courts communicated directly with each other.they subsequently entered reciprocal orders allowing specific issues related to the fraudulent conveyance claims to be litigated exclusively in the nfhlp bankruptcy court.the adelphia bankruptcy court defined the issue over which it was relinquishing jurisdiction the same issue that is now before us on this appeal 
th e issue is whether the participation of the adelphia in the processes of asset sale and plan confirmation in the nfhlp bankruptcy has the legal effect of having barred the prosecution of the present adversary proceeding as against hsbc,key bank,fleet bank with regard to the payments made upon,or in satisfaction of,loans that were originally extended by those banks to t he nfhlp debtors before any adelphia debtor or affiliate,or rigas or any rigas entity or affiliate,owned or controlled any of the nfhlp debtors.
order of,dated june.the adelphia bankruptcy court added that,to the extent necessary for deciding that issue,it also relinquished jurisdiction over interpretation of its earlier order authorizing the adelphia to exercise its judgment in granting or withholding consent to the process of sale and confirmation as to the nfhlp debtors.id.the nfhlp bankruptcy court order accepted jurisdiction on the same terms.
in november,the attorney who had represented the adelphia at the nhflp sale hearing submitted a declaration to the bankruptcy court which read,in relevant part 
at no time prior to the sale hearing was my law firm investigating any possible fraudulent conveyance claims that might be asserted against the banks.i was not privy to the investigation of the commit tee or its agents and was not informed of the findings of their investigation until july,shortly before the fraudulent conveyance action was commenced 
it did not occur to me at the sale hearing that any fraudulent conveyance claims that may be asserted by the adelphia were being waived,or that the existence of such claims was an issue being conducted explicitly or implicitly.certainly i was not aware of the claims at the time.
when i appeared before this court at the sale hearing,i had no intent to mislead this c ourt or the banks into thinking that the adelphia would never assert fraudulent conveyance claims against the banks.
vi.the bankruptcy court decision 
in a detailed and ruminative opinion,the bankruptcy court granted summary judgment on the fraudulent conveyance claims in favor of fleet with respect to the claims against it,but ordered that the fraudulent conveyance actions should be allowed to go forward with respect to hsbc and key the bankruptcy court stated that,if it had been informed that the adelphia was reserving its right to bring fraudulent conveyance actions in its own bankruptcy proceeding,it would not have approved the sale without the consent of the banks or a resolution as to who owned the lien rights.op.at.the bankruptcy court added that,even if the sale had been necessary to keep the hockey team in buffalo,it would not have hesitated to prevent the sale if the f requirements for a sale had not been met.
the bankruptcy court then explained why it thought hsbc and key were in a different position from fleet.it noted that they may have been remote from the n fhlp assets in a legal sense their position having been bought out they say in three years before the sale,but they were not remote,in fact,from what was happening in the n fhlp case.given adelphia may form disclosures and that counsel for hsbc was also counsel for the national hockey league and deeply involved in the hockey team assets sale,the bankruptcy court suggested that all three banks ought to have been well aware of what was transpiring in the nfhlp case.the bankruptcy court thus rejected the claim of hsbc and key that they never dealt with the rigases and that they merely accepted payments on the debts incurred by the sabres.op.at.
turning to its first conclusion of law,the bankruptcy court held 
r atifying the ownership of the liens,in open c ourt here was a necessary prerequisite to the sale and o rder here,and so it is a bar to counts,but only to the extent of the value sabres,and therefore adelphia received in exchange for the million paid to hsbc and key plus million transferred to fleet in payments credited by fleet when with adelphia.it may also be a complete defense to counts,as discussed later.and this c ourt finds that ratification did indeed occur as to what was received in from the banks 
unlike fleet,hsbc and key were not here in court to take a particular position regarding the sale.the most critical fact for these purposes is that this was a judicial sale,not a sale on the street.in such a sale the judge protects the innocent absentee.a simple mention of hsbc and key by adelphia would have caused this c ourt to bring them here 
a judicial sale depends on disclosure of hazy ownership.even more so as to sales free and clear by a bankruptcy court 
hsbc and key may avail themselves of the ruling that adelphia ratified,in this c ourt,what it received in the attacked transfers.
op.at emphases in original.
the bankruptcy court then gave lengthy consideration to whether the adelphia and its counsel knew at the time of the asset sale that it might later bring an avoidance action against the banks.noting the importance of counsel duty to the court,the bankruptcy court offered a discourse on the level of preparation it expected from experienced bankruptcy counsel before a sale,and speculated that counsel for the adelphia had taken insufficient steps to inform himself about the causes of actions that the adelphia might soon pursue the bankruptcy court went on 
if hsbc and key had appeared here,this c ourt would not ennoble that decision by adelphia counsel to remain silent about them.a big,complex chapter such as adelphia demands big,complex administrative resources to make sure that the debtor is not messing up the n fhlp critical efforts to reorganize the n fhlp debtors and the n fhlp c ourt docket.
but the bankruptcy court found that hsbc and key derive no benefit from its ruling,other than the ability to defend in the adelphia c ourt on the basis,in part,that adelphia ratified the fruits of the challenged transfers.op.at.that court view was that hsbc and key had failed to justify their in the nfhlp court,despite having dealt extensively with rigas and adelphia and t aken payment from adelphia other than in the ordinary course of the debts owed by the sabres.op.at.but it ruled that fleet was different because adelphia should not have consented to convenient resolution to an obstacle to the sale that adelphia adelphia was considering suing fleet for a major portion of the amount,if adelphia was relying on to later sue fleet.id.at.the bankruptcy court thus held that the adelphia was barred from bringing any fraudulent conveyance claims against fleet,but that it could return to the adelphia bankruptcy court and pursue its claims against hsbc and key.
the art appealed the ruling in favor of fleet to the district court,and hsbc and key the rulings against them.
vii.the district court decision 
in february,the district court issued an order affirming the bankruptcy court with respect to fleet but reversing the bankruptcy court with respect to hsbc and key.see hsbc bank usa,adelphia commc ns,civ,wl.the district court agreed with the bankruptcy court that,with respect to fleet,the adelphia had ratified the very transactions,the march sale of the construction and revolver loans to adelphia and adelphia payments on the concession loan that the art now contend s should be avoided.id.at.the district court rejected the notion that the adelphia did not have full knowledge of the facts surrounding the allegedly fraudulent transfer at the time of the sale hearing.id.the district court also took the view that the proper remedy in a fraudulent transfer action is rescission of the underlying transaction,not just a piece of it,such as the purchase price.id.at citing grace bank leumi trust,cir.on this basis,the district court rejected the art attempts to apply ratification to only the sale of the loans,while preserving a fraudulent transfer claim as to the purchase price.id.
unlike the bankruptcy court,the district court found the ratification analysis to be as applicable to hsbc and key as it was to fleet.id.at.the district court stated that there was no reason for hsbc and key to be present at the sale hearing because t he uncontested evidence is that the contracts governing the sale of th e construction and revolver loans ripened into ownership by sabres,and therefore,as far as hsbc and key were aware,at the time of the sale hearing,they had no ownership interests whatsoever in the loans and had no reason to appear.id.at.the district court ruled that the adelphia,by remaining silent at the april sale hearing,ratified the purchase of the loans with respect to hsbc and key as much as with respect to fleet.id.
alternatively,the district court found that several other principles barred the art from pursuing the fraudulent transfer claims.first,the district court concluded that the claims were barred by the doctrine of res judicata because the approval order and adelphia stipulation each constituted a final judgment on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction the adelphia and the banks were all creditors in the nfhlp bankruptcy proceedings,and thus the same parties were involved in both those proceedings and the present fraudulent transfer actions and a judgment in favor of the art on the fraudulent conveyance claims would impair the judgment rendered in the nfhlp bankruptcy,given that the only remedy for a fraudulent conveyance is rescission of the fraudulent transfer and the nfhlp assets were sold to hockey western free and clear.id.at.the district court again rejected the art contention that it did not have full knowledge of the factual basis for any fraudulent conveyance claims at the time of the asset sale,based on record evidence that they were at least exploring such claims.id.at.
as a second alternative ground for barring the art claims,the district court held that the doctrine of judicial estoppel applied,because the nfhlp bankruptcy court had relied on the adelphia representation that it alone owned the construction and revolver loans,a position incompatible with its present contention that the transfers were fraudulent and ought to be rescinded.id.at.finally,the district court found the fraudulent transfer claims barred by the doctrine of,because the art was asserting to the detriment of another a right inconsistent with a position it previously took,such that the conveyances,although perhaps originally impeachable,became unimpeachable in equity.id.at quoting simmons burlington.for each of these independent reasons,the district court declared that the art was barred from pursuing its fraudulent conveyance claims.id.at.
the art timely appealed to this court.

ii.ratification and res judicata 
although,as we shall explain later in our discussion of judicial estoppel,we do not believe that the art can escape the consequences of the adelphia silence and stipulations at the hearing,we can not agree with the district court ratification analysis,for two reasons.first,we are not persuaded that rescission is the only remedy that is ever available for a fraudulent conveyance under new york law.second,we do not think that adelphia demonstrated the requisite intent to ratify the fraudulent conveyances.we will discuss these points in turn,and they lead us to the conclusion that ratification does not bar the art fraudulent conveyance actions with respect to hsbc and key.as we will also explain,the ratification and res judicata analyses are closely related in this context,and we will discuss the two doctrines together.with respect to fleet,we conclude that res judicata applies to block the art cause of action.
a fraudulent transfer is not void,but voidable thus,it can be ratified by a creditor who is then estopped from seeking its avoidance.in re best prods,citing glenn,fraudulent conveyances and preferences,vol,at,at.ratification is the act of knowingly giving sanction or affirmance to an act which would otherwise be unauthorized and not binding.jur d estoppel,ratification,and waiver r atification may be express or implied,or may result from silence or inaction.id.
as discussed above,the bankruptcy court took the view that the adelphia actions ratified what it received from the march,ownership of the construction and revolver not what it paid.the district court rejected this view on the basis that the proper remedy in a fraudulent transfer action is rescission of the underlying transaction,not just a piece of it,such as the purchase price.hsbc bank usa,wl at.we think the district court erred to the extent that it categorically rejected the possibility of a money judgment in lieu of rescission.
it is true,as the district court and the art have both observed,that in the context of discussing new york fraudulent conveyance law we have stated that t he proper remedy in a fraudulent conveyance claim is to rescind,or set aside,the allegedly fraudulent transfer,and cause the transferee to return the transferred property to the transferor.grace bank leumi trust,cir citing geren quantum chem.however,this statement is taken out of context.in the portion of geren that we relied upon as authority for our pronouncement in grace,the concern of judge leval was to make clear that the action for fraudulent conveyance does not create an independent remedy of money damages against third parties who aided the debtors transfer.at.in other words,judge leval was explaining the purpose of fraudulent transfer actions,to unwind transactions between the actual parties to the transaction as distinct from other causes of action,and he was not describing a limitation on how that purpose might be fulfilled.id.at.in grace,similarly,we were required to consider whether a transferee standing existed to challenge a predicate judgment under debtor creditor law,and we cited geren in the context of explaining that such standing should be rare because the remedy under derives from the transfer of the assets and not the predicate judgment.at t he unsatisfied judgment,while a necessary predicate to bringing a case,is not a sword that can be directly turned upon transferees.
neither geren nor grace held,or would logically require us to hold,that under new york law a creditors commit tee can not obtain a money judgment where the asset alleged to have been fraudulently transferred is no longer in the hands of the original transferee.meanwhile,there is considerable authority suggesting that new york law permits exactly such a remedy when the traditional fraudulent conveyance remedy of rescission is no longer practicable.see,newshewat salem,d,w here the assets fraudulently transferred no longer exist a money judgment may be entered in an amount up to the value of the fraudulently transferred assets.rtc mortg.trust sopher,d,under new york law,a creditor may recover money damages against parties who participate in the fraudulent transfer and are either transferees of the assets or beneficiaries of the conveyance.lending textile,all purpose accessories,d,dep t while,as a general rule,the creditor remedy in a fraudulent conveyance action is limited to reaching the property which would have been available to satisfy the judgment had there been no conveyance,a money judgment may properly be granted as a substitute for those assets in circumstances where the debtor assets have been sold and commingled with those of a transferee.bracketed text in original internal quotation omitted mfrs.and traders trust lauer furniture acquisition,dep t where the assets of the have been sold and commingled with those of the transferee,a money judgment was properly granted as a substitute for those assets.valentine richardt,finding monetary judgment appropriate where property conveyed had been sold by transferee to bona fide purchaser see also jur d creditors rights and remedies where the assets fraudulently transferred no longer exist or are no longer in the possession of the transferee,a money judgment may be entered against the transferee in an amount up to the value of the fraudulently transferred assets.
key argues that there are no new york fraudulent conveyance cases allowing a money judgment where,as here,the allegedly ratifying opposed to the transferor or responsible for the destruction of any possibility that the status quo ante could be restored.this appears to be true.but it is also true that recent new york cases do not appear to preclude that remedy under such circumstances,even if the late nineteenth century cases where the alternative money remedy emerged could be read to suggest that the transferee must bear responsibility for the dissolution of the original asset for a money judgment to be available.see valentine,at a s the fraudulent grantee had by his own act,in conveying the land to a bona fide purchaser,prevented the plaintiff from recovering it,equity required that he should restore to the plaintiff its equivalent in money,not as damages,but as a substitute for the land itself,and the court had power to render any judgment consistent with the facts alleged and proved.it thus appears to us that,absent the operation of some other doctrine to bar art fraudulent conveyance actions,new york law would allow the possibility of a money judgment in lieu of rescission,even though the march conveyances can not be undone in the aftermath of the nfhlp asset sale.at least with respect to the price adelphia paid key and hsbc,ratification did not occur,because the adelphia acceptance of sole ownership of the construction and revolver loans did not,as a matter of law,preclude recovery of the purchase price for those loans.
second,we do not think the adelphia intended to ratify the purchase price.mere negligence is not ratification,but an act,such as an acceptance of benefits,may constitute a ratification,and acquiescence may give rise to an implied ratification jur d estoppel,ratification,and waiver.the intent required for ratification must be clearly established and may not be inferred from doubtful or equivocal acts or language.chemical bank affiliated fm ins,cir quoting holm sheet metal,dep t.where the allegedly ratifying party silent acquiescence to a transaction credibly appears to have resulted from the complexity of the situation rather than intent,ratification does not occur.see,e,king ionization int l,cir posner.although intent can be shown by implication,the banks do not point to anything in the record suggesting such intent on the part of adelphia at the sale hearing,and the bankruptcy court opinion suggests that the adelphia,although it may have been impermissibly inattentive to the causes of action available to it,was not acting with intent to ratify.we conclude that the adelphia did not ratify the price it paid for the construction and revolver loans.
and with respect to the construction and revolver loans,there is little difference between ratification and res judicata.the doctrine of res judicata,or claim preclusion,applies in later litigation if an earlier decision was a final judgment on the merits,by a court of competent jurisdiction,in a case involving the same parties or their privies,and involving the same cause of action.edp med.computer,united states,cir bracketed text in original quoting in re teltronic,cir.if those criteria are met,a final judgment on the merits precludes the parties or their privies from relitigating issues that were or could have been raised in that action.id.bracketed text in original quoting pierre dyer,cir alteration in the original.this rule applies with full force to matters decided by the bankruptcy courts.id.
there is no doubt that the bankruptcy court order approving the sale of the hockey team assets was a final judgment on the merits of an action by a court of competent jurisdiction,and we may assume for present purposes that,as the district court held,the nfhlp and adelphia bankruptcies are sufficiently intertwined that they may be considered the same cause of action.but as to the construction and revolver loans,we do not see how res judicata can apply in light of our ratification analysis and,in particular,our conclusion that new york law allows remedies other than rescission under certain circumstances.all that the bankruptcy court did was to approve a sale at which the adelphia appeared as a creditor,and the orders and stipulations entered into at that time merely confirmed that hockey western was acquiring the assets free and clear.these orders in no way resolved the issue of whether the price adelphia paid for the construction and revolver loans was fair,given that new york law would allow a money judgment even after rescission ceased to be a legal possibility.if it is the case that the conduct of the adelphia at the sale ought to deprive it of the opportunity to bring a fraudulent conveyance action because the banks would have proceeded differently had they known of the possibility of such actions,that is an equitable argument arising in some form of estoppel,an argument we will turn to momentarily.it is not an argument about the legal consequences of the asset sale,and res judicata can not apply as to the construction and revolver loans.
the concession loan is a different matter.unlike the other banks,who did not appear in connection with the sale proceeding,fleet and the adelphia negotiated as as to who would get paid what from the sale of the team.in doing so,both fleet and the adelphia agreed to certain sale terms that gave the adelphia credit for the approximately million in payments adelphia had already made to service the concession loan.so,in this respect,the adelphia received consideration not merely from the purchaser as was the case with the construction and revolver loans,which by the time of the asset sale were wholly owned by adelphia,but also from fleet,who the art now contends adelphia should never have paid in the first place.having sat across the table from fleet,and bargained for and benefitted from the terms on which the concession loan was cashed out,the adelphia directly confronted the valuation of the payments it had made to fleet on the concession loan.thus,the issue that was not resolved with respect to the construction and revolver fairness of the price paid by necessarily resolved with respect to the concession loan.for better or for worse,the adelphia consented to fleet demand that it be paid in full for the concession loan,and this was integral to approval of the asset sale.a bankruptcy court order confirming an asset sale is a final judgment capable of having res judicata effect.see in re am.preferred prescription,cir citing hendrick avent,cir gekas pipin,cir.to allow the art to challenge the decision made at the time of the asset sale would necessarily call into question the validity of the price paid at that time and confirmed by the court,which is exactly what res judicata prohibits.
like the district court,we reject the art argument that res judicata can not apply because counsel for the adelphia lacked sufficient knowledge of potential fraudulent conveyance actions at the time of the asset sale.even assuming that it was necessary for the adelphia to have known not only the facts that would have been the basis of its claims but also the viability of its right of we are still bound,absent a showing of clear error,by the bankruptcy court determination that only a deliberate decision to remain unaware of potential fraudulent conveyance actions could explain counsel ignorance.and we have held that r es judicata applies even where new claims are based on newly discovered evidence,unless the evidence was either fraudulently concealed or it could not have been discovered with due diligence.elecs.cougar,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
we have considered the art other arguments that res judicata can not apply,and with respect to the concession loan we find them without merit.
iii.judicial estoppel 
we must now consider whether the equitable doctrine of judicial estoppel requires that the art be estopped from pursuing its claims with respect to the construction and revolver loans even though the asset sale did not strip it of all possible remedies.
a potential consequence of a conflict between two factual statements made by the same party is judicial estoppel where a party assumes a certain po
