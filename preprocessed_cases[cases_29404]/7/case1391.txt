william meeks meeks or the trustee initiated this adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy court to avoid preferential transfers from the debtor,murray armstrong armstrong,to harrah tunica corporation harrah under,a,and arkansas code.harrah appeals the decision of the district court which affirmed the bankruptcy court decision for the trustee.we affirm.
background 
armstrong,the debtor,is an arkansas attorney who organized ponzi schemes to defraud investors,embezzled funds from his elderly clients life savings to support his fraud,and then attempted to become solvent through check kiting and gambling.he is currently incarcerated in a state penitentiary serving a sentence for his crimes.on january,an involuntary bankruptcy petition was filed with the bankruptcy court and an order for relief was entered on march.meeks was appointed trustee in the bankruptcy proceeding.harrah is the operator of harrah casino cruises in tunica,mississippi.
in the early,armstrong was in a very bad financial position,earning less from his legal practice than was required to finance his expensive lifestyle.finding his income insufficient for his spending habits,armstrong began organizing ponzi schemes,embezzling the life savings of elderly clients,check kiting and gambling heavily.
on the night of october,armstrong made a gambling trip to harrah in robinsville,mississippi,that lasted into october.armstrong signed a casino credit application in order to obtain markers from harrah.the casino credit application gave harrah authorization to investigate armstrong financial history for the approval of his credit limit.the credit application also noted in bold type that applicant is responsible for payment of credit issued.armstrong requested on the application a fourteen day disposition,or holding time,before harrah would deposit the markers for payment from armstrong checking account.after looking into armstrong credit and his background with other casinos,harrah initially granted him a line of credit,and then later on october,increased this line of credit to.during this period,harrah allowed armstrong to sign markers totaling.armstrong received in gambling chips from the casino in return for the markers.
harrah at first agreed to hold the markers for fourteen days before depositing them for payment from armstrong bank account.harrah later extended this time to thirty days,the maximum period that harrah would hold a marker.harrah policy,in line with casino industry standards,was to hold the markers for the agreed upon disposition,here fourteen and then thirty days,before depositing the markers at the customer bank.also under its policy,markers could be repaid in chips or cash before the borrower left the casino,or in the alternative,the casino would send the markers to the bank and the bank would honor the markers.harrah policy was to deposit immediately all personal or payroll checks paid to the casino.during his october and gambling trip,armstrong lost gambling at harrah.
after holding the markers for thirty days,harrah deposited them on november and.the markers were presented for payment on november,from armstrong farm account at the bank of rison in rison,arkansas.on that date,armstrong had insufficient funds in his farm account to pay off the markers.the bank held the markers for a day to allow armstrong to come up with the funds.armstrong then fraudulently secured a loan for from the warren bank and trust company using a fictitious lumber deed as collateral and deposited the funds in his farm account.the bank of rison then paid the markers on november and.
returning to harrah on november and,armstrong signed eight more markers that were redeemed with chips during that trip and are not the subject of this litigation.on december,armstrong gambled again at harrah and signed an additional thirteen markers worth that remain unpaid.only the october and markers are the subject of this proceeding.the trustee seeks to avoid the payment on these october markers.
armstrong was insolvent throughout all of the relevant time period,with his financial obligations exceeding his assets by a net deficit of in october.
ii.discussion 
following the district court review of the decision of the bankruptcy court,we sit as a second court of review in this matter.owens miller in re miller,cir.we apply the same standard of review as the district court,reviewing the bankruptcy court findings of fact for clear error and the bankruptcy court conclusions of law de novo.id.
the trustee cause of action to avoid the transfer of from armstrong to harrah is based upon a preference under b.in order to establish a prima facie case for a preference under the statute,the trustee must establish an interest 
to or for the benefit of a creditor 
for or on account of an antecedent debt owed by the debtor before such transfer was made 
made while the debtor was insolvent 
a on or within days before the date of the filing of the petition or 
b between ninety days and one year before the date of the filing of the petition,if such creditor at the time of such transfer was an insider and 
that enables such creditor to receive more than such creditor would receive if 
a the case were a case under chapter of this title 
b the transfer had not been made and 
c such creditor received payment of such debt to the extent provided by the provisions of this title.
id.it is undisputed that the trustee presented sufficient evidence on all of the elements of b,except for subsection.harrah argues the trustee did not make a prima facie case for a preference because he did not prove under b that the transfer was for or on account of an antecedent debt owed by the debtor before such transfer was made.
antecedent debt 
harrah argues the casino markers at issue are negotiable instruments checks made out by armstrong in a concurrent transaction for gambling chips.the bankruptcy court,however,concluded the markers were part of a loan transaction and thus met the antecedent debt element.
the bankruptcy code defines debt as a liability on a claim.laws united.bank of kansas city,cir citing.a debt is antecedent if it was incurred before the allegedly preferential transfer.jones truck lines,cent.states,southeast and southwest areas pension fund in re jones truck lines,cir.a debt is incurred on the date upon which the debtor first becomes legally bound to pay.id.quoting in re iowa premium,cir en banc.here,it is clear armstrong became obligated to pay on october and.the issue is whether armstrong simultaneously paid for the of chips at that time.
the bankruptcy court and district court both relied upon our decision in united states abodeely,cir,a criminal tax evasion case,in which we stated that a marker is an advance or loan which may be exchanged for chips in order to gamble.harrah argues this was mere dicta and not binding precedent upon this court.while we were correct in abodeely that a marker is a short term loan exchanged for gambling chips,a more analysis is warranted here.
the legal definition of a casino marker is a crucial factor in determining the rights of the parties.harrah argues a marker meets the statutory definition of a check under the mississippi uniform commercial code.each marker states on its face that it is governed by the laws of mississippi.the uniform commercial code ucc as adopted by mississippi defines a check as i a draft,other than a documentary draft,payable on demand and drawn on a bank or ii a cashier check or a teller check.ann.f.each marker states on its face the name of the drawee,the amount of money,the date of issue,the signature of murray armstrong,the bank it is to be drawn from,and the bank account number.the markers also read,i hereby represent that i have received cash for the above amount and that said amount is on deposit in said institution in my name and is free from claims and is subject to this check.upon presentment to the bank for payment,the markers at issue legally operate as checks under the ucc.however,this does not end our analysis.
with the expanding legalization of gambling and the pervasiveness of casino business operations almost nationwide,other courts have been called upon to analyze the legal effect of markers.louisiana and nevada have both concluded that a marker falls within the definition of a check under the ucc and markers are therefore enforceable under state bad check criminal enforcement laws.telerecovery of louisiana,gaulon,so d,nguyen state.see also fleeger bell,d,aff fleeger bell.cir unpublished opinion.while the analysis of markers under the ucc employed by these courts informs us how these states have decided to enforce markers as checks within ordinary banking channels,these cases offer us limited guidance for the facts and issues here.
harrah urges this court to conclude that because the markers operate as checks within the normal banking channels and meet the definition of a check under the ucc,the transactions at issue can not be characterized as involving antecedent debt under b.harrah instead labels the transaction concurrent,wherein the casino merely exchanged casino chips for armstrong markers,which they ask us to treat as the equivalent of personal checks.harrah characterization of the transaction at issue ignores important facts.
harrah argument mistakenly relies on the assumption that a check can not form part of a debt transaction.this is not the case.ucc states the obligation of a party to an instrument to pay the instrument may be modified,supplemented,or nullified by a separate agreement of the obligor and a person entitled to enforce the instrument,if the instrument is issued or the obligation is incurred in reliance on the agreement or as part of the same transaction giving rise to the agreement.ann.comment elaborates upon this rule,noting the separate agreement modifying the terms of the instrument may contradict the terms of the instrument.in this case,each marker is subject to harrah further agreement to hold the marker for a period of time.
the record clearly shows that harrah agreed to hold the markers initially for fourteen days,and then thirty days,before submitting them to armstrong bank for payment.when harrah extended a line of credit to armstrong,permitted him to sign markers in exchange for chips,and promised not to present the markers to his bank for payment for a definite length of time,harrah made a short term loan to armstrong.at that time,on october and,armstrong created a debt to harrah not due for thirty days.
it is noteworthy that harrah policy requires the immediate deposit of personal checks written or paychecks signed over to the casino for chips whereas,the casino will hold for later presentment the markers it issues as a part of the casino credit arrangement.harrah credit application signed by armstrong authorized investigation into armstrong financial history for the approval of his credit limit.in bold type on the application was the phrase applicant is responsible for payment of credit issued.this language is evidence that harrah recognized that the use of markers and its agreement to hold those markers for up to days was a credit transaction.
in determining that the markers issued by harrah were part of a loan transaction,we also note the markers were issued in the precise manner required for credit play under section vii t of the mississippi gaming regulations.these same regulations explicitly refer to markers as credit instruments.
an analogy between the markers issued by harrah and short term payday loans is enlightening as to why the markers here form part of a loan transaction.in oiciyapi fed.credit union.credit union,cir,we characterized payday loans as loans taken out up to two weeks in advance of the borrower next paycheck.payday loans are an extension of credit designed to be repaid on the borrower next payday.jackson american loan,cir.the similarity between the payday loan and the casino marker lies in the fact that both loan transactions utilize a negotiable instrument in the name of the borrower that is held for later deposit or redemption in exchange for ready funds.the payday lender typically holds the borrower postdated check until payday,when it is either redeemed by the borrower with cash or presented to the borrower bank for payment.oiciyapi,at.similarly,in the marker context,the casino agrees to hold the gambler signed marker for a specified period of time,here thirty days,before presenting it to the borrower bank.in both circumstances,it is the agreement not to deposit the check until a certain date that converts a negotiable instrument into a loan.the check and the marker in both circumstances function as security for the loan and will only be cashed if the loan is not paid off in the designated time period.
armstrong debt to harrah here was incurred on october and.the payment on the debt was not due until the agreed upon time when the marker could be deposited at the bank,thirty days later.because the debt here was incurred thirty days before payment,we find the payment of the casino markers constituted the payment of antecedent debt for purposes of b.see in re jones,at.
contemporaneous exchange 
a payment that is a preference under b may remain unavoided if it falls within one of the bankruptcy code c exceptions.harrah first argues the transaction falls under the affirmative defense set forth in c.under the c defense,the trustee may not avoid a transfer 
a intended by the debtor and the creditor to or for whose benefit such transfer was made to be a contemporaneous exchange for new value given to the debtor and 
b in fact a substantially contemporaneous exchange 
harrah asks this court to construe the transaction between harrah and armstrong as a concurrent exchange of a payment by check for gambling chips.harrah characterization overlooks important aspects of the relevant loan transaction.
to establish the contemporaneous exchange defense,harrah must show that both the and the intended a contemporaneous exchange the exchange was in fact contemporaneous and the exchange was for new value.see official plan comm.expeditors int l of washington,in re gateway pac,cir.
the critical inquiry in determining whether there has been a contemporaneous exchange for new value is whether the parties intended such an exchange.id.internal citations omitted.the existence of such an intent is a question of fact that we review for clear error.id.here,the bankruptcy court found,there is no evidence before the court that either harrah or armstrong intended the transaction to be contemporaneous.meeks harrah tunica in re armstrong.the bankruptcy court was not clearly erroneous in finding armstrong initially requested and harrah agreed to fourteen days for armstrong to pay for the markers,which harrah later agreed to extend to thirty days.the bankruptcy court therefore made no error in concluding the parties did not intend a contemporaneous exchange for new value.
the test for when a debt is incurred is whether the debtor is legally obligated to pay.laws,at.when a bank made advances to its customer in the amount of checks on deposit not yet collected,we held the customer was not indebted to the bank.id.however,we importantly noted,if the customer and the bank explicitly agreed to convert future negative collected funds balances into loans,the customer would have been legally bound to pay such debts as incurred.id.at.here,the facts show that harrah and armstrong entered into an explicit agreement that harrah would not cash the markers for thirty days.armstrong had the option of redeeming the markers for chips,cash,or check at any time before the markers became due.the debt was incurred at the time armstrong signed the markers,but the short term loan did not become due until the thirty days expired.
we can not overlook the important policy considerations driving congress to structure as it did.we have previously recognized that s ection is intended to discourage creditors from racing to dismember a debtor sliding into bankruptcy and to promote equality of distribution to creditors in bankruptcy.in re jones,at.the purpose of the c exceptions at issue is to encourage creditors to continue doing business with troubled debtors who may then be able to avoid bankruptcy altogether.id.contemporaneous exchanges for new value are an exception for two reasons b
