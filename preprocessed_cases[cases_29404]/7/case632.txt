in this consolidated appeal,timothy branigan,standing chapter trustee for the district of maryland,greenbelt division chapter trustee,appeals the district court order affirming both the bankruptcy court denial of his motion to dismiss the chapter petition of joseph bateman,and its confirmation of bateman chapter plan and the bankruptcy court orders denying his motion to dismiss the chapter petition of arthur and remegia graves collectively the graveses and likewise confirming the graveses chapter plan the chapter trustee contends that,because both bateman and the graveses are ineligible for discharges under f west supp,they should not be allowed to file a chapter petition.we disagree,and for the reasons set forth below,we affirm.
this case requires us to determine the meaning of f,which provides 
notwithstanding subsections a and b,the court shall not grant a discharge of all debts provided for in the plan or disallowed under section,if the debtor has received a discharge 
in a case filed under chapter,or of this title during the period preceding the date of the order for relief under this chapter,or 
in a case filed under chapter of this title during the period preceding the date of such order.
bateman previously filed for chapter bankruptcy on march,and received a discharge on june,later that year,on december,bateman filed the chapter bankruptcy petition at issue in this appeal to stop a pending foreclosure on his home.if ultimately put into effect,his confirmed chapter plan would fully pay all allowed claims.
bateman,however,would not receive a chapter discharge.the united states trustee filed a complaint seeking an order denying bateman a discharge pursuant to f because bateman had initiated the chapter proceeding within four years of the date that he had filed his previous chapter bankruptcy petition bateman did not respond to the united states trustee complaint,and the bankruptcy court entered a default judgment denying bateman a chapter discharge.
the chapter trustee filed a motion to dismiss bateman chapter petition based on his interpretation of f,arguing that bateman could not file a chapter petition because he was currently ineligible for a chapter discharge.the bankruptcy court denied the motion.in re bateman.after the bankruptcy court confirmed the plan over the chapter trustee objection,the chapter trustee appealed to the united states district court for the district of maryland,and the district court affirmed.in re khan,no.dkc,wl,dist.lexis.the chapter trustee appeals this decision.
like bateman,the graveses filed a joint chapter bankruptcy on february,to stop a pending foreclosure on their home,and like bateman,their confirmed chapter plan will pay all allowed claims in full.the graveses had previously filed a chapter bankruptcy petition on january,and received a chapter discharge on june,after completing five years of chapter plan payments.
as in bateman case,the chapter trustee filed a motion to dismiss the graveses second chapter petition,arguing that the graveses were ineligible to file the petition because they were ineligible to receive a chapter discharge.the chapter trustee contended that f prohibits a discharge in a chapter case filed within two years of the date of discharge in the prior bankruptcy and that because the graveses had received a discharge in a prior case in the period preceding the date of the filing in the present case,they were ineligible for a chapter discharge under f.the united states trustee filed a motion in opposition to the chapter trustee motion,arguing that the graveses were indeed eligible for a discharge under f because the period during which a discharge is prohibited runs from the date of filing in the prior bankruptcy case to the date of filing in the present chapter case.
the bankruptcy court denied the chapter trustee motion in part,finding that the graveses were eligible to file a chapter petition even if they could not receive a discharge,but also concluding that the question of their eligibility for a discharge was premature pending confirmation of the plan.in re graves,wl,graves i.ultimately,the bankruptcy court adopted a filing date to filing date interpretation of f and concluded that the graveses were eligible for a discharge as their chapter filings were over seven years apart.the bankruptcy court thus confirmed the graveses chapter plan over the chapter trustee objection.in re graves,wl,graves ii.
the chapter trustee sought a direct appeal of the bankruptcy court order to this court,which we granted,and the graveses case was consolidated with bateman we possess jurisdiction over the chapter trustee appeal in bateman case under d west conferring jurisdiction on courts of appeals to review final decisions of district courts reviewing bankruptcy decisions,and we possess jurisdiction over the chapter trustee appeal in the graveses case pursuant to d west conferring jurisdiction on courts of appeals to hear direct appeals from the bankruptcy court.
in this appeal,we must answer two questions of statutory interpretation.to resolve the graveses entitlement to receive a discharge in their second chapter petition,we must first decide whether the and periods described in f run from the date of filing of the previous bankruptcy petition or from the date of discharge with respect to the previous petition.in addition,to resolve bateman right to file a chapter petition,we must decide whether an individual may file a chapter petition if he is ineligible for a discharge under f.because this appeal presents only questions of bankruptcy law,our review is de novo.in re white,cir.
resolution of the first issue is a matter of grammar,for we must decide whether the phrase during the period preceding the date of such order in f modifies the phrase received a discharge or the phrase filed under chapter of this title.the chapter trustee contends that the phrase modifies the phrase received a discharge,so that the graveses are not eligible for a discharge under f because they received a discharge in a prior case in the period preceding the date of the filing in the present case.under the chapter trustee interpretation,the filing date of the prior bankruptcy petition is immaterial.the chapter trustee thus urges us to adopt a discharge date to filing date interpretation of subsection f.
in contrast,the graveses argue that a filing date to filing date interpretation is correct because the phrase during the period preceding the date of such order modifies the immediately preceding phrase filed under chapter of this title.under this interpretation,the graveses could only be denied a discharge in the present case if their prior chapter case was filed in the period preceding the date of filing in the present case.
because we conclude that the statutory language is plain,our analysis begins and ends with that language.lamie united states,d w hen the statute language is plain,the sole function of the least where the disposition required by the text is not to enforce it according to its terms.internal quotation marks omitted.applying the plain meaning of the statutory language,we conclude that the filing date to filing date interpretation of f is correct.this interpretation gives effect to the logical sequence of the language used.each subsequent clause modifies the immediately preceding clause.all words are given effect.no punctuation needs to be added or deleted.graves ii,at.
our conclusion is buttressed by the doctrine of the last antecedent,which teaches that a limiting clause or phrase should ordinarily be read as modifying only the noun or phrase that it immediately follows.barnhart thomas,d see also d statutes qualifying words,phrases,and clauses are ordinarily confined to the last antecedent,or to the words and phrases immediately preceding.applying this doctrine,the phrase during the period preceding the date of such order in f modifies the immediately preceding phrase filed under rather than the more distant phrase received a discharge.
moreover,any conclusion to the contrary would run counter to the general rule that courts should disfavor interpretations of statutes that render language superfluous.in re witt,cir quoting.bank germain,d.the chapter trustee interpretation would render the word filed superfluous,for congress could have accomplished what the chapter trustee believes the statute already accomplishes by omitting the word filed entirely and having subsection f to read in a case under chapter of this title in contrast to the chapter trustee,we believe that when congress used the phrase filed under,it meant filed under and not just under.
reading the statute as the chapter trustee would have us do also requires some grammatical finagling that is not needed with the filing date to filing date interpretation that we adopt.under the chapter trustee view,the statute must be reorganized so that subsection f would then read as follows if the debtor has received a discharge during the period preceding the date of such order,in a case filed under chapter of this title.even the chapter trustee concedes that t he position of words in a sentence is the principle sic means of showing their relationship,appellant supp.br.at quoting william strunk,white,the elements of style macmillan ed elementary principle of composition,a principle which is borne out by our application of the doctrine of the last antecedent in this case.
undeterred by the grammatical obstacles to his interpretation,the chapter trustee argues that because most chapter plans historically run for five years,a filing date to filing date interpretation essentially renders f meaningless.the bankruptcy court persuasively responded to this argument 
w hile it may be true that many plans state on their face that they are plans,it is not the case that the bankruptcy code requires that result in all cases.and it certainly is not the case that the bankruptcy code does not allow a one or plan if the circumstances of section b are met.accordingly,congress expressly made a distinction between plans running three years or longer,on the one hand,and plans running less than three years,on the other hand,in section b.there is nothing in the bankruptcy code to indicate that congress also did not distinguish between plans completed in two years or less,compared to plans completed in three years or more,in section f.
graves ii,at.indeed,as the chapter trustee concedes,many chapter plans are predicated on a refinancing or sale of estate property in less than three years.appellant supp.br.at.
likewise,although collier on bankruptcy has recognized that,under a filing date to filing date interpretation,f should rarely be applicable,it nevertheless believes such an interpretation flows from the plain language of the statute 
it might be suggested that congress really intended that the period run from the date of the discharge in the prior case,but such a reading of the subsection does violence to its plain language,which links the time period to the filing of the prior case in each subparagraph the reading urged by the chapter trustee would fly in the face of congress sic policy of encouraging chapter rather than chapter,punishing only those who successfully completed chapter plans and received a discharge.

finally,courts have repeatedly emphasized congress preference that individual debtors use chapter instead of chapter.in re mcdonald,cir in re bartee,cir.the filing date to filing date interpretation we adopt today is in keeping with this preference a debtor who files a new chapter petition after receiving a discharge in a typical chapter plan would never be prohibited under f from receiving a discharge,but a debtor who obtained a chapter discharge in a case filed within the last two years would be prohibited from receiving a discharge,as would debtors filing under chapter within the last four years.in re ward.
as the graveses case illustrates,however,the discharge date to filing date interpretation urged by the chapter trustee would reach an absurd result that runs counter to congress preference for chapter bankruptcy.the graveses filed for chapter bankruptcy on january,and received a chapter discharge on june.under the chapter trustee interpretation,the graveses would not be able to receive a discharge in a new chapter bankruptcy,which would pay all creditor claims in full,until june.but because the graveses previous chapter plan paid at least percent of the allowed unsecured claims,was proposed in good faith,and represented their best efforts,the graveses would be eligible for a chapter discharge on the very day they received their previous chapter discharge see a west supp providing for a waiting period for a chapter discharge after a debtor has been granted discharge in a chapter case,unless payments under the plan totaled of allowed claims or of such claims and the plan was proposed by the debtor in good faith and with the debtor best efforts.this would produce the strange result that the graveses would not be able to receive a chapter discharge,which would pay the creditor claims in full,but would be permitted to file a chapter bankruptcy and thereby avoid payment of a larger portion of their outstanding debts.the chapter trustee interpretation thus would encourage debtors that had intended to pay back all of their debts to instead opt for a chapter discharge merely because a chapter discharge would not be available to them at the height of their financial difficulties.
in sum,the plain language of f supports a filing date to filing date interpretation,and this result is not absurd accordingly,we hold that under f,a debtor may not obtain a chapter discharge in a bankruptcy filed within two years of filing an earlier chapter petition that resulted in a discharge,or within four years of filing an earlier chapter,or petition that resulted in a discharge because the time between the graveses chapter filings was more than years,f does not prohibit the graveses from receiving a discharge.we therefore affirm the bankruptcy court orders denying the chapter trustee motion to dismiss and confirming the graveses chapter plan.
on the other hand,because the time between bateman previous chapter filing in which he received a discharge and his current chapter filing was less than years,bateman is not eligible for a discharge under f indeed,bateman does not contend otherwise.instead,to resolve bateman case,we must decide whether a party like bateman can file a chapter bankruptcy petition when a discharge is not available.
the chapter trustee argues that f was added to the bankruptcy code to put an end to the proliferation of serial filings and prohibit debtors like bateman from filing for chapter relief when they are ineligible to receive a discharge upon completion of their confirmed plan.bateman counters that the unavailability of a discharge does not preclude a good faith chapter filing and we agree.
first,we do not believe that f is an eligibility provision.in re lewis.rather,whether an individual may be a debtor under chapter is established under e west supp section f never mentions the word filing,speaks only of discharge,and does not purport to limit the eligibility provisions of e.we therefore hold that the plain language of f does not prohibit a debtor who is ineligible for a discharge from filing a chapter petition see collier p noting that f does not prevent a debtor from filing a chapter case after a chapter case or after a prior chapter case in which a discharge was received william houston brown,taking exception to a debtor discharge the bankruptcy amendments make it easier,am,t his provision does not prevent the debtor from filing for chapter relief and potentially obtaining the benefit of the automatic stay,nor does it prevent that debtor from obtaining confirmation of a plan in a second case,even though that debtor might not be able to ultimately obtain a discharge in that case.
the chapter trustee relies heavily on the following statement from the united states supreme court in johnson home state bank,d 
congress has expressly prohibited various forms of serial filings.see,g no filings within days of dismissal a no chapter filing within six years of a chapter or chapter filing a limitation on chapter fili
