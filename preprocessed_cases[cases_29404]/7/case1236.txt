financial,llc tsf appeals the district court finding that tsf formed an enforceable settlement agreement with north central construction,ncc on june,during bankruptcy proceedings for ethanol tse ncc,claiming the district court abused its discretion by denying ncc reasonable attorney fees.because no enforceable contract was formed,we reverse and also dismiss ncc as moot.
background 
ethanol bankruptcy proceedings 
in,ncc built an ethanol plant in rosholt,south dakota.tse owned the plant,and ncc retained a million equity interest in the plant.the plant began operating in,but was not profitable.tse failed to pay ncc for construction of the plant,and ncc filed a mechanic lien and initiated foreclosure proceedings in south dakota state court.in may,tse filed a chapter bankruptcy petition in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of south dakota,resulting in a stay of ncc state foreclosure action.in june,a group of investors formed tsf,a shell corporation designed exclusively to provide funding for tse in an effort to return the ethanol plant to operation.
tse filed a modified chapter plan in march modified plan or plan.ncc and creditor interstate electric and engineering company interstate objected to their treatment under the plan.on june,tsf representatives engaged in settlement negotiations with ncc representatives.tsf sought an agreement under which tsf could purchase ncc claims against the bankruptcy estate,thus eliminating ncc objections to the modified plan.no agreement was reached on that date,but settlement negotiations continued between tsf representative john hoich hoich and ncc representative peter rudeen rudeen.tsf representatives later authorized hoich to offer rudeen million in exchange for ncc claims and interests in tse.hoich made the offer on june,the evening before a hearing was scheduled to discuss confirmation of the modified plan.
on the morning of june,shortly before the hearing commenced,rudeen called hoich and accepted the offer.representatives for tsf and interstate met with ncc attorney ron hall hall to discuss how the settlement should be structured.hoich did not attend either the meeting or the confirmation hearing.several other tsf representatives attended,including david ruback ruback,tsf manager james jandrain jandrain,a certified public accountant and jerrold strasheim strasheim,tsf newly hired attorney.hall took notes of the discussion and passed the notes around for others to review.
shortly after the meeting,the confirmation hearing commenced.hall read his notes into the record and indicated,with no objection,that his notes represented the settlement agreement among tsf,interstate,and ncc.several parties were present,including at least sixteen attorneys,and a significant amount of confusion existed about the terms of the agreement 
the terms of the settlement agreement read into the record can not easily be summarized.tsf agreed to purchase the various claims of ncc and interstate for million,with payable to interstate.the alleged agreement also contained provisions stating ncc and interstate would not object to tse plan confirmation.the reading detailed which claims were being purchased and from which class the claims could be found in tse chapter bankruptcy plan.there was also a provision allowing interstate to retain one of its claims which was to be paid by tse bankruptcy estate over a period of three years.
at the conclusion of the june,hearing,the bankruptcy court requested an amended plan be filed by june,in an effort to expedite the process.the court scheduled a confirmation hearing for the amended plan on july.before the confirmation hearing took place,the parties began to discuss the settlement agreement,and to exchange drafts of proposed documents,in an effort to memorialize the settlement discussed during the june,hearing.conflicts arose when tsf claimed the agreement was subject to confirmation of the amended plan.ncc vehemently denied the existence of such a condition.in the meantime,tsf raised million from investors and deposited the money into a trust account with strasheim law firm 
when ncc and tsf failed to agree on the written terms for the formal agreement,ncc filed a motion on july,asking the bankruptcy court to enforce the june,agreement.ncc and interstate also filed new objections to plan confirmation and ballots rejecting the modified plan in the event tsf failed to perform under the agreement.the motion to approve the settlement agreement and the motion to confirm the modified plan were heard on july.
shortly before the hearing,ncc attempted to perform its obligations under the settlement agreement by tendering to tsf an assignment of its claims against,and its interests in,tse.tsf declined to accept the tendered assignment and refused to pay ncc.when the hearing convened,tse and tsf did not pursue confirmation of tse modified plan,but instead,joined in a pending motion by the united states bankruptcy trustee trustee asking the court to dismiss the chapter proceedings.the bankruptcy court denied the motion to dismiss and instead converted tse chapter reorganization to a chapter liquidation.
the bankruptcy court also denied ncc motion to approve the settlement agreement,finding the settlement agreement was not conditional in any manner.the court noted the parties disagreed as to whether a meeting of the minds occurred,but the court concluded it did not have jurisdiction to force tsf,a third party not directly involved in the bankruptcy,to consummate a deal.tsf returned the million,which had been placed in a trust account,to the contributors.

present contract action 
after the bankruptcy court denied ncc motion,ncc filed this lawsuit in district court seeking to enforce the alleged settlement agreement against tsf and hoich.the parties also continued attempts to negotiate a new settlement in the bankruptcy court.the district court repeatedly stayed the contract action to allow negotiations to continue in bankruptcy.during this time,many of tse assets were sold,and several secured creditors and priority administrative expenses were paid from the bankruptcy estate.
on june,ncc and the trustee reached a settlement agreement as to ncc claim for construction costs.the bankruptcy court granted the trustee motion to approve the settlement agreement,but by that time,the district court had lifted the stay in the present action.as a result,the bankruptcy court was unable to enforce the settlement agreement formed by ncc and the trustee.
on august,this contract action proceeded to trial.the district court issued an opinion and order on december,holding the original settlement agreement,read into the bankruptcy court record on june,was a binding and enforceable agreement.the district court further found both tsf and hoich were bound by the agreement,and both tsf and hoich breached the agreement when they failed to perform,making them jointly and severally liable in the amount of million,plus prejudgment interest.the award was later reduced to,plus interest,pursuant to a stipulation ncc previously had made.the district court denied ncc request for attorney fees.
on february,tsf and hoich filed this consolidated appeal challenging the district court judgment in favor of ncc.ncc filed a challenging the denial of attorney fees.on november,counsel for tsf,hoich,and ncc appeared for oral argument before our court.tsf later filed bankruptcy and all proceedings were stayed as to the issues raised by tsf in its appeal and by ncc in its.the stay did not extend to hoich appeal.on march,this court issued an opinion resolving all issues raised by hoich in his appeal.see hoich,at.we held,among other things,that the district court erred in finding hoich had personally guaranteed,or hoich was a party to,the alleged june,settlement agreement.id.at.
tsf trustee filed a motion with the bankruptcy court seeking to lift the stay as to the litigation pending between tsf and ncc.on september,the bankruptcy court granted the motion,and our court was notified the stay was lifted on september.on september,this court severed hoich appeal from the remaining consolidated cases.on that same date,we dismissed,as moot,the claims against hoich in ncc.
the remaining matters for our court to consider are tsf claims against ncc in case number,and ncc claim against tsf in case number.tsf argues the district court erred when the court denied tsf motion for recusal and disqualification,denied tsf motion to dismiss on the basis of issue preclusion,concluded a binding agreement had been formed between tsf and ncc,found the agreement was enforceable,and improperly calculated damages.ncc,contending the district court abused its discretion by denying ncc reasonable attorney fees.
ii.analysis 
motion for recusal and disqualification 
before the district court set a trial date in the present case,the district court heard various appeals arising out of the underlying bankruptcy proceeding.tsf maintains two of the district court opinions in the bankruptcy appeals demonstrate the court whether a binding agreement was formed on june.in one bankruptcy appellate opinion filed on may,the district court stated,
we know that tsf and ncc reached a settlement in the presence of the bankruptcy judge which was on the record in june of.this was followed by tsf reneging on the settlement by adding terms not previously stated.the bankruptcy judge did not enforce the settlement and allowed tsf to escape from it.of course,this would be frustrating to any judge.
in another appellate opinion filed january,the district court declared,
it is obvious from the record that,despite the protestations of the attorneys for tsf,the bankruptcy judge believes that tsf twice agreed to settlements,once before the bankruptcy judge and then in a mediation session before a united states magistrate judge,and then refused to honor them by adding additional stipulations and conditions.
tsf claims the district court statements in these two appellate opinions demonstrate the d istrict c ourt already decided that ncc and tsf reached an agreement and that tsf breached that agreement.tsf asserts,the d istrict c ourt already ruled in favor of ncc on the merits before the evidence was presented at trial.based upon these statements,tsf proposes the district court had an unfavorable predisposition against tsf and should have granted tsf motion to recuse.

tsf admits the comments made by the district court were made in a judicial context.tsf does not dispute that the opinions formed by the district judge were based upon facts introduced during,and events occurring in,the course of the related bankruptcy proceeding.as a consequence,in order to establish bias or prejudice from the district court statements,tsf is required to demonstrate the district court judge had a disposition so extreme as to display a clear inability to render a fair judgment.id.quoting denton,at.under the facts of this case,tsf is unable to meet this burden.
in the district court order denying tsf recusal motion,the district judge admitted he erred in stating that settlements had been reached.the district judge continued by resolving,settlements may or may not have been reached and the trial of this action will answer that question.the statements in the district court opinions and in the transcripts manifestly do not demonstrate a favoritism or antagonism,nor do they display a disposition so extreme as to render fair judgment impossible.see liteky united states.on the contrary,the district judge admitted his error,and resolved to consider all the evidence presented at trial before deciding whether a contract had been formed.the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying tsf motion for recusal and disqualification.
motion to dismiss 
tsf argues the district court erred in denying tsf motion to dismiss on the basis of issue preclusion.tsf maintains that on july,at an evidentiary hearing,the bankruptcy court determined that no agreement had been formed at the earlier june,hearing.therefore,tsf insists the bankruptcy court already resolved the issue,and collateral estoppel should bar further litigation of whether ncc and tsf entered into a binding settlement agreement.
on july,the bankruptcy court held a hearing on ncc motion to approve a compromise and settlement release.during the hearing,ncc attorney patrick lee stated it was ncc position an agreement had been reached between tsf and ncc at the june,hearing.continued by proclaiming tsf refusal to tender the million in exchange for ncc interests in tse constituted a failure to perform and a breach of the settlement agreement.the bankruptcy judge answered complaints,responding,i do disagree with you.however,the bankruptcy court declined to enforce the alleged agreement,deciding the court did not have authority to force tsf,a not directly involved in the bankruptcy,to consummate a deal.at no time during the hearing did the bankruptcy court determine whether or not a contract actually existed as of june,between ncc and tsf.tsf claim relies on a mischaracterization of the record.the district court did not err.
settlement agreement 
on appeal,tsf contends the district court erred in finding a binding agreement was formed during the june,bankruptcy hearing because the alleged agreement failed to include an essential term,plan confirmation,which had been anticipated by the parties.tsf claim that the settlement agreement was contingent upon confirmation of tse modified plan is unsupported by the record.regardless,tsf is precluded from relying on such a condition precedent because tsf conduct in joining the trustee motion to dismiss instead of pursuing confirmation of the modified plan prevented the alleged condition precedent from occurring.see d contracts one who prevents or makes impossible the performance or occurrence of a condition precedent,upon which that person liability depends under the contract,can not insist or rely on the condition.see also johnson coss,an individual who prevents the occurrence of a condition may be said to be estopped from benefiting from the fact that the condition precedent to his or her obligation failed to occur.quoting richard lord,williston on contracts.nonetheless,the record makes clear that no agreement was reached for entirely different reasons.
