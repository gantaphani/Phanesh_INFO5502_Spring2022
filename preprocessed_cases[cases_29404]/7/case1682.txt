in this case we are asked to review the decision of the bankruptcy appellate panel bap,which held that the universal service administrative company usac was a transferee under and.we hold that usac is a transferee under the dominion test and affirm the judgment of the bap.
facts and proceedings 
congress passed the telecommunications act to encourage universal telecommunications service.city of springfield ostrander in re lan tamers,cir.universal service includes advanced telecommunications and information services,particularly internet access,for schools as well as for libraries and rural health care providers.id.quoting b,h.to this end,the telecommunications act of telecommunications act requires telecommunications carriers providing interstate telecommunications services to financially support the cost of providing telecommunications services to schools,libraries,providers,consumers,and subscribers in areas.see b see also id.d every telecommunications carrier that provides interstate telecommunications services shall contribute,on an equitable and nondiscriminatory basis,to the specific,predictable,and sufficient mechanisms established by the commission to preserve and advance universal service.the telecommunications companies pass this cost through to their subscribers the charge generally appears on phone bills as the universal service fund fee.
each telecommunications carrier is required by law to contribute to the universal support fund usf based on its interstate and international telecommunications revenue.see a.the federal communications commission fcc devises a formula that each carrier must adhere to in calculating its contribution.the usf contributions are not defined as federal funds however,they exist because of a federal mandate.in re lan tamers,at see also.office of pub.util.counsel fcc,cir describing the history and universal service goal of the telecommunications act and subsequent implementing regulations in re lan tamers,at describing certain portions of the usac structure in conjunction with the program implementing usf financial support for schools and libraries robert frieden,universal service when technologies converge and regulatory models diverge,harv.tech,describing the telecommunications act universal service mission and its impact.the universal service fund is then disbursed to subsidize the costs of telecommunications services for the beneficiaries of the act,schools,libraries,and rural health care providers all disbursements from the usf are made to carriers 
congress gave the fcc the authority to implement the universal service support provisions of the telecommunications act and mandated that it do so.pursuant to this authority,the fcc designated usac,a corporation incorporated in delaware,to collect,pool,and disburse the universal service support funds contributed by carriers pursuant to d.a the universal service administrative company is appointed the permanent administrator of the federal universal service support mechanisms see also id.the term administrator shall refer to the universal service administrative company that has been appointed the permanent administrator of the federal universal service support mechanisms.all of usac operations are carried out pursuant to regulations promulgated by the fcc.see id.
incomnet communications corporation incomnet was a telecommunications carrier subject to universal service support contribution requirements under fcc regulations.pursuant to fcc rules,usac billed and collected usf contributions from incomnet during the months of june,july,and august.the contributions for those three months totaled,and usac deposited incomnet contributions in the usf along with contributions from other carriers.
incomnet filed for chapter bankruptcy on september,the committee of unsecured creditors of incomnet communications corporation committee was appointed trustee of incomnet estate on may.the committee filed a complaint against usac in federal bankruptcy court,alleging that the paid by incomnet to usac in june,july,and august of constituted a preferential transfer made within the ninety days preceding incomnet bankruptcy petition.arguing that usac was a transferee under and a,the committee sought to recover these universal service support contributions and requested that usac reimburse these payments to incomnet.the committee also sought to prevent usac from making any further claims on incomnet estate.
usac admitted that it had received a total of in universal service support contributions from incomnet through three payments in june,july,and august of,respectively.however,it contended that it was not a transferee under a,but was instead a mere conduit for the funds,and moved for summary judgment on that ground.
the committee filed objections to usac motion for summary judgment and subsequently moved for summary judgment on its first cause of action,the preferential transfer.it argued that uncontroverted evidence established that usac receipt of the funds from incomnet met all of the requirements of b.
purporting to apply the test we announced in danning miller in re bullion reserve of north america,cir,which the bankruptcy court labeled the dominion or control test,the bankruptcy court found that usac did not have dominion or control over the usf.the bankruptcy court held that usac did not have the requisite degree of unfettered control over the usf to qualify as a transferee under and and granted usac motion for summary judgment.
the committee appealed to the ninth circuit bankruptcy appellate panel bap.the bap reversed the bankruptcy court grant of summary judgment in favor of usac,holding that usac was a transferee under a because it was the actual recipient of the transfer.see comm.universal serv.admin.in re incomnet commc ns,cir.the bap held that the dominion or control test did not apply because it was adopted to distinguish financial intermediaries from true recipients,and that the usac transaction could not be a conduit transfer because it did not involve a transaction.see id.at.usac filed this appeal.

iii.analysis 
statutory framework and the dominion test 
the trustee of a bankrupt debtor estate can seek to avoid and recover preferential transfers pursuant to and.section reads,in relevant part 
b except as provided in subsections c and i of this section,the trustee may avoid any transfer of an interest of the debtor in property 
to or for the benefit of a creditor 
for or on account of an antecedent debt owed by the debtor before such transfer was made 
made while the debtor was insolvent 
a on or within days before the date of the filing of the petition and 
that enables such creditor to receive more than such creditor would receive if 
a the case were a case under chapter of this title 
b the transfer had not been made and 
c such creditor received payment of such debt to the extent provided by the provisions of this title.
b supp.the trustee,in this case the committee,has the burden of proving the avoidability of the transfer under b,id.g,but is aided by a presumption that the debtor is insolvent during the ninety days preceding the filing of the chapter petition,id.f.subsections c and i,which create exceptions to the provisions of b,have not yet been considered by the bankruptcy court and thus are not before us on appeal 
when,pursuant to,a trustee avoids a transfer within ninety days of the debtor filing chapter,a provides for recovery from the transferee 
t o the extent that a transfer is avoided under section,the trustee may recover,for the benefit of the estate,the property transferred,or,if the court so orders,the value of such property,from 
the initial transferee of such transfer or the entity for whose benefit such transfer was made or 
any immediate or mediate transferee of such initial transferee.
a.under a,t he trustee right to recover from an initial transferee is absolute.schafer las vegas hilton in re video depot,cir in re bullion reserve,at.because the bankruptcy court ruled that usac was not a transferee,it did not decide whether all of the elements of b had been met in this case or whether usac has a valid defense to avoidance under any other statutory provision.thus,the issue before us is a narrow one whether usac is an initial transferee 
section a does not define the phrase initial transferee.in the absence of a clear statutory definition,two standards to determine whether a party is an initial transferee have emerged the dominion test and the control test.while the words dominion and control are synonyms when used in their lay sense,the dominion test and the control test,as originally stated,are not merely different names for the same inquiry.as we discuss below,the two tests do differ,and the fact that the dominion test is sometimes stated as an inquiry into who had legal control over funds does not mean that the two standards are indistinguishable.while we have not always been careful with our terms,we have applied the dominion test several times,but have declined to adopt the control test.see,abele modern fin.plans,in re cohen,cir contrary to the bap,the district court,and appellee contentions,we have not explicitly adopted the control test in this case we again rely exclusively upon the dominion test emphasis added internal citations omitted in re bullion reserve,at discussing both the dominion test and the control test but ultimately selecting and relying exclusively on the dominion test.although the resolution of this case does not turn on the question of which of these two standards governs in this circuit,we address this question at some length in an effort to clarify a somewhat murky area of our jurisprudence 
under the dominion test,a transferee is one who has dominion over the money or other asset,the right to put the money to one own purposes.in re cohen,at citing bonded fin.servs.european am.bank,cir see also in re video depot,at in re bullion reserve,at.the inquiry focuses on whether an entity had legal authority over the money and the right to use the money however it wished.see in re cohen,at bonded fin,at.
the leading case in this area is the seventh circuit decision in bonded financial services.in bonded financial services,a debtor sent a bank a check payable to the bank order with a note directing the bank to deposit the check into an account that belonged to michael ryan,the person who controlled the debtor.id.at.the bank deposited the check in ryan account,and ryan subsequently requested that the bank debit his account in the amount received in order to reduce the outstanding balance on a loan he owed to the bank.id.the debtor later declared bankruptcy,and the trustee of his bankruptcy estate sought to avoid the transfer.id.he argued that because the bank was the payee of the check,it was the initial transferee under a.id.the seventh circuit held that the bank was not an initial transferee because it received no benefit from the initial transaction,in which it acted as a financial intermediary without dominion over the money.when a gives a check to b as agent for c,then c is the initial transferee the agent may be disregarded.id.at only after a second and separate transaction,where ryan instructed the bank to debit his account in the amount of the transfer from the debtor,did the bank have dominion over the money.id.at.the dominion test stressed the ability of the recipient to use the money as it saw fit.
the eleventh circuit took a slightly different approach when it laid out the control test,under which courts view the entire transaction as a whole to determine who truly had control of the money.see nordberg societe generale in re chase sanborn,cir.in that case,the trustee sought to avoid a fraudulent transfer made to a bank to cover an overdrafted account.see id.at.the eleventh circuit stated that t he control test simply requires courts to step back and evaluate a transaction in its entirety to make sure that their conclusions are logical and equitable.id.at.the court concluded that the bank transaction did not fall within the scope of avoidable transfers because it acted as a conduit.id.at.the control test was born out of the statement that the outcome of the cases turn on whether the banks actually controlled the funds or merely served as conduits,holding money that was in fact controlled by either the transferor or the real transferee.id.at.
a number of circuits combined these at least combined their a dominion and control test to determine whether a party is an initial transferee.see,bailey big sky motors,in re ogden,cir applying the dominion and control test of bonded financial services,while also citing to in re chase sanborn christy alexander alexander of in re finley,kumble,wagner,heine,underberg,manley,myerson casey,cir stating that in in re chase sanborn,the eleventh circuit had adopted the logic of the seventh circuit in bonded financial services,and join ing these other circuits in adopting the mere conduit test bowers atlanta motor speedway,in re se.hotel props,cir w e explicitly adopt the dominion and control test as set forth in bonded financial services.we hold further that this test requires that in order to constitute the initial transferee of property under a of the bankruptcy code,a person or entity must have exercised legal dominion and control over the property.sec.first bank brunson in re coutee,cir relying on both bonded financial services and in re chase sanborn in adopting the dominion or control test first bank of barnesville rafoth in re baker getty fin,cir quoting a party characterization of bonded financial services as establishing a dominion or control test and applying same.
thus,we see that while the two inquiries are similar,they are not indistinguishable the dominion test focuses on whether the recipient of funds has legal title to them and the ability to use them as he sees fit.see bonded fin,at.the control test takes a more gestalt view of the entire transaction to determine who,in reality,controlled the funds in question.in re chase sanborn,at.since we have explicitly adopted the more restrictive dominion test,set out in bonded financial services,in re cohen,at,we take care not to apply the more lenient control test put forth in in re chase sanborn.
application of the dominion test to usac 
we next consider usac and the fcc legally prescribed roles in the administration of the usf.while we recognize that the fcc does hold substantial power over the fund indirectly,essentially by overseeing usac,we also recognize that it has no ability to control the usf through direct seizure or discretionary spending.we hold that usac,which,as administrator of the usf,has discretion over if,when,and how it disburses universal service funds to beneficiaries,holds dominion over the usf.accordingly,we hold that usac is the initial transferee and affirm the judgment of the bap.
usac has a board of directors board and a chief executive officer.both telecommunications carriers and usf beneficiaries submit nominations for the board to the chairman of the fcc,who selects usac directors.c.the board nominates usac chief executive officer by consensus,but he must be approved by the chairman of the fcc.id.b.fcc regulations establish board committees that oversee usac distribution of the usf to various categories of beneficiaries.id.
the fcc has responsibility for implementing and regulating the collection and distribution of the usf.see.office of pub.util.counsel fcc,cir see also a in re lan tamers,at.the fcc specifies eligibility requirements for universal service support funds and establishes policy.see,listing supported services for rural,insular,and areas id.generally defining eligible telecommunications carriers id.listing additional eligibility requirements for telecommunications carriers see also id.c requiring usac to seek guidance from the fcc when the telecommunications act or rules that it must follow are unclear.the fcc must approve usac total projected expenses and budget on a quarterly basis.id.a.
usac is prohibited from mak ing policy,interpret ing unclear provisions of the statute or rules,or interpret ing the intent of congress.id.c.where the provisions of the telecommunications act or the fcc rules are unclear,or do not address a particular situation,usac must seek guidance from the fcc.id.the fcc retains the authority to overrule usac actions in administering the universal service support funds those who are aggrieved by usac,its committees,or its board may seek review from the fcc.id.c.
telecommunications carriers contributions to usac are based both on the telecommunications revenues they report to the fcc and on a contribution factor that the fcc determines quarterly.id.a.usac calculates the payment due from each individual carrier by multiplying that carrier revenues by the quarterly contribution factor.see id.a.if a carrier fails to make timely payments,usac generates an invoice for the amount of the required contribution and sends it to the carrier.id.
usac takes legal title to the contributions it receives from carriers and deposits them into the usf,then disburses funds to subsidize the provision of service to libraries,schools,rural areas,and areas.usac requires potential beneficiaries to fill out the correct forms,meet deadlines,and receive proper certification usac is prohibited from subsidizing entities that are not certified or that do not meet specific criteria.id,support certification and criteria id.eligibility requirements for schools and libraries id.eligibility requirements for rural health care providers.fcc regulations require usac to file an annual report with the fcc and congress that includes information on operations,activities,participation,administrative costs,and payments.id.g.usac is also required to consult with fcc staff regarding the scope and content of its annual report.id.
citing the restrictions under which it operates and its concomitant limited discretion,usac contends that it was a mere conduit for the contributions it received from incomnet.it then points to our statement in in re bullion reserve that it would be inequitable to allow recovery against an entity merely because it had technically received the funds,if the entity had never actually controlled the funds.at omissions in original quoting in re chase sanborn,at.usac argues that because it merely possessed the funds in accordance with federal law,serving as a conduit to telecommunications carriers that provide service to beneficiaries,it is not an initial transferee.it maintains that it did not acquire dominion over the money or the right to put the money to its own purposes,and was not free to invest the whole amount in lottery tickets or uranium stocks.bonded fin,at.usac claims that its status as a mere conduit renders incomnet universal service support payments unavoidable therefore,the committee is not entitled to reimbursement.
the committee argues that since usac holds legal title to the funds and deposits the usf into its own bank accounts,it satisfies the plain meaning of transferee and the committee has carried its burden the committee argues that usac can not be a conduit when its administrator has the right to use the money collected to accomplish the purposes of the fund.the committee also asserts that even though usac is subject to federal regulations that dictate how the usf is to be disbursed,these regulations do not make usac a mere conduit entitled to avoid transferee liability.
we agree with the bap that usac is a transferee for purposes of and.usac is neither an agent nor a mere conduit for some other party indeed,three months after incomnet filed for chapter protection,usac filed its own proof of claim as a creditor for more than in additional universal service obligations owed under the telecommunications act as usac conceded before the bankruptcy court,it holds legal title to the funds in the usf accounts.
the dominion test we have crafted strongly correlates with legal title.in in re cohen,we described d ominion as akin to legal control,the right to invest the funds as one chooses and distinguished this from mere possession.in re cohen,at.in the vast majority of cases,possessing legal title to funds will equate to having dominion over them the focus on dominion is useful for those unusual situations in which legal title to funds and the right to put those funds to use have been separated.there are two primary cases when this may occur when an entity has legal title as a formal matter,but legally does not have any discretion in the application of funds and when an entity does not possess legal title,but nevertheless has sufficient authority over the funds to direct their disbursement.
to illustrate the first case,consider a bank that receives currency from a depositor with instructions to deposit those funds into the account of a third party.in such a case,the bank will initially take title over the depositor funds,but it will not have dominion over them because it has no discretion over the uses to which the depositor money is to be put.thus,the bank is not the transferee,but the conduit or agent for a general deposit 
the second scenario,where an entity lacks legal title to funds,but nevertheless has power over them,may be illustrated by a trustee who is able to direct the disbursement of the funds in a trust account he manages,even though he does not own them.such a trustee would therefore exercise dominion over the funds without holding title to them.see kupetz united states in re cal.trade technical,cir t reating a transfer to the department of education doe trust fund as equivalent to a transfer to doe is entirely consistent with the seventh circuit decision in bonded financial services id.our treatment of the transfer to the trust as a transfer to or for the benefit of doe under section b renders doe an initial transferee,or an entity for whose benefit the initial transfer was made under section a.
usac is the designated administrator of the usf,a.while the fcc has substantial authority to determine usac budget and approve its disbursements,see id.a,usac is not simply holding funds in the usf as the fcc agent.the fcc only exercises power over the fund indirectly,essentially by overseeing usac it has no ability to control the funds in the usf through direct seizure or discretionary spending.see id.c usac shall submit to the fcc projected quarterly budgets at least sixty days prior to the start of every quarter.the fcc must approve the projected quarterly budgets before usac disburses funds under the federal universal service support mechanisms.richardson fdic in re blackburn mitchell,the fdic obtained full dominion and control over the funds with the right to put the money to its own purposes it was not holding those funds in trust,or as agent,for any other party.id.at the fdic had full use of those funds for its own account.
nor is usac a mere conduit of universal support funds to the carriers who provide telecommunications services to the beneficiaries of the telecommunications act.although usac is obligated by law to spend those funds for designated,highly regulated purposes,usac is neither the agent of,nor a trustee for,carrier recipients.usac is charged with establishing a budget that meets the purpose of the statute,but neither the specific recipients nor the specific beneficiaries are named in that statute.see specifying requirements carriers must meet to be eligible to receive usf disbursements id,specifying eligibility requirements for usf beneficiaries.
similarly,usac has not established that there is any binding legal relationship between it and any of the usf beneficiaries.the statute establishing the universal service support contributions and the regulations implementing the statute do not name specific
