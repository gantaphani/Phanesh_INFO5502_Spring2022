appellant,kaiser group international international,appeals from the district court decision granting international finance company ifc motion to dismiss international third amended complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.in doing so,the district court reversed the bankruptcy court to the extent that the bankruptcy decision concluded that international claims were within the scope of the waiver of sovereign immunity by ifc pursuant to b.
on appeal,international argues that its claims fall within the scope of ifc waiver of sovereign immunity,thereby conferring subject matter jurisdiction on the bankruptcy court.it contends that its claims are both property of the estate and arise out of the same transaction or occurrence as the proof of claim filed by ifc in international bankruptcy proceeding and that,therefore,the claims asserted by international in the third amended complaint are viable and should be considered on the merits.we agree.
accordingly,we will reverse the judgment of the district court,remand to the district court,and direct that the district court remand this case to the bankruptcy court so that there may be a ruling on the merits of international third amended complaint.
the district court had jurisdiction over this case as an appeal from the determination of the bankruptcy court under a.we have jurisdiction under d and.
the district court dismissed the instant action upon ifc federal rule of civil procedure b motion for lack of subject matter jurisdiction predicated on sovereign immunity.we exercise plenary review over the district court dismissal under rule b.in re cybergenics,cir.when reviewing a facial challenge to this court subject matter jurisdiction,we accept all allegations in the complaint as true and view them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.see turicentro,am.airlines,cir.
as we indicated above,because the present appeal is before us on the district court order granting ifc b motion to dismiss,we must accept the allegations of the third amended complaint as true and view them in the light most favorable to international.consequently,the following factual summary is drawn from the facts as alleged in the third amended complaint.
on july,kaiser engineers engineers a debtor subsidiary of international,entered into a letter of intent with nova hut,a czech steel manufacturer nova hut,pursuant to which international agreed to provide certain advisory services to nova hut in connection with the construction of a continuous caster and reversing rolling mill,also known as a minimill,to be located in the czech republic.nova hut agreed to pay a fee of million for those services.in order to assist nova hut funding the project,international eventually agreed to defer of that fee.according to international,that fee was never paid.
on november,international,kaiser netherlands,netherlands,a,subsidiary of international,and nova hut,entered into a memorandum of understanding for the construction of the minimill which set the total purchase price for phase of the project at million.
on june,netherlands and nova hut entered into a contract for construction of phase of the minimill the construction agreement pursuant to which netherlands agreed to design and supply nova hut existing steel mill with a fully constructed,operational phase of the for flat rolled products.it is undisputed that international was not a party to the construction agreement.in order to finance its obligations under the construction agreement,nova hut obtained a secured loan from ifc in the amount of million.
to secure netherlands timely and proper design,manufacture,and construction of the,the construction agreement required netherlands to submit a performance letter of credit in the amount of million the letter of credit.the construction agreement provided that nova hut could draw down against the letter of credit if netherlands breached the contract or failed to renew the letter of credit as required.first union bank issued the letter of credit on july,as amended on september.
it is also undisputed that netherlands,not international,is listed as the customer on the letter of credit.at the same time,according to the third amended complaint,first union bank required international to post collateral as security for the letter of credit.to meet this requirement,international deposited million in cash with first union bank.
to further ensure netherlands performance under the construction agreement,international executed a written guaranty of the performance of kaiser netherlands pursuant to the agreement between nova hut and netherlands the performance guaranty.this performance guaranty provided that if netherlands failed to prove that the passed the requisite performance tests,and if netherlands was unable to correct that deficiency or pay nova hut what it owed,then nova hut would have the right to seek liquidated damages from international.
on november,nova hut granted ifc a security interest in the construction agreement and performance guaranty.nova hut conditionally assigned its rights under the construction contract,but not its obligations,to ifc.netherlands and international acknowledged and consented to this conditional assignment.
thereafter,netherlands commenced construction of the minimill.the construction agreement required netherlands to pass a four week integrated production performance test the performance test in connection with the minimill construction.the four week performance test was run from october,through november.after completing the test,nova hut informed netherlands that it had failed to prove that the performed as required by the construction agreement.thus,nova hut notified netherlands that it was in default.international,however,claims that netherlands passed that test and met all of its other contractual obligations under the construction agreement.
in january,a dispute arose over the letter of credit,which was set to expire on march.international agreed to extend the letter of credit in return for nova hut and ifc representations that they would not draw on the letter of credit if it was extended until july.despite these representations,on february,nova hut drew down on the million letter of credit and terminated the construction agreement allegedly at the direction of ifc.that draw down,which international alleges was improper and in breach of the construction agreement and the additional agreements that it had with nova hut and ifc,forms the basis of the present litigation.
on june,international and certain subsidiaries filed a petition under chapter of the bankruptcy code.on august,ifc filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy case seeking recovery from international based on an assignment ifc had received from nova hut.it alleged claims in connection with the performance guaranty,the letter of credit and the construction agreement and sought damages in excess of million.ifc further alleged that it was entitled to recover the million from international because it had the right to step into the shoes of nova hut and enforce the terms and provisions of the construction contract and the performance guaranty pursuant to the assignment.
at the same time,ifc stated that it was filing the proof of claim under the compulsion of the bar date and that the filing was not a consent by ifc to the jurisdiction of the court with respect to the subject matter of those claims.
on april,after nova hut drew down on the letter of credit,international filed an amended objection to nova hut and ifc proofs of claim and filed claims against ifc and nova hut in response,on june,ifc filed a motion for leave to withdraw its proof of claim.
in an order dated january,the bankruptcy court granted ifc motion,but only on the conditions that the bankruptcy court would retain jurisdiction over international claims and that ifc was barred from asserting other claims against the debtors.
on october,international filed its third amended complaint.
the third amended complaint alleges that at the time nova hut drew on the letter of credit,netherlands had passed the performance test,had met all of the requirements for final acceptance of the minimill project,and was in compliance with the requirements of the construction amendment.thus,the third amended complaint alleges that the draw down on the letter of credit was wrongful and resulted in international sustaining damages of over million in loss of collateral.international further charges that nova hut improperly drew down on the letter of credit at the direction of ifc.
as against ifc,international asserted both contract and equitable claims.these claims can be summarized as follows 
first,nova hut and ifc are liable for breach of warranty for allegedly false representations and warranties made by nova hut at the direction of ifc in connection with the draw on the letter of credit.
second,nova hut and ifc are liable for breach of contract in connection with agreements they had with international concerning the letter of credit whereby international agreed to establish the letter of credit on behalf of netherlands and nova hut agreed not to draw on the letter of credit if international extended the letter of credit prior to its expiration.
third,as an alternative to its breach of contract claims,nova hut and ifc are liable to international under a theory of unjust enrichment for improperly drawing on the letter of credit,failing to pay in deferred payments allegedly owed to engineers for financial and engineering services it provided pursuant to the letter of intent,and failing to pay million allegedly owed to international for engineering and construction goods and services it provided pursuant to the memorandum of understanding.
fourth,as an alternative to its breach of contract and unjust enrichment claims,nova hut and ifc are liable to international under a theory of quantum meruit.
fifth,in the event a contract existed between nova hut and international or engineers,ifc is liable for tortious interference with contract.
sixth,in the event no enforceable contract existed,ifc is liable for tortious interference with business relations and prospective economic advantage.
in response,ifc filed a motion to dismiss the third amended complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,claiming sovereign immunity under of the bankruptcy code.ifc argued that it was immune under the international organizations immunity act that ifc could not waive its immunity under b because it was not a governmental unit or a sovereign and that even if it could waive its immunity,it had not done so by filing the proof of claim.
the bankruptcy court ruled that ifc is a governmental unit under b and that its filing of the proof of claim was an express waiver of its immunity.consequently,in an order dated december,the bankruptcy court denied ifc motion to dismiss.
on appeal to the district court of delaware,in addition to the arguments it raised before the bankruptcy court,ifc asserted for the first time that even if it had waived its immunity,the claims set forth in the third amended complaint were outside the scope of its waiver pursuant to b.in an order dated september,the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court decision that ifc constituted a governmental unit for purposes of b of the bankruptcy code and that ifc had expressly waived its immunity by filing the proof of claim in international bankruptcy proceeding.the district court,after reviewing supplemental briefs which it had ordered,reversed the bankruptcy court decision and held that international claims were outside the scope of ifc waiver of sovereign immunity under b,and thus ifc prevailed.
with respect to international breach of contract claims in connection with the letter of credit,the district court found that those claims were not property of the estate.specifically,it held that because neither a letter of credit nor its proceeds are property of the estate under bankruptcy law,any recourse international might have,would be limited to the underlying construction agreement.such a cause of action could not be property of the estate because international was not a party to that contract.
as for international equitable claims,the district court found that even assuming they were property of the estate,they were not within the scope of ifc waiver,because they did not arise from the same transaction or occurrence as ifc proof of claim.it so held because international claims were predicated on events that occurred subsequent to international filing of its objections to the proof of claim and thus had not matured within the period of time prescribed by.a.the district court concluded,therefore,that those claims did not meet the compulsory counterclaim test under.a and were therefore outside the scope of ifc waiver.
by order dated february,the district court dismissed international third amended complaint with prejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.this timely appeal followed.
as an initial matter,international asserts that ifc has waived the issues of whether its claims were property of the estate and whether the claims arose out of the same transaction or occurrence,and therefore,can not raise these issues on appeal.international relies on the general rule that when a party fails to raise an issue in the bankruptcy court,the issue is waived and may not be considered by the district court on appeal.see buncher official comm.of unsecured creditors of genfarm lp iv,cir.although the general rule of buncher is correct,international fails to note the exception for subject matter jurisdiction,which is applicable to this case.
it is law that subject matter jurisdiction can be challenged at any point before final judgment,even if challenged for the first time on appeal.see grupo dataflux atlas global group,d.we have consistently held that the defense of lack of subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time.see,brown philadelphia hous,cir citing sansom comm.lynn,cir defense that district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to enforce consent decree may be raised for the first time on appeal.
specifically,we have stated that courts of appeals must consider whether sovereign immunity was waived under b even though neither presented or considered below because a waiver of sovereign immunity is a prerequisite for jurisdiction.in re.med,cir citation omitted.we therefore reject international waiver argument.
sets forth the conditions under which an entity will be deemed to have waived its sovereign immunity in the bankruptcy courts.section b provides that 
a governmental unit that has filed a proof of claim in the case is deemed to have waived sovereign immunity with respect to a claim against such governmental unit that is property of the estate and that arose out of the same transaction or occurrence out of which the claim of such governmental unit arose.
id.thus,by its terms,b limits the scope of a waiver predicated on the filing of a proof of claim to those adversarial claims that are both property of the estate and arise out of the same transaction or occurrence as the claims set forth in the proof of claim.
as we observed earlier,the district court found that international breach of contract claims concerning the letter of credit were not property of the estate.it based this conclusion on the rule of bankruptcy law that a letter of credit and the proceeds therefrom are not property of the debtor estate.matter of compton,cir citations omitted see also in re hechinger inv.of.instead,a debtor seeking to remedy an improper draw on a letter of credit is limited to a cause of action on the underlying contract.see in re graham square,cir.because the district court found that international was not a party to the construction agreement upon which the letter of credit was based,it found that international claim for million predicated on nova hut improper draw down was not property of the international estate and could not be recovered by international.
on appeal,international argues that the general rule of letter of credit jurisprudence relied upon by the district court is not applicable in this case.in the typical case,a debtor either seeks to enjoin a bank distribution of the proceeds of a letter of credit or to recover the bank distribution as a voidable preference or unauthori
