at an auction sanctioned by the bankruptcy court,corporate assets,cai submitted the high bid for assets belonging to the debtors,but its apparent victory proved.a higher,upset bid tendered to the debtors after the close of the auction convinced the debtors,with the bankruptcy court approval,to reopen the bidding.cai won the second auction with a bid higher than its original bid.cai appealed the bankruptcy court decisions to reopen the bidding and to confirm the sale to cai at the higher price established by the second auction.the district court affirmed.in re ggsi liquidation.cai has now appealed to this court,contending that the bankruptcy court abused its discretion in allowing a second auction and in refusing to confirm the results of the first auction.we also affirm.
on september,debtors goss holdings,and goss graphic systems,collectively,goss filed voluntary chapter bankruptcy petitions later consolidated with the bankruptcy court.shortly thereafter,the debtors sought approval from the court to sell by auction certain personal property including newspaper printing press manufacturing equipment,furniture,and fixtures located at goss manufacturing facility in cedar rapids,iowa the cedar rapids assets or the assets.
on december,the bankruptcy court entered an order approving specific bidding procedures for the auction and sale of the cedar rapids assets.tab ex.pursuant to these rules,each interested party was to submit a written bid to goss in advance of the auction along with an executed copy of an asset purchase agreement that goss had prepared,financial data demonstrating that it had the financial ability to consummate the asset purchase,and a deposit.id.ex.a at.goss was in turn empowered to review these submissions and determine whether each bidder was qualified in the sense of having submitted the requisite materials and having demonstrated its bona fides and ability to make good on its offer.id.ex.a at.goss was then to conduct an auction among qualified bidders on january,at which time those bidders would have the opportunity to increase the amounts of their bids.id.ex.a at.upon conclusion of the auction,goss,in consultation with its pre and lenders and the committee of its unsecured creditors,was to ascertain the highest and best offer and present that bid to the bankruptcy court for approval at a sale hearing scheduled for january.id.ex.a at.however,goss recommendation that the court approve a particular offer was not to be taken as an acceptance of that offer only the court approval of an offer was to be so construed.id.ex.a at.a modifications provision included in the approved procedures also gave goss substantial discretion to reject any bid to impose additional conditions and terms on the sale of its property prior to the sale hearing

included in the draft purchase agreement that bidders were to execute in advance of the auction was a term concerning the removal of the cedar rapids assets from goss property.tab ex.at.that provision required the purchaser to remove the bulk of the assets from the property on or before june.id.however,noting that goss was attempting to sell the property,the agreement reserved to goss the right to require removal of the assets prior to june in the event that the property was sold.id.a number of interested bidders expressed concern to goss about that reservation,and some submitted written bids conditioned on deletion of that language from the purchase agreement.tab at.
after becoming aware of the concerns that prospective bidders had about the provision,goss decided that it would delete that provision from the asset purchase agreement.by this time goss had,in fact,contracted to sell the cedar rapids facility to a third party.goss arranged to sublease the property from the new owner until june at a cost of,so that the eventual purchaser of the cedar rapids assets would not be forced to remove them from the property before that date.tab at.in the week prior to the auction,goss advised some,but not all,of the bidders on the assets that the purchase was no longer subject to the term see tab at,tab at the rest were informed of the change at the time of the auction see tab at.goss would later advise the bankruptcy court that once it informed some of the prospective bidders that the cedar rapids assets would not have to be removed prior to june,the bid amounts on the assets jumped from a high of approximately million to million.tab at.
the auction proceeded as scheduled on monday,january.after the amounts of the written bids that goss had received were announced at the start of the auction,qualified bidders were given the opportunity to increase their bids.before opening the floor to further bids,however,goss attorney solicited questions from the bidders.one of the bidders asked,will this be final today,or will someone be able to go to the court date three days from now and up our bid tab at.goss attorney responded as follows 
well,the court order provides that today is the day for the auction,and when we close the auction it will be final.i can not obviously state that someone ca walk into court on wednesday the day scheduled for the sale hearing and offer million dollars for the stuff and have the court say that it not going to accept their bid but under the procedures,today is the day for the auction.
the debtors anticipate that when they close the auction today,they will take the lead bidder who has provided all of the necessary information and deposits to be a qualified bidder and will present that to the court to approve.
so i guess i ca give you percent assurances that someone ca walk into court on wednesday and try to outbid whoever wins today,but i think that is a very slim possibility.
of the written bids that had been submitted to goss in advance of the auction,cai was the highest,in the amount of million.when the bidding was reopened at the auction,none of the other bidders topped that bid.several did increase their bids,but only in an apparent effort to secure second place behind cai high bid.myron bolling auctioneers mba ultimately secured the slot,with a bid of million.at the close of bidding,goss counsel indicated that the final bids of the four qualified bidders would be submitted to the bankruptcy court at the sale hearing scheduled for january and that goss would expect to close on the sale on the following day.id.at.goss attorney also advised the bidders that if any of them wished to object to the sale process,they must file their objections no later than on the day prior to the sale hearing.id.at.the auction was then declared closed.id.at.
the next day,january,mba representative,myron bolling bolling contacted goss and indicated that mba wished to increase its bid to million,an amount or just under nine percent greater than cai high bid.mba had not known prior to the auction that goss had decided to remove from the purchase agreement the language permitting goss to require removal of the cedar rapids assets prior to june.see tab at,see also tab at after goss counsel announces removal of that sale condition,bolling asks him to clarify when assets would have to be removed.evidently,during the auction,bolling and another mba representative were able to communicate this information to some,but not all,of the members of the mba bidding group who were not present at the auction.tab at tab at.following the auction,when everyone in the mba group became aware of the change,they decided to increase mba bid.
presented with the higher offer from mba,goss,with the concurrence of its lenders and the committee of unsecured creditors,decided that it would ask the bankruptcy court to continue the sale hearing scheduled for january so that it could conduct a second auction.the bankruptcy court granted the request and rescheduled the hearing for january,reserving judgment as to whether it would accept the results of the second auction or instead confirm the sale to cai based on its winning bid at the first auction.tab at.goss then set january,as the date of the second auction and notified the bidders.
cai participated in the second auction,subject to a full reservation of its legal rights,and subsequently won with a final bid of million,an amount approximately percent higher than its previous bid.at the sale hearing on january,the debtors requested that the bankruptcy court confirm the results of the second auction and declare cai the winner based on its high bid at that auction.cai objected,arguing that the results of the first auction should be confirmed with cai as the winning bidder at a price of million.cai also submitted an administrative expense claim seeking compensation for the costs it had incurred as a result of the second auction.see b a.
the bankruptcy court carol doyle granted goss request to confirm the results of the second auction and denied cai request for expenses.tabs.the court was mindful of the need to preserve the integrity and finality of the auction process and to recognize the reasonable expectations of the parties who participated in the first auction.tab at.on the other hand,the court also had to consider the governing principle in confirming a sale,which is to secure the highest price for the benefit of the estate and creditors.id.citing in re chung king,cir.accepting cai winning bid at the second auction was in the best interests of the bid was more than higher than cai bid at the first auction.id.at.and after weighing the circumstances,the court was satisfied that confirming the results of the second auction was contrary neither to the reasonable expectations of the bidders nor the integrity and finality of the auction process.id.the modifications provision of the bidding procedures had given goss the authority to reject a bid not in the best interests of the estate at any time before the court entered an order approving a qualified bid it had also empowered goss to impose additional conditions in the interests of the estate prior to or at the sale hearing.in the court view,goss decision to reject cai high bid at the first auction and to reopen the auction to further bidding would fit within that very,very broad language.id.at.cai had been aware of the bidding procedures,including the modifications provision,and so to the extent cai expected that its high bid at the first auction necessarily would be approved,its expectation was unreasonable.id.at.likewise,because the bidding procedures granted goss the authority to reject any bid until such time as the court had entered a sale order,the decision to reopen the auction did not undermine the interests in finality and integrity of the auction process.id.at.moreover,in the court view,the second auction provided a more level playing field than the first had done.id.at.prior to the first auction,some but not all bidders had been made aware of goss decision to remove the language that might have required removal of the cedar rapids assets prior to june.mba did not learn of the change until the day of the auction and was not able to inform all of the members of its bidding group until after the auction had concluded.id.at.for these reasons,the court concluded that it was appropriate to confirm cai winning bid at the second auction rather than the first.id.at.because the court had overruled cai objection to the second auction,the court found no ground on which to compensate cai for the fees it had incurred in pursuing that objection or for the difference between its first and second bids.id.
cai appealed the bankruptcy court decision to the district court.soon after that appeal was filed,the proceedings in the bankruptcy court were converted from chapter to chapter proceedings.
the district court elaine bucklo affirmed the bankruptcy court decision.in re ggsi liquidation.the district court recognized that when a bankruptcy court is asked to confirm the results of an auction,it is faced with two competing interests the integrity and finality of public auctions and the best interests of the bankruptcy estate creditors.id.at citing in re food barn stores,cir.the former interest is satisfied if a court acts in a manner consistent with the rules by which the auction has been conducted and in compliance with the reasonable expectations of the bidders.id.at quoting food barn,at.although in this case the bidding procedures approved by the bankruptcy court contemplated one auction rather than two,the modifications provision authorized goss to reject any bid not in the best interests of the estate and its creditors,to review the bids in light of those interests before making a recommendation to the bankruptcy court,and to impose other terms and conditions on the sale at any time up to and during the sale hearing.at the same time,the approved procedures did not specify any beyond which goss could no longer accept bids.the bankruptcy court therefore had correctly concluded that goss acted within the rules when it reopened the bidding.id.goss had not departed from the bidders reasonable expectations in taking this step.id.at.all of the bidders had received a copy of the approved procedures prior to the auction,and although goss counsel had informed bidders that the results of the first auction were likely to be final,he had also told them that he could not give them percent assurances on that score.thus,cai expectations that its high bid at the first auction would be accepted were not adequately solidified so as to demand a showing of fraud or gross inadequacy before the bidding could be reopened.id.at quoting food barn,at.the court agreed with the bankruptcy court that the second auction was in the best interests of the estate and goss creditors.id.the approximately percent differential between cai high bids at the first and second auctions,although perhaps insufficient to demonstrate gross inadequacy in the original bid see chung king,at,was nonetheless a significant boon to the estate.id.the bankruptcy court thus was within its discretion to conclude that the benefit to the estate in the second auction outweighed the bidders expectations as to the results of the first auction and the interest in the finality and integrity of public auctions.id.finally,because goss position with respect to the validity of the second auction was not frivolous and because the bankruptcy court had properly accepted the results of the second auction,the district court concluded that fundamental fairness did not require cai to be compensated for the legal fees it incurred in opposing the second auction or for the greater price it had to pay for the cedar rapids assets as a result of the second auction.id.quoting in re.it therefore sustained the denial of cai administrative expense claim.id.
in reviewing the district court decision to affirm the bankruptcy court,we employ the same standard of review that the district court itself used,frierdich mottaz,cir.the bankruptcy court confirmation or refusal to confirm an asset sale will only be overturned in extreme cases,when the bankruptcy court has abused its discretion.in re chung king,cir.generally speaking,a court abuses its discretion when its decision is premised on an incorrect legal principle or a clearly erroneous factual finding,or when the record contains no evidence on which the court rationally could have relied.see united states jain,cir salgado by salgado general motors,cir.
as the lower courts recognized,two principal interests come to the fore when a bankruptcy court is asked to confirm the results of a judicial sale.the governing principle at a confirmation proceeding is the securing of the highest price for the bankruptcy estate.chung king,at.a central purpose of bankruptcy,after all,is to maximize creditor recovery,precision,qualitech steel sbq,llc,cir.but there is also an interest in the finality and integrity of the process by which bids are accepted and approved.if parties are to be encouraged to bid at judicial sales,there must be stability in such sales and a time must come when a fair bid is accepted and the proceedings are ended.chung king,at quoting in re webcor,cir see also shlensky weissberg,cir.a tension arises between these two interests where,as here,someone makes a higher,upset bid after the auction has concluded and bidding has formally closed.accepting a late bid may mean more money for creditors in the short run,but by upsetting the expectations of those who thought the bidding was at an end,it may in the long term undermine confidence in judicial sales and discourage prospective purchasers from making their best offers in a timely manner.see chung king,at.r efusing to confirm a sale to a high bidder merely because an intervening higher bid has been received is the surest way to destroy confidence in judicial sales and defeat the purpose sought to be accomplished thereby to realize the greatest amount from such sales to those entitled to receive the proceeds thereof.sugarman davis,cir.a bankruptcy judge confronted with this scenario thus faces the unenviable task of walk ing a tightrope between the competing interests.in re financial news network,cir see also in re food barn stores,cir.
the cases dealing with upset bids reflect a continuum,along which the bankruptcy court discretion to reopen the bidding in pursuit of estate maximization diminishes as the sale comes closer to becoming a fait accompli and as the expectations of the participants solidify.food barn,at.once a court has confirmed the sale of the debtor assets to the auction victor,for example,the public interest in finality is high and the parties reasonably expect that the bidding is over.id.at that juncture,only a narrow range of circumstances will support a court decision to vacate the sale order and reopen the bidding.the simple fact that a late bid offers the estate more money than the bid previously approved by the court will not suffice only if the belated bid reveals the initial sale price to be so grossly inadequate as to shock the conscience of the court,chung king,at,or if the original auction was tainted by fraud,mistake,or some comparable defect,webcor,at,will a court be justified in setting aside a confirmed sale.see also food barn,at in re irvin,cir.on other hand,where the sale ha s not progressed to a comparable plateau,the bankruptcy court enjoys broader discretion to decide whether to entertain a late bid,and its judgment in that regard commands commensurate deference from the reviewing court.food barn,at.for example,where the bidding for a debtor property is complex and fluid,financial news,at,or where it is informal and flexible,food barn,at,and where the court has not yet approved sale to a particular bidder,the court might appropriately conclude that consideration of a late bid would not unduly frustrate the reasonable expectations of the participants or compromise the integrity of the process.id.at financial news,at.in that setting,financial gain for the estate and its creditors might suffice as a basis for reopening the bidding without an additional showing that the initial bids were grossly inadequate or that the original bidding was tainted by fraud or some other irregularity.food barn,at.
in this case,the bankruptcy court had not yet confirmed the results of the first auction when it continued the sale hearing so that goss could conduct a second auction.our cases reflect the significance of the confirmation order the parties reasonable expectations and the interest in the finality and regularity of the sale process.we have repeatedly cited the entry of a sale order as the point at which the court loses much of the discretion it otherwise enjoys in deciding whether to confirm the results of the auction and at which it must be able to identify a compelling reason in order to recognize a late bid.irvin,at chung king,at webcor,at in re marathon foundry mach,cir.that is not to say that the bankruptcy court enjoys unbounded authority in any circumstance to accept additional bids so long as it has not yet entered a sale order,see food barn,at financial news,at,but it is to say that until that point,the court enjoys broader discretion to balance the goal of estate maximization against the interest in regularity and finality and the parties expectations.
cai contends that,notwithstanding the lack of a sale order,once the first auction had closed with it as the high bidder,it had every reason to think that the bidding was done and that the court approval was but a formality,so that it was an abuse of discretion for the bankruptcy court to allow goss to conduct a second auction based on mba upset bid.cai position is not entirely without support in the facts.the bidding procedures,and the court order approving those procedures,envisioned a single auction,as the bankruptcy and district courts both recognized.tab at ex.a at.when asked at the auction about the finality of the bidding,goss counsel informed the bidders that when we close the auction it will be final.tab at.counsel did go on to qualify that statement somewhat,noting that he could not entirely rule out the possibility that the court might entertain a dramatically higher upset bid at the sale hearing but he saw that as a very slim possibility.id.at.the auction proceeded in a straightforward matter,and it was clear from the moment when the written bids were disclosed at the start of the hearing until the bidding closed that cai was the high bid.at the close of the auction,neither goss counsel nor any other participant said anything suggesting that further bidding was anticipated.this was not,in the parlance of financial news,a complex and fluid bidding process that left the participants uncertain as to what could be expected next.at see also food barn,at.
in view of these circumstances,cai urges us to follow in re,cir,and hold that the bankruptcy court abused its discretion in permitting a second round of bidding.the bankruptcy court in had issued a notice inviting bids on the debtor property to be submitted in writing by a fixed date and time,with a sale hearing to follow several hours later.the appellant had submitted the high bid as of the specified deadline.however,when the parties appeared in court for the sale hearing,a second bidder sought leave to make a higher bid.the bankruptcy court allowed it to do so,and under protest,the appellant then made a new bid of its own to best its competitor.the court then confirmed the sale to the appellant on its final bid.on appeal,the first circuit vacated the sale order out of concern that the bankruptcy court decision to reopen the bidding was contrary to the reasonable expectations of the participants.the notice calling for bids on the property had specified a day and time as of which the bidding would close,and although the high bid as of that deadline was subject to the bankruptcy court approval,there was no suggestion that the appellant initial bid was inadequate,such that the bankruptcy court would have been entitled to reject it outright.see id.at.nor was there even a substantial disparity between that bid and the belated upset bid instead,the bankruptcy court had reopened the bidding simply because the upset bid was modestly greater than the appellant timely bid.id.the first circuit viewed this as an unfair and imprudent step,barring some established practice of entertaining late bids that would have placed the appellant on notice that its timely offer remained subject to further bidding at the confirmation hearing 
if there is no local custom to the contrary,we are in accord with the established rule that it is an abuse of discretion for a bankruptcy court to refuse to confirm an adequate bid received in a properly and fairly conducted sale merely because a slightly higher offer has been received after the bidding is cl
