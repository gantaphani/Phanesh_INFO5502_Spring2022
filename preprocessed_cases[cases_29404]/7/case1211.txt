only a belief that bankruptcy is forever could produce a case such as this.that sentiment,which opens the opinion in pettibone easley,cir,is equally applicable to this dispute.
aldo botti and his former client,mary anne zurn,have spent the last decade debating the quality of legal work botti provided to zurn during divorce litigation,and torts that zurn believes botti to have committed during the course of his representation.zurn suit in illinois was met by a request for sanctions botti also argued in a countersuit that zurn still owed money for legal fees.when the dust settled in the state trial court,botti emerged with a judgment of about.to avoid paying,zurn filed a federal bankruptcy proceeding.it soon became clear that the bankruptcy court would not allow zurn to retain the stakes without accruing interest during an appeal in state court,nor would the bankruptcy court take over the appellate function and decide the matter itself.after the bankruptcy court formally decided to abstain from any role in the ongoing state litigation,zurn filed a plan promising full payment to all creditors,including botti.she paid the sums he claimed as a creditor,her plan was approved,and the federal proceedings were dismissed in april.
meanwhile the litigation continued in illinois.in march the state appellate court reversed the judgments to the extent that they had required zurn to pay botti.with respect to zurn claims against botti,the appellate court decided three in botti favor but held that zurn claim for battery had been dismissed improperly.at this point botti should have returned the money zurn had paid to satisfy the judgments.buzz barton associates,giannone.see also richardson penfold,cir palmer chicago,cir.yet he did not do so,though it is hard to see how he could be entitled to keep the money after the reversal.the appellate decision left each side with unresolved legal claims against the other,but neither took timely steps to resume the litigation in the trial court.illinois requires a litigant that wants to continue the proceedings after an appeal to act within a reasonable period after the appellate mandate which issued in november.see.c illinois eidel.botti has never attempted to reinstate his suit seeking legal fees.apparently botti believes that,because he holds the money paid under the reversed judgment,it is no longer necessary to establish a legal entitlement to these funds.
for her part,zurn allowed months to pass and then moved to reopen,not the state litigation,but the bankruptcy proceeding.she asked the bankruptcy judge to order botti to return the money that had been paid under the plan.a few weeks later in january she tried to reinstate the litigation in the state trial court.both the bankruptcy judge and the state judge said no.the state judge concluded that zurn request was untimely,and after initially granting some of the relief zurn had requested the bankruptcy judge changed his mind.the details of events in the bankruptcy court do not matter.ultimately,bankruptcy judge wedoff concluded that zurn had not supplied adequate cause to reopen the proceedings under b,that it was not possible to enforce the plan as zurn had requested in a separate motion because the plan had been carried out to the letter,and that state rather than federal tribunals offer the right forums for final resolution of the disputes between zurn and botti.
zurn did not appeal within the state system,but she did ask a district judge to review the bankruptcy judge decision.the district judge agreed with the bankruptcy judge bottom line but gave different reasons.he concluded,first,that reopening is barred by the doctrine,see rooker fidelity trust.district of columbia court of appeals feldman,d,and,second,that zurn has no remaining state remedies and thus is not entitled to restitution.bankruptcy courts implement entitlements under state law,see butner united states,d,and if as a matter of illinois law zurn has lost her right to restitution then there is no claim to vindicate in bankruptcy.dismayed by this turn of bankruptcy judge sent her claim to state court,while the district judge wiped it has appealed to us.
the district court characterized its decision as one affirming the bankruptcy judge decision to abstain rather than interfere with state litigation.if that is the right understanding,then d blocks appellate review.but the district judge use of language was imprecise.the bankruptcy judge discussed abstention particularly the consequences of the decision to abstain,but his judgment in these proceedings was not one of abstention.instead the bankruptcy judge denied zurn motion to enforce the plan,a decision that is not abstention of any flavor.indeed,it would have been possible to abstain in only after first reopening the bankruptcy.judge wedoff rescinded his initial act of reopening the district court affirmed.that is incompatible with abstention.moreover,by the time this dispute returned to the district judge,all proceedings in state court were over.there was nothing to abstain in favor was there any pending bankruptcy case that would proceed while the state courts handled the matters from which the federal court had abstained.the questions on the table in concerned the consequences of decisions the state courts already had rendered.because the federal court was not asked in to interfere with or take over a pending state suit in order to value a claim in bankruptcy,it also could not abstain within the meaning of c.what the court actually did was decline to reopen a bankruptcy proceeding under b and hold that the plan did not need enforcement because no one had departed from its provisions.because that decision ended the litigation in the district court,we have jurisdiction under d.
neither of the district judge substantive reasons is correct.the doctrine instantiates the principle that only the supreme court of the united states may modify a judgment entered by a state court in civil litigation.zurn did not ask the federal court to review or alter the state courts decisions she argued,instead,that the appellate decision has a particular legal consequence that botti must make restitution.that may be right or wrong,but deciding whether it is right does not transgress.federal law does not undercut efforts to enforce state judgments.nor was it right to say that zurn delay in attempting to reinstate her suit obliterated her opportunity to obtain restitution.illinois entertains independent actions for restitution,when a judgment that has been satisfied later is reversed.see liberty mutual insurance zambole,d.whether such an independent suit would be appropriate in light of other circumstances that are not in the record such as whether zurn has made a timely demand of botti for restitution is something on which we offer no comment.it is enough to say that zurn retains at least a potential for restitution under state law.
although neither of the district judge reasons is convincing,its judgment nonetheless is correct,for the reason given by the bankruptcy judge.zurn bankruptcy ended in.the plan of reorganization has been fully implemented there is nothing to enforce and no reason to reopen and alter the plan.zurn belief that anyone who has been a debtor in bankruptcy has eternal access to federal court for all disputes related in some way to the debts handled in the bankruptcy proceeding is incompatible not only with pettibone but with many other cases,none of which zurn discusses,maytag navistar international transportation,cir in re xonics,cir in re chicago,rock island pacific,cir.suppose that a chapter plan called for a debtor to pay in full for a car,and thus retain title,and that after the confirmation of the plan a warranty dispute occurred.would the bankruptcy judge be called on to determine whether the car transmission had been repaired to the debtor satisfaction certainly not the federal role ended with the decision that the car would be paid for and retained rather than abandoned.other disputes concerning the car belong to state tribunals.so too with leaseholds,we held in chicago,rock island pacific.zurn conceded at oral argument that disputes of this kind could not be brought back to federal court but argues that her dispute differs because the state litigation was ongoing at the time of the federal bankruptcy.but that was equally true in pettibone,where the bankruptcy court abstained and left resolution of the parties dispute to state tribunals.after the bankruptcy ended,the parties could not agree on the effect in the state cases of the automatic stay in bankruptcy even though this dispute unlike the imbroglio was related to federal law,we held in pettibone that jurisdiction once relinquished stays relinquished.when a bankruptcy court abstains and permits state courts to handle pending litigation,the parties must thereafter look to the state courts to handle their complete dispute and may not drag selected issues back to the bankruptcy forum years later.
section b allows a district judge to reopen a bankruptcy proceeding,but use of that power is reserved for matters such as the correction of errors see in re shondel,cir,amendments necessitated by unanticipated events that frustrate a plan implementation,and the need to enforce the plan and discharge see in re bianucci,cir.reversal of a civil judgment that created a claim against the estate does not warrant reopening reversal affects the amount of a given claim,not the plan provisions for satisfying claims.zurn plan promised payment in full and if events mean that in full is less than the debtor anticipated,still this does not call the plan itself into question.it just provides an occasion for the use of whatever remedies zurn has under state law.
it is unfortunate that botti obduracy has prolonged this dispute.lawyers should comply with their legal the duty to make restitution identified in buzz barton than compel former clients to resort to still more litigation to vindicate their rights.behavior such as botti brings the legal profession into disrepute.see also dale board of education,cir.if litigation must continue,however,the right forum is state court,just as the bankruptcy judge concluded.
the majority rests its decision on a ground that never was raised by the parties in this court or in the earlier stages of the litigation.indeed,botti conceded in his brief to this court that the bankruptcy court had the authority to reopen this case and properly had done so.moreover,the majority characterization of the bankruptcy court proceedings can not be supported by the record.in my view,the appropriate course is to take the bankruptcy court at its word it said that it was abstaining from exercising jurisdiction over the state cases just as it had done in,leaving zurn and botti free to pursue their state remedies.thus,the bankruptcy court abstained under c,and we lack appellate jurisdiction to review such a decision under d.i therefore would dismiss this appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
the majority writes that t he details of events in the bankruptcy court do not matter.op.at.i respectfully disagree.indeed,careful attention to the course of those proceedings reveals that the majority characterization of them can not be supported by the record.
on december,zurn filed a motion to reopen her bankruptcy case under b,which provides that a case may be reopened in the court in which such case was closed to administer assets,to accord relief to the debtor,or for other cause.b.on january,botti filed a memorandum in opposition to zurn motion to reopen.in that memorandum,botti argued that the doctrine of laches barred reopening because of zurn delay and the prejudice such a delay would cause botti.on january,the bankruptcy court nevertheless granted zurn motion and reopened the bankruptcy.in doing so,the bankruptcy court considered the terms of,as well as our decision in in re bianucci,cir.it held that i n this case i found nothing that indicates that there prejudice to the botti firm by any delay in actions involved in this case.january.at.the court further stated that the merits are a completely separate issue from the question of whether the case ought to be reopened.in the absence of the showing of any prejudice to the botti firm the case ought to be reopened pursuant to the authorities that were cited in the bianucci case.id.at.thus ended the litigation over the question of reopening.botti did not ask the bankruptcy court to reconsider its decision.
the parties then turned their attention to the merits of zurn request that the bankruptcy court order botti to reimburse zurn the funds she had paid earlier in compliance with her bankruptcy plan.zurn characterized her motion for repayment as a motion to enforce the original chapter bankruptcy plan confirmed in.under zurn reading of the plan,the bankruptcy court had the authority to order botti to repay zurn because the plan had contemplated continued state proceedings subsequent to the plan confirmation.in reply,botti filed a motion for abstention and remand.he urged the bankruptcy court to deny zurn motion for enforcement of the plan.
after the parties submitted further briefing on the merits,the bankruptcy court ordered botti to repay zurn for the funds she had paid to satisfy the state court judgment in the zurn case,in which zurn,as plaintiff,alleged that botti and his law firm had mishandled her divorce action.a default judgment dismissing the claims for failure to state a cause of action and imposing sanctions and attorneys fees on zurn had been entered by the trial court.however,that judgment subsequently was reversed by the illinois appellate court,and zurn therefore had been relieved of the obligation to pay that judgment.
by contrast,the bankruptcy court denied zurn motion for reimbursement with respect to the botti case.in this action,botti and his law firm,as plaintiffs,had sought fees for representing zurn in the divorce action.a default judgment had been entered in favor of botti,awarding him the requested attorneys fees.however,this judgment had been reversed on appeal.
the bankruptcy court had reached different results in the two requests for reimbursement because it determined the state appellate decision to be final in the zurn case but in the botti case.as to the zurn case,the bankruptcy court explained that the illinois appellate court had determined that zurn had stated a cause of action therefore botti claim for sanctions could not stand.because the chapter payment was only provisional as to this claim,reasoned the bankruptcy court,zurn was entitled to a return of the amount that she had paid to botti on this claim.contrary to this characterization,in the botti case,botti claim for attorneys fees was still alive,and he ultimately might prevail and be entitled to the funds zurn had paid through the chapter plan.in sum,the bankruptcy court granted in part and denied in part zurn motion to enforce the plan and to order repayment of those funds.after the bankruptcy court oral ruling on march and while that court was considering whether and at what rate to impose interest on the funds at issue,the dupage county court denied zurn motion to reinstate the zurn case in that court.botti brought a motion to amend the earlier order in light of this new development and what he submitted were manifest errors of law in the bankruptcy court characterization of the illinois appellate court decision reversing the zurn case.zurn also brought a motion to reconsider with respect to the botti case.as the bankruptcy court characterized the situation,the legal issues raised by both parties are essentially of the same nature that the court has misperceived the law that applicable here and that to reconsider the order that previously been entered.june.at.specifically,botti maintained that the bankruptcy court order incorrectly perceived the nature of illinois supreme court rule,which is analogous to federal rule of civil procedure,the provision under which zurn had been sanctioned in the zurn case.in its order,the bankruptcy court had reasoned that,because zurn could no longer be sanctioned under rule,the appellate court ruling on that issue was final and the bankruptcy court could order botti to repay zurn.
upon reconsideration,the bankruptcy court agreed with botti that its earli
