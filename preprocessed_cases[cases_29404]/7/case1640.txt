background 
keith mackenzie,like many others,invested funds in afi.afi was operated by gary eisenberg who entered a guilty plea to federal securities and mail fraud charges in and is currently serving a prison sentence.in that plea,he conceded that he operated afi as a ponzi investors purported profits with funds raised from other investors.
mackenzie invested with afi in and as a purported limited partner.in connection with his subsequent withdrawal from afi,he received payments totaling between and.of the total payments,was a return of mackenzie principal investment.the rest,roughly,was a fictitious gain on the principal investment.
afi bankruptcy proceedings commenced on october.in october of,the trustee,carolyn dye,commenced adversary proceedings against approximately of afi investors,including mackenzie,to avoid transfers made to them by afi the trustee claimed avoidance and recovery of fraudulent transfers pursuant to b and and cal.civ.code and.
the bankruptcy court granted the trustee summary judgment motion seeking to avoid transfers made by afi to mackenzie.mackenzie appealed the judgment to the district court,which reversed in part.the reversal was limited to the amount of principal initially invested by mackenzie.the district court reasoned that mackenzie had exchanged his purported partnership interest for a proportionately reduced restitution claim,distinguishing the facts of the transaction from a simple receipt of money on account of an equity interest as a limited partner.the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court as to the remaining,the fictitious gain on mackenzie principal investment,as it was in excess of mackenzie restitution claim,and it was not transferred in connection with mackenzie withdrawal from the partnership.
the district court ordered the matter remanded to the bankruptcy court to determine whether mackenzie had received the transfer in good faith and to determine also how much,if any,prejudgment interest was payable to the trustee.
the trustee appeals,arguing that the debtor estate is entitled to the entire amount transferred from afi to mackenzie,principal and the fictitious gain,as well as prejudgment interest.mackenzie cross appeals,arguing that he is entitled to the entire amount transferred from afi to him.
discussiona.standard of review.
we review de novo the district court decision on an appeal from a bankruptcy court.in re raintree healthcare,cir.thus,we apply the same standard of review applied by the district court.id.at.no deference is given to the district court decision.in re salazar,cir.summary judgment is to be granted if the pleadings and supporting documents,viewed in the light most favorable to the party,show that there is no genuine issue as to a material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.fed.civ.c.
b.this is a fraudulent transfer case.
as an initial matter,it is important to recognize that this case implicates only fraudulent transfer law.our concern here is not the law of preferences under,because we are years removed from that section reach back period.see b a.similarly,we are not concerned with the law of subordination under b,because we are a step removed from distribution of the bankruptcy estate under b see wyle rider family in re united energy,cir united energy.instead,this case is driven by california state fraudulent transfer law.as a result,our analysis is directed at what the debtor surrendered and what the debtor received irrespective of what any third party may have gained or lost.id.emphasis added and internal quotation marks omitted.
applicable law.
an action to recover fraudulent transfers under a of the bankruptcy code is time barred because the transfers from afi to mackenzie occurred more than one year before bankruptcy proceedings commenced section b of the bankruptcy code,however,allows a bankruptcy trustee to avoid any transfer of a debtor property that would be avoidable by an unsecured creditor under applicable state law.see in re acequia,cir.one creditor of any amount will suffice for the purposes of b.id.at.in this case,at least one unsecured creditor existed,and cal.civ.code a and a provide california state law allowing an unsecured creditor to reach the transfers made by afi to mackenzie in and.
where state statutes are similar to the bankruptcy code,cases analyzing the bankruptcy code provisions are persuasive authority.hayes palm seedlings in re agric.research and tech.group,cir agretech.here,california fraudulent transfer statutes are similar in form and substance to the bankruptcy code fraudulent transfer provisions.united energy,at.compare a with cal.civ.code a allowing a transfer to be avoided when the debtor acted with actual intent to hinder,delay,or defraud an entity or creditor,or where indicia of constructive fraud are present compare also c with cal.civ.code a providing a safe faith exception to transferees who took in good faith and for value.
mackenzie the transfer from afi to mackenzie was an actually fraudulent transfer under a a.
mackenzie argues that he may be entitled to the entire transfer,including the fictitious gain made on account of his investment.the thrust of that argument is that genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether afi transferred the to mackenzie with the actual intent to hinder,delay,or defraud an entity or creditor under a a.we do not find that argument persuasive.
we allow a finding of fraudulent intent under section a the analog to a on the basis of circumstantial evidence.agretech,at.furthermore,the mere existence of a ponzi scheme is sufficient to establish actual intent under a or a state equivalent to that section.id.at.here,eisenberg plea demonstrates the existence of fraudulent intent and a ponzi scheme,and mackenzie failed to identify evidence in the record that created a genuine issue of material fact as to either issue.eisenberg admitted the following in his plea 
eisenberg solicited investors for partnerships knowing that the businesses of afi,afhi,and the partnerships were not profitable from inception.as early as,eisenberg knew that the factoring business of afi,afhi,and the partnerships had already incurred million to million in operating losses and that he was running a ponzi scheme,that is,paying investors purported interest payments with funds raised from other investors,rather than from the profits of the factoring business as eisenberg represented to investors.
emphasis added.thus,the record shows eisenberg operation was a ponzi scheme before mackenzie invested in the partnership,well before the transfers were made from afi to mackenzie.that by itself is enough to establish the transfers were made with actual fraudulent intent.see agretech,at.
we find mackenzie without merit,and we continue to the issue in the trustee appeal the application of the good faith exception under cal.civ.code a,which is the equivalent to c.
e.the good faith exception under cal.civ.code a is not barred as a matter of law.
we have twice addressed the application of the phrase reasonably equivalent value related to fraudulent transfer law in the context of a ponzi scheme the first time was in agretech,where we held that a distribution on account of a partnership interest relative to an investor capital contribution was not reasonably equivalent value as defined by the bankruptcy code and hawaii analog.agretech,at.the second was in united energy,where we held that a transfer in exchange for a proportionally reduced restitution claim was reasonably equivalent value as defined by the bankruptcy code and california analog.united energy,at.the question before us tod
