vicki dempsey represented debtors in four bankruptcy cases before central district of illinois courts.in each case,dempsey requested attorney fees in excess of,the central district presumptive attorney fee limit for chapter bankruptcy cases.however,the bankruptcy court found that dempsey failed to justify fees in excess of the limit in any of her cases,and thus limited her fee awards to in each case.dempsey appealed to the district court.following a convoluted series of procedural moves involving a remand to the bankruptcy court for clarification and the filing by dempsey of two motions to reopen appeal in the district court,the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court fee award by denying dempsey second motion to reopen appeal.
background 
two years ago,dempsey first appeared before this court to challenge the central district procedure for awarding fees to chapter bankruptcy attorneys.in in the matter of kindhart,cir hereinafter kindhart i,dempsey applied to the bankruptcy court was in excess of what at the time was an presumptive fee limit throughout the central district the district court affirmed the fee award,and dempsey appealed to this court.finding the limit an abuse of discretion,this court reversed and directed the district and bankruptcy judges of the central district to reexamine the manner in which they awarded fees to chapter bankruptcy attorneys.in response to our order,the district and bankruptcy judges agreed to raise the chapter presumptive fee limit to to maintain a uniform presumptive attorney fee limit for chapter bankruptcy cases throughout the district and to review the presumptive limit every months.see order of the district court for the central district of illinois at.on remand,dempsey fees were adjusted to reflect the new base fee,but she still felt and once again appealed to this court.we held that the new fee limit was fair and reasonable,and thus did not modify dempsey new fee award.see in the matter of kindhart,cir hereinafter kindhart ii.
armed now with four new cases,dempsey attempts to challenge once again the central district presumptive fee limit.in each of these cases,dempsey filed motions in the bankruptcy court seeking fees that exceeded the new limit by amounts ranging from to.in these motions,dempsey presented detailed records of the amount of time she had spent on each case totaling approximately to hours per case,and reported that she had billed this time at the rate of per hour.
following a hearing on these motions which was attended by dempsey partner,but not by dempsey herself,the bankruptcy court ruled that dempsey had failed to justify in any of her four cases a fee in excess of the presumptive fee limit.noting that dempsey bore the burden of establishing the reasonableness of her fees,the bankruptcy court maintained that it could not conclude that the hourly rate was reasonable because there are experienced chapter bankruptcy attorneys practicing in the quincy area whose hourly rate is in the to per hour range.see,in re hatfield,slip op.at.may.further,because dempsey cases were some of the more simple and straightforward that the court and dempsey have seen,the court believed that dempsey would be overcompensated by an award of attorney fees above the threshold.id.accordingly,the bankruptcy court limited dempsey fee to in each case.
dempsey appealed to the district court.that court consolidated the four cases and decided the newly consolidated case on the briefs submitted by dempsey and the trustee.on december,the district court entered the following judgment in each case 
it is ordered and adjudged pursuant to order entered by the honorable richard mills,the judgment of the bankruptcy court for the central district of illinois is vacated,and this case is remanded to the bankruptcy court for an elaboration and a more detailed explanation as to why that court denied appellant motion for approval of additional fees.case closed.

more than four months after the district court remand,the bankruptcy court still had not entered a new judgment.frustrated by the delay,dempsey filed a motion to reopen appeal in the district court on april,asking that the district court allow her requested fees in their entirety,establish local bankruptcy attorney fee rules for all judges in the central district and provide any other appropriate relief.before the district court could address the merits of dempsey motion to reopen appeal,the bankruptcy court ruled.
not surprisingly,the bankruptcy court once again limited dempsey fees to per case.in addition to restating its prior reasons for denying dempsey excess fee requests,the bankruptcy court new opinion set forth numerous general conclusions,but few specific factual findings.among the more specific new findings were the following.first,the court complained that dempsey had only produced an unverified itemization setting forth her time expended and services rendered.in re bond,et.al,slip op.at.second,the bankruptcy court found that dempsey failed to adequately delegate work to members of her staff.as a result,the bankruptcy court believed that at least some of the hours expended by dempsey should have been billed at a staff rate,rather than at her higher attorney rate.third,the bankruptcy court alleged that dempsey ha d never filed an application to be hired by the estate as required by section of the bankruptcy code of more concern,she ha d never sought authority of the court to represent the estate.id.at.from the record,it appears that dempsey was given no opportunity to respond to these concerns although some of them were raised for the first time in the bankruptcy court second opinion before the bankruptcy court once again denied her fees.
because the bankruptcy court finally ruled before the district court could address dempsey motion to reopen appeal,the district court denied dempsey motion to reopen appeal as moot.however,the district court directed dempsey in an order dated may to file another motion but providing no time limit for doing so if she continues in her position that these cases should be reopened.in re bond,slip op.at.may.in accordance with this directive,dempsey filed a second motion to reopen appeal in the district court on may,more than days after the bankruptcy court entered its final order.this motion,which sought to have the district court review the bankruptcy court decision to deny her fees,is best viewed as a short appellate brief,or perhaps,if generously construed,a notice of appeal.finding the case ripe for adjudication,in re bond.june,the district court denied dempsey second motion to reopen appeal on the merits,effectively affirming the bankruptcy court final order.dempsey now appeals to this court.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,dempsey argues that the district court erred by refusing to award the requested fees.before we are able to address the merits of dempsey argument,we must first address the intervenor trustee contention that we may not exercise jurisdiction over this problem that arises out of the convoluted procedure that dempsey used partially at the district court direction to appeal the bankruptcy court decision on remand.we therefore begin with the always stimulating and hopefully fruitful consideration of technical jurisdictional points.fruehauf jartran,in re jartran,cir.
jurisdiction 
under,a party may appeal the final judgment of a bankruptcy court to an appropriate district court.however,in order to perfect the appeal and provide the district court with jurisdiction,the party must file a notice of appeal with the clerk of the bankruptcy court within days of the bankruptcy court decision.see fed.a.rule a describes conditions precedent that are mandatory and jurisdictional.see stelpflug federal land bank of paul,cir see also in re schultz fabricating,cir district court deprived of jurisdiction when appellant fails to file timely notice of appeal.
in this case,dempsey and the district court appear to have agreed to waive the formalities of the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure.when dempsey appealed the bankruptcy court decision following the district court remand,she did not do so by filing a notice of appeal in the bankruptcy court within days of the court decision.instead,she filed a motion to reopen appeal in the district court,more than days after the bankruptcy court decision.in response to this novel procedure,the intervenor trustee argues that the district court did not have jurisdiction over dempsey appeal because her motion was not filed with the clerk of the bankruptcy court,was not a notice of appeal,and even if it was a notice of appeal,was not filed within the window provided by rule a nor did dempsey seek an extension of the filing time under rule c.because any one of these alleged defects can deprive the district court of jurisdiction,we devote the bulk of our discussion to the issue of timeliness,as did the parties in their briefs.
dempsey attempts to refute the trustee argument by noting that when the district court denied her first motion to reopen appeal,it explicitly told her to file another motion if she continues in her position that these cases should be reopened.in light of this ruling,dempsey argues that the district court properly exercised jurisdiction over her appeal because it specifically assured her in its ruling on her first motion that she could file a new motion if she was dissatisfied with the bankruptcy court decision on remand.even if the district court could not derive jurisdiction from its assurances to dempsey,she believes that another,independent,basis for jurisdiction lies in the fact that the district court implicitly retained jurisdiction over the case when it remanded the case to the bankruptcy court for further elaboration.we address,and reject,these arguments in turn.
the unique circumstances doctrine 
dempsey first argument reduces to a claim that the happenings below call for application of a narrow exception to the general rule prohibiting an untimely appeal known as the unique circumstances doctrine.varhol national passenger,cir en banc.the unique circumstances doctrine was first recognized in harris truck lines,cherry meat packers,d,which held that a court of appeals should defer to a district court finding of excusable neglect under rule of civil procedure a when a party relies on the district court erroneous extension of time to file a notice of appeal.two years later,the doctrine was extended by thompson ins,d,in which the supreme court held that unique circumstances were present because the district court had erroneously ruled that the motion for a new trial was filed in ample time and the party,relying on that determination,believed that the time for taking an appeal would not continue to run pending final disposition of the motion.charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure at ed.
subsequent supreme court decisions have narrowed the unique circumstances doctrine to the point where its continued vitality is in question.see,varhol,at.nonetheless,the doctrine survives,although we only apply it as follows when a party performs an act which,if properly done,postponed the deadline for filing an appeal,and the party relied on the district court conclusion that the act had been properly done,the appeal is timely if filed within the mistaken new deadline.varhol,at quoting thompson,at.in addition,the doctrine applies only when a party has received specific assurance by a judicial officer that the necessary act has been properly done.osterneck ernst whitney,d.
here,the unique circumstance relied upon by dempsey is the district court order denying her first motion to reopen appeal.as noted,the order contains one sentence which states that the district court is denying dempsey first motion to reopen appeal,but that she can file another motion if she continues in her position that these cases should be reopened.in light of green bisby,cir,which held that a minute order does not constitute an affirmative representation,it is difficult to interpret the one sentence in the district court order here as the kind of specific assurance from a judicial officer that osterneck contemplated as allowing for an exception to otherwise strict notice of appeal rules.this is especially true because the parties in other unique circumstance not even request an extension of time from the court thus,the district court did not enter its order with the intent of assuring dempsey of the proper timing for filing an appeal.
more importantly,even if one sentence of a judge order could generally constitute an assurance that a motion to reopen appeal would adequately substitute for a proper notice of appeal,the order at issue here does not contain any specific assurance regarding the timeliness of dempsey action.instead,the order merely states that dempsey first motion to reopen appeal is moot and that if she continues in her position that these cases should be reopened,she must file a new motion.it is thus difficult to conclude that the district court intended to grant dempsey an extension of time and that dempsey relied on this extension,as required by varhol.instead,the fact that the district court order suggested no time limit might have caused dempsey to look at the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure,where she might have discovered the proper procedure for filing a valid notice of appeal.accordingly,the district court order does not constitute the type of specific assurance that triggers the unique circumstances doctrine.
retained jurisdiction 
dempsey also argues that the district court retained jurisdiction over this cause when it first remanded to the bankruptcy court for an elaboration of the bankruptcy court reasoning.this would be an easy argument to make had the district court explicitly stated that it was retaining jurisdiction during the proceedings on remand,the method used by most courts in this circuit when they wish to exert a continuing supervisory role over a dismissed case.see,kindhart i,at.here,however,the court took the road less traveled,acting as if it had retained jurisdiction even though nothing in the court actions at the time it remanded dempsey case really indicated an intent to do so.we must thus determine whether the district court somehow implicitly retained jurisdiction over dempsey case.
of most help to our determination is franzen,cir.in,a prison inmate case was dismissed with prejudice after the inmate entered into a settlement agreement with defendant prison officials.subsequently,the inmate complained to the district court that the settlement agreement was not being adhered to,and the district court ruled on the merits.on appeal,we held that the district court only had jurisdiction to entertain the inmate complaint if the district court had exercised a deliberate retention of jurisdiction.id.at.
unfortunately,the district court in did not explicitly retain jurisdiction when it dismissed the inmate suit.nonetheless,we found that the district court had retained jurisdiction,employing reasoning that is worth quoting at some length 
w e know that settlements between prisoners and prison officials often contemplate a continuing supervisory role for the federal court,and we know that when the plaintiff wrote his letter to the judge,the judge forthwith characterized it as a petition to enforce the agreement and proceeded to do so.the judge would not have been likely to grant such a petition in a case over which he had no jurisdiction because he had dismissed the case outright months earlier.his response is therefore some evidence that he had indeed intended to make his dismissal,though outright in form,conditional in substance 
id.at.thus,two factors primarily motivated our finding in the continued role for the court that was contemplated after dismissal and the court acting as if it had retained jurisdiction because these factors constitute the bare minimum requirements for a finding of retained jurisdiction,see,both factors must be present for a district court to implicitly retain jurisdiction.
here,the conditions are not completely satisfied.unlike settlement agreem
