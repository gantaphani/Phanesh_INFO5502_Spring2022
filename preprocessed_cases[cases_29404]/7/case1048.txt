this is an appeal involving a puzzle of statutory interpretation.the issue comes to us from an adversary proceeding in bankruptcy court between debra miller trustee and lasalle bank national association lasalle.the bankruptcy court held that an improperly recorded mortgage was avoidable under indiana law as amended in because it did not impart constructive knowledge to a bona fide purchaser,here the trustee.the bankruptcy court held that the amendment applied only to mortgages recorded after the amendment effective date of july.the district court reversed,and the trustee appeals.because we interpret the statute to apply to all mortgages regardless when recorded,we affirm the district court.
background 
none of the operative facts is in dispute.in,the debtors executed and delivered to alliance,lasalle predecessor,a mortgage on a property in peru,indiana,to secure a loan.the mortgage was filed with the miami county recorder in may,but the acknowledgment had a technical defect because it did not identify the individuals who appeared before the notary and executed the mortgage document.after the debtors filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter,in march,the trustee brought an adversary proceeding to avoid lasalle mortgage lien 
in indiana,as elsewhere,a recorded,properly acknowledged mortgage imparts constructive notice of its existence to subsequent bona fide purchasers bfps.see bank of new york nally.prior to the amendment,a mortgage that was not entitled to be recorded because of a technical defect in the acknowledgment did not provide such notice see requiring that a notary public authenticate signature for grantors of mortgage now modified by,at issue in the present case sandy ridge oil,centerre bank ass in re sandy ridge oil,stating the general rule in re stubbs,holding that an acknowledgment was defective because it did not include the name of the person who appeared before a notary public,aff wl baldin calumet bank in re baldin.
in,the indiana general assembly amended its recording statute,to allow recorded mortgages with certain technical defects to provide constructive notice as if the mortgages were properly recorded and acknowledged.the district courts that have interpreted the statute in this case,and both parties in the present appeal,note that the legislature passed the amendment in an apparent attempt to overrule in re stubbs.in,the assembly again amended the statute and made it clear that the statute applied to all mortgages,regardless when recorded amendment.the parties dispute whether,before the amendment came into force,the amendment applied to purchasers of properties encumbered by certain technically deficient mortgages recorded prior to july.
in the present case,the bankruptcy court found the amendment ambiguous but held that it was most naturally interpreted to apply to mortgages recorded after july.the bankruptcy court ultimately grounded its decision on several presumptions of statutory interpretation.it construed the purpose of the amendment as divest ing a bfp and a bankruptcy trustee of the right to avoid an improperly recorded mortgage.based on the presumption that statutes are applied prospectively,the bankruptcy court construed the statute to apply only to mortgages recorded after the amendment effective date.on appeal,the district court disagreed with the bankruptcy court interpretation of the language of the amendment.see miller lasalle bank ass in re gysin.the district court began by examining indicia of legislative intent.it credited lasalle argument that the amendment was passed in response to frequent arguments by bankruptcy trustees in the period that the amendment should be interpreted to apply only to mortgages recorded after the amendment became effective.see id.at.the district court thus found that the indiana legislature intended the amendment to apply to all mortgages and apparently did not rely on the default rule that statutes are to be applied prospectively.see id.at.
ii.standard of review 
when reviewing a bankruptcy court decision,an appeals court applies the same standard of review as does the district court.we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment and its interpretation of indiana law.see estate of moreland dieter,cir citing salve regina coll.russell,d dick conseco,cir.
iii.discussion 
the purpose of a recording statute is to provide protection to subsequent purchasers,lessees and mortgagees.see,szakaly smith.in,after a recodification,indiana recording statute provided 
conveyance or mortgage of land or of any interest in land and 
a lease for more than three years.must be recorded in the recorder office of the county where the land is situated.
b a conveyance,mortgage,or lease takes priority according to the time of its filing.the conveyance,mortgage,or lease is fraudulent and void as against any subsequent purchaser,lessee,or mortgagee in good faith and for a valuable consideration if the purchaser,lessee,or mortgagee deed,mortgage,or lease is first recorded.
an amendment in moved the last phrase of a to become the introductory phrase of the subsection the following must be recorded,and the amendment provided subsection c 
c this subsection applies only to a mortgage.if 
an instrument referred to in subsection a is recorded and 
the instrument does not comply with the 
a requirements of 
b technical requirements of ic c the instrument is validly recorded and provides constructive notice of the contents of the instrument as of the date of filing.
acts,effective july,emphasis added.
the amendment amended subsection c to add t his subsection applies regardless of when a mortgage was recorded after the first sentence.acts,effective july.consequently,our interpretation of the amendment affects only properties purchased here under the strong arm powers of the trustee between july,and july.
indiana law includes familiar rules of statutory interpretation.the statute is given its clear and plain meaning if unambiguous,but if ambiguous the court must try to ascertain the legislature intent,and the court primary goal is to interpret the statute to effectuate that intent.basileh alghusain,city of carmel steele.the indiana supreme court describes the intent inquiry as follows t he court will look to each and every part of the statute to the circumstances under which it was enacted to the old law upon the subject,if any to other statutes upon the same subjects,or relative subjects,whether in force or repealed,to contemporaneous legislative history,and to the evils and mischiefs to be remedied.see ashlin transp.services,indiana unemployment ins,summarizing indiana supreme court cases.because indiana statutes have no explanatory committee reports,there is little legislative history to examine beyond amendments to the statute.see,state.
in addition to the presumption against retroactivity,indiana caselaw recognizes many other familiar presumptions of statutory interpretation,if language is used in one section but omitted in another,the court presumes that the legislature acted intentionally in doing so,see city of crown point misty woods properties,llc,internal citations omitted statutes in derogation of the common law are to be strictly construed,see stanley walker,dickson,dissenting citing bartrom adjustment bureau,and an amendment to a statute creates the rebuttable presumption that the amendment was intended to change the law,see turner state.lastly,when the legislature passes several statutes during the same session,those should be interpreted in harmony,to give effect to each.see,ware state,internal citations omitted.
we thus begin with the language of the statute.the parties provide two interpretations of the phrase is recorded in subsection c.both parties arguments are reasonable,and we hold that the statute is ambiguous.the bankruptcy court held,and the trustee argues,that is recorded is a present tense passive verb having temporal significance and subsection c only applies to mortgages that are recorded after the amendment effective date.they also note that another provision in the same chapter,added in uses the language this section applies to an instrument rega
