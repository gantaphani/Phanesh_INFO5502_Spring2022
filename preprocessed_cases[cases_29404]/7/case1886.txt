the question in this bankruptcy appeal is whether a chapter trustee may bring claims that a chapter could not.we conclude that the trustee is barred in the circumstances of this case from bringing a derivative claim on behalf of a creditors committee after conversion to chapter.
accordingly,we affirm the decision of the district court.
background 
debtor,known under its trade name provided meeting and conference technology to corporate clients.in july,after a series of financial setbacks,mshow filed for bankruptcy under chapter.shortly after the bankruptcy case was filed,some of mshow unsecured creditors formed a creditors committee to represent their interests in the proceedings.about the same time,mshow sought emergency authority from the bankruptcy court to use its cash on hand as collateral,incur additional debt,and protect lenders from existing creditors.
the bankruptcy court issued a financing order granting mshow request.this financing order gave mshow,as the authority to use certain of its assets subject to security interests,including assets held by secured creditors.akamai technologies had previously helped finance mshow and was one of its secured creditors holding a security interest.
the financing order contained a provision protecting the secured creditors,including akamai,from any and all claims except those that could be brought by the unsecured creditors committee.paragraph of the financing order,which is at the heart of this dispute,set out the protective bar 
debtor estate,creditors,holders of claims against or equity interest in,debtor,any official or unofficial committee of holders of claims or equity interests and all such and other persons and entities shall be forever barred from asserting any and all claims on any basis or theory against the secured creditors.
at,emphasis added.
the financing order,however,carved out a narrow exception to this bar for an unsecured creditors committee 
the committee shall have until the first date set by the court for objections to confirmation of a reorganization plan in the bankruptcy case to deliver to secured creditors its written notice of intent to commence an action against any secured creditor asserting any claim,liability,or cause of action,based on any grounds or theory whatsoever but including,without limitation,any claim,liability or cause of action seeking to avoid.
in addition to the explicit language of,the financing order contained other provisions confirming that it bound parties other than mshow and was intended to survive conversion to chapter.paragraph,for example,stipulated its provisions were to survive conversion to chapter bankruptcy.and stipulated that the protections of would bind parties to a credit agreement that included releases and other protections for secured creditors 
the financing order also required mshow to prepare and serve a notice on its creditors that described the agreements contained in.accordingly,in august,mshow served notice including the following language 
if the committee takes no action against the secured creditors by these deadlines which it estimated to be days from the date of the notice,any claims that may exist against the secured creditors will be forever barred.this bar is binding not only on mshow and its creditors,but also on any subsequently appointed bankruptcy trustee.
at.the notice further acknowledged 
all of the provisions of the loan agreements and the order shall be binding on any trustee subsequently appointed in the bankruptcy case for mshow and including upon dismissal,conversion to chapter,or closing the mshow case.as a result,these provisions may limit the recovery of both and unsecured creditors in the event the case is converted to one under chapter.
at,emphasis added 
following this notice,the bankruptcy court approved the financing order on august.over the next,however,the creditors committee took no action to assert claims against the secured creditors.consequently,the parties decided to convert the case to chapter.in its motion to convert the case to chapter,the trustee stated that one of the purposes of conversion was to initiate avoidance and other types of litigation by an independent chapter trustee.at.
three days before the conversion order was entered,on june,mshow and the unsecured creditors committee filed a stipulated settlement,releasing certain lenders.the settlement said nothing about claims against secured creditors,such as akamai,except that all parties to this agreement hereby expressly reserve their rights,claims,and causes of action against any who are not released parties.at.akamai was not a released party.
the bankruptcy court entered the conversion order on june.the chapter trustee subsequently commenced an avoidance action against akamai to recover transfers for the benefit of the estate.akamai moved for summary judgment on the ground that the claim was barred by the terms of the financing order.the bankruptcy court denied this motion,and akamai appealed to the district court.the district court reversed on the ground that the financing order barred the trustee claims.
the trustee now appeals.
ii.analysis 
a bankruptcy trustee has general authority to avoid certain transfers for the benefit of the estate.under the bankruptcy code,a has the powers of a trustee,id.a,and,as such,the authority to bring avoidance actions.zilkha energy leighton,cir authority under a includes the right to bring avoidance action.importantly,however,where a serves as the trustee in a chapter bankruptcy,a chapter trustee may not assert any rights that were previously waived by the prior to conversion.paul monts,cir.
accordingly,we must first determine if mshow,as the,waived its right along with the right of the chapter trustee to bring an avoidance action against akamai.if it did,we must then consider whether the trustee can still exercise the authority reserved to the creditors committee to bring such a claim.
the first issue is readily resolved by the financing order.it clearly states debtor estate and debtor shall be forever barred from asserting any and all claims on any basis or theory against the secured creditors.at.it is difficult to construe the language of this legal bar any way other than a waiver of mshow right to bring an avoidance action against secured creditors such as akamai.
nevertheless,the trustee suggests several theories in support of his position that he is not barred from bringing suit the trustee argues a full release did not occur because the creditors committee retained a right of action inclusion of the word trustee in,but not of the order,excluded the trustee from the legal bar it is unreasonable to conclude the agreement intended conversion to act as an unstated limitation on the creditors committee right of action and parol evidence should be admitted to establish the intent of the parties.all of these arguments are without merit.
the release.the trustee first argues that because the order expressly preserves avoidance claims to be pursued by the creditors c ommittee against the secured creditors,it can not be a full release.aplt.br.at.the basis for this argument is the proposition that a release is an outright discharge of the entire obligation.symons mueller,cir.thus,the trustee argues,the retention of any right to sue implies the financing order did not constitute a full release and,therefore,the trustee may still sue.
but the real question is not whether a full release exists,but rather who retained any existing right to bring an avoidance action.it is well established that a chapter trustee succeeds to the rights of the and is bound by prior actions of the to the extent approved by the court.paul monts,cir.even the trustee concedes he is bound by court approved stipulations of a prior to conversion.aplt.br.at.the creditors committee may have retained a right of action,but that does not remove the existing bar against the or,the trustee enforcing those rights.mshow and,the trustee are barred from bringing an avoidance action regardless of whether the right to an avoidance action exists.both the bankruptcy court and district court agreed the financing order barred mshow from
