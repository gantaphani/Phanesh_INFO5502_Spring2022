background 
in,prestige purchased a car wash business from east bay,financed in part by a seller loan of.prestige gave east bay a promissory note first note that was secured by a deed of trust and a security interest in prestige personal property and equipment.the first note was signed by prestige three general partners,including jerry brassfield,and included a guaranty provision stating,this promissory note,including all of trustor obligations to pay principal and interest are hereby personally guaranteed by jerry brassfield dba brassfield enterprises.
in september,the first note was split into two notes,one for second note,and one for third note,both of which were secured by deeds of trust and both of which contained the same personal guaranty as the first note.the second note was subsequently assigned and is no longer at issue.the third note was due in october,but the parties extended the maturity date to october.
in october,prestige defaulted on the third note.rather than foreclosing on its security interest,east bay filed an action on the guaranty against brassfield,seeking writs of attachment against his personal assets.one of the affirmative defenses brassfield raised was that the relief sought was a violation of the single action rule found in a,which requires that a secured creditor seek foreclosure as the single form of action for the recovery of a debt secured by a mortgage or deed of trust on real property.east bay obtained the writs of attachment,and,in april,attached approximately in brassfield personal bank accounts.
in december,prestige filed a petition for bankruptcy under chapter of the bankruptcy code,listing east bay as the holder of a disputed secured claim.on april,prestige filed an adversary proceeding in bankruptcy court,seeking the avoidance of east bay lien due to its violation of a,and a declaration that the third note was unenforceable under the statute found in.prestige filed a motion for summary judgment,setting forth three issues whether brassfield was a primary obligor under the third note,such that east bay violated a by proceeding against his unpledged assets,whether east bay action against brassfield unpledged assets constituted an action under a,resulting in a waiver of east bay security interest,and whether east bay had any claim in prestige bankruptcy case because of its failure timely to file a proof of claim and because its loan was by operation of.
in january,the bankruptcy court entered an order granting partial summary judgment in favor of prestige,ruling on the first two issues.see prestige.east bay car wash partners in re prestige,prestige i.the court found that brassfield was a primary obligor on the third note,such that the purported guaranty added no additional liability,and that east bay had taken its action under a,resulting in a waiver of its security interest in the real property.id.at.the court declined to consider the third issue because the issue was not properly before it.see id.at.as a result of this ruling,the santa clara county superior court dissolved the writs of attachment,and,in august,east bay released the attachments of brassfield personal accounts.
the district court affirmed the order granting partial summary judgment.we affirmed,adopting the facts and reasons set forth in the bankruptcy court decision.see prestige.east bay car wash partners in re prestige,cir prestige iii.
on may,prior to our decision in prestige iii,east bay filed a proof of claim in prestige bankruptcy case.the bankruptcy court then held a hearing to determine the final matter raised by east bay had any claim against prestige.in order to make the determination,the court addressed the following three arguments raised by prestige as to why east bay unsecured claim should be disallowed it was not timely filed,east bay violation of a caused it to lose both its security and its unpaid debt,and the underlying note is a purchase money note and is therefore unenforceable under.see prestige.east bay car wash partners in re prestige,prestige ii.
the bankruptcy court denied prestige motion for partial summary judgment and overruled its objection to east bay unsecured claim.see id.at.the court concluded that east bay had timely filed its claim,had lost its security only,not its debt,and was not subject to the provisions of.see id.at.east bay therefore held an unsecured claim in prestige bankruptcy case.see id.at.the district court affirmed the denial of the remainder of prestige summary judgment motion and the overruling of prestige objection to east bay claim.prestige filed a timely notice of appeal.
jurisdiction 
we have jurisdiction over an appeal from a final order of the district court under d.ordinarily,a district court order is final if it affirms or reverses a final bankruptcy court order.see stanley crossland,crossland,chambers,macarthur lastreto in re lakeshore village resort,cir.however,i n bankruptcy proceedings the rules of finality developed under the general grant of appellate jurisdiction provided in are given a flexible reading.century ctr.partners fdic in re century ctr.partners,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also walthall united states,cir finality determination in the bankruptcy context has its own set of rules.we therefore use a pragmatic approach to finality in bankruptcy because certain proceedings in a bankruptcy case are so distinctive and conclusive either to the rights of individual parties or the ultimate outcome of the case that final decisions as to them should be appealable as of right.alexander compton in re bonham,cir quoting elliott four seasons properties in re frontier properties,cir.this approach has led us to exercise jurisdiction over appeals from bankruptcy court orders denying summary judgment.see alvarado walsh in re lco enters,cir affirming bap reversal of the bankruptcy court denial of the motion for summary judgment.
the district court order disposed of all the issues in the case by overruling prestige objections to east bay claim and was thus sufficiently conclusive to be appealable 
because the district court declined to rule on the issue of the amount of east bay claim,however,the question arises of whether the district court order was final.prestige argued before the district court and to this court that,even if east bay did hold an unsecured claim,it should be limited to the amount of the avoided security interest,rather than the amount of the debt.the bankruptcy court did not address the issue,presumably because prestige did not raise it,focusing instead on the issue of whether east bay held a claim at all.see prestige ii,at the court is now asked to determine whether east bay has an unsecured claim in the bankruptcy case.id.the ultimate issue is whether east bay has any claim against prestige in the bankruptcy case.the district court noted that the bankruptcy court did not address the amount of the claim and that the record was void as to whether prestige raised the issue below,and so declined to rule on the issue.
any further proceedings that would be required here in order to determine the amount of east bay claim would involve new proceedings and factual findings independent of the legal conclusion upon which the bankruptcy court based its decision to allow east bay claim at all.sims dearmond in re lendvest mortgage,cir.furthermore,the question of whether east bay still holds a claim at all is clearly potentially dispositive,for there is no need to determine the amount of east bay claim without a finding that it still holds a claim.id.quoting bonner mall partnership bancorp mortgage in re bonner mall partnership,cir,dismissed as moot,d.in united states stone in re stone,cir,the bankruptcy court granted partial summary judgment on the issue of whether the irs held an interest in proceeds held by the debtor,leaving other issues yet to be determined in the adversary proceeding.as in stone,where the bap affirmance of the bankruptcy court order was a final and appealable order because it resolved d the question of the priority of the federal tax lien,the district court order here resolved the question of whether east bay holds a claim at all.id.at.the district court order is therefore final for purposes of our jurisdiction.law offices of nicholas franke tiffany,cir where the bankruptcy court ordered funds disgorged with disposition pending further court order,appellate jurisdiction existed over the discrete issue of whether the bankruptcy court properly ordered the funds disgorged at all.
standard of review 
the district court decision on appeal from a bankruptcy court is reviewed de novo.see preblich battley,cir.thus,we independently review the bankruptcy court decision and do not give deference to the district court determinations.see id.the bankruptcy court denial of summary judgment is subject to de novo review.see alvarado walsh in re lco enters,cir.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party,we must determine whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the bankruptcy court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.see id.
a provides,in relevant part,that t here can be but one form of action for the recovery of any debt or the enforcement of any right secured by mortgage upon real property or an estate for years therein,which action shall be in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.section is both a and rule it compels the secured creditor,in a single action,to exhaust his security judicially before he may obtain a monetary deficiency judgment against the debtor.general sec,th,d,citing security pac.bank wozab,cal d,wozab.thus,when a secured creditor sues on the obligation rather than seeking foreclosure of the mortgage or deed of trust,he has made an election of remedies,electing the single remedy of a personal action,and thereby waiv ing his right to foreclose on the security or to sell the security under a power of sale.prestige i,at.
a debtor may invoke the protection of a by either raising it as an affirmative defense,compelling the creditor to first exhaust the security before being entitled to a monetary judgment on any deficiency,or invoking it as a sanction,meaning that a creditor who obtains a monetary judgment rather than foreclosing on the security will be deemed to have waived the right to pursue the security interest.see wozab,at,d at.moreover,even if the creditor does rely on the security first,his right to a judgment against the debtor for any deficiency may be limited or barred by the statutes found in,or.see walker community bank,cal d.the purposes behind these provisions are to prevent multiplicity of actions,to compel exhaustion of all security before entry of a deficiency judgment and to require the debtor to be credited with the fair market value of the secured property before being subjected to personal liability,at.
when the bankruptcy court granted in part prestige motion for summary judgment,it concluded that east bay had waived its security interest because its attachment and levying upon brassfield bank accounts constituted an action under a.see prestige i,at.prestige contends on this appeal that east bay has waived not only its security,but its underlying debt as well,due to its violation of the security first rule in a.in wozab,however,the court held that a bank violation of a resulted in a waiver of its security interest in the debtor real property,but not the forfeiture of the underlying debt.see wozab,at see also disalvo disalvo in re disalvo,holding that it was erroneous to impose the double sanction of losing both the security and the underlying obligation for a violation of a,dismissed as moot,cir.
prestige attempts to avoid the clear holding of wozab and disalvo by citing caselaw in which a was allowed to invoke a to bar an action on a promissory note because the lender reconveyed the security under an agreement with the other without the knowledge of the first for example,in pacific valley bank schwenke,d.schwenke,schwenke was allowed to rely on a to be relieved of any personal liability on a promissory note,where the creditor bank had voluntarily released the security without his knowledge or consent.see id.at see also walker,at holding that where the debtor failed to invoke the protection of,thus waiving the affirmative defense aspect of the statute,the debtor was still entitled to raise the defense,resulting in the creditor losing its security interest in the real property,d at relying on both schwenke and walker to hold that the debtor waiver of the sanction aspect of did not operate to deprive third party lienholders of the protections of.
prestige relies on this line of cases to argue that east bay lost its right to proceed against prestige on the debt because prestige did not have the opportunity to invoke as an affirmative defense in east bay action against brassfield,the.prestige case is distinguishable,however,because it had knowledge of east bay actions,even though they were taken without prestige consent.
moreover,prestige had the opportunity to invoke the sanction aspect of in bankruptcy court,resulting in east bay loss of its security interest.see prestige i,at.similar to wozab,where the court noted that the debtors accepted the bank reconveyance of the deed of trust and thus acquiesced in indeed,demanded the bank decision not to foreclose,at,prestige was the one who sought to have east bay security interest waived.finally,unlike schwenke,walker,and,where the creditor received some payment,east bay,by its violation of,has lost not only its security interest in the real property,but also the very payment that constituted the violation the line of cases therefore does not help prestige under wozab and disalvo,the double sanction of losing both the security interest and the underlying debt is not allowed.
ii.section 
prestige points out that wozab and disalvo did not involve purchase money notes and so argues that they are not controlling because they did not involve the application of.section precludes a deficiency judgment on a purchase money note and provides,in part,that no deficiency judgment shall lie in any event after a sale of real property for failure of the purchaser to complete his or her contract of sale,or under a deed of trust or mortgage given to the vendor to secure payment of the balance of the purchase price of that real property.california statutes are intended to limit strictly the right to recover deficiency judgments,that is,to recover on the debt more than the value of the security.brown,at.the bankruptcy court reasoned that applies only when there is a deficiency,defined as that part of a debt secured by mortgage not realized from sale of mortgaged property,and thus concluded that did not apply to prohibit east bay unsecured claim because there had been no foreclosure or sale.prestige ii,at quoting black law dictionary ed.
standard purchase money note 
east bay contends that does not apply because the note was not a standard purchase money note.as noted above,however,the bankruptcy court stated several times that there was no dispute that all three notes were purchase money notes,and that east bay had admitted as much see prestige i,at prestige ii,at.
spangler memel,cal d,en banc,does not aid east bay.in spangler,the court reaffirmed its ruling in brown that applies to junior lienors.see,at.the court went on to state,however,that applies automatically only to a standard purchase money transaction,which it described as one in which the purchaser is going to continue the same or similar use of the property.see,at.the court concluded that does not automatically apply where the vendor agrees to subordinate his lien to the purchaser construction loan because the purchaser does not intend to continue with the same use of the property.see,at.
contrary to east bay assertion,spangler does not hold that does not apply in the case of commercial developments.rather,spangler specifically dealt with the subordination clause situation.id.east bay asserts
