opinion of the court 
this appeal concerns the application of our recent decision in jeld wen,van brunt in re grossman,cir,establishing a new test for determining when a claim exists under the bankruptcy code,et.plaintiffs patricia wright and kevin west collectively,the plaintiffs filed a putative class action seeking damages related to defects in roofing shingles manufactured by owens corning the district court granted owens coming motion for summary judgment,determining that the plaintiffs claims were discharged under the confirmed reorganization plan the plan of owens corning and certain of its subsidiaries collectively,the debtors.specifically,the court held that,based on grossman,the plaintiffs held claims under the code,and that the published notices of the debtors chapter bankruptcy cases afforded them procedural due process.we agree that the plaintiffs held claims under the code,but,under the circumstances before us,disagree that they were afforded procedural due process.hence their claims were not discharged.we thus affirm in part and reverse in part the court judgment,and remand the case for further proceedings.
background 
the plaintiffs story presents the challenge of administering unknown future claims in bankruptcy.in late or early,wright hired a contractor,who installed shingles manufactured by owens corning on her roof.in,west similarly hired a contractor,who likewise installed shingles manufactured by owens corning on his roof.they both discovered leaks in,and determined that the shingles had cracked.each sent warranty claims to owens corning.it rejected wright claim in part and west claim in full.in november,wright filed a class action against owens corning alleging fraud,negligence,strict liability,and breach of warranty.west later was added as a named plaintiff.
meanwhile,back in october,the debtors filed their chapter bankruptcy petitions.in november,the bankruptcy court set a claims bar date of april.all claimants were required to file proofs of claim on or before that date.it also approved a bar date notice,which was published twice in the new york times,the wall street journal,and usa today,among other publications.the notice directed claimants to file proofs of claim if they held claims that arose prior to the filing of the debtors bankruptcy cases.it specifically identified claims relating to the sale,manufacture,distribution,installation marketing of products by any of the debtors,including without limitation roofing shingles 
the debtors bankruptcy proceedings resulted in the filing of the plan in june.soon after,the bankruptcy court approved notices of the confirmation hearing for the plan,including a generic notice to most unknown claimants this notice was published in the new york times,the wall street journal,and usa today,among other publications.it stated,in bold,that the plan might affect the rights of holders of claims against the debtors.
two other notices of the debtors bankruptcy proceedings also were published.in june,notice of the hearing to consider the disclosure statement was published in the new york times,the wall street journal,usa today,and the toledo blade.in november,notice of the plan date of confirmation,september,the confirmation date,was published in the same four publications.the plan provided for the discharge of all claims relating to the debtors under the bankruptcy code that arose before the confirmation date the order confirming the plan the confirmation order likewise provided that all claims arising before the confirmation date were discharged.
when the plaintiffs filed their class action,there was little dispute as to the effect of owens coming bankruptcy on the plaintiffs claims against it.based on our decision in avellino frenville in re frenville,cir,a claim under the bankruptcy code did not arise until a cause of action accrued under applicable law that is,when a claimant possessed a right to payment.in this context,the plaintiffs cause of action did not accrue until the defects in the roofing shingles manifested in,years after the confirmation date thus,at the time they filed the class action,the plaintiffs were correct to conclude that they did not hold claims under the code based on the action.but subsequently we overruled frenville with our en banc decision in grossman,in which we rejected frenville accrual test,and in its place established the rule that a claim arises when an individual is exposed to a product or other conduct giving rise to an injury,which underlies a right to payment under the bankruptcy code.at.
based on grossman,owens corning filed its motion for summary judgment,arguing that the plaintiffs claims were discharged under the plan and confirmation order.before the district court,the plaintiffs argued that grossman is limited to cases,it does not apply retroactively,and they were not afforded due process because the notices of the bankruptcy proceedings were insufficient.the court rejected these arguments,holding that the plaintiffs claims were discharged under the plan and confirmation order.
on appeal,the plaintiffs advance two arguments.first,they argue that the district court applied grossman too rigidly,creating the unworkable result that persons who did not anticipate future tort actions at the time of a bankruptcy proceeding nonetheless possess claims under the bankruptcy code that are discharged.the test set out in grossman,they assert,requires that the debtor and claimant anticipate a future tort action at the time of the bankruptcy proceedings for a claim to exist.second,they claim that the district court due process analysis fell short because it based its ruling on our precedent holding that unknown claimants generally are entitled to notification by publication.

iii.grossman and claims under the bankruptcy code 
in addressing whether the plaintiffs held claims under the bankruptcy code,we first confront the effect of their failure to advance to the district court their argument on appeal regarding grossman.before the district court,the plaintiffs contended only that grossman is limited to claims and should not apply retroactively.they advance neither argument to us.we generally follow a well established principle that it is inappropriate for an appellate court to consider a contention raised on appeal that was not initially presented to the district court.lloyd hovensa,cir.yet this principle is one of discretion rather than jurisdiction,selected risks ins.bruno,cir,and we may consider an argument raised for the first time on appeal in exceptional circumstances,such as the when the public interest so warrants.barefoot architect,bunge,cir quoting rogers larson,cir see also tri m,llc sharp,cir noting that the matter of what questions may be taken up and resolved for the first time on appeal is one left primarily to the discretion of the courts of appeals,to be exercised on the facts of individual cases quoting council of alter.pol.parties hooks,cir.the principle also is best applied to issues that are or the resolution of which on a basis not argued to the district court will surprise the parties.barefoot architect,at.
