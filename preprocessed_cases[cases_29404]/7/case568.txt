opinion of the court 
this matter arises out of the bankruptcy of two lease financing corporations,which were allegedly operated as a ponzi scheme.like all such schemes,this one collapsed,leaving numerous investors with significant losses.to operate the scheme,william shapiro,aided by others,allegedly caused the corporations to issue fraudulent debt certificates,which were then sold to individual investors.when the corporations lost any reasonable prospect of repaying the outstanding debt,they filed for bankruptcy.
a committee of creditors,appointed by a bankruptcy trustee,brought claims in the district court on behalf of the two debtor corporations alleging that had fraudulently induced the corporations to issue the debt securities,thereby deepening their insolvency and forcing them into bankruptcy.these allegedly conspired with the debtors management,who were also the debtors sole shareholders,in engineering the ponzi scheme.on these allegations,the district court concluded that it could not rule out the possibility of a cognizable injury.nevertheless,the district court held that the committee lacked standing to assert its claims against the because of the doctrine of in pari delicto.the committee appeals.
we conclude that deepening insolvency constitutes a valid cause of action under pennsylvania state law and that the committee therefore has standing to bring this action.however,evaluating the committee claims as of the commencement of the bankruptcy,we hold that because the committee,standing in the shoes of the debtors,was in pari delicto with the third parties it is suing,its claims were properly dismissed.accordingly,we will affirm the judgment of the district court.
the following allegations are taken from the amended complaint of the appellant,the official committee of unsecured creditors the committee,which was appointed by the bankruptcy trustee and which was authorized by stipulation to assert claims on behalf of the debtor corporations.the essence of the committee allegations is that the shapiro family or the shapiros,with the assistance of other defendants,including professionals operated walnut equipment leasing company,walnut,and its wholly owned subsidiary,equipment leasing corporation of america elcoa,as a ponzi scheme.
the scheme originated with walnut,which was owned by defendant walnut associates,and which,in turn,was owned by william shapiro.in,walnut was experiencing financial difficulties.as a result,walnut could not raise sufficient capital through the sale of debt securities.in a purported effort to secure more capital for walnut,the shapiro family organized elcoa as a limited purpose financing subsidiary,wholly owned by walnut,to provide a platform to sell debt securities through a new company with a clean financial picture.
according to the amended complaint,elcoa was fraudulently marketed as an independent business entity,even though its only function was to acquire leases from walnut and to sell debt certificates to raise money.in reality,walnut and elcoa were part of a network of businesses owned and operated by the shapiro family.this network included defendants welco,the law offices of william shapiro,walnut associates,financial data,and kenner collection agency.as part of the scheme to keep this network afloat,the shapiros allegedly misstated walnut and elcoa financial position in order to induce these companies to register,offer,and sell additional debt certificates to raise capital.numerous investors purchased the elcoa debt securities,and the committee claims that the shapiros funneled those monies into walnut.at the same time,the shapiros and their continued receiving salaries and fees from walnut and elcoa.moreover,the issuance of debt securities allegedly deepened the insolvency of walnut and elcoa,and put them on the path to bankruptcy.
the amended complaint states that certain professionals were essential to the shapiro family operation,namely,their counsel,defendant william shapiro,their accountant,defendant cogen sklar,cogen,and their qualified independent underwriters,defendant lafferty,lafferty,and defendant liss financial services,liss.each of these parties was responsible for professional opinions that served as prerequisites for the registration of each public offering and sale of elcoa debt securities.each allegedly conspired with the shapiro family to render opinions replete with multiple fraudulent misstatements and material omissions concerning walnut and elcoa financial statements.the parties allegedly lacked any foundation for their conclusions.
ultimately,the artifice collapsed,leading to the bankruptcies of walnut and elcoa,which became the debtor corporations or the debtors.the companies filed chapter petitions,and the debtors management,which included members of the shapiro family and their,were removed.the bankruptcy court then appointed a bankruptcy trustee.thereafter,the trustee,pursuant to section of the bankruptcy code,appointed the committee to represent the claims of unsecured creditors in connection with the bankruptcy proceedings.the committee is comprised entirely of creditors no member of the debtors former management is present.
on january,the bankruptcy court approved a stipulation between the committee and the debtors authorizing,among other things,the committee to commence and prosecute l itigation on behalf of the debtors estates.stipulation among the debtors and the official committee of unsecured creditors of the debtors authorizing the committee to commence litigation on behalf of the debtors estates,at.under the stipulation,the committee effectively acquired all the attributes of a bankruptcy trustee for purposes of this case.see in re the mediators,cir t he committee,while not a trustee in bankruptcy,is in a position analogous to a trustee because it is suing on behalf of the debtor.
on february,the committee,on behalf of the debtors estates,commenced a civil action in the district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania against the debtors officers,directors,affiliated companies the shapiro family and their network of companies,and outside professionals cogen and lafferty on the ground that the defendants,through their mismanagement of the debtors and their participation in a fraudulent scheme,had wrongfully expanded the d ebtors debt out of all proportion of their ability to repay and ultimately forced the d ebtors to seek bankruptcy protection.the committee brought claims against the shapiros and their alleged cogen and upon violations of federal securities laws,as well as common law fraud and negligent misrepresentation,mismanagement and breach of fiduciary duty,breach of contract,professional malpractice,and aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty.in addition,the committee brought claims against some shapiro,lester shapiro,adam varrenti,john orr,and philip their capacity as directors of either walnut or elcoa or both,asserting that they had mismanaged and breached their fiduciary duties to the debtors by allegedly failing to supervise and oversee the debtors affairs.
all defendants except liss,who failed to appear moved to dismiss the committee amended complaint or,alternatively,for summary judgment.on september,the district court dismissed the claims against cogen and lafferty,reasoning that,s ince it is pleaded that the d ebtors,acting through the shapiros,perpetrated the ponzi scheme the doctrine of in pari delicto bars the committee from suing these defendants for claims arising out of the fraud.official committee of unsecured creditors william shapiro,et,slip op.at,wl.at the same time,however,the district court denied the motion to dismiss as to the other defendants on the ground that in pari delicto did not preclude claims against corporate insiders.id.at.thereafter,the court severed the committee claims against cogen and lafferty,and the committee appealed the dismissal of those claims.cogen has settled with the committee,leaving lafferty as the only appellee.
the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over the case under and b.we have jurisdiction to hear the appeal under.
we have plenary review over the district court dismissal of the committee claims against lafferty.see maio aetna,cir.we apply the same standard used by the district court,namely,we must determine whether,under any reasonable reading of the pleadings,the committee may be entitled to relief,accepting as true all well pleaded allegations in the amended complaint and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the committee.nami fauver,cir.the district court order granting the motion to dismiss will be affirmed only if it appears that the committee can prove no set of facts that would entitle it to relief.conley gibson,d.
as a preliminary matter,we believe that the district court conception of the standing issue in this case was somewhat flawed.the district court stated that both cognizable injury and the doctrine of in pari delicto were elements of the standing analysis.official committee of unsecured creditors,slip op.at.this formulation,however,was incorrect.in general,s tanding consists of both a case or controversy requirement stemming from article iii,section of the constitution,and a subconstitutional prudential element.see the pitt news fisher,cir.an analysis of standing does not include an analysis of equitable defenses,such as in pari delicto.whether a party has standing to bring claims and whether a party claims are barred by an equitable defense are two separate questions,to be addressed on their own terms.see in re dublin,cir analyzing in pari delicto separately from standing.
that said,we will address both doctrines because,together,they formed the basis of the district court judgment.as a threshold requirement,standing demands our initial attention.see valley forge christian college americans united for separation of church state,d discussing the fundamental requirement of standing.citing warth seldin,d,for the proposition that standing requires a distinct and palpable injury,lafferty argues that the committee lacks standing because the debtors have not sustained a cognizable injury separate and apart from any injury sustained by investors who had purchased the debtors debt securities.as such,lafferty maintains that the committee may not bring those claims under the supreme court decision in caplin marine midland grace trust,in which the court held that a bankruptcy trustee has no standing to assert claims on behalf of an estate creditors.see,d.
lafferty made the same argument to the district court,which rejected it on the ground that,at the motion to dismiss stage,the court could not foreclose the existence of a separately cognizable injury to the debtors distinguishable from the injuries suffered by purchasers of the debtors certificates 
here,the committee is suing on behalf of the bankrupt debtor corporations walnut and elcoa not on behalf of the creditors themselves.the injury alleged is that the debtors were fraudulently induced to register,offer and sell certificates when insolvent and thus without ability to repay their obligations to investors.as a result,the debtors outstanding debt was continually expanded out of all proportion with their ability to repay,forcing them into bankruptcy.compl.
defendants cogen and lafferty maintain that the alleged ponzi scheme claims belong exclusively to the creditors,citing hirsch arthur andersen,cir.however,i believe that,w hile the most obvious damages were those sustained by the creditors who purchased certificates and securities,the possibility of a distinct and separate injury to the debtor corporations can not be eliminated at this stage.see in re plaza mortg.and fin,denying motion to dismiss trustee claims against accountants who participated in ponzi scheme and distinguishing hirsch where only allegation of injury was unpaid obligations of the debtor to the creditors.
official committee of unsecured creditors,slip.op.at,emphasis added.
we agree with the district court evaluation.with the exception of a single federal securities law claim,the committee brought only state common law claims on behalf of the debtors.according to the amended complaint,the defendants including lafferty,through their alleged fraud and participation in the scheme,injured the debtors by wrongfully expand ing the d ebtors debt out of all proportion of their ability to repay and ultimately forc ing the d ebtors to seek bankruptcy protection.in other words,the committee alleges an injury to the debtors corporate property from the fraudulent expansion of corporate debt and prolongation of corporate life.this type of injury has been referred to as deepening insolvency.see,course of study,proximate cause,foreseeability,and deepening insolvency in accountants liability litigation.
as far as the state law claims are concerned,it is clear that,to the extent pennsylvania law recognizes a cause of action for the debtors against lafferty,the committee can demonstrate the injury required for standing to sue in federal court.given lafferty arguments,the standing analysis then consists of three inquiries whether the committee is merely asserting claims belonging to the creditors,whether deepening insolvency is a valid theory giving rise to a cognizable injury under pennsylvania state law,and whether,as lafferty contends,the injury is merely illusory.
whether the committee is merely asserting claims belonging to creditors 
whether a right of action belongs to the debtor or to individual creditors is a question of state law.hirsch arthur andersen,cir.in pennsylvania,as in almost every other state,a corporation is a distinct and separate entity,irrespective of the persons who own all its stock.barium steel wiley,citations omitted accord in re erie drug.from this principle arises a distinction between the property of a corporation and that of others.for example,with respect to shareholders,
t he fact that one person owns all of the stock does not make him and the corporation one and the same person,nor does he thereby become the owner of all the property of the corporation.the shares of stock of a corporation are essentially distinct and different from the corporate property.
barium steel,at citations omitted see also meitner state real estate comm n,stating that officers of corporations are not deemed to be the owners of corporate property even to the extent that they are shareholders.
the legal fiction of corporate existence corresponds with the view that an injury to the corporate body is legally distinct from an injury to another person.thus,it is well established,under pennsylvania law,that where fraud,mismanagement,or other wrong damages a corporation assets,a shareholder does not have a direct cause of action.burdon erskine,citation omitted.rather,it is the corporate body that suffers the primary wrong and,consequently,it is the corporate body that possesses the right to sue.john motley,rumbaugh,citations omitted describing pennsylvania law.thus,an action to redress injuries to the corporation can not be maintained by an individual shareholder,but must be brought as a derivative action in the name of the corporation.id.citations omitted describing pennsylvania law see also summary of pennsylvania jurisprudence business relationships ed creditors claiming a beneficial interest in the corporation may not even maintain a derivative action.
it follows from this discussion that a corporation can suffer an injury unto itself,and any claim it asserts to recover for that injury is independent and separate from the claims of shareholders,creditors,and others.we think it is irrelevant that,in bankruptcy,a successfully prosecuted cause of action leads to an inflow of money to the estate that will immediately flow out again to repay creditors 
the assertion that this action will benefit creditors is not an admission that this action is being brought on their behalf.in a liquidation case,it is commonplace for a trustee to pursue an action on behalf of the debtor in order to obtain a recovery thereon for the estate.if the trustee is successful in the action,the recovery which he obtains becomes property of the estate and is then distributed pursuant to the scheme established by a.simply because the creditors of a n estate may be the primary or even the only beneficiaries of such a recovery does not transform the action into a suit by the creditors.otherwise,whenever a lawsuit constituted property of an estate which has insufficient funds to pay all creditors,the lawsuit would be worthless since under caplin it could not be pursued by the trustee.
in re jack greenberg,accord scholes lehmann,cir that the return would benefit the limited partners is just to say that anything that helps a corporation helps those who have claims against its assets.
in the instant case,the committee sought recovery of damage to the debtors property from deepening insolvency.we see no indication that the committee is attempting to recover for injuries to the creditors.caplin,at.holding that a trustee may not assert claims on behalf of creditors.therefore,accepting the allegations as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the committee,we conclude that the claims here belong to the debtors,rather than to the creditors.
whether deepening insolvency is a valid theory that gives rise to a cognizable injury under state law 
having established that the committee brought claims on behalf of the debtors,rather than the creditors,we must now determine whether the alleged theory of injury deepening insolvency is cognizable under pennsylvania law.neither the pennsylvania supreme court nor any intermediate pennsylvania court has directly addressed this issue.in the absence of an opinion from the state highest tribunal,we must don the soothsayer garb and predict how that court would rule if it were presented with the question.see wiley state farm fire casualty,cir.indeed,because no state or federal courts have interpreted pennsylvania law on this subject,we will rely predominantly on decisions interpreting the law of other jurisdictions and on the policy underlying pennsylvania tort law to make this prediction.see gruber,cir noting possible sources of authority for making a prediction.
drawing guidance from these authorities,we conclude that,if faced with the issue,the pennsylvania supreme court would determine that deepening insolvency may give rise to a cognizable injury.first and foremost,the theory is essentially sound.under federal bankruptcy law,insolvency is a financial condition in which a corporation debts exceed the fair market value of its assets.even when a corporation is insolvent,its corporate property may have value.the fraudulent and concealed incurrence of debt can damage that value in several ways.for example,to the extent that bankruptcy is not already a certainty,the incurrence of debt can force an insolvent corporation into bankruptcy,thus inflicting legal and administrative costs on the corporation.see richard brealey stewart myers,principles of corporate finance ed.b y issuing risky debt,a corporation give s lawyers and the court system a claim on the firm if it defaults.when brought on by unwieldy debt,bankruptcy also creates operational limitations which hurt a corporation ability to run its business in a profitable manner.see id.at.aside from causing actual bankruptcy,deepening insolvency can undermine a corporation relationships with its customers,suppliers,and employees.the very threat of bankruptcy,brought about through fraudulent debt,can shake the confidence of parties dealing with the corporation,calling into question its ability to perform,thereby damaging the corporation assets,the value of which often depends on the performance of other parties.see michael knoll,taxing prometheus how the corporate interest deduction discourages innovation and,vill.in addition,prolonging an insolvent corporation life through bad debt may simply cause the dissipation of corporate assets.
these harms can be averted,and the value within an insolvent corporation salvaged,if the corporation is dissolved in a timely manner,rather than kept afloat with spurious debt.as the seventh circuit explained in schacht brown 
c ases that oppose deepening insolvency rest upon a seriously flawed assumption,that the fraudulent prolongation of a corporation life beyond insolvency is automatically to be considered a benefit to the corporation interests.this premise collides with common sense,for the corporate body is ineluctably damaged by the deepening of its insolvency,through increased exposure to creditor liability.indeed,in most cases,it would be crucial that the insolvency of the corporation be disclosed,so that shareholders may exercise their right to dissolve the corporation in order to cut their losses.thus,acceptance of a rule which would bar a corporation from recovering damages due to the hiding of information concerning its insolvency would create perverse incentives for officers and directors to conceal the true financial condition of the corporation from the corporate body as long as possible.
cir citations omitted emphasis added.
growing acceptance of the deepening insolvency theory confirms its soundness.in recent years,a number of federal courts have held that deepening insolvency may give rise to a cognizable injury to corporate debtors.see,id.applying illinois law and holding that,where a debtor corporation was fraudulently continued in business past the point of insolvency,the liquidator had standing to maintain a civil action under racketeering law hannover of america beckner,applying louisiana law and stating that a corporation can suffer injury from fraudulently extended life,dissipation of assets,or increased insolvency allard arthur andersen,applying new york law and stating that,as to suit brought by bankruptcy trustee,b ecause courts have permitted recovery under the deepening insolvency theory,defendant is not entitled to summary judgment as to whatever portion of the claim for relief represents damages flowing from indebtedness to trade creditors in re gouiran holdings,applying new york law,and refusing to dismiss claims brought by a creditors committee because it was possible that,under some set of facts two years of negligently prepared financial statements could have been a substantial cause of the debtor incurring unmanageable debt and filing for bankruptcy protection feltman prudential bache securities,stating that an artificial and fraudulently prolonged life and consequent dissipation of assets constitutes a recognized injury for which a corporation can sue under certain conditions,but concluding that there was no injury on the facts.some state courts have also recognized the deepening insolvency theory.see,herbert post sidney bitterman.div.dep t applying new york law and allowing a malpractice claim for failing to detect embezzlement that weakened a company,which already was operating at a loss,thereby causing default on loans and forcing liquidation corcoran frank hall.div.dep t applying new york law and allowing claims for causing a company to assume additional risks and thereby increase the extent of its exposure to creditors.
significantly,one of the most venerable principles in pennsylvania jurisprudence,and in most common law jurisdictions for that matter,is that,where there is an injury,the law provides a remedy.see pennsylvania law encyclopedia,torts,at for every legal wrong there must be a correlative legal right.citation omitted.thus,an identifiable and compensable injury is essential to the existence of tort liability,schweitzer consolidated rail,cir,but once an injury has occurred,tort law attempts to place the injured party in the same position he occupied before the injury,hahn atlantic richfield,cir construing pennsylvania tort policy.similarly,where a contractual breach occurs,contract law seeks to give to the nonbreaching party the benefit of his or her bargain,to put him or her in the position he or she would have been in had there been no breach.summary of pennsylvania jurisprudence torts ed.thus,where deepening insolvency causes damage to corporate property,we believe that the pennsylvania supreme court would provide a remedy by recognizing a cause of action for that injury.
lafferty challenges the strong rationales for recognizing an injury here,citing a few cases that it claims reject deepening insolvency.in our view,the majority of these cases do not address deepening insolvency,but rather,simply apply the supreme court holding in caplin that a bankruptcy trustee has no standing to assert claims on behalf of creditors.see,hirsch arthur andersen,cir hutton hadley,cir williams california bank,cir.these decisions are not relevant to the present case because,as we explained earlier,the committee is proceeding on behalf of the debtors,not the creditors.moreover,to the extent that either the cases cited by lafferty or other cases suggest that a corporation may never sue to recover damages resulting from the fraudulent prolongation of its life past solvency,we believe,under the same analysis conducted by the seventh circuit in schacht,that pennsylvania courts would reject them.
we pause here to consider the century case of patterson franklin,an arguably applicable decision of the pennsylvania supreme court.in patterson,an assignee standing in the shoes of an insolvent corporation brought suit against the incorporators,claiming that they had allegedly made false representations in the statement of incorporation.id.at.apparently,the false representations had allowed the corporation to contract more debts.id.on these allegations,the pennsylvania supreme court affirmed the dismissal of the assignee claims,reasoning that,because the assignee had alleged that the corporation had benefitted from the representations,there was no viable cause of action.id.
in our view,patterson is not controlling here.the patterson court never expressly considered the deepening insolvency theory,as the opinion does not indicate that the assignee presented any version of that argument to the court.in fact,it seems that the assignee in patterson had not even alleged an injury to the corporation at all 
the fraud was perpetrated for its benefit.it was a gainer,not a loser because of it.it was given a considerable credit by the statement to which,as it is alleged,it had no claim whatever.
id.emphasis added.thus,given the allegations in the case,it was perfectly reasonable for the court in patterson to affirm the dismissal.see also kinter connolly,rejecting receiver claim on behalf of the corporation against the directors for fraudulent statements that induced parties to do business with the corporation because there was no averment that any act or omission of those of the defendants who demur caused loss or injury to the corporation.
our reading of patterson is informed in part by its age.in the years between that decision and the present,the business practices of corporations in the united states have changed quite dramatically.likewise,society understanding of corporate theory has grown.see william bratton,the new economic theory of the firm critical perspectives from history,stan,describing the evolution of corporations over the last two centuries see also henry hansmann reinier kraakman,the end of history for corporate law,geo,describing the history of models for corporate structure and governance.therefore,we decline to draw any broad principle from patterson,a decision which did not directly address deepening insolvency.
in sum,we believe that the soundness of the theory,its growing acceptance among courts,and the remedial theme in pennsylvania law would persuade the pennsylvania supreme court to recognize deepening insolvency as giving rise to a cognizable injury in the proper circumstances.we now apply this conclusion to the allegations presented in this case.
whether,as lafferty contends,the injury is merely illusory 
at oral argument,lafferty observed that,under the ponzi scheme alleged in the committee amended complaint,any fraudulent debt certificates issued by the debtors would have created a capital flow into the debtors,allowing them to pay the perpetrators of the fraud,the shapiros,who were at the top of the pyramid.stated in slightly different terms,we understand lafferty to be saying that any injury to the debtors caused by deepening insolvency might be considered illusory because that injury passed directly to the sole shareholders and wrongdoers,the shapiro family.see,feltman,at accepting deepening insolvency but concluding that,because a corporation was fictitious,any injury to it was illusory.as we discussed earlier,so long as the corporate form is respected,the alleged deepening insolvency injury to the property of the debtors can not be regarded as equivalent to the shapiro family shareholder interest.see barium steel,at corporate property is distinct from shareholder property john motley,at causes of action for damage to corporate property belong to the corporation.thus,we think that lafferty is essentially asking us to disregard the corporate existence of walnut,whose status separates the debtors property,and hence,the alleged injury from the shapiro family shareholder interest 
as a result,lafferty argument implicitly invokes the piercing the corporate veil doctrine,which treats a corporation and its shareholders as identical for purposes of suit,thereby imposing personal liability on shareholders.see kiehl action.we doubt that the pennsylvania supreme court would apply any form of the doctrine here.the present issue,after all,involves the defendant lafferty invoking the doctrine to demonstrate the lack of injury to the debtors,whereas in the standard scenario the plaintiff invokes the piercing the corporate veil doctrine to impose liability on shareholders.even assuming,for argument sake,that the pennsylvania supreme court would consider the merits of the corporate veil doctrine here,we think that,given the pleadings,the court would not disregard walnut corporate form and would not find the alleged injury to the debtors to be illusory.
in pennsylvania,courts will disregard the corporate entity only in limited circumstances when the form is used to defeat public convenience,justify wrong,protect fraud or defend crime.kiehl,at.this is a stringent inquiry.c ourt s must start from the general rule that the corporate entity should be recognized and upheld,unless specific,unusual circumstances call for an exception care should be taken on all occasions to avoid making the entire theory of the corporate entity useless.wedner unemployment compensation bd.of review,quoting zubik zubik,cir internal quotations omitted.
the narrow circumstances in which pennsylvania courts will disregard the corporate form are demonstrated by the number of cases,outside traditional attempts to impose liability on shareholders,that reject such arguments.see,kiehl,at refusing to disregard the corporate form between parents and subsidiaries when applying workmen compensation laws wedner,at reversing the determination of a board of unemployment compensation to ignore the corporate form to deny benefits to an employee shareholder shared communications servs.of jfk boulevard,bell atlantic,refusing,on a common law conspiracy claim,to ignore the legal corporate form between parents and wholly owned subsidiaries.
we conclude,on the allegations presented here,that the circumstances for ignoring walnut corporate form do not exist with certainty.although the committee alleged in the amended complaint that the shapiro family had made misrepresentations through walnut,it did not allege that walnut was a fictional or sham corporation.feltman,at concluding that a deepening insolvency injury was illusory because the debtor corporations were fictitious with no corporate identity separate from their sole shareholder.the committee merely identified walnut as an equipment leasing company,with no indication that walnut business activities,apart from its debt certificates,were anything but legitimate and real.moreover,the record does not support a finding that corporate formalities were ignored.although the shapiros used walnut to commit a fraud,the committee has not alleged that walnut lacked a corporate identity separate from the shapiro family.
thus,accepting all of the committee allegations as true and reading them in the light most favorable to the committee,we can not state with certainty that walnut corporate existence should be disregarded such that any deepening insolvency injury was illusory.see weston commw.of pennsylvania,cir we will affirm a dismissal only if it appears certain that a plaintiff will be unable to support his claim.we therefore agree with the district court that the possibility of a distinct and separate injury to the debtors can not be ruled out at the motion to dismiss stage.
up until this point in our analysis of standing,we have spoken only in terms of the committee state law claims under pennsylvania law.with regard to the committee single federal securities claim,we are confident that the principles we have elucidated are so well accepted that the analysis of that claim is the same.that is,insofar as alleged securities misrepresentations induced the debtors to incur excessive debt which damaged corporate property,we think that the claim belongs to the debtors,not to the creditors.caplin,at.furthermore,for the reasons noted earlier,we believe deepening insolvency is generally a valid theory for federal law claims.see schacht,at.
thus,because the committee properly asserts the claims of the debtors,rather than the creditors,and because we recognize deepening insolvency as a valid theory giving rise to a claim under pennsylvania law,we hold that the district court did not err in concluding that the committee had standing to bring the debtors claims against lafferty.
having determined that the committee has standing to bring the debtors claims,we now address lafferty assertion of the doctrine of in pari delicto as an affirmative defense against those claims.the doctrine of in pari delicto provides that a plaintiff may not assert a claim against a defendant if the plaintiff bears fault for the claim.see feld and sons,pechner,dorfman,wolfee,rounick and cabot,see also american trade partners,international importing enterprises,under the in pari delicto doctrine,a party is barred from recovering damages if his losses are substantially caused by activities the law forbade him to engage in.under pennsylvania law as well as federal law,in pari delicto is a doctrine of equity.see peyton margiotti,reynolds boland.more generally,the broad idea captured by the doctrine may involve a number of different defenses,depending on whether a contract,tort,or other claim is asserted.we nevertheless can legitimately speak of one doctrine,in pari delicto,across the different claims because the analysis under the various causes of action will typically be the same.judge posner made this point in cenco,seidman seidman 
the challenged jury instructions relate to the question whether seidman was entitled to use the wrongdoing of cenco managers as a defense against the charges of breach of contract,negligence,and fraud which when committed by auditors,are a single form of wrongdoing under different names because these theories of auditors misconduct are so alike,the defenses based on misconduct of the audited firm or its employees are also alike,though verbalized differently.a breach of contract is excused if the promisee hindrance or failure to cooperate prevented the promisor from performing the contract.the corresponding defense in the case of negligence is,of course,contributory negligence and,in the fraud context,a participant in a fraud can not also be a victim entitled to recover damages,for he can not have relied on the truth of the fraudulent representations,and such reliance is an essential element in a case of fraud.
cir citation omitted.
whether the in pari delicto doctrine applies here depends on whether the shapiro family conduct can be imputed to the debtors and hence to the committee,which,under bankruptcy law,stands in the shoes of the debtors.imputation refers to the attribution of one person wrongdoing to another person.for example,in the present case,the rules of imputation determine whether or not the debtors will be deemed to have participated in wrongdoing because of the acts of the debtors management.if wrongdoing is imputed,then the in pari delicto doctrine comes into play and bars a suit.
in the present case,the district court imputed the shapiro family wrongdoing to the debtors and held that the committee,standing in the shoes of the debtors,was barred from bringing claims under the doctrine of in pari delicto.on appeal,the committee argues that the district court erred in discounting the committee status as an innocent successor when applying the in pari delicto defense.for support,the committee relies primarily on in re jack greenberg.the crux of its argument is that,under pennsylvania law,courts may disallow the in pari delicto defense when its invocation would produce an inequitable result.see id.at.according to the committee,the fact of bankruptcy and the resulting removal of the shapiro family and their from management prevents bad actors from benefitting from a recovery to the debtors.because only innocent creditors would now benefit from this suit,the committee argues that the imputation of the shapiro family wrongdoing to the debtors and the consequent application of the in pari delicto doctrine are unwarranted.
the committee argument requires us to resolve two related questions.first,we must decide whether,when evaluating a claim brought by a bankruptcy trustee,a court of law may consider events that may affect an equitable defense,such as in pari delicto.second,we must decide whether,in light of our answer to the first question,the shapiro family conduct should in fact be imputed to the debtors such that the doctrine of in pari delicto bars the committee claims.
the first question is whether events may be considered when evaluating a claim in bankruptcy.at the outset,we note that the application of the in pari delicto doctrine is affected by the rules governing bankruptcies.the bankruptcy in this case the the representative of the bankruptcy estate.see a in re mediators,cir suggesting that,when a committee bring claims on behalf of a debtor,it takes on the characteristics of a trustee.therefore,in this case,the bankruptcy laws authorize the committee to commence and prosecute any action or proceeding in behalf of the estate before any tribunal.fed.such actions fall into two categories those brought by the trustee as successor to the debtor interest included in the estate under section,and those brought under one or more of the trustee avoiding powers.collier on bankruptcy ed.the trustee avoiding powers are not implicated here,as they relate to the trustee power to resist transfers of property.
instead,the committee brings claims against lafferty as a successor to walnut and elcoa interest.section covers such claims.under section,the bankruptcy estate includes all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of bankruptcy.a emphasis added see also trueger,cir.these legal and equitable interests include causes of action.collier on bankruptcy accord,at.given these provisions,we have held that in actions brought by the trustee as successor to the debtor interest under section,the trustee stands in the shoes of the debtor and can only assert those causes of action possessed by the debtor.conversely,t he trustee is,of course,subject to the same defenses as could have been asserted by the defendant had the action been instituted by the debtor.hays merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir quoting collier on bankruptcy.
as these authorities demonstrate,the explicit language of section directs courts to evaluate defenses as they existed at the commencement of the bankruptcy.this direction is entirely consistent with the legislative history.the senate report to the bankruptcy reform act of made clear that the appropriate frame of reference for section is the state of the debtor as of the commencement of the bankruptcy 
though section will include choses in action and claims by the debtor against others,it is not intended to expand the debtor rights against others more than they exist at the commencement of the case.for example,if the debtor has a claim that is barred at the time of the commencement of the case by the statute of limitations,then the trustee would not be able to pursue that claim,because he too would be barred.he could take no greater rights than the debtor himself had.

the answer to our first question should now be apparent.the committee asks us to consider events,namely,the removal of the shapiro family and their from the debtors management,as well as the committee status as an innocent successor,when weighing the equities of the in pari delicto defense.the plain language of section,however,prevents courts from taking into account events that occur after the commencement of the bankruptcy case.as a result,we must evaluate the in pari delicto defense without regard to whether the committee is an innocent successor.see bank of marin england,d the trustee succeeds only to such rights as the bankrupt possessed and the trustee is subject to all claims and defenses which might have been asserted against the bankruptcy but for the filing of the petition.integrated solutions,serv.support specialties,cir stating that it is a fundamental principle that the estate succeeds only to the nature and the rights of the property interest that the debtor possessed.
we thus agree with the analysis of the tenth circuit in in re,cir,which employed section in applying the in pari delicto doctrine to bar a bankruptcy trustee suit against a.in,an individual ran a ponzi scheme through a solely owned corporation and three limited partnerships.after the scheme collapsed,the corporation and the partnerships went into bankruptcy.a bankruptcy trustee was appointed over the four entities,and the trustee subsequently brought suit on behalf of the debtors against investors who had profited from the ponzi scheme.see id.at.the district court applied the in pari delicto defense and dismissed the suit.see id.
the trustee argued before the tenth circuit,as the committee does here,that his status as a bankruptcy trustee prevented the application of the in pari delicto defense.in support,he cited scholes lehmann,a case in which the seventh circuit refused to apply the defense to bar a receiver from bringing fraudulent conveyance actions on behalf of the debtor corporations against and others who had received funds from the corporations.see at.the scholes court holding rested on the rationale that the appointment of the innocent receiver had removed the wrongdoer from the scene and changed the equities such that the in pari delicto doctrine los t its sting.id.citations omitted.
the tenth circuit rejected the trustee argument and held that the trustee could not bring suit against the investors because one who has himself participated in a violation of law can not be permitted to assert any right founded upon the illegal transaction,at internal quotations and citations omitted.it reasoned that,while the seventh circuit reasoning in scholes might be preferable from a public policy perspective,it did not comport with the plain language of section,which explicitly provided that the bankruptcy estate is comprised of all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.id.at.the court explained the significance of that language 
we emphasize that a limits estate property to the debtor interests as of the commencement of the case.this phrase places both temporal and qualitative limitations on the reach of the bankruptcy estate.in a temporal sense,it establishes a date after which property acquired by the debtor will normally not become property of the bankruptcy estate.in a qualitative sense,the phrase establishes the estate rights as no stronger than they were when actually held by the debtor.congress intended the trustee to stand in the shoes of the debtor and take no greater rights than the debtor himself had.therefore,to the extent that the trustee must rely on for his standing in this case,he may not use his status as trustee to insulate the partnership from wrongdoing 
neither the text of the bankruptcy code nor its legislative history suggests any exceptions to the principle that the strength of an estate cause of action is measured by how it stood as of commencement of the case.
id.at citations omitted.
we note that the tenth circuit is not alone.both the second and sixth circuits have also applied the in pari delicto doctrine to bar claims of a bankruptcy trustee,standing in the shoes of a debtor,against,without regard to the trustee status as an innocent successor.see dublin,at applying ohio law hirsch arthur andersen,cir applying connecticut law shearson lehman hutton,wagoner,cir applying new york law see also the mediators,at summarizing hirsch and wagoner and applying new york law to find that a bankruptcy trustee has no standing to assert claims against for cooperating in the very misconduct that the debtor had initiated.our research reveals no courts that hold otherwise in the bankruptcy context.
we certainly acknowledge that,in the receivership context,several courts have declined to apply in pari delicto to bar the receiver from asserting the claims of an insolvent corporation on the ground that application of the doctrine to an innocent successor would be inequitable.these courts have thought it proper to consider events arising after a corporation enters into receivership.see,fdic myers,cir while a party may itself be denied a right or defense on account of its misdeeds,there is little reason to impose the same punishment on an innocent entity that steps into the party shoes pursuant to court order or operation of law.scholes,at stating that the defense of in pari delicto loses its sting when the person who is in pari delicto is eliminated.these cases are easily distinguishable,however unlike bankruptcy trustees,receivers are not subject to the limits of section.
the second question we must answer is whether,viewing the committee as if it had brought its claims as of the commencement of the bankruptcy,as section commands,the shapiro family conduct should,in fact,be imputed to the debtors such that the doctrine of in pari delicto bars the committee claims.while bankruptcy law mandates that the trustee step into the shoes of the debtor when asserting causes of action,state law generally provides the substantive law governing imputation for state law claims.see myers fdic,d holding,in the fdic receivership context,that,without an explicit federal statutory provision or special federal interest,state law governs the imputation of knowledge to corporate victims of alleged negligence.
under the law of imputation,courts impute the fraud of an officer to a corporation when the officer commits the fraud in the course of his employment,and for the benefit of the corporation.see waslow grant thornton in re jack greenberg,citing rochez,rhoades,cir,and deriving a federal rule that is consistent with pennsylvania law see also bank of shamokin waynesboro knitting,describing pennsylvania agency law.
the allegations in the amended complaint leave no doubt that the first part of the imputation test is fraud allegedly perpetrated by the shapiro family took place in the course of their employment for the debtors.as the district court explained 
william shapiro is the sole shareholder of walnut associates,inc,which in turn owns debtor walnut,which owns debtor elcoa.william shapiro is president and a director of the debtors.kenneth shapiro is debtors and a director.defendants walnut associates,william shapiro,welco,financial data,and kenner collection agency,which are owned by william shapiro,are alleged to have played a role in the fraudulent certificate offerings.the debtor corporations are alleged to have been part of the shapiro,owned and controlled by the shapiros.

the second part of the imputation fraudulent conduct was perpetrated for the benefit of the debtor often analyzed under the adverse interest exception.under this exception,fraudulent conduct will not be imputed if the officer interests were adverse to the corporat
