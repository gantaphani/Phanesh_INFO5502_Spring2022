section a a of provides that a debtor chapter plan must provide for the full payment of all priority claims under unless the claim is a claim owed to a governmental unit that arises as a result of the sale of any farm asset used in the debtor farming operation,in which case the claim shall be treated as an unsecured claim that is not entitled to priority under section in these consolidated appeals,the government challenges the applicability of to income taxes arising out of sales of the property of the debtors,anders knudsen and cynthia knudsen and james daniel schilke.in and,the government asserts that a a is inapplicable to the debtors postpetition sale of farm assets.in,the government contends that the knudsens prepetition sale of their slaughter hogs does not constitute a sale of a farm asset used in the debtor farming operation under a a and the proper method for allocating the knudsens tax liability between the tax arising out of the transactions within the scope of a a and the tax arising from those transactions outside of its scope is the proration method as opposed to the marginal method.
for the reasons discussed below,we hold a chapter debtor may treat postpetition income taxes imposed on the debtor income earned during the pendency of the case as administrative expenses under the knudsens prepetition sale of their slaughter hogs in constitutes the sale of a farm asset used in the debtor farming operation under a a and the marginal method is the correct method to determine the allocation of taxes between priority and claims under a a.
accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the bankruptcy in.
in,we affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the bankruptcy court.first,we reverse the part of the bankruptcy court decision holding that the knudsens prepetition sale of their slaughter hogs in is not entitled to the benefit of a a.second,we reverse the part of the bankruptcy court decision holding that the proration method is the correct method to determine the allocation of taxes between priority and claims,as opposed to the marginal method.finally,we affirm the part of the bankruptcy court decision holding that a chapter debtor may treat postpetition income taxes imposed on the debtor income earned during the pendency of the case as administrative expenses under.we remand to the bankruptcy court with instructions to confirm the knudsens fifth amended and substituted plan of reorganization in accordance with this opinion.
background 
the knudsens,owners of a iowa farm,filed a voluntary bankruptcy petition under chapter of the bankruptcy code.the knudsens farming enterprise includes raising hogs.in the early,the knudsens enlarged their hog operation,increasing their sow herd to.they also built a farrowing house and started selling feeder pigs.although the knudsens initially hired others to fatten their hogs,they eventually built two finishing barns,the first in and the second in.by,the knudsens were operating a hog operation and were selling their own hogs as their main source of income.
in,two swine disease outbreaks stifled the growth and profitability of the knudsens hog operation.between and,the knudsens and their lender,ansgar state bank,became concerned about the financial future of the knudsens farm.ansgar became less willing to lend money to finance the knudsens farm business.as a result,the knudsens considered reorganizing their farming operation.in december,the knudsens entered into two contracts to raise hogs for squealers pork,spi.under the contract terms,spi would provide baby pigs to the knudsens,and the knudsens would raise the pigs to market weight.because of its fears of swine disease,spi required the knudsens to completely dispose of their own swine before they started raising hogs for spi.consequently,the knudsens,in,sold the last of their breeding sows and all of their slaughter hogs.they used the hog sale proceeds to make a payment on a loan from ansgar,which was secured by the hogs.additionally,because of the change in their hog operation,the knudsens sold a livestock trailer and their interest in some farrowing equipment.the knudsens also ended their grain farming operation and leased their acres for cash rent of per year.
in their joint federal income tax return,the knudsens reported farm income of for sales of livestock,produce,grains,and other products.this figure included the sale of the slaughter hogs.the knudsens reported net farm income of for,the sale of their breeding sows as a capital gain of,and proceeds of the sale of the farrowing equipment and the livestock trailer as an ordinary gain of.as shown on their initial return,the knudsens total tax for was.
thereafter,the knudsens filed an amended federal income tax return,showing their federal tax to be.the knudsens taxes increased because they revoked an election to treat certain hog building remodeling costs as expenses rather than to depreciate the costs over time.this amendment decreased farm expenses for,thus increasing the knudsens income.the knudsens filed for bankruptcy shortly after submitting their amended tax return.
in their reorganization plan,the knudsens contended that income tax relating to the sale of the slaughter hogs qualified for treatment as an unsecured claim pursuant to a a.as a result,the knudsens asserted that of their total tax liability of should be classified as an unsecured claim.the plan further proposed funding the reorganization by selling certain machinery and equipment,as well as acres of the farm.as with the sale of the slaughter hogs,the knudsens asserted that the taxes arising from these postpetition sales would qualify for treatment as an unsecured claim under a a.
the internal revenue service irs objected to the knudsens proposed plan,challenging,among other things,the knudsens proposed treatment of federal taxes attributable to the sale of the slaughter hogs and the postpetition sale of the machinery and land.according to the irs,a a did not apply to taxes arising out of the sale of the slaughter hogs because slaughter hogs did not qualify as a farm asset used in the debtor farming operation.the irs contended that the slaughter hogs were not an asset used in a farming operation but rather were the end product produced by the farming operation.see a a.the irs also opposed the knudsens proposed method for allocating their tax liability between unsecured and priority tax claims,contending that the knudsens method took an incorrect and unwarranted advantage of lower tax rates.finally,the irs maintained that a a did not apply to the knudsens postpetition sale of the machinery and land,arguing that a a restricted its benefits to claims that qualified for priority treatment under,which sets forth certain claims and expenses entitled to priority,and that the postpetition taxes did not qualify for any of enumerated categories.
the bankruptcy court denied confirmation of the knudsens plan.first,the bankruptcy court held that the beneficial tax treatment for farms under a a did not apply to the knudsens prepetition sale of the slaughter hogs.according to the court,the phrase used in the debtor farming operation in a a should be accorded the same meaning and treatment as the phrase property used in the trade or business in b of the internal revenue code irc.in re knudsen,internal quotations omitted.section b provides capital gain treatment for taxes arising from the sale of breeding livestock.id.at.the court concluded that a a,like,is limited to capital assets.id.at.
second,as to the allocation of taxes,the bankruptcy court applied the irs proration method to determine the amount of tax that qualifies for beneficial treatment under a a instead of the knudsens marginal method.the court found 
that the proration method is the better method for determining what amount of tax qualifies for beneficial treatment under a a and what does not.it recognizes all income,deductions,exemptions,and credits in arriving at a tax and allocates according to the percentage of each type of income.it divides the actual tax without regard to which sales produced the last dollar of income.
third,as to the applicability of a a to postpetition transactions,the bankruptcy court held that the 
knudsens may pay through the estate,as administrative expenses,income taxes incurred by them during the pendency of the case,that they may treat a portion of such taxes as nonpriority unsecured claims under the plan pursuant to a a and that such nonpriority unsecured taxes incurred postpetition may be discharged with prepetition unsecured debts after completion of the plan.
ultimately,the bankruptcy court rejected confirmation of the knudsens proposed plan because its rulings against certain of the knudsens positions make the plan as proposed unconfirmable.id.
both parties appealed to the district court.the knudsens argued that the bankruptcy court erred by excluding their prepetition sale of slaughter hogs in from the benefit provided by a a and applying the irs proration method to determine the amount of tax that qualifies for beneficial treatment under a a instead of their marginal method.the irs challenged the bankruptcy court ruling on the applicability of a a to postpetition sales of assets.
the district court affirmed in part and reversed in part the bankruptcy court,remanding to the bankruptcy court with instructions to confirm the knudsens plan.in re knudsen.first,the district court held that the slaughter hogs that the knudsens sold in order to convert their hog operation into a reorganized custom operation qualified as farm assets used in the knudsens farming operation under a a.id.at internal quotations omitted.second,it determined that 
the marginal method is the correct method to determine the allocation of taxes between priority and claims.to apply that method,the knudsens should calculate a return for all income,then a second pro forma tax return removing all qualifying sales income,so that income would be taxed at lower marginal tax rates,and the taxes shown on the pro forma return would represent the portion of the tax claim entitled to priority status,while the difference between the taxes shown on the return for all income and the taxes shown on the pro forma return would represent the unsecured portion of the tax claim.the bankruptcy court erred,as a matter of law,in choosing the proration method instead.
id.at.finally,the court affirm ed the bankruptcy court conclusion that a chapter debtor may treat income taxes imposed on the debtor income earned during the pendency of the case as administrative expenses under and that the plan may propose payment of such expenses by the estate.id.at.according to the court,such taxes were incurred by the estate within the meaning of b b i,despite the fact that a chapter estate is not a separate taxable entity,because incurred by the estate refers to when tax liability is incurred rather than to the existence of an estate as a separate taxable entity.id.at.
schilke filed a voluntary bankruptcy petition under chapter of the bankruptcy code.thereafter,he submitted his chapter plan to the bankruptcy court.the proposed plan provided,inter alia,that schilke would sell certain farm estate and breeding livestock.schilke estimated that his taxable income for tax year from the sale of these assets would be and that his estimated capital gains taxes would be.the proposed plan treated the capital gains taxes as follows 
class v internal revenue service and nebraska department of revenue any income tax resulting from the sale of real estate and livestock as provided in this plan or any amendments or modifications shall be treated as an unsecured debt without priority under usc as provided in usc a a.
the government objected to this provision of the proposed plan,asserting that schilke tax liabilities,whether or,are not,and can not be,administrative expenses of the bankruptcy estate,should not be included in debtor plan,and can not be discharged.in its supporting brief,the government argued that the benefits of a a applied only to priority claims under and that,in schilke case,the taxes could only receive priority under that section if they constituted administrative expenses pursuant to b under b b i,a tax must be incurred by the estate to be an administrative expense.according to the government,the taxes at issue did not meet this requirement because a chapter bankruptcy estate is not a separate taxable entity.
the bankruptcy court overruled the government objection,holding that 
even though a chapter bankruptcy estate is not a separate taxable entity,the estate does exist nonetheless.the estate consists of all property of the debtor on the date of filing,all property that the debtor acquires after commencement of the case,and all earnings from services performed by the debtor after commencement of the case.a.debtor filed a motion to sell real estate and personal property free and clear of liens fil,which was granted fil.the taxes at issue are created by the sale of property of the estate by debtor.i do not believe that the language of b b regarding any tax incurred by the estate was intended to apply only to those situations where the estate itself is a separate taxable entity.in fact,incurred by the estate has been interpreted to simply mean incurred.dep t of revenue shoe,cir stating t he bankruptcy court and the district court both held that while the entire corporate tax was incurred by the estate.here,there clearly is an estate,the tax is the result of a sale of property of the estate,and debtor happens to be liable for that tax.
in re schilke.
the government appealed to the district court,challenging the bankruptcy court confirmation of schilke chapter plan.the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court determination that taxes arising from the postpetition sale of real estate and livestock may be attributed to the estate and not to the debtor,meaning that the resulting claim is an unsecured claim under a a.
ii.discussion 
in and,the government asserts that a a is inapplicable to both the knudsens and schilke postpetition sale of farm assets.additionally,in,the government contends that the knudsens prepetition sale of their slaughter hogs does not constitute a sale of a farm asset used in the debtor farming operation under a a and the proper method for allocating the knudsens tax liability between the tax arising out of the transactions within the scope of a a and the tax arising from those transactions outside of its scope is the proration method.

applicability of a a to postpetition transactions 
on appeal,the government asserts,with respect to both the knudsens and schilke,that a a does not apply to the postpetition sale of farm assets.first,the government argues that chapter framework establishes that plans under chapter are binding only upon prepetition creditors,not holders of postpetition claims.if true,then a does not apply to any postpetition claim.according to the government,pursuant to a,the provisions of chapter are only binding on creditors.in turn,a creditor is defined as an entity that has a claim against the debtor that arose at the time of or before the order for relief concerning the debtor.a emphasis added.as a result,a chapter plan can not bind holders of postpetition claims because they are not creditors,they are not holders of prepetition claims.
second,the government argues that the bankruptcy code waiver of sovereign immunity in limits the extent to which a plan may bind the government.according to the government,pursuant to a,it has waived its sovereign immunity with regard to,inter alia,and therefore has agreed to be paid on its prepetition claims pursuant to a confirmed chapter plan.but the government contends that a does not contain a waiver of sovereign immunity as to,except to the extent that its provisions regarding the contents of a plan can bind the government as a creditor under a.therefore,the government concludes that,without an express waiver of sovereign immunity for purposes of postpetition claims,a chapter plan that provides for treatment of a postpetition claim of the government can not bind the government.
third,the government asserts that even if the statutory framework did not prohibit the application of a a to postpetition claims,income tax claims arising from postpetition asset sales would not constitute an administrative expense under b b i.the government notes that a a applies to claims otherwise entitled to priority under in turn,a provides priority for administrative expenses under b.but,according to the government,postpetition sales do not qualify as administrative expenses under b b i because this provision restricts its applicability to taxes incurred by the estate in a chapter case,the only taxable entity is the debtor,meaning that taxes can not be incurred by the estate.
whether the framework of chapter dictates that a a can not apply to postpetition claims 
we will first consider the government argument that the statutory framework of chapter restricts the claims that are eligible for the benefits of a a to prepetition claims.
a district court in kansas recently substantially similar argument to the one advanced by the government in the present case.see dawes nazar in re dawes,wl,slip op.in dawes,the government asserted that a a does not apply to postpetition claims,arguing,inter alia,that chapter plans deal only with the treatment of claims and are only binding upon creditors holding such claims.id.at.the government contended that its view was confirmed by reading sections b,and a together.id.in rejecting the government argument that a a did not apply to it because it was not a creditor,the district court stated 
the united states argues that chapter plans are only binding upon creditors,not upon holders of claims,and it says the binding effect of the plan can extend no further upon the united states.it points out that a creditor is defined as an entity that has a claim against the debtor that arose at the time of or before the order for relief concerning the debtor an entity that has a claim against the estate of a kind specified in section d,f,g,h or i of this title or an entity that has a community claim.
section a a does not mention creditors.rather,the statute specifically applies to claim s owed to a government unit.a a.the term claim is defined as a right to payment,whether or not such right is reduced to judgment,liquidated,unliquidated,fixed,contingent,matured,unmatured,disputed,undisputed,legal,equitable,secured,or unsecured.a.in the case at hand,the irs,a government unit,has a right to payment for capital gain taxes arising from the sale of the debtors farm property.it thus has a claim against the debtors.section,by its terms,is not limited to creditors.moreover,the court notes that appellant suggested construction of the statute is inconsistent with congress apparent intent in adopting that section sic c ongress has chosen to recognize the uncollectibility of the majority of the income taxes occasioned by the sale of the farm debtor assets used in the farming operation.the amendments provide financially strapped family farmers the opportunity to downsize and restructure their farming operations without the necessity of paying the taxes in full as required under old chapter.norton.prac d.the statute by its terms is not limited to creditors,and it therefore can not be read to apply only to claims.section addresses claims owed to a government unit,which includes the tax claim held by the irs.
the court then addressed the government argument that claims in chapter cases are governed by,and that when read with and a a,the various sections confirm that holders of claims are not bound by chapter plans.id.section b states that b efore or at the time of each payment to creditors under the plan,there shall be paid any unpaid claim of the kind specified in section a of this title.id.internal quotations omitted.section a provides that 
t he provisions of a confirmed plan bind the debtor,each creditor,each equity security holder,and each general partner in the debtor,whether or not the claim of such creditor,such equity security holder,or such general partner in the debtor is provided for by the plan,and whether or not such creditor,such equity security holder,or such general partner in the debtor has objected to,has accepted,or has rejected the plan.
id.internal quotations omitted.the court summarized b and a as dictating that the confirmed plan binds the debtor and all the creditors.furthermore,confirmation obligates the trustee to distribute all payments to creditors in accordance with the plan,and vests in the debtors all the rights in any acquired property.dawes,wl,at citing arkison plata in re plata,cir.
the court also discussed.id.at.under a a,a chapter plan shall provide for the full payment of claims entitled to priority under unless the claim is a claim owed to a governmental unit that arises as a result of the sale of any farm asset used in the debtor farming operation,in which case the claim shall be treated as an unsecured claim that is not entitled to priority under section id.at.the bankruptcy court recognized that lists the expenses and claims that have priority in bankruptcy.id.at.section a gives priority status to certain prepetition taxes,while a gives priority status to a dministrative expenses allowed under section b.id.according to the court,sets out that the administrative expenses should be paid before payment to creditors of the confirmed plan.id.the court noted its prior conclusion that taxes incurred by the estate qualify as administrative expenses pursuant to section b a conclusion that this court also reaches,as discussed that such expenses are ordinarily a priority claim pursuant to section a.id.the court determined that the government argument that the foregoing sections necessarily preclude claims fails to take into consideration the specific language of section a a,noting that a a 
specifically exempts from priority status a claim owed to a governmental unit that arises as a result of the sale of any farm asset,in which case the claim should be treated as unsecured.the claim of the irs in this instance is a claim owed to a governmental unit,and it is the result of the sale of a farm asset,the farming property.the irs reliance on section and does not overcome the straightforward and specific language of a a.
we find the rationale of the district court in dawes persuasive and now adopt its reasoning.as the dawes court recognized,nothing in the plain language of a a restricts its application to prepetition sales.instead,the provision provides that a claim is stripped of its priority status if the claim is owed to a governmental unit that arises as a result of the sale of any farm asset used in the debtor farming operation.accordingly,we conclude,as did the district court in dawes,that nothing in the provision restricts its application to only those dispositions that occur before the debtor files his bankruptcy petition,nor does a a apply to merely creditors of the debtor,as it specifically refers to claims owed to a governmental unit.
whether the government has waived its sovereign immunity 
in a related argument,the government asserts that the bankruptcy code waiver of sovereign immunity in limits the extent to which a plan may bind the government.according to the government,pursuant to a,it has waived its sovereign immunity with regard to,inter alia,and,therefore,has agreed to be paid on its prepetition claims pursuant to a confirmed chapter plan.but the government contends that a does not contain a waiver of sovereign immunity as to,except to the extent that its provisions regarding the contents of a plan can bind the government as a creditor under a.thus,the government concludes that,without an express waiver of sovereign immunity for purposes of postpetition claims,a chapter plan that provides for treatment of a postpetition claim of the government can not bind the government.
although our review of the record indicates that the government never raised the defense of sovereign immunity before the bankruptcy court in either the knudsens case or schilke case,sovereign immunity is a jurisdictional issue that may be raised for the first time on appeal.satcher of at pine bluff bd.of trustees,cir citing harmon indus.browner,cir.but a belated assertion of sovereign immunity is a factor that may be relevant to the issue of waiver.rose dep t of educ.in re rose,cir.therefore,although we will consider the government sovereign immunity argument,we bear in mind that such argument is belated and that its untimeliness can be a factor used in evaluating whether the government has waived its sovereign immunity.
section a provides that sovereign immunity is abrogated as to a governmental unit to the extent set forth in this section with respect to of this title.in turn,states that 
the provisions of a confirmed plan bind the debtor,each creditor,each equity security holder,and each general partner in the debtor,whether or not the claim of such creditor,such equity security holder,or such general partner in the debtor is provided for by the plan,and whether or not such creditor,such equity security holder,or such general partner in the debtor has objected to,has accepted,or has rejected the plan.
emphasis added.
section a of defines creditor as,inter alia,an entity that has a claim against the debtor that arose at the time of or before the order of relief concerning the debtor.in turn,a informs us who may file a proof of claim.according to this section,a creditor or an indenture trustee may file a proof of claim.
in the present case,the government essentially argues that because it is not a creditor within the meaning of a,its claims against the knudsens and schilke did not arise at the time of or before the order of can not be bound under a chapter plan that provides for the treatment of a government postpetition claim under a a,as a only waives sovereign immunity as to the claim of a creditor.
but,as we previously acknowledged,a a specifically exempts from priority status a claim owed to a governmental unit.see supra part quoting dawes,wl,at.nowhere in the language of a a does it condition application of the section to situations in which the government is a creditor of the debtor.instead,a a clearly and unequivocally applies to a governmental unit,regardless of whether that governmental unit qualifies as a creditor of the debtor under a.see supra part.
furthermore,aside from the straightforward and specific language of a a,dawes,wl,at,the government,pursuant to a,has waived its sovereign immunity with regard to,inter alia.section a a states that if the claim is a claim owed to a governmental unit that arises as a result of the sale of any farm asset used in the debtor farming operation,then the claim is treated as an unsecured claim that is not entitled to priority under section.emphasis added.section a gives priority status to administrative expenses allowed under section b.emphasis added.in turn,b b i allows for any tax incurred by the estate,whether secured or unsecured to be treated as an administrative expense.as explained infra,incurred by the estate means incurred postpetition.see infra part.section explicitly states that the government sovereign immunity is abrogated as to a governmental unit to the extent set forth in this section with respect to of this title.
accordingly,we hold that the government sovereign immunity argument necessarily fails.
whether postpetition taxes qualify as an administrative expense under b b i 
the key question in the present cases is whether the postpetition taxes incurred by both the knudsens and schilke should be considered administrative expenses.as administrative expenses,the taxes would have priority status under a via b b i,thereby allowing the chapter plan to treat such expenses as nonpriority unsecured claims under a a.thus,we now address the government final argument that postpetition taxes do not qualify as administrative expenses under b b i because they are not incurred by the estate as required by that provision.
section of addresses the contents of a debtor chapter plan.under subsection a a,such a plan must 
provide for the full payment,in deferred cash payments,of all claims entitled to priority under section,unless the claim is a claim owed to a governmental unit that arises as a result of the sale,transfer,exchange,or other disposition of any farm asset used in the debtor farming operation,in which case the claim shall be treated as an unsecured claim that is not entitled to priority under section,but the debt shall be treated in such manner only if the debtor receives a discharge 
in turn,provides for two categories of taxes that are entitled to priority.section a gives priority status to certain prepetition taxes,while a gives priority status to administrative expenses allowed under section b of this title,and any fees and charges assessed against the estate under chapter of title.section b b i allows for any tax incurred by the estate,whether secured or unsecured to be treated as an administrative expense.
we have previously recognized that incurred by the estate means incurred postpetition,at the bankruptcy court and the district court both held that while the entire corporate tax was incurred by the estate postpetition,the portion of the tax attributable to prepetition income was of a kind specified in section a.we are not alone in our understanding of the meaning of incurred by the estate.see.state dep t of tax revenue in re columbia gas transmission,cir the priority for taxes incurred by the estate extends only to taxes incurred postpetition.in re baltimore marine,the only requirement for a tax to be accorded administrative priority under the statute is that it must be incurred by the bankruptcy estate,and thereby of necessity,be incurred postpetition.in re pub dennis of cumberland,the language incurred by the estate relates only to taxes which are incurred,after the estate is created.in re northeastern ohio hosp.ass n,taxes incurred by the estate are administrative expenses pursuant to section b b i.because the estate does not exist,priority treatment is limited to taxes incurred.collier on bankruptcy ed.only taxes incurred by the estate can be administrative expenses.therefore,first priority for tax claims extends to only postpetition taxes because before the petition is filed,there is no estate.
additional factors also support our conclusion that postpetition income taxes are administrative expenses,as such taxes were incurred by the estate,incurred postpetition.first,the plain language of a a does not restrict its application to prepetition sales.see cincinnati ins.bluewood,cir the primary rule of statutory interpretation is to give effect to legislative intent as reflected in the plain language of the statute.internal quotations and citation omitted.
second,it is the irc,not the bankruptcy code,that creates a separate taxable entity upon the filing of petitions by individuals under chapters and but does not create a separate taxable entity in cases filed by individuals under chapters and.compare with.additionally,even though there is no separate taxable entity in a chapter case,an estate still exists,pursuant to a,which provides 
property of the estate 
a property of the estate includes,in addition to the property specified in section of this title 
all property of the kind specified in such section that the debtor acquires after the commencement of the case but before the case is closed,dismissed,or converted to a case under chapter of this title,whichever occurs first and 
earnings from services performed by the debtor after the commencement of the case but before the case is closed,dismissed,or converted to a case under chapter of this title,whichever occurs first.
here,the taxes at issue result from the postpetition sale of the knudsens machinery and land assets,as well as schilke postpetition sale of real estate and breeding livestock.the sale of these assets certainly falls within the ambit of a.
finally,we also note that the majority of courts to have considered this precise issue have also reached the same result,rejecting the government argument that postpetition income taxes can not be incurred by the estate because a bankruptcy filing under chapter does not create a separate taxable entity under of the irc.see,hall united states in re hall,appeal pending in the ninth circuit in re dawes,aff,wl,slip op.appeal pending in the tenth circuit in re gartner,no,wl,appeal to the district court stayed pending outcome of present cases in re rickert,no,wl,appeal to the district court withdrawn and judgment of dismissal with prejudice entered in re uhrenholdt,no,wl appeal to the district court stayed pending bankruptcy court approval of parties proposed settlement.but see in re hall,rev,in re whall.
accordingly,we affirm the bankruptcy courts judgment that a a applies to the postpetition sale of farm assets.
treatment of taxes on the sale of the knudsens slaughter hogs 
the government asserts that a a does not apply to the knudsens sale of their slaughter hogs in their chapter case.the government bases this assertion on its view that the hogs were not farm asset s used in the debtor farming operation but instead were the end product of the farming operation.according to the government,the plain meaning of a a establishes that it applies to the sale of a farm asset put into action or service to bring about the desired end of debtor farming operation.the government concedes that the knudsens breeding sows and equipment,such as the farrowing crates,meet this requirement.but it contends that the slaughter hogs,which were produced and sold in the ordinary course of the knudsens operation,do not.according to the government,the slaughter hogs were the farm product instead of farm assets used in production.the government supports its interpretation of a a by reference to of the irc.the government thus argues that the district court,in reversing the bankruptcy court,erred by defining the knudsens farming operation broadly to mean their farming operation under their reorganization plan.
the proper construction of any statute,the bankruptcy code included,begins with the language of the statute itself.hartford underwriters ins.magna bank,in re hen house interstate,cir.the long established plain language rule of statutory construction requires examining the text of the statute as a whole by considering its context,object,and policy.united states bolden,cir internal quotations and citation omitted.we examine the statute express language and overall purpose when interpreting a statute.martin cox,in re martin,cir.
as we have previously discussed,a a provides that the chapter plan must 
provide for the full payment,in deferred cash payments,of all claims entitled to priority under section,unless 
a the claim is a claim owed to a governmental unit that arises as a result of the sale,transfer,exchange,or other disposition of any farm asset used in the debtor farming operation,in which case the claim shall be treated as an unsecured claim that is not entitled to priority under section,but the debt shall be treated in such manner only if the debtor receives a discharge 
section a a is,without doubt,complex and replete with legal terms of art.a full analysis of those terms would require examination of over provisions of the bankruptcy code.see richard mcqueen jack williams,tax aspects of bankruptcy law and practice ed.fortunately,the only phrase at issue in the present case is any farm asset used in the debtor farming operation.a a.to properly construe this phrase,we will consider the plain language of the phrase in three parts any farm asset,used in,and the debtor farming operation.
any farm assets 
neither a a nor any other provision in chapter defines the phrase farm assets.but,and are instructive in defining farm assets.see mcqueen williams,supra.section a provides that the property of the estate consists of all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.under a,p roperty of the estate includes,in addition to the property specified in section all property of the kind specified in such section that the debtor acquires after the commencement of the case therefore,
postpetition income is included in the ambit of the estate and is usually used to fund,along with other financial sources,the chapter farming operations plan.it is this property of the estate that is subject to administration under the bankruptcy code and is used to satisfy,among other things,allowed claims in accordance with the priority and distributional rules in bankruptcy.
mcqueen williams,supra.
the term property,as used in and,is interchangeable with the term asset,as used in and.see id.noting that uses the term assets related to a farming operation to determine family farmer eligibility and that,under a,the individual debtor must file a schedule of assets so that the parties in interest can determine the extent and value of the property of the estate.an asset is defined as.an item that is owned and has value.the entries on a balance sheet showing the items of property owned,including cash,inventory,equipment,real estate,accounts receivable,and goodwill.all the property of a person available for paying debts.navarre luna in re luna,cir quoting black law dictionary ed emphasis added.as a result,a a use of the term any farm assets,like use of the term assets and a and use of the term property,is all encompassing and broadly defined.mcqueen williams,supra.
furthermore,and give a specific meaning to the phrase farm assets,as used in a a.section provides that a family farmer is one engaged in a farming operation.section defines a farmer as a person that received more than percent of his gross income during the taxable year immediately preceding the taxable year in which the case was commenced from a farming operation owned or operated by such person.emphasis added.farming operation is defined as including farming,tillage of the soil,dairy farming,ranching,production or raising of crops,poultry,or livestock,and production of poultry or livestock products in an unmanufactured state.thus,farm assets would include any asset related to farming operations,whether or not actually used in farming operations.mcqueen williams,supra.farm assets would therefore include capital assets under,other property that may receive favorable tax treatment under,and inventory items that would otherwise generate ordinary income under.id.
here,the slaughter hogs were assets,as they were the property of the knudsens.the slaughter hogs were also farm assets because they were a part of the knudsens farming operation,which included the production of livestock.thus,the slaughter hogs constitute farm assets.
section a a only applies if the debtor farm assets are actually used in the farming operation.the phrase used in can be contrasted with the phrase related to the farming operation,as found in.the phrase relating to carries a broad ordinary meaning,to stand in some relation to have bearing or concern to pertain refer to bring into association with or connection with united states weis,cir quoting morales trans world airlines,d quoting black law dictionary ed.in contrast,use is defined as 
t he application or employment of something,a possession and employment of a thing for the purpose for which it is adapted,as distinguished from a possession and employment that is merely temporary or occasional.
black law dictionary ed.thus,the phrase related to appears to have a broader meaning than the phrase used in as a result,it would appear that a a is more restrictive than,and.mcqueen williams,supra.
the term used is encountered throughout the bankruptcy code but may be found most prominently in.id.section concerns the use,sale,or lease of property of the estate both in the ordinary course of business and other than in the ordinary course of business.section b provides when the trustee may use,sell or lease,other than in the ordinary course of business,property of the estate,while c provides that 
i f the business of the debtor is authorized to be operated under section of this title and unless the court orders otherwise,the trustee may enter into transactions,including the sale or lease of property of the estate,in the ordinary course of business,without notice or a hearing,and may use property of the estate in the ordinary course of business without notice or a hearing.
emphasis added.
the language of c use property of the estate in the ordinary course of business is comparable to that of a a the claim is a claim owed to a governmental unit that arises as a result of the sale of any farm asset used in the debtor farming operations.emphasis added.the notable difference is that a a is farming specific,that is,the course of business that refers to in a chapter case where the debtor seeks the benefits of a a is generally farming operations.mcqueen williams,supra.under l bankruptcy law and practice,a trustee or is entitled to,under c,use inventory or the proceeds from inventory,accounts receivable in the ordinary course of business.mcqueen williams,supra collier on bankruptcy a ed.t he trustee may sell inventory or collect accounts in the ordinary course of business without court approval,since these are not cash collateral,but the cash proceeds will be cash collateral,even if acquired by the trustee after the commencement of the case,because the cash is proceeds of the inventory or receivables,unless the court orders otherwise under section b.given the substantial similarity between a a and c,we see no reason why the phrase used in in a a should not be afforded the same meaning as the similar phrase use property of the estate in the ordinary course of business in c.as a result,the slaughter hogs,like inventory,would be considered used in the farming operation.
here,the government supports its argument that the slaughter hogs are not used in the farming operation by reference to of the irc.according to the government,like a a,employs the word used in a phrase to designate certain property receiving beneficial treatment in the context of capital gains taxes.section a provides beneficial capital gains tax treatment for certain gain from the sale of property used in the trade or business.section b b provides that livestock includes other livestock,regardless of age,held by the taxpayer for draft,breeding,dairy,or sporting purposes,and held by him for months or more from the date of acquisition.thus,under,the products themselves,the end products,of the business are not used in the trade or business.
the government analogy to in interpreting a a breaks down for three primary reasons.first,if we were to apply the government interpretation of used in,then,under c,a trustee or could never use inventory because it is not a deemed or defined capital asset.mcqueen williams,supra.additionally,provides that a fter notice and a hearing the trustee in a chapter case may sell property under section b and c free and clear of any interest in such property of an entity other than the estate if the property is farmland or farm equipment emphasis added.the wording of this section indicates that when congress wants to identify a debtor rights and powers in deemed or defined capital assets only,such as farm land or farm equipment,it does so specifically.mcqueen williams,supra.
second,a a is not a federal income tax provision found in the bankruptcy code instead,it is a provision that applies to any tax,state,or local.therefore,we decline to apply the of the irc in the bankruptcy context and instead rely on the provisions of the bankruptcy code itself in interpreting a a.see,united states reorganized cf i fabricators of utah,d in sum,we conclude that the bankruptcy act reveals no congressional intent to reject generally the interpretive principle that characterizations in the internal revenue code are not dispositive in the bankruptcy context,and no specific provision that would relieve us from making a functional examination of a.
third,a commonsense understanding of the phrase used in supports the knudsens argument that the slaughter hogs were used in their farming operation.as noted supra,use means to apply or to employ something.see black law dictionary ed.here,the knudsens certainly employed or made use of the slaughter hogs for their purposes.in the,the knudsens operated a hog operation in which they would sell the hogs as their main source of income.and,prior to the bankruptcy filing,the knudsens used the slaughter hogs in their farming operation by selling them in order to reorganize their farming operation in accordance with their contact with spi.
debtor farming operation 
there is no dispute that the knudsens qualify as debtors under and.the term debtor means person or municipality concerning which a case under this title has been commenced.under,o nly a family farmer or family fisherman with regular annual income may be a debtor under chapter of this title.the knudsens are family farmers.
to understand the meaning of farming operation,we look to.the term farming operation includes farming,tillage of the soil,dairy farming,ranching,production or raising of crops,poultry,or livestock,and production of poultry or livestock products in an unmanufactured state.t he above list is not,as it employs the term includes.watford fed.land bank of columbia in re watford,cir.this definition is to be construed liberally in order to further congress s purpose of helping family farmers to continue farming.id.
here,the knudsens engaged in a farming operation,as they have operated a hog farm since the early.first,this farming operation consisted of hog production in which the knudsens were selling their own hogs as their main source of income.then,in,the knudsens farm operation changed from a hog operation to raising pigs under a contract with spi 
in summary,because we find that knudsens sale of their slaughter hogs qualifies for treatment under the plain language of a a,we reverse the bankruptcy court judgment that the slaughter hogs were not a farm asset used in the debtor farming operation under a a.
allocation of tax claims entitled to beneficial treatment 
the government final argument is that the proration method as opposed to the knudsens preferred marginal method is the appropriate method for allocating the knudsens tax liability.some method must be used for allocating the knudsens tax liability between the tax arising out of the transactions within the scope of a a and the tax arising from those transactions outside of its scope.the a a portion would be an unsecured claim but the remainder would retain its priority status.the government points out that a a is silent as to the proper allocation of tax liability,thereby requiring us to consult legislative history and the statutory purposes of chapter to determine the proper allocation method.according to the government,its allocation method,which divides the taxes proportionately between the two types of claims,gives effect to congress intent to balance the interests of debtors and creditors in chapter.
the bankruptcy court adequately summarized the parties competing positions as follows 
irs argues that the appropriate way to allocate the taxes is to prepare a tax return which recognizes total income and all deductions and exemptions and calculates the income tax based on all taxable income.irs would then calculate the percentage of total income attributable to sales of qualifying capital assets and the percentage of total income attributable to sources.the income tax would be divided according to these percentages.see irs exhibit a applying this method to knudsens amended return for.irs would add the total tax to the tax for income because it says the tax is not based on income from the sale of capital assets.knudsens tax returns show this to be so exhibits and.
irs would next subtract any credits according to their relation to the sources of income.in the case of its example for,it applied two credits to the tax calculation tax withheld and fuels credit.irs arrives at a net tax due for each treatment and then calculates the percentage of the tax attributable to qualifying and sources of income.in exhibit a,the priority claim is per cent of the total tax,and the unsecured general claim is per cent.irs would then apply any payments on taxes for in accordance with the percentage relationship of net tax due for qualifying and income,yielding a tax balance for each.irs calls this method a proration or proportional method.
knudsens argue for a marginal rate method.they would calculate a tax return for all income,and then a second,pro forma tax return removing all qualifying sales income.the knudsens contend that this is a better method because it taxes the income at lower marginal tax rates.this results in a lower tax for income not entitled to beneficial treatment and likely makes reorganization more feasible,furthering the intent of the amendment.knudsens would also apply any and all payments on taxes to the tax,the tax which would not be discharged unless paid.no tax payments for would be applied to the portion of the tax that would receive beneficial treatment as unsecured debt under a a.
irs otherwise objects to the marginal rate method for the very reason knudsens support calculates the remaining priority taxes at lower marginal rates.irs argues for a method that taxes all taxable income at the marginal rates that would be applicable outside of bankruptcy and then prorates the result.neither party provides any other argument for the proposal.
knudsen,at finding that the proration method is the better method for determining what amount of tax qualifies for beneficial treatment under a a and what does not because i t recognizes all income,deductions,exemptions,and credits in arriving at a tax and allocates according to the percentage of each type of income and divides the actual tax without regard to which sales produced the last dollar of income.
section a a is silent as to how a debtor tax liability should be allocated between and priority claims.this silence is somewhat explainable by a a nature.the provision does not relate solely to taxes but also to a claim owed to a governmental unit.if a statute is silent,then such statute is deemed ambiguous.see clark dep t of agriculture,cir.a mbiguities in the code are generally resolved in favor of the debtor.new neighborhoods.workers comp.fund,cir matter of nickerson nickerson,cir the referee reasoned that this ambiguity should be resolved in favor of the debtor,since excluding priority claims from the fee base would result in reducing the expenses incurred by the debtor and thus would foster the rehabilitative purposes of the act.
s o long as the creditor right is protected,the creditor certainly is in no position to insist that doubts or ambiguities in an act be resolved in its favor and against the debtor.rather the act must be liberally construed to give the debtor the full measure of the relief afforded by congress lest its benefits be frittered away by narrow formalistic interpretations which disregard the spirit and the letter of the act.

additionally,once this court concludes that a particular statute is ambiguous,we may seek guidance in the statutory structure,relevant legislative history,and congressional purposes expressed in the statute.united states,cir quoting.power light lorion,d alteration in.the purpose of chapter is to provide family farmers with a faster,simpler,and cheaper alternative to chapter and chapter procedures,while preserving the fair treatment of creditors under those chapters.rowley yarnall,cir.it was designed to give family farmers facing bankruptcy a fighting chance to reorganize their debts and keep their land while,at the same time,preventing abuse of the system and ensuring that farm lenders receive a fair repayment.id.quoting conf,sess,reprinted in,alteration in rowley.courts have recognized that chapter was enacted as an emergency response to a farm debt crisis.travelers ins.bullington,cir.

moreover,the the irs does not always apply the proportional method.ficken internal revenue serv.in re ficken,case,adversary,slip opn.at bankr.july,unpublished.although the observation that the irs does not always use the proportional method when allocating the tax is not determinative,it does illustrate some exceptions where the irs does not apply what would be the proportional method to treat each dollar of income as the same.id.for example,t he irs utilizes the marginal method to determine estate taxes for special use valuation under.id.t he estate tax,like the income tax,is a graduated tax.id.pursuant to,farmland may be passed from one generation to the next by a qualified heir.the irs requires the estate to report only the special use value,and not the fair market value,on form to determine the estate tax due.id.
and,the irs requires computation of tax on prior transfers tpt using the marginal method under.id.citing robert stommel lester law,planning to maximize the credit.bar.
t he tpt credit is a credit applied to the federal and not state estate tax liability of the decedent estate equal to the amount of the federal estate tax deemed paid on property transferred to the decedent from the transferor.stommel lester at.the tax is the amount of federal estate tax attributable to the transferred property in the decedent estate.the tax is computed as the lesser of the average or pro rata method of tax allocation and the with and without or marginal method of tax allocation.id.at.with respect to tpt,the irs contemplates that the taxpayer compute the tax under the marginal method,and if the marginal method results in a lower tax than the pro rata or proportional method,that is the tax to be paid.
we hold that the proper allocation method under a a a provision as opposed to a tax the marginal method.as the district court observed 
by treating the proceeds of transactions that qualify for beneficial treatment under a a,in effect,as the last dollars in,and,therefore,subject to the highest marginal tax rate,the marginal method maximizes the percentage of the taxes to which beneficial unsecured treatment will apply,reducing the irs veto power,and making the debtors reorganization plan more feasible and,hence,more confirmable.the irs method,in contrast,would minimize the taxes entitled to beneficial treatment and reinstate much of the irs veto power,thereby fritter ing away the benefits of a a in stripping priority from claims of governmental units,at least to the extent that such claims are tax claims.see wright,at.douglas observing that the bankruptcy act must be liberally construed to give the debtor the full measure of the relief afforded by congress,lest its benefits be frittered away by narrow formalistic interpretations which disregard the spirit and letter of the act.the knudsens approach does not,however,entirely eliminate the irs veto power,which,consistent with the plain language of a a,see b d land livestock,d at the first approach to statutory interpretation is the plain language of the statute in question accord in re hen house interstate,at interpretation of provisions of the bankruptcy code begins with the plain meaning of the statute in re martin,at same,remains in place to the extent that the family farmer reorganization plan does not provide for the payment of the priority portion of the claim or the family farmer still fails to obtain a discharge under the reorganization plan.see a subject to the exception a a,the plan must provide for payment of priority claims,and the cla
