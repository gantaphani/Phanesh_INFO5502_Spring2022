the bankruptcy code expressly provides that a chapter bankruptcy plan may modify the rights of holders of unsecured claims.b.this section also provides that such a plan may modify the rights of holders of secured claims,other than a claim secured only by a security interest in real property that is the debtor principal residence id.
whether a lienholder has a secured claim or an unsecured claim,in the sense in which those terms are used in the bankruptcy code,depends on whether the lienholder interest in the collateral has economic value.see a.where a creditor holds a second mortgage on a homestead valued at less than the debtor secured obligation to a first mortgagee,for example,the holder of the second mortgage has only an unsecured claim for a purposes.
the appellee in the case at bar is such an unsecured creditor a second mortgagee whose lien on the chapter debtor homestead is totally under water.if the lien were only partially under water if the second mortgagee claim had a secured component,being unsecured only in part,the supreme court decision in nobelman american savings bank,d,teaches that the rights of the lienholder would not be subject to modification.the question before us now is whether the implications of nobelman would bar modification of the rights of a creditor who,although the holder of a lien on the chapter debtor homestead,has solely an unsecured claim under a.
the issue is one on which the courts are divided.under the majority view,it is permissible for a chapter plan to modify the rights of such an unsecured creditor the minority view is that modification is prohibited.the bankruptcy court adopted the minority position in the case at bar,and the district court affirmed on appeal.
we shall reverse.it does not appear to us that nobelman forecloses what we take to be the better reading of the code.under that reading,which is consistent with the result reached by all of the four other courts of appeals and both of the bankruptcy appellate panels that have addressed the question,modification of the rights of a totally unsecured homestead mortgagee is permitted by b.
the facts of the instant case were largely placed before the bankruptcy court by stipulation.here is a brief summary.
in the debtors,george and sherry lane,obtained a loan secured by a first mortgage on what we take to have been their sole residence.this mortgage was assigned to cit group,along with the lanes promissory note.
the lanes took out a second mortgage loan on their residence a year later.the second mortgage and mortgage note were assigned to firstplus financial,neither firstplus nor cit had any relevant security interest outside its mortgage,as far as the record discloses.
in november of the lanes sought protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code.soon thereafter cit filed a proof of claim showing a balance of due and owing on the senior mortgage obligation.there is no dispute as to the validity or amount of this claim.
firstplus filed a proof of claim showing due and owing on the junior mortgage obligation.firstplus has stipulated that the value of the lanes residence was less than the balance due on the first mortgage.the stipulation does not give a dollar value for the residence,but a brief filed by firstplus in the bankruptcy court put the value of the property at no more than.
the debtors filed a repayment plan proposing that cit would receive its regular monthly mortgage payment and that firstplus would be paid only as an unsecured claimant.the dividend for holders of unsecured claims would be in the range of cents to cents on the dollar,according to the plan.
firstplus objected to confirmation of the plan.in a brief supporting its objection,firstplus argued that b barred modification of its contractual rights because of the undisputed fact that its claim was one secured only by a security interest in real property that is the debtors principal residence.the bankruptcy court accepted this argument and denied confirmation of the plan in the form proposed.see in re lane.when the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court order,the lanes appealed to this court.
lawyers often think of any claim for repayment of a mortgage loan as a secured claim whether or not the mortgagee could actually realize anything at a foreclosure sale.under the bankruptcy code,however,a n allowed claim of a creditor secured by a lien on property in which the estate has an interest is a secured claim to the extent and only to the extent of the value of such creditor interest in the estate interest in such property a emphasis supplied.conversely,the claim is an unsecured claim to the extent that the value of such creditor interest is less than the amount of such allowed claim.id subject to exceptions not relevant here,a makes a applicable in a chapter bankruptcy case.
the principal residence of the debtors whose chapter plan was considered by the supreme court in nobelman american savings bank,d,had an uncontroverted value of.the property was mortgaged to a bank that submitted a proof of claim for three times that amount.the debtors filed a plan in which,on the strength of a,they proposed to bifurcate the bank claim into a secured claim and a larger unsecured claim.the secured component would be paid in full,under the plan,and the unsecured component would be written off.the supreme court refused to sanction this plan,holding that insofar as the proposed bifurcation would result in modification of the rights of the bank under its mortgage,the plan ran afoul of the other than clause of b 
in reaching this conclusion,the nobelman court decided that the phrase used in the antimodification clause a claim secured only by a security interest in real property that is the debtor principal residence should be read as encompassing the unsecured component of the bank overall claim as well as the secured component.nobelman,at.otherwise,the court pointed out,it would be impossible to protect the bank rights in the manner intended by congress 
the bank contractual rights are contained in a unitary note that applies at once to the bank overall claim,including both the secured and unsecured components.the debtors can not modify the payment and interest terms for the unsecured component,as they propose to do,without also modifying the terms of the secured component.id.
this being so,and given the focus of b on the rights of the bank,see nobelman,at,the court held that the bank rights were fully protected by the antimodification clause notwithstanding that the amount of the bank overall claim exceeded the value of the bank security interest in the homestead.
the nobelman court had no occasion to say what the result would have been if the bank claim had involved no secured component at all.in a passage consistent with the position adopted by a number of lower courts,however,the author of one leading bankruptcy treatise has said that t he clear implication of nobelman analysis is that even a completely unsecured claim holder with a lien on real property that is the debtor principal residence would be protected from modification by b,notwithstanding that such an unsecured lienholder could not have an allowable secured claim under a.lundin,bankruptcy,at ed.
strictly as a matter of syntactics,perhaps,there is something to be said for this conclusion.but the majority of courts that have been called upon to adjudicate the rights of lienholders asserting purely unsecured claims have declined to read nobelman as placing such lienholders in the class of claimants whose rights are entitled to special protection under the antimodification clause of b 
the collier bankruptcy treatise endorses the majority position the nobelman opinion strongly suggests that if a lien is completely undersecured,there would be a different result.collier on bankruptcy a i ed.as collier correctly notes,t he opinion relies on the fact that,even after bifurcation,the creditor in the case was still the holder of a secured claim because the debtors home retain ed of value as collateral.id.quoting nobelman,at.if the creditor had held a lien on property that had no value,collier continues,then under this analysis,the cre
