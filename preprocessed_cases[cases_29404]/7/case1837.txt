in these consolidated bankruptcy appeals,the california state water resources control board the state board and the california underground storage tank cleanup fund the fund challenge the district court orders denying them eleventh amendment immunity.in particular,the state board contends that it is an arm of the state of california,that it did not waive its eleventh amendment immunity,and that does not validly abrogate such immunity.the fund raises a narrower eleventh amendment question,arguing merely that it is an arm of the state.the state board also appeals the district court order ruling that abstention is not appropriate,under c,and,on,george schulman,the bankruptcy trustee,the trustee seeks reversal of the district court order finding that fees payable to the fund are taxes for bankruptcy purposes,under a.we affirm in part,reverse in part,dismiss in part,and remand for further proceedings.
more precisely,we hold that while the state board is an arm of the state of california,it has waived its eleventh amendment immunity in the trustee mandamus action.in the fund appeal,we apply our test and hold that the fund is an arm of the state and therefore entitled to invoke eleventh amendment immunity.finally,we dismiss the state board abstention appeal and the trustee for lack of jurisdiction.
background 
on july,upon the seizure by the state of california of the bank accounts held by divine grace lazar and gary lazar the debtors or the lazars for nonpayment of gasoline taxes,including payments imposed for contribution to the fund,the lazars voluntarily petitioned for chapter reorganization on behalf of themselves and eight of their corporate entities the corporate cases were substantively consolidated and ordered jointly administered with the lazars personal bankruptcy proceedings.george schulman was appointed as chapter trustee and,on september,when the cases were converted to chapter,was appointed as trustee of the chapter estate.
the lazars and their entities owned,operated and leased some retail gasoline stations throughout southern california in the and early.in may,the los angeles county grand jury returned an indictment against the lazars,their corporate entities,and certain other individuals for environmental crimes resulting from their operation of the gas stations,including illegal disposal of hazardous wastes and falsification of tank test results related to leaking gas tanks at the lazars mostly older gas stations.in september,the lazars pleaded nolo contendere to the charges of conspiracy and falsification of the underground storage tank test results,and,on february,the state court sentenced the lazars to eight years in custody and fined their companies more than million.
the state criminal charges arose from violations of the barry keane underground storage cleanup trust fund act the act,enacted by the california legislature in to address the problem of leaking petroleum underground storage tanks and the threat they pose to public health and safety and the environment.see cal.health safety code west supp.the act imposes duties on owners or operators of underground storage tanks,including the duty to investigate the condition of the tanks,to clean up leaks,and to establish evidence of financial responsibility for taking corrective action and compensating others for damage caused by the leaks.the act established the fund,a reimbursement program administered by the state board that is used by small gasoline purveyors to comply with the resource conservation and recovery act,et,which requires these small gasoline purveyors to demonstrate financial ability to pay claims for damages caused by their leaking underground storage tanks.
the fund is financed by a fee imposed on underground storage tank owners for each gallon of gasoline or other petroleum product stored in a permitted tank.owners and operators of petroleum underground storage tanks may file a claim against the fund to recover costs associated with corrective action taken in response to unauthorized releases.cal.health safety code west supp.before filing for bankruptcy on july,california target enterprises,one of the lazar companies,submitted twenty claims against the fund to the state board.the trustee became the holder of the twenty claims as a result of his appointment as trustee of the bankruptcy estate.
in november,the controller of the state of california the controller submitted proofs of claims for unpaid taxes against california target enterprises totaling in excess of million in the bankruptcy proceedings.the california state board of equalization the boe submitted at least five proofs of claims for unpaid taxes totaling in excess of million in the bankruptcy proceedings during the years through.an unspecified portion of this over million in claims is for taxes payable to the fund.
the twenty reimbursement claims were denied on november,by david deaner,a member of the state board staff and the manager of the fund final staff decision.the november letter cited misconduct by the lazars as the basis for denial.the trustee filed an appeal of the final staff decision,which was summarily denied by harry schueller,chief of the state board division of clean water programs,in a letter dated march,final division decision.the trustee then filed an amended petition for board review of final division decision amended petition and a request for hearing and oral argument request for hearing.the amended petition and request for hearing were deemed denied by operation of law days after the state board received them.see regs.tit,d.
having exhausted his administrative remedies,the trustee filed a petition for peremptory writ of administrative mandamus or other appropriate writ against the state board in the superior court of the state of california for the county of los angeles on march,the mandamus adversary.in the mandamus adversary,the trustee sought a writ requiring the state board to reinstate the trustee claims against the fund,pay the claims in accordance with the statutory prioritization scheme,and thereby to permit the trustee to use the fund as a mechanism for demonstrating financial responsibility for operation of underground storage tanks in accordance with the provisions of state and federal law.the trustee also sought actual damages in excess of million,reasonable attorneys fees,and such other and further relief as appears appropriate under the circumstances.on march,the trustee filed a notice of removal of the mandamus adversary to the united states bankruptcy court for the central district of california,pursuant to in response,the state board filed a motion for remand or in the alternative abstention and remand.the state board argued that the bankruptcy court subject matter jurisdiction over the action was foreclosed by the eleventh amendment the bankruptcy court lacked subject matter jurisdiction under a because the action concerned enforcement by the state of california of its police or regulatory powers and under c,the bankruptcy court must abstain from hearing the action and remand it to state court,or,in the alternative,the bankruptcy court should abstain and remand in the interests of justice,comity and respect for state law,under c.
in an opinion dated september,the bankruptcy court rejected each of the state board arguments and denied the motion.see schulman california state water resources control bd.in re lazar.it found that the mandamus adversary was not a civil action by a governmental unit to enforce that unit police or regulatory power and was therefore properly removed under a.it also concluded that the requirements for mandatory abstention were not met,principally because the mandamus adversary did not present a purely state law question,and because it is a core proceeding within the meaning of c.the bankruptcy court rejected the state board permissive abstention arguments,finding that the factors set forth in christensen tucson estates,in re tucson estates,cir,weighed against abstention.for similar reasons,the court found that remand was not warranted by any equitable consideration.leaving the constitutional issues for last,the bankruptcy court,while suggesting but not holding that a state waiver of sovereign immunity under b was invalid after seminole tribe florida,d,ruled that the state of california waived its sovereign immunity by filing its proofs of claims in the bankruptcy proceeding and by making a general appearance in support of its position as one of the most substantial secured creditors in case.schulman,at.the state board timely appealed to the bankruptcy appellate panel.
meanwhile,on june,the trustee had filed a complaint to determine and subordinate the boe postpetition claim s,to recover damages for unlawful misconduct of agencies of the state of california,and to recover payments improperly paid against the state of california,the state board,and the fund the tax adversary in this action,the trustee moved for partial summary judgment for determination of two discrete issues whether the fund is an arm of the state capable of invoking immunity under the eleventh amendment and whether the monies paid into the fund are properly characterized as fees and not taxes.the bankruptcy court denied the motion in a order dated june,ruling that the fund is an entity of the state of california for the purpose of claiming sovereign immunity under the eleventh amendment and that the fees imposed as payment to the fund are taxes for the purposes of a the trustee timely appealed to the united states district court for the central district of california,and successfully moved to consolidate the mandamus and tax adversaries.
the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court order denying the state board motion for remand or abstention,but reversed in part and affirmed in part the bankruptcy court order denying the trustee motion for partial summary judgment.the district court held that the fees paid into the fund are taxes for purposes of a,notwithstanding any contrary characterization by california state law the fund is not an arm of the state capable of invoking the eleventh amendment and the bankruptcy court correctly decided against abstention in the mandamus adversary.the parties of this decision are before us.

the district court held that eleventh amendment immunity did not apply in the mandamus adversary because the fund,which it determined would be the source of any money damages,was not an arm of the state.the state board is the only named defendant in the mandamus adversary,however,and with respect to the eleventh amendment question,it is the entity potential legal liability,rather than its ability or inability to require a third party to reimburse it,or to discharge the liability in the first instance,that is relevant.regents of of cal.doe,d.therefore,to determine whether eleventh amendment immunity applies here,we must assess the nature of the state board,a task made easy by the california legislature.
the california water code provides that the state board shall exercise the adjudicatory and regulatory functions of the state in the field of water resources,cal.water code west,and that the state board is in the california environmental protection agency and consist s of five members appointed by the governor,id.thus,the state board correctly contends that it is an agency of the state of california,and the trustee does not dispute this contention.see rounds oregon state bd.of,cir to determine whether an entity enjoys eleventh amendment immunity,we must look to its nature as created by state law.citing regents of of cal.doe,at dittman california,cir holding that the state of california acupuncture committee is a state agency entitled to eleventh amendment immunity,cert.denied,d.u nder the eleventh amendment,agencies of the state are immune from private damage actions or suits for injunctive relief brought in federal court.id.at quoting mitchell los angeles community college,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also pennhurst state sch.hosp.halderman,d it is clear,of course,that in the absence of consent a suit in which the state or one of its agencies or departments is named as the defendant is proscribed by the eleventh amendment.

the trustee argues that the state board waived its eleventh amendment immunity in the mandamus adversary because other agencies of the state of california,namely the boe and the controller,filed proofs of claims in the lazars bankruptcy proceedings.
in gardner new jersey,the supreme court addressed the impact that filing a proof of claim in a bankruptcy proceeding has on a state assertion of eleventh amendment immunity.id.at.the court held 
it is traditional bankruptcy law that he who invokes the aid of the bankruptcy court by offering a proof of claim and demanding its allowance must abide the consequences of that procedure.if the claimant is a state,the procedure of proof and allowance is not transmitted into a suit against the state because the court entertains objections to the claim.the state is seeking something from the debtor.no judgment is sought against the state when the state becomes the actor and files a claim against the fund it waives any immunity which it otherwise might have had respecting the adjudication of the claim.
id.last term,the supreme court reaffirmed the validity of gardner.see college sav.bank.at stating that gardner stands for the unremarkable proposition that a state waives its sovereign immunity by voluntarily invoking the jurisdiction of the federal courts see also california franchise tax bd.jackson in re jackson,cir relying on gardner to find that the california franchise tax board waived its sovereign immunity when it filed a proof of claim for unpaid state income taxes against the jacksons.
the question in this case,then,is not whether a state waives its eleventh amendment immunity by filing a proof of claim in bankruptcy.gardner establishes that it does.gardner,at.rather,the relevant questions are the extent of this waiver and,more concretely,how this waiver applies to the state board in the mandamus adversary.we now turn to these questions.

richard fallon et,hart and wechsler the federal courts and the federal system ed.supp hereinafter hart wechsler supp.although we have never directly addressed these questions,we have applied gardner in the past,and these past applications provide us with some guidance.
first,in confederated tribes white in re white,cir,we held,in accordance with gardner,that by participating in a bankruptcy proceeding,an indian tribal government waived sovereign immunity respecting the adjudication of its claim against the debtor assets.id.at.in so holding,we upheld the district court order affirming discharge of the tribal government claim under chapter of the bankruptcy code.see id.at.similarly,in california franchise tax board jackson in re jackson,cir,we determined that because a state agency filed a proof of claim,it was not immune from the bankruptcy court discharge of that claim.id.at.these two decisions clarified the rule of gardner that when a state files a proof of claim against a debtor,it waives its eleventh amendment immunity with respect to the adjudication of that particular claim.or,as the gardner court stated,by filing a proof of claim in bankruptcy,the state waives its immunity from t he whole process of proof,allowance,and distribution of the claim.gardner,at.
in jackson,however,we indicated that this waiver may encompass more than the mere adjudication of the state claim.we noted favorably the fourth circuit holding that when a state files a proof of claim in a bankruptcy proceeding,the state waives its sovereign immunity in regard to the debtor claims which arise out of the same transaction or occurrence as the state proof of claim.jackson,at citing schlossberg maryland in re creative goldsmiths,cir.this language in jackson is not inconsistent with gardner.although the waiver found constitutional in gardner was limited to the state own claim,and thus narrower than the standard,gardner,at.see also confederated tribes,at the supreme court made clear in gardner new jersey that when a sovereign files a claim against a debtor in bankruptcy,the sovereign waives immunity with respect to the adjudication of the claim.citation omitted seay tennessee student assistance in re seay,noting that the operative language of gardner new jersey can not really be read to say any more than that the filing of a proof of claim by a state waives its sovereign immunity as to matters connected with the claims allowance process,nothing in gardner precludes a broader waiver rule,see hart wechsler supp,supra,at suggesting that when a state voluntarily invokes federal jurisdiction,the permissible extent of the state eleventh amendment waiver goes beyond the bounds of gardner teresa goebel,comment,obtaining jurisdiction over states in bankruptcy proceedings after seminole tribe,chi.the gardner court held that the defensive counterclaim rule was constitutional,but did not foreclose the possibility that a broader test may be constitutional.danning united states,cir citing gardner while allowing a bankruptcy trustee to assert counterclaims against the united states up to the amount of the federal government claim.
our sister circuits,in addressing this question,have not yet achieved consensus on the proper rule.as noted above,the fourth circuit has articulated a test.schlossberg,at holding that to the extent a defendant assertions in a federal action,including those made with regard to a proof of claim in a bankruptcy action,amount to a compulsory counterclaim,a state has waived any eleventh amendment immunity against that counterclaim in order to avail itself of the federal forum.the tenth circuit also has held that sovereign immunity is waived for claims arising out of the same transaction or occurrence.wyoming dep t of transp.straight in re straight,cir.indicating,without reaching the question,that the permissible extent of a state waiver may be even broader than the test,cert.denied,d.c stating that a counterclaim may claim relief exceeding in amount or different in kind from that sought in the pleading of the opposing party the seventh circuit,however,has indicated that when a state files a proof of claim in bankruptcy,the state waiver of immunity is limited to matters arising out of the same transaction or occurrence which is the subject matter of the suit,to the extent of defeating the state claim.jones yorke in re friendship med,cir dekalb county div.of family children servs.platter in re platter,cir stating that no sovereign immunity problem existed where the state filed the claim and no one sought money from the state.
consistent with this authority,we hold today that when a state or an arm of the state files a proof of claim in a bankruptcy proceeding,the state waives its eleventh amendment immunity with regard to the bankruptcy estate claims that arise from the same transaction or occurrence as the state claim.however,whether these claims are limited to only compulsory,as the seventh circuit holds,or allow for a broader affirmative recovery from the state,need not be addressed here.because the estate claims are slightly over million and the boe proof of claim is at least million in taxes payable to the fund,affirmative recovery beyond the proof of claim amount is not being sought in this case,and we leave for a future day the question of whether gardner would so permit.we must nevertheless ascertain whether the trustee mandamus adversary arises out of the same transaction or occurrence as the boe proof of claim.
same transaction or occurrence 
to determine whether the trustee claims against the state board in the mandamus adversary arise out of the same transaction or occurrence as the proofs of claims filed in the lazars bankruptcy case by the boe,we apply the logical relationship test of.a.pinkstaff united states in re pinkstaff,cir.
a logical relationship exists when the counterclaim arises from the same aggregate set of operative facts as the initial claim,in that the same operative facts serve as the basis of both claims or the aggregate core of facts upon which the claim rests activates additional legal rights otherwise dormant in the defendant.

in these proceedings,the boe filed several proofs of claims against the lazars bankruptcy estate,totaling approximately million.an unspecified portion of the boe claims are for ust fees in the mandamus adversary,the trustee has sued the state board to reinstate its claims for reimbursement from the fund and for damages.accordingly,to determine whether the state board is entitled to eleventh amendment immunity in the mandamus adversary,we must determine whether the boe claims for unpaid ust fees are logically related to the trustee claims for ust reimbursement see pinkstaff,at.
the state board argues that although an owner or operator of an underground storage tank for which a permit is required must pay fees to the fund in sums based on the amount of petroleum that is stored in the tanks,see cal.health safety code west,whether an owner or operator will receive reimbursements for cleaning up petroleum leaks is dependent upon a detailed statutory scheme under which claimants receive priority based on various factors,see id.west supp.the state board further asserts that,in this case,the denial of the trustee reimbursement claims was not based upon the nonpayment of fees,and that,therefore,the bankruptcy court could resolve the mandamus adversary without probing into the lazars payment of ust fees.thus,the state board contends that although the boe proofs of claims and the trustee claims in the mandamus adversary both revolve around the fund and the lazars maintenance of underground storage tanks,the resolution of these claims involves wholly separate inquiries.we disagree.
the boe proofs of claims for unpaid ust fees and the trustee claims in the mandamus adversary both concern the fund and both arise out of activities associated with the same bankruptcy case.while the boe demands payments of fees to the fund,the trustee seeks reimbursement from the fund for corrective actions taken on underground storage tanks.see straight,at holding that the proofs of claim filed by the state and the motion filed by straight arose out of the same transaction or debtor business fifth assocs.new york state dep t of taxation fin.in re fifth assocs,cir thus,the appellee claim for a tax refund arose from the same transaction or sale of the stanhope the state claim for additional taxes.moreover,the fund collects fees from owners and operators of underground storage tanks for the ultimate purpose of paying reimbursement claims when those tanks leak petroleum.see cal.health safety code,west supp.therefore,we hold that the trustee claims against the state board in the mandamus adversary are logically related to the proofs of claims filed by the boe for unpaid ust fees.see pinkstaff,at see also price united states in re price,cir the pertinent inquiry is whether the claim arises out of the same transaction or occurrence and not whether the claims are from the same transaction or occurrence.albright gates,cir in deciding what is a transaction,we take note that the term gets an increasingly liberal construction.
accordingly,because the boe filed proofs of claim in the bankruptcy proceeding that arise out of the same transaction or occurrence as the trustee claims against the state board in the mandamus adversary,the state board has waived its eleventh amendment immunity in the mandamus adversary 
abrogation 
in b,congress provided that when a state files a proof of claim in a bankruptcy case,the state is deemed to have waived sovereign immunity with respect to a claim against such state that is property of the estate and that arose out of the same transaction or occurrence out of which the claim of such state arose.b.several courts have considered the issue of whether,by enacting a and b,congress has abrogated the states sovereign immunity.some courts have found that a and b are unconstitutional because the sections were enacted pursuant to article i of the united states constitution.see,sacred heart hosp.pennsylvania,dep t of pub.welfare in re sacred heart hosp,cir holding a,which purports to abrogate sovereign immunity,unconstitutional department of transp.dev.pnl asset management in re estate of fernandez,cir.same,amended by cir per curiam in re creative goldsmiths of washington,at holding section b unconstitutional.other courts have concluded that a and b are constitutional because the bankruptcy code was enacted pursuant to section of the fourteenth has long been recognized by the supreme court as a valid source of congressional power to abrogate state eleventh amendment immunity see,in re straight,concluding that application of the fourteenth amendment to section renders it constitutional,aff,cir,cert.denied,d in re headrick,the fourteenth amendment allows debtors to enforce the provisions of the bankruptcy code in federal court notwithstanding the states eleventh amendment immunity.
because we have determined that the state waived its eleventh amendment immunity rendering permissible the estate counterclaim against the state,we refrain from reaching the question of the constitutionality of sections a or b.state of maryland,cir i f a case can be decided on either of two grounds one involving a constitutional question,and the other,a question of statutory construction or general law,the court should decide on the basis of the latter,vacated on other grounds,d see,rose,at concluding that because the court found that the state had waived its eleventh amendment immunity,the court need not reach issues of the constitutionality of the abrogation provision of a and the statutory provision of b.
conclusion 
in sum,we hold that because the boe filed proofs of claims in the lazars bankruptcy case that are logically related to the trustee claims against the state board in the mandamus adversary,the state board has waived its eleventh amendment immunity in the mandamus adversary.
abstention 
the state board also argues that the bankruptcy court erred by not abstaining in the mandamus adversary,pursuant to c and c in security farms international brotherhood of teamsters,cir,however,we noted that a bstention can exist only where there is a parallel proceeding in state court.id.at.thus,we held that 
section c abstention should be read in pari materia with section b remand,so that c applies only in those cases in which there is a related proceeding that either permits abstention in the interest of comity,section c,or that,by legislative mandate,requires it,section c.
id.at.on march,the trustee successfully removed the mandamus adversary from state court,and,as a result,n o other related state proceeding thereafter exists.id.accordingly,because there is no pending state proceeding,c and c are simply inapplicable to this case.see id.at 
furthermore,to the extent that the state board appeals the bankruptcy court decision against remanding the mandamus adversary,and to the extent that we are required to construe the state board motion to abstain as a motion to remand,id.at,we lack jurisdiction over the appeal.b stating that a decision to not remand is not reviewable by appeal or otherwise by the court of appeals security farms,at section b prevents this court from reviewing a district court decision not to remand.
iii.tax adversary 
in the tax adversary,we are confronted with two distinct issues.the fund appeals the district court determination that it is not an arm of the state and thus can not invoke eleventh amendment immunity.the trustee the district court order affirming the bankruptcy court judgment that the fees paid into the fund are taxes for the purposes of bankruptcy,pursuant to a.we examine each issue in turn.
arm of the state 
we have jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine to review the district court denial of the fund claim that it is an arm of the state of california.metcalf eddy,at.we review questions of eleventh amendment immunity de novo.hill,at.
in determining the eleventh amendment status of a defendant,t here may be a question whether a particular suit in fact is a suit against a state.pennhurst,at.it is well established that the eleventh amendment reference to actions against one of the united states encompasses not only actions in which a state is actually named as the defendant,but also certain actions against state agents and state instrumentalities.regents of the of cal.doe,at.
we inquire into the relationship between the state and its instrumentality to decide whether it may invoke the state immunity.id.in particular,
t o determine whether a governmental agency is an arm of the state,the following factors must be examined whether a money judgment would be satisfied out of state funds,whether the entity performs central governmental functions,whether the entity may sue or be sued,whether the entity has the power to take property in its own name or only the name of the state,and the corporate status of the entity.
durning citibank,cir quoting mitchell los angeles community college,cir internal quotation marks omitted.w hether a particular state agency is an arm of the state is a question of federal law.but that federal question can be answered only after considering the provisions of state law that define the agency character.regents of the of cal.doe,at.on balance,we hold that the five durning factors compel the conclusion the fund is an arm of the state of california.
the first factor,namely whether a judgment against the fund under the terms of the tax adversary complaint would have to be satisfied out of the limited resources of the fund itself or whether the state treasury would also be legally pledged to satisfy the obligation,itsi tv,agricultural ass ns,cir quoting durning,at internal quotation marks omitted,provides little guidance in this case.that is,in the tax adversary,the trustee seeks from the fund both reimbursement for the improper payment of fees and actual damages,and these differing claims point us in different analytical directions.
more precisely,under california law,the trustee reimbursement claims would be paid only out of the f und,cal.health safety code b west,and the california state treasury is not liable,durning,at see cal.health safety code.thus,to the extent the trustee seeks reimbursement from the fund in the tax adversary,this first factor weighs against an finding.see durning,at when a state entity is structured so that its obligations are its own special obligations and not general obligations of the state,that fact weighs against a finding of sovereign immunity under the arm of the state doctrine.as to the trustee,damages claims,however,no statute specifically protects the state treasury from a court judgment against the fund,and,in fact,california law provides that when the fund sunsets,all of its liabilities shall be transferred to the state general fund.cal.gov t code west providing that whenever a special fund in the state treasury is abolished,and no successor fund is specified in the act providing for abolition,all of the special fund liabilities shall be transferred to and become a part of the general fund.thus,to the extent the trustee seeks not reimbursement,but actual damages from the fund in the tax adversary,this factor appears to weigh in favor of an finding.in short,this first factor is a close question and for this reason is entitled to little weight in the overall balance.belanger madera unified sch,cir.
the second factor in our inquiry,however,is not uncertain,and it weighs strongly in favor of finding that the fund is an arm of the state.the fund performs central governmental functions,rounds,at,and california exercises substantial centralized control over the fund,belanger,at see also franceschi schwartz,cir noting that,in performing an analysis,a court must assess the extent to which the entity derives its power from the state and is ultimately regulated by the state.quoting greater los angeles council on deafness,zolin,cir.
the california legislature created the fund to protect public health and safety and the environment in light of the perception that a significant number of the underground storage tanks containing petroleum in the state may be leaking.cal.health safety code b,west supp.nonetheless,the trustee argues that the fund was enacted primarily for the financial benefit of tank owners.in particular,he characterizes the fund as an insurance measure sponsored by a lobby and as a means by which underground storage tank owners and operators may comply with their federal requirements.
that the fund works to the benefit of owners and operators of underground storage tanks does not diminish its public importance.rather,the language of the authorizing statute demonstrates that the fund performs services that benefit owners and operators for the purpose of protecting the public health.id.b,west supp there are threats to public health and water quality if a comprehensive,uniform,and efficient corrective action program is not established it is in the best interest of the health and safety of the people of the state to establish a fund to pay for corrective action where coverage is not available.
moreover,the california health and safety code is replete with provisions establishing that the state is both the fund source of power and its ultimate regulator.for example,section a provides that the fund is created in the state treasury.see id.a.this same section authorizes the state board to expend the fund monies upon appropriation by the legislature.id.therefore,we conclude that the fund derives its power from the state.franceschi,at.
we also conclude that the fund is ultimately regulated by the state through the state board.by statute,the state board must report at least once every three months on the payment of claims from the fund to the senate committee on budget and fiscal review,the senate committee on environmental quality,the assembly committee on budget,and the assembly committee on environmental safety and toxic materials,or to any successor committee,and to the director of finance.cal.health safety code c west supp.additionally,the state board has statutory authority to modify existing accounts or create accounts in the f und or other funds administered by the board,which the board determines are appropriate or necessary for proper administration.id.a west supp.the state regulation of the fund is also manifested through the boe statutory authority to adopt regulations to carry out its role as the collector of fund fees.see id.a west.
accordingly,we find that this second factor weighs heavily in favor of finding that the fund is an arm of the state.
as for the remaining factors,the california legislature has not granted the fund corporate status or given it the power to take property in its own name.thus,these two factors weigh in the fund favor.see durning,at.finally,the fund admits that it may sue or be sued in its own name,which would weigh against an finding.see id.at.although recent legislation adds some uncertainty to this admission,compare cal.health safety code g west the fund may sue and be sued in its own name,with id.deleting subsection g,pursuant to legislative amendments,this factor does not turn the balance in any event.
for the foregoing reasons,then,we must conclude that,on balance,the fund is an arm of the state of california,thereby entitled to invoke eleventh amendment immunity in reaching this conclusion,we find it most significant that the california legislature established the fund to serve the central governmental function of ensuring safe and healthy water resources for the state citizens.
fees as taxes
