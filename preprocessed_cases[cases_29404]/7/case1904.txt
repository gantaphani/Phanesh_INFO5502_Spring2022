franklin savings association fsa,formerly a state chartered savings and loan association,and its parent,debtor franklin savings corporation fsc,a kansas corporation collectively,franklin,appeal the dismissal of their adversary complaint against the united states and the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic.this is the latest in a long string of lawsuits franklin has brought against the government asserting claims in connection with the government seizure,conservation and liquidation of fsa by the resolution trust corporation rtc and its,the fdic the bankruptcy court granted the government motion to dismiss,finding the claims were barred by the doctrine of claim preclusion.the district court affirmed.we conclude franklin claims are and,therefore,affirm the dismissal 
background 
the complete history of franklin litigation against the government is set forth in numerous published opinions,see,supra,and we briefly describe only the factual background necessary to resolve this appeal.the rtc was appointed conservator of fsa in.the rtc function was converted from conservator to receiver in,and the rtc liquidated fsa.the fsc,which owns percent of fsa stock,then filed for chapter bankruptcy protection.
a.the franklin iii litigation 
in,franklin filed an adversary complaint against the rtc in bankruptcy court seeking damages under the federal tort claims act ftca for negligence,breach of fiduciary duty,and conversion by the rtc while acting as conservator of fsa.see franklin iii,at franklin sav.united states.franklin claimed that the rtc,while acting as a conservator,negligently failed to protect the assets and economic viability of fsa,in violation of certain directives and in breach of its fiduciary duty.see franklin iii,at.the district court withdrew the reference from the bankruptcy court,and franklin amended its complaint to name the fdic as the rtc.id.at.
the government moved to dismiss all claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,asserting the discretionary function exception to the ftca waiver of sovereign immunity applied because resolution of the jurisdictional issue of whether the discretionary function exception applied was so intertwined with the merits of the case,the district court treated the government motion to dismiss as one for failure to state a claim under.b.id.at.the district court granted the motion to dismiss.
on appeal to this court,franklin argued for the first time that the government had waived its discretionary function immunity under bankruptcy code,when it filed a claim in bankruptcy against fsc estate.franklin iii,at.this court held that franklin had waived reliance on bankruptcy code by failing to assert that jurisdictional basis in its complaint,seeking leave to amend its complaint to do so,or in any way raising it in the district court.id.at.
this court affirmed the dismissal of franklin claims,holding that they were barred by the discretionary function exception because all of franklin allegations against the government involved discretionary conduct.id.at.the supreme court denied franklin petition for certiorari review.franklin sav.united states,d.
b.the franklin iv complaint 
franklin refiles franklin iii 
three months after the supreme court denied review of franklin iii,franklin filed another adversary complaint in this case franklin iv.the new complaint,at issue herein,is virtually identical to the complaint filed in franklin iii with respect to the actual parties,allegations,and legal claims.franklin sav.united states in re franklin sav,comparing claims in franklin iv with those in franklin iii.
the same plaintiffs have filed and fsc.the same defendants have been named,the united states and the fdic as to the rtc.the factual allegations are exactly the same,restated from the second amended complaint in franklin iii virtually verbatim.each of the claims the district court dismissed in the prior action are restated in the instant complaint,also verbatim as in the prior action,the plaintiffs seek money damages in the amount of million.
franklin does not dispute the bankruptcy court characterization of the two suits.indeed,its position is that it has simply refiled its franklin iii action in franklin iv,and it concedes that all of the causes of action in both franklin iii and franklin iv sound in tort.see aplt.opening br.at.at.
franklin bases franklin iv on bankruptcy code 
franklin iv does,however,posit a new legal basis for franklin contention that the government has waived sovereign immunity bankruptcy code b and c,the theory we deemed waived in franklin iii.franklin asserts that bankruptcy code constitutes a complete waiver of sovereign immunity separate and apart from the ftca waiver of immunity,and that this waiver permits tort claims against the united states which would otherwise not be permitted under the discretionary function exception of ftca a.
bankruptcy code,as amended in,provides a waiver of sovereign immunity when the government files a proof of claim against a debtor in a bankruptcy proceeding.section b waives sovereign immunity with respect to counterclaims of the debtor estate that arose out of the same transaction or occurrence as the proof of claim.b section c waives sovereign immunity with respect to counterclaims of the debtor estate that did not arise out of the same transaction or occurrence as the proof of claim,but only to the extent that the claims offset the government claim.id.c the government does not dispute that it filed proofs of claim in fsc bankruptcy proceeding or that the conditions of b and c are met.
the bankruptcy court dismisses franklin iv under the doctrine of claim preclusion 
the bankruptcy court granted the government motion to dismiss on the basis of res judicata,or claim preclusion.in re franklin sav,at.it ruled that franklin was relitigating the same claims against the same parties as in franklin iii,and that all of the claims in franklin iv had been raised,or could have been raised,in franklin iii.id.at.the bankruptcy court rejected franklin argument that it could reassert its claims because the claims in franklin iii had not been decided on the merits,but had been dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.id.at.the court also ruled that bankruptcy code waiver of sovereign immunity did not abrogate the discretionary function exception to the ftca.id.at.the district court affirmed,and this appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
franklin argues on appeal that franklin iii was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction,rather than on the merits,and,therefore,the doctrine of claim preclusion does not bar the reassertion of its claims.we do not reach this issue,however,because it is clear that all of the claims in franklin iv are.even if franklin iii was dismissed without prejudice,the dismissal of an earlier suit without prejudice does not authorize a subsequent suit brought outside of the otherwise binding period of limitations.stein reynolds,cir see also lambert united states,cir same,applying b.
moreover,as we explain below,the statute of limitations issue is jurisdictional in this case,and must be decided before the claim preclusion issue jurisdictional issues must be addressed first and,if they are resolved against jurisdiction,the case is at an end.see steel citizens for a better env t,d.in contrast,r es judicata is not a jurisdictional bar it is an affirmative defense,and,thus,would not defeat subject matter jurisdiction of this or the district court.kenmen eng g city of union,cir.
a.the ftca and its time limitations govern franklin claims 
the exclusive avenue for franklin claim is the ftca 
we must begin our analysis by making clear what franklin does not acknowledge its claims are governed by the ftca,which provides the exclusive avenue to assert a claim sounding in tort against the united states.a providing that the ftca remedy is exclusive for all claims which are cognizable under section b.franklin seems to argue that it is bringing its claims under bankruptcy code.by its express terms,however,bankruptcy code does not provide a substantive or independent basis for asserting a claim against the government.section a states nothing in this section shall create any substantive claim for relief or cause of action not otherwise existing under this title,the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure,or nonbankruptcy law.thus,a plaintiff such as franklin seeking to use the waiver in must demonstrate that a source outside of entitles it to the relief sought.hardy united states in re hardy,cir see also zayler united states,d,appeal pending,cir.e ven though b and c waive sovereign immunity for counterclaims against the united states,any substantive rights asserted must have an independent legal basis.
that outside source is the ftca when,as here,the claim sounds in tort.it is clear that the ftca provides the exclusive avenue to bring a tort claim against the united states,notwithstanding other statutes that permit the government to be sued a rule previously explained to franklin in franklin iii,at holding that the ftca provides the exclusive avenue for franklin tort claims,which are cognizable under ftca,notwithstanding the existence of an independent sue and be sued limited waiver of immunity.although franklin never acknowledges that the ftca governs its claims in franklin iv,it does admit that all of its claims sound in tort,that it is simply reasserting the same tort claims it asserted in franklin iii,and that its claims in franklin iii were brought under the ftca.see aplt.opening br.at.at.quite clearly then,the ftca provides the exclusive avenue for pursuing those claims against the united states.
time limitation in section b 
federal law bars any tort claim against the united states unless it is presented to the appropriate federal agency within two years of the claim accrual,and filed within six months after notice of denial of the claim by that agency.b a tort claim against the united states shall be forever barred unless action is begun within six months after the date of mailing of notice of final denial of the claim by the appropriate federal agency to which it was presented.section b is the limitations period of the ftca.plaza speedway united states,cir.here,the relevant federal agency denied the claims asserted in franklin iv on august,eight years before the franklin iv complaint was filed.at.
the ftca timeliness requirement is jurisdictional 
timeliness of suit is one of the conditions of the government waiver of sovereign immunity under the ftca,and the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to proceed under the ftca if a plaintiff fails to satisfy the ftca timing requirements set forth in b.dahl united states,cir.
the doctrine of sovereign immunity precludes suit against the united states without the consent of congress the terms of its consent define the extent of the court jurisdiction.the applicable statute of limitations is a term of consent.the plaintiff failure to sue within the period of limitations is not simply a waivable defense it deprives the court of jurisdiction to entertain the action.

franklin argues section b does not apply 
franklin does not dispute that the statute of limitations in expired prior to its commencement of franklin iv.rather,it argues that b does not apply.aplt.reply br.at.first,it argues that a kansas saving statute permits it to refile its otherwise untimely claims.aplt.opening br.at.at.second,it argues that its use of bankruptcy code waiver of sovereign immunity abrogates any conditions on the waiver found in the ftca,including the statute of limitations provided in b.we find no merit in either proposition.
the kansas saving statute 
franklin contends that franklin iv is not because it relates back to the filing date of franklin iii by virtue of the kansas saving statute,which allows an action to be refiled within six months if the original action was timely commenced and was dismissed for reasons other than on the merits.stat.ann.franklin argues on appeal that the bankruptcy court and the district court erred in rejecting application of the kansas saving statute.these courts rejected application of on the basis that franklin iii had been dismissed for failure to state a claim under rule b and,therefore,had failed on the merits.we agree that the kansas saving statute has no application here,but for a different reason as noted above,the ftca is the exclusive means for franklin to assert its tort claims against the government,and there is no legal basis for applying a state saving statute under the ftca.
franklin argues that claims under the ftca rely on the substance of the forum state tort law,here kansas,and therefore,that kansas statute of limitations determines the limitation period in federal court.aplt.opening br.at.at.this court has previously rejected this very argument.pipkin united states postal,cir see also benge united states,cir.although state law determines whether there is substantive liability under the ftca,see cannon united states,cir,federal law defines the applicable limitations period,pipkin,at.a court looks to state law to define the time limitation applicable to a federal claim only when congress has failed to provide a statute of limitations for a federal cause of action,but congress has expressly stated the applicable limitation period for a tort claim brought against the united states,in b,so reference to state law is inappropriate.id.quotation omitted.in both pipkin and benge,this court held that a state saving statute has no application to tort claims brought against the united states.benge,at oklahoma saving statute pipkin,at same.thus,the kansas saving statute does not apply to the claims asserted in franklin iv.
bankruptcy code does not abrogate b timeliness requirements 
franklin responds that benge and pipkin are inapplicable because the waiver of sovereign immunity under bankruptcy code supercedes the more limited waiver of immunity under the ftca.although a condition of the waiver of immunity under the ftca is compliance with b timing requirements,dahl,at,franklin argues that compliance with b is not a condition of waiver of immunity.it contends that the mere filing of a proof of claim in bankruptcy court constitutes a complete abrogation not only of any sovereign immunity defense,but also of any rights associated with the waiver of immunity,including the statute of limitations under b.aplt.reply br.at.franklin cites the cases of anderson fdic,cir and ashbrook block,cir,for the proposition that none of the limitations on liability contained in b or in the ftca apply when a plaintiff is proceeding under the waiver of immunity contained in.aplt.opening br.at aplt.reply br.at.for the following reasons,we conclude that the condition of the b limitation period must be satisfied,notwithstanding any waiver of immunity under bankruptcy code.
section is only a limited consent to be sued in bankruptcy court 
section allows franklin to file a counterclaim against the united states in bankruptcy court it does not permit franklin to file an untimely counterclaim.section is simply a waiver of sovereign immunity it does not create a claim for relief,nor does it provide a separate basis for subject matter jurisdiction.weeks,oglala sioux hous,cir holding that the sovereign consent to be sued,standing alone,does not confer subject matter jurisdiction upon a court to hear a claim against the sovereign.
in order for a claim against the united states to be heard,first there must be,because sovereign immunity requires it,consent to be sued and because,with the exception of the supreme court,the subject matter jurisdiction of federal courts is defined by statute,there must be,second,congressional provision of a court with the authority to hear the claim and grant relief.

the court subject matter jurisdiction for the claims asserted in franklin iv is determined and defined by the provisions of the ftca.federal jurisdiction under the ftca is limited by a number of conditions,including the statute of limitations provision of b.as previously noted,the ftca waiver of immunity provision,b,is subject to the condition of compliance with b time limitations.see dahl,at holding that court must dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction if an ftca litigant does not satisfy the tim
