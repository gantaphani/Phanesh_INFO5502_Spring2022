mitchell founded wood floors import distributor,wfi in january of.wfi imported bamboo flooring from china and distributed it throughout the united states.mitchell wife kathy did data entry for the company but did not have an ownership interest.after the company was formed,mitchell discussed with his attorneys the possibility of transferring ownership of wfi to kathy so that it would not be affected by the personal bankruptcy he was contemplating.kathy knew nothing about this plan until march of.that month,mitchell directed her to type meeting minutes reflecting that he gave his ownership interest to her on november.mitchell explained that the company had to be out of his name for so long of a period so that they could attach to it.
the minutes said that mitchell would remain as president of the company,and kathy would hold all other titles.she sent the minutes to mitchell corporate attorney,who on march,prepared certificates of ownership to be signed and delivered.despite the new paperwork,nothing changed in the operation of wfi.mitchell continued to run the business kathy responsibilities were not increased.she did not consider herself to have authority to pay wfi bills,and only signed checks as mitchell directed.on paper,kathy made per month,but mitchell treated the money as his own and told her how to spend it.
in late,kathy relationship to mitchell and role in wfi changed.on october,she filed for divorce.she began to fear that,because she was the owner of wfi on paper,she would be liable for anything that the company did.on the advice of her attorney,she fired mitchell from wfi and denied him access to its assets.she filed a chapter bankruptcy petition for the company on december.
upset at the way he was treated,mitchell contacted assistant united states trustee janet reasoner in january of to accuse kathy of bankruptcy fraud.he told reasoner that he had formed wfi in and had transferred it to kathy three years before.instead of discussing the fraud accusations,however,mitchell explained that he wanted to be allowed to liquidate the inventory in wfi bankruptcy estate.he provided two binders containing information about wfi and its business plan.among the documents was an amortization schedule showing wfi payments on mitchell loan from f m bank,with an adhesive note on it that said,this was income to dan.not a loan from the to pay a loan.there was also a copy of wfi list of payments to insiders,which showed that mitchell was paid approximately per week.attached to the list was another adhesive note that said,being the originator starter of the co take home every weeks ha ha after the meeting,mitchell lawyer filed a motion on his behalf asking the bankruptcy court to compel the chapter trustee to hire him to liquidate the inventory.
as she prepared to resist mitchell motion,reasoner learned that he had filed a personal bankruptcy in.she reviewed the filings from that case and became suspicious that mitchell had concealed his interest in wfi or failed to disclose that he transferred the business.at the hearing on mitchell motion,reasoner planned to gather additional information that she might use for a criminal referral.
the bankruptcy court held the hearing on march.mitchell testified in support of his motion.in response to questions from wfi attorney,mitchell admitted that in july of he was the president and ceo of wfi according to kathy records,but identified himself as a laborer on his bankruptcy schedules.he claimed that he had to b ecause of tax reasons and my wife pretty much did want to have the irs connecting this company with the other company.when reasoner asked him about the amortization schedule,he confirmed that from march,to october,he directed wfi to pay f m bank more than on the debt that he personally owed,and that the payments were income to him.
the most telling part of mitchell testimony,however,was his reaction to reasoner suggestion that he was a creditor of wfi 
i feel as an owner.i never lost that position.just because a piece of paper takes it away from me does not change the fact that i started this,i ran it,i put hours a week in this company.
