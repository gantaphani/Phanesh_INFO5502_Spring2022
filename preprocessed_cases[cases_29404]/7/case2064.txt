we conclude that the trial court was not required to resolve the procedural challenges to the assignment in this proceeding for an order for sale,since the applicable statutory requirements for acknowledgment of assignment were met.we also conclude the evidence supports the conclusion that allen was not entitled to a homestead exemption.finally,we find there was no evidence that the judgment liens underlying the writ of execution were discharged in bankruptcy.we affirm the order.

given this burden and their third priority position,the radoseviches realized they would recover nothing under a judicial foreclosure of their judgment lien.they approached the coastal commission and negotiated an assignment of its judgment against allen.the coastal commission considered the proposed assignment agreement in closed session on january.it then authorized its executive director,peter douglas,to enter into the assignment agreement.

discussion 
allen challenges the standing of the radoseviches to obtain an order for sale,arguing that the coastal commission temporary assignment of its judgment lien to them was void.among his arguments is that the assignment exceeded the coastal commission powers,violated the public contract code and open meeting laws,and illegally bestowed powers on the radoseviches which are reserved to the attorney general.amicus curiae pacific legal foundation joins in these claims.we need not and do not reach these arguments.
this appeal is from an order for sale of dwelling,made under code of civil procedure section that section is part of the enforcement of judgments law,a comprehensive scheme governing the enforcement of civil judgments in california.imperial bank pim electric,th,d.
contrary to allen assertion,the radoseviches are judgment creditors within the meaning of the enforcement of judgments law.section defines the term judgment creditor to include an assignee of record judgment creditor means the person in whose favor a judgment is rendered or,if there is an assignee of record,means the assignee of record.
section prescribes the requirements for an assignee to enforce a judgment under this statutory scheme an assignee of a judgment is not entitled to enforce the judgment under this title unless an acknowledgment of assignment of judgment to that assignee has been filed under section or the assignee has otherwise become an assignee of record.the law revision commission comment to this section explains section is a new provision that codifies a requirement of former practice.the commission has been advised that as a matter of practice under the former law an assignee of a judgment was not permitted to obtain a writ of execution unless the assignment was made a matter of record.cal.law revision com,west of civ.proc.foll.
section sets out the requirements for becoming an assignee of record.an assignee of a right represented by a judgment may become an assignee of record by filing with the clerk of the court which entered the judgment an acknowledgment of assignment of judgment,subd.a.subdivision b of that section sets out the precise contents of the acknowledgment of judgment.subdivision c prescribes the method for completing the acknowledgment the acknowledgment of assignment of judgment shall be made in the manner of an acknowledgment of a conveyance of real property.executed and acknowledged by the judgment creditor or by the prior assignee of record if there is one.notably,section is in addition to,and does not limit or restrict,any other means by which an assignee may become an assignee of record,subd.d.
these statutes,read together,specify requirements for an assignee to obtain standing as a judgment creditor to enforce a judgment under the enforcement of judgments law.no provision is made for a debtor to attack the judgment creditor authority to make the assignment the scope of the provision is limited to the process for an assignee to obtain standing to proceed as a creditor.for this reason,we conclude the legislature did not intend a proceeding under the enforcement of judgments law to become a forum for litigating the validity of the underlying assignment agreement.allen challenges to the method and content of the coastal commission assignment of judgment to the radoseviches are subject to being raised in a separate proceeding.see.allen has not pursued this course.these claims do not bear on this limited proceeding.
the radoseviches attached to their application for order for sale a copy of the acknowledgment of assignment of judgment.that document complied with the requirements of section,subdivision b it was signed by peter douglas,executive director of the coastal commission,clara slifkin,deputy attorney general,as attorney for the coastal commission,and michael buley,as attorney for the radoseviches.the signatures were notarized,and the acknowledgment was filed in the superior court on december.this is all that is required for purpos
