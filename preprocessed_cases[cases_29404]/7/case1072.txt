airadigm communications,purchased fifteen personal communications services pcs licenses in through fcc auctions.it planned to pay for these licenses in installments.unable to meet its payment obligations,airadigm filed for chapter bankruptcy in.its plan of reorganization,confirmed on november,was dependent upon financing by telephone and data systems tds.the reorganization plan provided the fcc an allowed claim of million for the fifteen licenses.the fcc took the position that the licenses were forfeited as a result of airadigm failure to pay in full,and airadigm chapter case proceeded as if the licenses were no longer an asset of the company.in,however,the supreme court decided fcc nextwave personal communications,d.that case held that the fcc could not cancel a license because the licensee had filed for bankruptcy prior to paying for the license.the fcc then conceded that it had incorrectly terminated airadigm licenses,and it reinstated them.
airadigm filed a second chapter petition in may.tds again would provide financing.on september,the fcc filed a claim for each of the licenses,seeking the principal amounts owed on the licenses about million and accrued interest on the claims through the petition date about million.airadigm and tds objected to the fcc claims for interest,arguing that under the plan all interest stopped accruing on the petition date.
the bankruptcy court denied the fcc interest for the period from the commencement of the bankruptcy case to the november,confirmation date,but it found that the plan implicitly entitled the fcc to interest.the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court in part to allow interest and reversed the bankruptcy court in part to also allow a portion of the additional interest that the fcc sought.airadigm and tds appeal.for the reasons explained below,we affirm the district court ruling awarding interest for the period between confirmation of airadigm plan of reorganization and commencement of new bankruptcy proceedings in and we affirm the district court award of interest for the interim period between commencement of the bankruptcy proceeding and confirmation of the plan.
background 
the fcc awards spectrum can be used for a variety of mobile and fixed radio specific time periods.the communications act of,as amended,authorizes the fcc to allocate spectrum licenses through a system of competitive bidding,based on the premise that the highest qualified bidder will be most likely to build out the licenses and put them to public use.j.this act further requires the fcc to design auctions that ensure that small businesses,rural telephone companies,and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women are given the opportunity to participate in the provision of services.j b,j d.the fcc earmarked certain blocks of c and such entities who,unable to afford a lump sum payment,could pay for their licenses in installments.to ensure payment,the fcc made a condition precedent to obtaining a license,g iv,and it executed a promissory note and security agreement to secure its interest in each license.id.g.if the successful bidder fell into default,its license would automatically cancel,and it would be subject to debt collection procedures.g iv.
in a fcc auction,airadigm was the highest bidder for fifteen licenses designated for small businesses.thirteen of these licenses were and two were segments.the licenses authorized airadigm to use portions of the electromagnetic spectrum to provide wireless telecommunications services in parts of wisconsin,iowa,and michigan.airadigm agreed to pay for these licenses in quarterly installments,plus interest,over a period.airadigm paid ten percent of the purchase price,signed fifteen promissory notes recognizing its debt to the fcc,and executed fifteen security agreements.the licenses themselves stated that they were conditioned on the full and timely payment of all monies due pursuant to fcc regulations and the terms of the commission installment plan.the licenses stated that failure to comply with this condition would result in automatic cancellation of the licenses.the fcc sought to perfect its interest in the licenses by,among other things,filing ucc financing statements with the office of the wisconsin secretary of state.
airadigm soon met financial problems.it defaulted on its obligations to the fcc and filed a voluntary petition for chapter relief on july.the fcc allowed airadigm to continue using its portion of the spectrum but cancelled airadigm licenses and filed a proof of claim in bankruptcy court for about million,which represented the aggregate unpaid principal balance due under the fifteen notes.the fcc stated that the licenses had automatically cancelled by operation of law and that,as its collateral had been extinguished,its claims against airadigm were unsecured.hedging,the fcc recognized in its proof of claim that if it did not have the authority to cancel the licenses,its debt was instead secured by the licenses themselves.airadigm filed a petition with the fcc seeking either reinstatement of the licenses or a waiver of their cancellation.
in october,airadigm and several other interested parties filed a plan of reorganization.the fcc objected to confirmation of the plan,but it limited its objection to the plan treatment of the fcc as the holder of an unsecured claim.on november,a confirmation hearing was held on the debtor plan.on november,the bankruptcy court entered an order confirming the plan.the fcc did not appeal.
the reorganization proceeded under the assumption that the fcc had properly cancelled the licenses.the plan provided that the fcc had an allowed claim of million and laid out several contingencies should the fcc reinstate the licenses.tds would provide the financing under these contingency scenarios.should the fcc reinstate the licenses by june,tds would pay the fcc claim in full.if the fcc did not reinstate the licenses by june but did so by june,tds had the option of paying off the claim but was not obligated to do so.but if the fcc never reinstated the licenses or fail ed to act in a timely manner,the plan provided that tds would obtain all of airadigm assets except the licenses.the plan was otherwise silent as to the fcc exact interests in the licenses and what would happen if the fcc reinstated them after june.and the plan did not expressly preserve the fcc security interest in the licenses,instead stating that the plan shall not enjoin or in any way purport to limit,restrict,affect or interfere with action initiated by the fcc in the full exercise of its regulatory rights,powers and duties with respect to the licenses.
the fcc did not act on the reinstatement petition by june.on january,the supreme court issued its decision in nextwave personal communications,d.in a case involving a factual scenario very similar to this one,the court held that the fcc could not cancel a debtor pcs licenses just because it had filed for bankruptcy.the court held that automatic cancellation violated of the bankruptcy code,which provides that a government unit may not deny,revoke,suspend,or refuse to renew a license,permit,charter,franchise,or other similar grant to a debtor in bankruptcy solely because such debtor has not paid a debt that is dischargeable in the case under this bankruptcy title or that was discharged under the bankruptcy act.a.the court reasoned that even if timely installment payments further the fcc regulatory purposes,the obligation to make such payments is still a debt within the meaning of,and that the failure to make payments on such debt therefore can not be the sole basis for canceling the fcc licenses.nextwave,at.the fcc conceded a few months later that it had been wrong to terminate airadigm licenses,and it reinstated them as though they had never been cancelled.
after the fcc reinstated airadigm licenses,oneida enterprise development authority oeda,another airadigm creditor,filed an objection to the fcc claim.oeda argued that the fcc delay in reinstating the licenses prejudiced them and the fcc claim should be disallowed for inequitable conduct,deemed waived,or subordinated to the claims of other creditors.the fcc responded that its conduct was appropriate and that there was no legal basis to disallow or subordinate its claim.agreeing with the fcc,the bankruptcy court signed an order granting the motion to dismiss and ordering that the fcc claim is allowed in the amount of.the allowance order did not provide for any interest on the fcc claim.
on may,airadigm filed a second chapter bankruptcy petition.it asserted that a new bankruptcy proceeding was necessary because in the period between cancellation of the licenses and their restoration,the licenses had decreased in value and could no longer cover airadigm debts.on june,the parties entered a stipulation agreeing,among other things,that the fcc allowed claim in the bankruptcy case shall be allowed in the bankruptcy case.in exchange for this agreement,the fcc agreed not to object to the closing of the case and the opening of the case.the stipulation further provided that all other rights of the parties hereto including without limitation,the right of the fcc and tds to seek inclusion and allowance of interest on their allowed claims are expressly reserved.
the fcc then renewed its claim,asserting that the claim was secured and demanding unpaid principal in the amount of million accrued interest on the claims running through the commencement of the case in the amount of million and petition interest.airadigm and its financier tds objected to the interest claims.they argued that the only claims that the fcc could pursue were those arising from the plan,that the fcc had waived any claim to interest by not specifically including interest on the proof of claim form,and that the interest claims were now barred because the order allowing the fcc claim over the oneida objection only allowed the debt principal and made no provision for interest.
on february,the bankruptcy court held a hearing on the fcc claims.at that hearing,the bankruptcy court denied the fcc petition interest and denied the fcc interest for the period between commencement of the case and confirmation of the reorganization plan.it reasoned that these claims were excluded by the order on the oneida objection setting the amount of the fcc allowed claim at amount that included only principal,without interest.the bankruptcy court did add interest in the amount of for the period between confirmation of the plan which occurred on november,and commencement of the second bankruptcy case on may.the bankruptcy court found that the plan implicitly entitled the fcc to this interest at the contract rate.it reasoned that the fcc was a secured creditor with respect to the licenses restored to airadigm after nextwave that secured creditors must,under b of the bankruptcy code,receive interest on their secured claim if payments are deferred and that the award of interest on the allowed claim,at the market rate specified in the contract underlying the fcc claims,was implicit in the court earlier confirmation order.the bankruptcy court also held that the fcc was entitled to interest running from commencement of the bankruptcy proceeding on claims pertaining to two of airadigm licenses.
both parties appealed to the district court.the district court affirmed the decision on prepetition interest accruing before commencement of the case.the court reasoned that the bankruptcy court order denying the oeda objection to the fcc claim and setting the amount of the allowed claim did not provide for prepetition interest.the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court award of implicit interest for the period from november,to may.the court reasoned that the bankruptcy court construction of its own prior order confirming airadigm plan of reorganization was entitled to deference and was,in any event,the only reasonable interpretation of the plan.additionally,the district court reversed the bankruptcy court to hold that the fcc was entitled to million more in interest for the time period after commencement of the case through confirmation of the plan from july,through november.the district court granted this interest based on b of the bankruptcy code,which requires interest when a claim is oversecured.the court found that the value of the licenses securing the claim at the time of the petition was greater than the amount of the allowed claim.
airadigm and tds appeal the district court order to the extent that it awarded implicit interest for the period from november,to may,and b interest for the period from july,to november.the fcc no longer challenges the denial of petition interest,and airadigm and tds no longer challenge the award of interest for the period following commencement of the bankruptcy case.

legal conclusions are reviewed de novo.findings of fact may be reversed only if clearly erroneous.in re outboard marine,cir.a bankruptcy court interpretation of a plan it confirmed is subject to full deference as an interpretation of its own order and may be overturned only if the record shows an abuse of discretion in the interpretation.in re weber,cir.

to satisfy the first scenario,which is the scenario implicated in this case,an objecting secured creditor must be given deferred cash payments totaling at least the allowed amount of such claim,of a value,as of the effective date of the plan,of at least the value of such holder interest in the estate interest in such property.b a i ii.when payment is deferred,a creditor receives the present value of its claim only if the total amount of the deferred payments includes the amount of the underlying claim plus an appropriate amount of interest to compensate the creditor for the decreased value of the claim caused by the delayed payments.rake wade,d.section b a i ii thus requires interest if the claim is to be paid over time.united sav.ass timbers of inwood forest,d.
in this case,there was initially great uncertainty as to whether the fcc should be treated as a secured or unsecured creditor.at the time of plan confirmation,the parties believed that the fcc was an unsecured creditor.the bankruptcy court confirmed a plan that did not explicitly provide for interest under b a,which allows for interest for secured creditors only.then the supreme court decided nextwave,which made clear that the fcc was in fact a secured creditor.the fcc subsequently reinstated the licenses.
as a secured creditor,the fcc brought this litigation,retroactively seeking interest under b a.the bankruptcy court awarded this interest to the fcc.the court noted that,as a result of pending disputes over whether the licenses should be restored to airadigm,the fcc status as a secured creditor was not certain at the time of plan confirmation.it reasoned,however,that nextwave,and the subsequent reinstatement of licenses,made clear that the fcc was in fact a secured creditor.since the fcc was a secured creditor,the bankruptcy court found that interest under b a i was implicit in the plan,and it awarded this interest to the fcc.the bankruptcy court explained 
it was implicit in that confirmation over the objection of what we subsequently learned was a secured creditor that they were entitled to that much.so on their allowed secured claim,the payment of which was deferred,they enti
