opinion of the court 
in this bankruptcy appeal,former employees of hechinger investment company and related entities hechinger contest an order under which certain employee benefits are treated as administrative expenses only to the extent that they are attributable to employment services performed after hechinger filed for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code.for the reasons stated below,we affirm the order of the district court.
hechinger operated general home improvement stores under a variety of names,including hechinger,builders square,and home quarters warehouse.due to financial difficulties,hechinger decided to close of its builders square stores in february of.in order to liquidate the inventory of these stores,hechinger held going out of business sales.wishing to ensure that each store would retain experienced staff to run these sales,hechinger offered two types of special benefits hereinafter collectively benefits.first,hechinger offered to increase the percentage of bhq time for which an employee would be paid on termination.employees accumulated bhq time a combination of vacation,sick,holiday,and personal days at rates that varied based on length of service.employees not participating in the benefits program,received payment for of their bhq time upon termination.under the benefits program,however,employees were to be paid for of this time.second,participating employees were to receive severance pay in amounts that varied based on length of service with the company.employees who had completed at least nine months of continuous service as of the date of termination were eligible to receive one week of severance for each completed year of service,up to a maximum of weeks.to be eligible to receive any of these enhanced benefits,however,an employee had to remain with the company until the employee store was closed or the employee was released by the company.
on june,hechinger voluntarily filed petitions for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code.on august,employees of the closing builders square stores employees filed a motion in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware requesting immediate payment of benefits owed under the benefits plan as administrative expenses under b a,a,and.
the bankruptcy court granted this relief only in part.the court apportioned both the bhq time payments and the severance pay between the period of pre and employment and treated only the latter as administrative expenses.the district court affirmed,and this appeal followed.
we have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to d.our review of the district court decision effectively amounts to review of the bankruptcy court opinion in the first instance.see in re telegroup,cir.interpretations of the bankruptcy code are subject to plenary review.see in re abbotts dairies,cir.we review a refusal to exercise jurisdiction under for an abuse of discretion.see nordhoff,zenith,cir.
the dispute between the parties is limited to the priority to be afforded to the benefits claims.the employees argue that the entirety of their claims qualify as administrative expenses under b a because the benefits were not earned,employees could not expect payment,until after the last day of business of the individual store or the individual employee release date.each named employee completed employment after hechinger petition date.the employees contend that this feature of the benefits distinguishes them from conventional severance pay and that therefore this case is not controlled by our precedents allowing administrative priority to claims for severance benefits only inasmuch as the claims arose.based on their contention that the benefits at issue here were earned after the petitions were filed,the employees argue that they are administrative expenses under b a.
section b provides 
after notice and a hearing,there shall be allowed administrative expenses,other than claims allowed under section f of this title,including 
a the actual,necessary costs and expenses of preserving the estate,including wages,salaries,or commissions for services rendered after the commencement of the case.
b emphasis added.
under,certain categories of expenses and claims enjoy priority.administrative expenses allowed under b receive first priority in the distribution of the assets of the debtor estate.see a.in a chapter case,a court can not confirm a distribution plan unless the plan provides full cash payment of all b administrative expense claims or the claim holder agrees to different treatment.see b,a a.
the employees also argue that hechinger will be unjustly enriched if all benefits are not treated as administrative expenses and that immediate payment of their claims should be ordered under bankruptcy code section.
the employees principal argument is that the benefits are entitled to administrative expense priority because they were earned after the filing of the petition and directly and substantially benefitted the estate.noting that employees qualified for these benefits only if they remained until released,the employees state that these benefits were not earned ratably over time but were earned upon the employees release.appellants br.at.the employees explain 
t he benefits are distinct from wages and other traditional compensation benefits which compensate employees for their daily work.this separate element can not be prorated between prepetition and postpetition periods no benefits would be due and owing if an employee left the employ of hechinger before release by hechinger.
appellants br.at.in addition,the employees argue that,even if the benefits are treated like ordinary severance benefits,the benefits must be classified as administrative expenses because the employees in good standing at the time of furnished after the filing of the petition.
in analyzing the employees argument,we begin with the language of section b a.under that provision,as noted,wages,salaries,or commissions for services rendered after the commencement of the case may be allowed as administrative expenses.thus,in order for the benefits to qualify in toto,as the employees desire,these benefits must have been for services rendered after the commencement of the case.it is apparent,however,that all of the benefits can not meet this requirement.suppose that the employees,after enlisting in the benefits program,had absented themselves from work until the moment when the bankruptcy petition was filed and had then showed up professing a willingness to remain on the job until release.the employees would have been ready to perform all of the services to be rendered after the commencement of the case,but because they had not rendered the specified services prior to that point,they would not qualify for the benefits or,presumably,for continued employment with the debtor.
under the benefits program,the consideration furnished by the employees was the work that they did every day from the time when they agreed to the benefits program until the closing of their stores or their release by the company.some of these services were rendered before the bankruptcy case was commenced and some were rendered after.accordingly,it seems clear to us that some sort of apportionment between the two periods is needed.
the employees reliance on the date when the benefits were to be the end of the employees misplaced.section b a does not give administrative priority to wages,salaries,or commissions due to be paid after the commencement of the case.it looks to the time when the services were rendered not when they were scheduled for payment.see,in re commercial fin,cir to determine administrative priority,courts look to when the acts giving rise to a liability took place,not when they accrued quotation omitted in re sunarhauserman,cir same in re continental airlines,congress was quite specific about which wage claims were to receive administrative priority and made it clear that the only wages which were to be given priority in b a were those for services rendered in re m group,it was not determinative that the payment of a lump sum severance was contingent on termination,which occurred.
it is similarly irrelevant whethe
