opinion of the court 
this appeal arises out of the chapter liquidation of kb toys and affiliated entities the debtors.pursuant to d,the residual trustee of the kbti sought to disallow certain trade claims that asm capital,and asm capital ii,llp,together,asm obtained from some of the creditors.under d,a bankruptcy claim can be disallowed if a claimant receives property that is avoidable or recoverable by the bankruptcy estate.see d.the issue here is whether a trade claim that is subject to disallowance under d in the hands of the original claimant is similarly disallowable in the hands of a subsequent transferee.for the reasons set forth herein,the answer is yes and thus,we will affirm.
creditors holding claims against an entity who has filed a chapter petition sometimes face a risky and lengthy bankruptcy process.to avoid this risk and expense,a creditor may look to sell its claim,a practice permitted under the bankruptcy rules.in re kreisler,cir citing fed.e.by selling its claim,a risk averse creditor can opt out of the bankruptcy process and obtain an immediate,albeit discounted,payment on the debt it is owed.see id.claim purchasers buy these claims and hope to receive a distribution from the debtor estate in excess of the price paid.see tally wiener nicholas malito,on the nature of the transferred bankruptcy claim.bus,some purchasers are simply investing with an eye towards receiving a distribution on claims in cash or readily liquidated property in excess of the purchase price.
a trade claim is usually transferred via contract.if a claim is transferred before a proof of claim is filed,federal rule of bankruptcy procedure e allows a transferee to file the proof of claim.see fed.e.if a claim is transferred after a proof of claim is filed,rule e requires a claims transferee to file an evidence of transfer with the bankruptcy court.see fed.e.
the debtors filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code on january,the petition date to liquidate all of their assets.on march,as required by a b iii,each debtor filed a statement of financial affairs sofa.each sofa required the disclosure of all payments made within the days immediately preceding the petition date.payments made during this day time period are potentially vulnerable to attack as avoidable preferences.see b a.
between april,and may,asm,which participates in the sale and purchase of bankruptcy claims nationwide,purchased the nine claims at issue in this appeal the claims via assignment agreements.the claims were originally held by various trade claimants the original claimants to whom the debtors owed money.the assignment agreements underlying the transfers of four of the claims contained a generic indemnification clause.five did not.each assignment agreement contained specific restitution provisions that dealt with risks particular to bankruptcy.these provisions shift the risk of disallowance back to the original claimant by requiring the original claimant to pay restitution to asm if the claim is disallowed 
each original claimant was listed on a sofa as receiving a payment within days of the petition date.the trustee brought preference against the original claimants,eventually obtaining a judgment in each case.the judgments against the original claimants were uncollectable because the original claimants all went out of business.asm purchased eight of the claims before the trustee commenced the preference actions and purchased one after the trustee obtained a judgment.
on july,the trustee filed an objection with the bankruptcy court seeking the disallowance of the claims pursuant to d.the trustee did not allege that asm itself received an avoidable transfer.instead,the trustee contended that the claims are disallowable under d because each original claimant received a preference before transferring its claim to asm.
after considering the language of d and its legislative history,the bankruptcy court disallowed the claims,concluding that a claims purchaser holding a trade claim is subject to the same d challenge as the original claimant.put differently,the bankruptcy court held that,under d,d isabilities attach to and travel with the claim.app.the bankruptcy court also observed that asm is a sophisticated entity,well aware of the bankruptcy process,who had access to both the sofa and the original claimants,and thus,was on constructive notice of the potential preference actions and could have discovered the potential for disallowance under d with very little due diligence.app.accordingly,the bankruptcy court held that asm was not entitled to protection as a good faith purchaser.
asm appealed the decision to the district court,which affirmed the bankruptcy court.the district court noted that it believed the plain language of d was ambiguous but it otherwise adopted the reasoning of the bankruptcy court.asm appealed 
section d of the bankruptcy code provides notwithstanding subsections a and b of this section,the court shall disallow any claim of any entity from which property is recoverable under section,or of this title or that is a transferee of a transfer avoidable under section f,h,or a of this title,unless such entity or transferee has paid the amount,or turned over any such property,for which such entity or transferee is liable under section i,or of this title.
d emphasis added.the issue in this case,which only concerns trade claims,turns on the interpretation of the phrase any claim of any entity.
the court analysis begins with the text of the statute.if the text is clear and unambiguous,this court must simply apply it.roth norfalco,cir when the meaning of statutory text is plain,our inquiry is at an end.yet courts must be mindful,particularly when examining the bankruptcy code,that statutory interpretation is a holistic endeavor.official comm.of unsecured creditors of cybergenics ex rel.cybergenics chinery,cir en banc quotation and citation omitted.consequently,courts must not be guided by a single sentence or member of a sentence,but look to the provisions of the whole law,and to its object and policy.id.quotation and citation omitted.if the statutory text is ambiguous,a court may look to the legislative history.blum stenson.
the language of d states that any claim of any entity who received an avoidable shall be disallowed.thus,the statute operates to render a category of claims disallowable those that belonged to an entity who had received an avoidable transfer.further,the statute provides that such claims can not be allowed until the entity who received the avoidable transfer,or the transferee,returns it to the estate.d stating that the trustee shall disallow such claims unless such entity or transferee has paid the amount,or turned over any such property,for which such entity or transferee is liable.accordingly,any claim falling into this category of claims is disallowable until the avoidable transfer is returned.because the statute focuses on claims and not claimants claims that are disallowable under d must be disallowed no matter who holds them.
to hold otherwise would contravene the aims of d,the first of which is to ensure equality of distribution of estate assets.enron springfield,in re enron enron ii,see also cybergenics,at noting that courts must look to a law object and policy when interpreting the law.if a transferred claim was protected from disallowance,an original claimant who received an avoidable transfer would have an incentive to sell its claim and wash the claim of any disability.after all,if the original claimant did not transfer its claim,the claim would be disallowed pursuant to d.if the original claimant could transfer the claim for value to a transferee,the original claimant would receive value for a claim that would otherwise be disallowed and the transferee,who would receive the claim washed of its disability,could then share in the distribution of estate assets.in short,the original claimant would have an incentive to sell its claim so it could receive some value for an otherwise valueless claim and the transferee would have an incentive to buy the claim because once the claim is in its hands,the claim is eligible t
