debtor elwood dean french appeals from the final judgment of the district court in this matter,affirming the bankruptcy court.see french peninsula bank.by its opinion of january,the bankruptcy court denied french discharge petition and awarded summary judgment to creditor mercantile peninsula bank peninsula on two independent grounds.see in re french.first,the bankruptcy court determined that french discharge petition should be denied because he had knowingly made false oaths during his bankruptcy proceedings.second,the court concluded that the petition should be denied because french had failed to keep and preserve adequate records from which his financial condition could be ascertained.french contends on appeal that the bankruptcy court erred by failing to apply the appropriate principles to its assessment of peninsula summary judgment motion,and that the district court erred in affirming that decision.more specifically,french maintains that there are genuine issues of material fact concerning whether he knowingly made false oaths in his bankruptcy proceedings,and whether he failed to keep and preserve adequate financial records.as explained below,we vacate and remand.
on october,french filed a chapter petition for bankruptcy relief in the middle district of florida,claiming that he was a florida resident and seeking to protect his florida residence from his creditors under the state homestead exemption on january,peninsula,one of french creditors,filed a complaint in the bankruptcy court,seeking the denial of french petition to discharge his debts.the complaint alleged that french had,inter alia,knowingly made false oaths in connection with his bankruptcy petition,in contravention of a a and failed to keep or preserve recorded information from which his financial condition could be ascertained,in contravention of a.following the filing of its complaint,peninsula,along with other creditors of french,filed a motion to transfer the florida bankruptcy case to the district of maryland for the convenience of the parties.the case was transferred on april.
on march,peninsula moved for summary judgment on its complaint,contending that french bankruptcy petition should be denied on the grounds asserted in its complaint.in support of its claim that french had knowingly made false oaths,peninsula referred the bankruptcy court to several examples of inconsistent statements that french had made under oath in connection with his bankruptcy proceedings,including statements that he had subsequently acknowledged as inaccurate.more particularly,peninsula focused on statements french had made concerning his entitlement to the florida homestead exemption,whether he was a resident of maryland or florida,and his financial interests in several partnerships and investment groups.with regard to its claim that french had failed to keep and preserve adequate financial records,peninsula relied on statements french had made indicating that he either had not kept or was unsure of the existence of certain records.these included records of the sale of new cherokee lanes,a corporation owned by french wife of any sources of than social security french may have had in of income he had received in and and of a transaction involving an entity called chesapeake group.
on march,french filed a memorandum opposing peninsula summary judgment motion.in responding to peninsula contention on false oaths,french maintained that there was a genuine issue of material fact on whether he had knowingly and intentionally made any false statements.in this regard,french offered his own affidavit,asserting that he had always sought to be truthful in his testimony in the bankruptcy proceedings,and maintaining that any inconsistencies in the evidence were the result of confusion,his failure to understand certain questions he had been asked in part because of his limited school unfamiliarity with legal terminology,and his inability to recall the information requested.french affidavit also stated that he had been preliminarily diagnosed with a medical condition that affected his memory,his understanding of language,and his ability to give full,complete,and consistent testimony.
with regard to his financial records,french affidavit asserted that,although he initially believed that he had lost many of the financial records sought,he eventually produced many of the records that peninsula had alleged were missing.more specifically,french advised that he had disclosed complete bank records,including all checks,check registers,bank statements,and deposit tickets,from his atlantic bank checking account,which he had used for all business and personal transactions in and records showing his personal monthly expenses for,and bank records for the two personal checking accounts he maintained in and tax returns for,and.french also explained that,early in the bankruptcy proceedings,he had not known of the existence or whereabouts of many of these records,but that he had subsequently located and produced in substantially all of the records peninsula and the trustee sought.
on april,french filed a memorandum and attached two additional affidavits from proposed expert witnesses.french first expert was daniel freedenburg,a psychiatrist who had examined french and whose affidavit specified that french was suffering from a progressive disorder in the nature of a dementia which adversely impacts his cognitive functions and which is particularly intensified under stressful situations,such as testimony in a deposition or hearing.freedenburg further asserted in his affidavit that w hile i am not yet prepared to label this disorder as alzheimer,i am of the opinion that french apparent difficulties at times in recollection,in organizing thoughts,and even in keeping full and accurate records,derive from this disorder rather than from a lack of honesty or effort.id.the freedenburg affidavit continued this problem causes him at times to provide inaccurate and sometimes even contradictory responses to questions despite a desire and effort to be truthful,a symptom i personally observed during my examination.id.moreover,freedenburg asserted that t his problem also exhibits itself in french inability at times to understand questions or terms used by a questioner in the same way as they are intended to be understood.id.
french second expert was charles fagan,a cpa,whose affidavit asserted that he had examined french financial records and concluded that they were reasonably sufficient to determine french financial condition for the years and.more specifically,fagan stated,while french is not able to document all transactions in detail,it is my opinion that the records he provided are sufficient to determine his financial condition in general terms without necessarily tracking each transaction.fagan advised that he had not yet examined french bank records for and thus had not formulated an opinion on the adequacy of french records relating to that year.
on may,peninsula filed an amended motion for summary judgment,asserting the same claims it had addressed in its earlier motion,and providing additional examples of inconsistent statements french had made in connection with his bankruptcy proceedings.on june,french filed a memorandum opposing peninsula amended summary judgment motion,again asserting that genuine issues of material fact were apparent on peninsula claims that he had knowingly made false oaths and that he had failed to keep and preserve adequate financial records.several months later,on september,the bankruptcy court heard oral argument on peninsula amended summary judgment motion.at the conclusion of the argument,the court announced from the bench that it would grant peninsula motion for summary judgment and deny the discharge in bankruptcy sought by french.
more than two years later,on january,the bankruptcy court entered its memorandum opinion and order awarding summary judgment to peninsula and denying french the discharge he had sought.see in re french,the bankruptcy opinion the bankruptcy opinion concluded that french had made false oaths and had failed to keep and preserve adequate financial records,and that each of those grounds warranted the denial of his discharge in bankruptcy.the court rejected french position that the inaccuracies in his testimony were the result of misunderstandings and his impaired mental function,concluding that french was not credible and declining to give any weight to freedenburg affidavit.specifically,the court explained that g iven the importance of honesty in the administration of bankruptcy proceedings,this court will not reward a dishonest debtor with the privilege of a discharge merely because of a doctor excuse that the debtor is a compulsive liar.bankruptcy opinion.additionally,the court asserted that t he timing of the false statements alone is enough for this court to determine that they were intended to reach a certain result.id.at.the court,however,failed to assess whether a reasonable trier of fact,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to french,would be entitled to conclude that his inconsistent statements were made innocently.
with respect to the claim concerning french preservation of financial records,the bankruptcy court asserted that the condition of french financial records had placed an intolerable burden upon the court,the trustee and the creditors of the estate to attempt a reconstruction of the financial affairs of the debtor and his various entities.bankruptcy opinion.specifically,the court relied on deficiencies in records of the sale of new cherokee lanes and records of french income in.furthermore,it concluded that french initial denials that he had maintained the requested records caused unreasonable delay and expense to creditors.id.at.the court failed,however,to mention or assess the fagan affidavit.moreover,as with its evaluation of peninsula contention on false oaths,the court did not discuss whether a reasonable trier of fact,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to french,would be entitled to find that french had satisfied his obligation with regard to financial records.
french thereafter appealed the bankruptcy court rulings to the district court for the district of maryland,pursuant to a.on february,the district court entered its memorandum opinion and order affirming the bankruptcy court.see french peninsula bank,the district court opinion it agreed that no genuine issues of material fact existed concerning whether french had knowingly made false oaths and whether he had kept and preserved adequate financial records.see district court opinion,at.although the district court also did not discuss the fagan affidavit,it concluded that,according all reasonable inferences to french,the freedenburg affidavit did not create a genuine issue of material fact with respect to peninsula claims.see id.at.
french has timely appealed,and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to.
we review de novo a bankruptcy court award of summary judgment and a district court affirmance thereof.in re ballard,cir.in bankruptcy,summary judgment is governed in the first instance by federal rule of bankruptcy procedure,which expressly incorporates into bankruptcy proceedings the standards of federal rule of civil procedure.a court may award summary judgment only when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see anderson liberty lobby,d in re apex express,cir see also fed.civ.proc.c providing that award of summary judgment is appropriate only if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.in evaluating a summary judgment motion,a court must consider whether a reasonable jury could find in favor of the party,taking all inferences to be drawn from the underlying facts in the light most favorable to the.apex express,at.in so doing,a court is not entitled to either weigh the evidence or make credibility determinations.see anderson,at.credibility determinations,the weighing of the evidence,and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions,not those of a judge.if the moving party is unable to demonstrate the absence of any genuine issue of material fact,summary judgment is not proper and must be denied.see celotex catrett,d honor hamilton,cir.
put simply,french contends on appeal that the bankruptcy court erred in failing to apply the applicable summary judgment principles in its evaluation of peninsula motion.more specifically,french asserts that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to each of peninsula grounds for the denial of his discharge petition,and that summary judgment was thus inappropriate.we address in turn the rulings of the bankruptcy opinion on peninsula two french knowingly made false oaths and that he failed to keep and preserve adequate financial records.
french first contends that the bankruptcy court erred in awarding summary judgment on the basis of peninsula claim that he knowingly made false oaths during his bankruptcy proceedings.the bankruptcy code provides that a debtor seeking chapter relief shall be granted a discharge of his debts unless the debtor knowingly and fraudulently,in or in connection with the case made a false oath or account.a a.in order to be denied a discharge under this provision,the debtor must have made a statement under oath which he knew to be false,and he must have made the statement willfully,with the intent to defraud.williamson fireman fund ins,cir.significantly,in evaluating a claim under a a,we have recognized that the question of whether a debtor has made a false oath is generally a question of fact.see id.
on appeal,french focuses on the essential element of intent,maintaining that a genuine issue of material fact is present on whether he made any false statements with an intent to defraud.in particular,french points to his personal affidavit,in which he maintains that any inaccurate or inconsistent statements he made under oath in the bankruptcy proceedings were the result of confusion or impaired mental function.he also relies on freedenburg affidavit,in which french psychiatrist opined that french suffers from a progressive cognitive disease that makes it difficult for him to answer questions accurately.based on these affidavits,french contends that a genuine issue exists as to whether he possessed the intent to defraud essential for a denial of discharge under a a 
notwithstanding the evidence forecast by these affidavits,the bankruptcy court concluded that there was no genuine issue of material fact as to french intent to defraud.in so ruling,the court made several points.first,the court observed that the timing of french inaccurate statements indicated that they were made with an intent to defraud.second,the court made known that it simply disbelieved the freedenburg affidavit,describing it as a doctor excuse that the debtor is a compulsive liar.bankruptcy opinion.third,the court indicated that,even if the freedenburg affidavit was correct,it would nonetheless deny french a discharge because of the importance of honesty in the administration of bankruptcy proceedings.id.
in these circumstances,we conclude that the bankruptcy court erred and that a genuine issue of material fact exists on whether french made false statements in his bankruptcy proceedings with an intent to defraud.although the court evaluated french affidavit and the freedenburg affidavit,it did not address the question central to the assessment of peninsula summary judgment motion whether a reasonable trier of fact,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to french,could have found that he lacked the fraudulent intent necessary to deny him a discharge under a a.see in re apex express,cir recognizing that court must consider whether a reasonable jury could find in favor of the party,taking all inferences to be drawn from the underlying facts in the light most favorable to the.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to french the party,a reasonable factfinder could,in this case,readily conclude that french lacked the requisite intent to make false oaths.this is particularly so in light of the expert medical evidence indicating that french inaccuracies were likely the result of a mental impairment,plus french own affidavit that he did not intend to mislead the court 
in its ruling,the bankruptcy court also made credibility determinations which are not appropriate in a court assessment of a motion for summary judgment.we have recognized that,in evaluating a a a claim,a determination concerning fraudulent intent depends largely upon an assessment of the credibility and demeanor of the debtor.williamson,at.in awarding summary judgment to peninsula,the bankruptcy court made credibility determinations on both french and freedenburg proffered testimony,and specifically rejected their testimony as unreliable.in the summary judgment context,a court is simply not empowered to make such determinations.see anderson liberty lobby,d credibility determinations are jury functions,not those of a judge.in these circumstances,the bankruptcy court erred in awarding summary judgment to peninsula on the ground that french made false oaths during his bankruptcy proceedings 
french next contends that the bankruptcy court erred in awarding summary judgment on the basis of peninsula claim that he had failed to keep and preserve adequate financial records.the bankruptcy code provides that a debtor seeking chapter relief shall be granted a discharge of his debts unless 
the debtor has concealed,destroyed,mutilated,falsified,or failed to keep or preserve any recorded information,including books,documents,records,and papers,from which the debtor financial condition or business transactions might be ascertained,unless such act or failure to act was justified under all of the circumstances of the case.
a.thus,a party objecting to a bankruptcy discharge petition on this basis must make an initial showing that the debtor failed to keep and preserve adequate financial records,and such a failure makes it impossible to ascertain the debtor financial condition.see a see also meridian bank alten,cir.
on appeal,french contends that there is a genuine issue of material fact on whether he maintained adequate records from which his financial condition could be ascertained.in assessing this contention,we must first review the obligations of a debtor under a.although we have not heretofore addressed this specific point in a published decision,several other courts of appeals have done so these courts have consistently determined that a debtor books need not be perfect nor follow any particular system.noroian hern,cir see also in re schifano,cir concluding that bankruptcy code does not require perfect bookkeeping meridian bank,at the bankruptcy code does not require a debtor seeking a discharge specifically to maintain a bank account,nor does it require an impeccable system of bookkeeping.
the essential requirement of a under these authorities is,as the third circuit has explained,that the records sufficiently identify the transactions so that intelligent inquiry can be made of them.the test is whether there is available written evidence made and preserved from which the present financial condition of the bankrupt,and his business transactions for a reasonable period in the past may be ascertained.meridian bank,at internal quotation marks omitted see also schifano,at concluding that records preserved must reasonably allow court and parties to ascertain accurate picture of debtor financial affairs noroian,at all that is required is that a competent accountant should be able to determine from such books and records the financial condition of the bankrupt.in re greene,the appropriate inquiry is whether the debtor kept records which would allow creditors to ascertain the debtor present financial condition and business transactions over a reasonable period of time.the bankruptcy code does not demand perfection,but it does require debtors to maintain records in a manner that is reasonable under the circumstances of the particular case.internal citations omitted in re baxter,a debtor records must at least reasonably allow for the reconstruction of the debtor financial condition to meet the requirements of the bankruptcy code.internal quotation marks omitted.we are content with the principle that a bankruptcy debtor is not required to maintain perfect records.a debtor is,however,obliged by the statute to preserve sufficient and adequate financial records to enable the court and the parties to reasonably ascertain an accurate picture of his financial affairs.
although the parties did not take issue with the foregoing principle,peninsula makes two contentions on appeal concerning its applicability to the circumstances of french discharge petition.first,peninsula contends that it is entitled to summary judgment on its inadequate records claim because french was a sophisticated debtor and thus should be held to a higher standard.in the bankruptcy opinion,the bankruptcy court agreed on that point.the court then determined that,because it found french to be a sophisticated businessman,he should have better maintained his business records.although the sophistication factor may be important in assessing a denial of discharge under a,whether french was a sophisticated debtor was itself a contested fact,and such a finding does not,in any event,justify an award of summary judgment to peninsula.instead,as the third circuit explained,the level of a debtor sophistication is simply another factor that a trier of fact may take into account in determining whether a debtor maintained sufficient records.see meridian bank,at concluding that bankruptcy code requires trier of fact to make determination on adequacy of debtor records and his justification for not maintaining certain records based on all circumstances,including the education,experience,and sophistication of the debtor the volume of the debtor business the complexity of the debtor business the amount of credit extended to debtor in his business and any other circumstances that should be considered in the interest of justice internal quotation marks omitted.
next,peninsula contends that it is entitled to summary judgment on its inadequate records claim because french did not disclose the requested financial records in a timely fashion.specifically,it contends that,although french eventually produced an abundance of records,such production occurred after he had already informed the trustee that he believed the requested records had been destroyed or that they did not exist.thus,peninsula asserts that the bankruptcy court properly ruled that by denying the existence of certain records that were later produced by his attorney,french caused unreasonable delay and expense to creditors who were entitled to have him make full disclosure of his financial records.bankruptcy opinion.again,whether the timeliness of a debtor disclosure of records caused a delay for the parties in adequately ascertaining his financial condition is a factor that a trier of fact may assess in its determination as to whether he has satisfied the standard of a 
finally,we must assess whether there is a genuine issue of material fact concerning whether the records french disclosed would permit the parties to reasonably ascertain his financial condition.french asserts that,although his records are not complete,there is a question of fact as to whether an accurate picture of his financial affairs can be developed.in so maintaining,french points to his affidavit,where he explains that,despite his statements in earlier proceedings that there were significant gaps in his recordkeeping,he ultimately was able to produce records of his income,expenses,and banking transactions for several years prior to the filing of his bankruptcy petition.french also points to the fagan affidavit,where his expert asserts that the records are sufficient to ascertain his financial condition except,perhaps,for the year.based on these affidavits,french contends that a genuine issue of fact exists on whether he adequately kept and preserved his financial records.
notwithstanding the evidence forecast by french,the bankruptcy court ruled against him,concluding that there
