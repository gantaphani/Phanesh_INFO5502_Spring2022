years after dow corning corporation filed a petition for reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy code,and following extensive and vigorous negotiations,the third proposed plan of reorganization for dow was submitted to the bankruptcy court.the bankruptcy court confirmed the amended joint plan of reorganization for dow and the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court confirmation order.certain claimants who voted against the plan appealed.the first principal issue presented here is whether a bankruptcy court may enjoin a creditor claims against a to facilitate a reorganization plan under chapter of the bankruptcy code.for the following reasons,we affirm the district court conclusion that,under certain circumstances,a bankruptcy court may enjoin a creditor claim against a to facilitate a chapter plan of reorganization.however,the factual findings of the bankruptcy court do not demonstrate that such an injunction is appropriate in this case.therefore,we remand to the district court.the second issue presented is whether the plan classification of foreign claimants complies with the bankruptcy code classification requirements.for the following reasons we affirm the bankruptcy court determination regarding the plan classification.
for nearly thirty years,dow was the predominant producer of silicone gel breast implants,accounting for almost fifty percent of the entire market.in addition,dow supplied silicone raw materials to other manufacturers of silicone gel breast implants.
in the,certain medical studies suggested that silicone gel may cause tissue diseases such as lupus,scleroderma and rheumatoid arthritis.in,the food and drug administration ordered that silicone gel implants be taken off the market and dow ceased manufacturing and marketing its silicone implants.soon thereafter,tens of thousands of implant recipients sued dow and its two shareholders,the dow chemical company and corning,incorporated,claiming to have been injured by reactions to the silicone in their implants.other manufacturers and suppliers of silicone gel implants were named as with dow and its shareholders.
the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation consolidated the breast implant litigation for administration of matters.see in re silicone gel breast implants prods.liab.the consolidated litigation led to a proposed billion global settlement,which the multidistrict litigation court approved in.see lindsey dow corning in re silicone gel breast implant prods.liab.litig,no.cv,civ.no,wl,at.however,hundreds of thousands more women than anticipated filed claims with the global settlement fund and the settlement collapsed in.
later that year,dow filed a petition for reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy code.in order to reduce its exposure to claims,immediately after it filed for bankruptcy,dow sought to transfer all of the breast implant actions,including actions against its shareholders,to the eastern district of michigan.likewise,other breast implant manufacturers also requested that the cases against them be transferred to the eastern district of michigan.because of dow bankruptcy,the court granted dow request as to the claims against dow,but denied the transfer of the claims against dow shareholders and the other breast implant manufacturers.see in re dow corning.we reversed the district court,holding that the district court had jurisdiction over dow shareholders and the other breast implant manufacturers,and remanded the requested transfers for analysis under abstention principles.see in re dow corning,cir.on remand,the district court declined to exercise jurisdiction over dow shareholders and the other breast implant manufacturers based on its interpretation of abstention principles.see in re dow corning,wl,at.july.on a motion for a writ of mandamus,we reversed the district court ruling with respect to dow shareholders.see in re dow corning,cir.the district court then transferred all breast implant claims against dow shareholders to the eastern district of michigan.
the trustee in bankruptcy appointed several committees to represent the differing interests of dow claimants during the development of dow plan of reorganization.the tort claimants committee vigorously opposed dow first two proposed reorganization plans.dow then entered into mediation with the committees,and on february,dow and the tort claimants committee submitted the amended joint plan of reorganization to the bankruptcy court.on november,the bankruptcy court confirmed the plan.in the following weeks,it issued seven separate opinions relating to its confirmation order the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court confirmation order on november.in re dow corning.a timely appeal to this court followed.
because the bankruptcy court opinions and the district court opinion provide a detailed examination of the plan,we discuss only the portions of the plan that bear upon our decision.
under the plan,a billion fund is established for the payment of claims asserted by personal injury claimants,government health care payers,and other creditors asserting claims related to products liability claims.the billion fund is established with funds contributed by dow products liability insurers,dow shareholders and dow operating cash reserves.as a quid pro quo for making proceeds available for the billion fund,section of the plan releases dow insurers and shareholders from all further liability on claims arising out of settled personal injury claims,and section permanently enjoins any party holding a claim released against dow from bringing an action related to that claim against dow insurers or shareholders.plan.
under the plan,claimants who choose to settle are channeled to the settlement facility,a legal entity created by the plan and authorized to negotiate payments out of funds set aside for that purpose.claimants who choose to litigate are channeled to the litigation facility,a legal entity created by the plan that is essentially substituted for dow as a defendant in the claimant lawsuit.
the plan divides claims and interests into classes and subclasses.classes and are composed of foreign claimants who are given the opportunity to either settle or litigate their claims.settlement payments to foreign breast implant claimants are between and of the amounts to be paid to domestic claimants.
class is composed of all government payer claimants,namely,the united states and the governments of the canadian provinces of alberta and manitoba.class voted against the plan.the united states filed claims under the medicare secondary payer program,b,and the federal medical care recovery act,which grant the united states the right to recover from insurers and other third parties,the cost of medical care that,though the legal responsibility of another party,has been paid for or provided through a federal health benefit program.
class claims not resolved before the plan confirmation date are liquidated through the litigation facility.canada claimants recovering through either the settlement facility or the litigation facility are required to notify the claims administrator of any unresolved subrogation claims or liens held by the canadian provinces.the claims administrator is under a duty to determine whether one of the canadian provinces has a claim with respect to an impending canada claimant payment,and to notify the province of its potential claim.the claims administrator must hold the claimant payment in a trust until he receives instructions from the claimant and the canadian province that they have reached an agreement as to the appropriate allocation of a settlement payment.if no agreement is reached,the dispute is referred to a court for resolution.
the united states claims are not accorded similar protection.the plan does not specifically permit the united states to interfere with payment to a claimant.once a specific claimant has been paid,the united states claims against dow,and all other entities created by the plan,are cut off for costs related to that claimant.
the bankruptcy court confirmed the plan,but construed the release and injunction provisions to apply only to consenting creditors.in re dow corning,at.although the bankruptcy court determined that it has authority under the bankruptcy code to enjoin a creditor claims against,it decided,based on law,that such injunctions are inappropriate as applied to creditors,and construed the plan accordingly.id.the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court confirmation order but reversed the bankruptcy court interpretation of the release and injunction provisions of the plan.the district court interpreted the release and injunction provisions of the plan to apply to all creditors,consenting and.
in a bankruptcy proceeding,the bankruptcy court is the finder of fact.in re caldwell,cir.when a district court acts as an appellate court as it does in a bankruptcy proceeding,it reviews the bankruptcy court factual findings under the clearly erroneous standard,and its conclusions of law de novo.id.in appeals from the decision of a district court on appeal from the bankruptcy court,the court of appeals independently reviews the bankruptcy court decision,applying the clearly erroneous standard to findings of fact and de novo review to conclusions of law.in re madaj,cir quoting in re century boat,cir.we review the district court legal conclusions de novo.in re downs,cir.
the first issue we are asked to decide is whether a bankruptcy court has the authority to enjoin a creditor claims against a to facilitate a reorganization plan under chapter of the bankruptcy code.this is a question of first impression in this circuit.
the bankruptcy code does not explicitly prohibit or authorize a bankruptcy court to enjoin a creditor claims against a to facilitate a reorganization plan.in re continental airlines,cir.however,bankruptcy courts,as courts of equity,have broad authority to modify relationships.united states energy resources,d.for example,section a of the bankruptcy code grants a bankruptcy court the broad authority to issue any order,process,or judgment that is necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this title.a.this section grants the bankruptcy court the power to take appropriate equitable measures needed to implement other sections of the code.see in re granger garage,cir.
consistent with section a broad grant of authority,the code allows bankruptcy courts considerable discretion to approve plans of reorganization.energy resources,at.section b permits a reorganization plan to include any appropriate provision not inconsistent with the applicable provisions of this title.b.thus,the bankruptcy court,as a forum for resolving large and complex mass litigations,has substantial power to reorder relations needed to achieve a successful reorganization.for example,under the doctrine of marshaling of assets,t he bankruptcy court has the power to order a creditor who has two funds to satisfy his debt to resort to the fund that will not defeat other creditors.in re robins,cir.moreover,it is an ancient but very much alive doctrine that a creditor has no right to choose which of two funds will pay his claim.id.likewise,when a plan provides for the full payment of all claims,enjoining claims against a so as not to defeat reorganization is consistent with the bankruptcy court primary function.see id.for the foregoing reasons,such an injunction is not inconsistent with the code,and is authorized by section b.
nevertheless,some courts have found that the bankruptcy code does not permit enjoining a creditor claims against a.see in re lowenschuss,cir in re western real estate fund,cir.these courts primarily rely on section e of the code,which provides that the discharge of the debt of the debtor does not affect the liability of any other entity on,or the property of any other entity for,such debt.e.however,this language explains the effect of a debtor discharge.it does not prohibit the release of a.see in re specialty equip,cir this language does not purport to limit or restrict the power of the bankruptcy court to otherwise grant a release to a third party.republic supply shoaf,cir in re robins,at.
the bankruptcy court concluded that releases were authorized by section b,but were precluded by a law limitation on the bankruptcy court equity power.in re dow corning,at.we disagree.the bankruptcy court cited grupo mexicano de desarrollo alliance bond fund,d,for the proposition that a court use of its general equity powers is confined within the broad boundaries of traditional equitable relief.the grupo mexicano court explained that,the equity jurisdiction of the federal courts is the jurisdiction in equity exercised by the high court of chancery in england at the time of the adoption of the constitution and the enactment of the original judiciary act.id.at.quoting dobie,handbook of federal jurisdiction and procedure.based upon this principle,the grupo mexicano court vacated an injunction preventing a toll road operator from dissipating,transferring,or encumbering its only assets to the prejudice of an unsecured note holder because traditional equity jurisprudence did not allow such remedies until a debt had been established.id.at.the bankruptcy court,applying the grupo mexicano analysis,concluded that,releases were also unprecedented in traditional equity jurisprudence,and therefore exceeded the bankruptcy court equitable powers.in re dow corning,at.
the district court rejected this argument on the grounds that the releases were authorized by sufficient statutory authority under the bankruptcy code.in re dow corning,at.for the following reasons,we agree with the district court.in grupo mexicano,the supreme court distinguished its own holding from that in united states first national city bank,d.at.first national approved an injunction preventing a bank from transferring any of a taxpayer assets.at.the grupo mexicano court distinguished that holding on the grounds that the first national case involved not the court general equitable powers under the judiciary act of,but its powers under the statute authorizing tax injunctions.grupo mexicano,at.thus,because the district court had a statutory basis for issuing such an injunction,it was not confined to traditional equity jurisprudence available at the enactment of the judiciary act of.the statute in first national gave courts the power to grant injunctions necessary or appropriate for the enforcement of the internal revenue laws.a.similarly,the bankruptcy code gives bankruptcy courts the power to grant injunctions necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of the bankruptcy code.a.we conclude that due to this statutory grant of power,the bankruptcy court is not confined to traditional equity jurisprudence and therefore,the bankruptcy court grupo mexicano analysis was misplaced.
because we determine that enjoining a creditor claim against a is not inconsistent with the code and that grupo mexicano does not preclude such an injunction,we turn to when such an injunction is an appropriate provision of a reorganization plan pursuant to section b.because such an injunction is a dramatic measure to be used cautiously,we follow those circuits that have held that enjoining a creditor claim is only appropriate in unusual circumstances.see in re drexel burnham lambert group,cir in re robins,at macarthur,cir.in determining whether there are unusual circumstances,our sister circuits have considered a number of factors,which are summarized in our holding below.we hold that when the following seven factors are present,the bankruptcy court may enjoin a creditor claims against a there is an identity of interests between the debtor and the third party,usually an indemnity relationship,such that a suit against the is,in essence,a suit against the debtor or will deplete the assets of the estate the has contributed substantial assets to the reorganization the injunction is essential to reorganization,namely,the reorganization hinges on the debtor being free from indirect suits against parties who would have indemnity or contribution claims against the debtor the impacted class,or classes,has overwhelmingly voted to accept the plan the plan provides a mechanism to pay for all,or substantially all,of the class or classes affected by the injunction the plan prov
