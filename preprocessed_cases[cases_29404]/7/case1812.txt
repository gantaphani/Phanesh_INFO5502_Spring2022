security farms,and other central california growers growers,all unsecured creditors,seek review of the bankruptcy court approval of a chapter reorganization plan submitted by local of the international brotherhood of teamsters local.the principal issue is whether the local international parent union international has an equity interest in the local by virtue of the provision in the contract between the local and the international that upon the local liquidation,its assets will escheat to the international for two years or until the local is reorganized.if the provision does indicate an equity interest,then the international would have to provide new value to the local to prevent its liquidation.see b b.
there is also an issue as to whether the collective bargaining agreement itself and the future dues owed the local should be considered as assets that would be distributed in a chapter liquidation.if so,the plan would violate the best interests of the creditor rule codified at a a ii.the creditors also attack the bankruptcy court determination that the debtor proposed the plan in good faith.
the bankruptcy court held that the international did not have an equity interest in the debtor that would entitle the international to be treated like a shareholder or equivalent holder of an equity interest in a corporation.it followed the only circuit court decision involving application of the absolute priority rule to a corporation.see in re wabash valley power ass n,cir.the district court affirmed,and we agree.the district court also affirmed the bankruptcy court holding that the plan did not violate the best interests rule.we agree as well,because the creditors could not get more on dissolution of the local than they would get under the proposed reorganization.it was the overall finding of the bankruptcy court,also affirmed by the district court on appeal,that the plan was proposed in good faith.this finding is entitled to deference and there was no clear error.we therefore affirm.
the local led its members in a strike in.violence ensued during the strike,and growers sued the local.the trial court found for growers,who were awarded damages of,along with fees of and penalties of.the local then filed for bankruptcy under chapter of the bankruptcy code.
in,the bankruptcy court confirmed a reorganization plan proposed by the local to resolve its financial obligations to growers and other creditors.under the plan,the local was to sell all its equity in real property and its assets or take a reorganization loan in the amount of its equity and assets,and deposit the proceeds in a bank account.the account would then be used by the local to pay its creditors.the plan also made available to creditors any gain realized by the local if it sold or refinanced assets in the five years after the plan confirmation.when the international lien on the local real property was satisfied the only secured claim,the local calculated that it would have to pay unsecured obligations consisting principally of the damages awarded to growers.
growers appealed the bankruptcy court decision to accept this plan.in particular,growers averred that the reorganization plan violated their rights as general unsecured creditors because it did not recognize the international or the local members as equity holders,and did not treat the local collective bargaining agreement and future member dues as assets.moreover,growers believed that the reorganization plan was not proposed in good faith because it allowed the local to continue operating with its financial affairs essentially unchanged without raising member dues to pay creditors.
the district court reviewed growers appeal and affirmed the bankruptcy court,finding that none of growers legal theories justified reversing the bankruptcy court balancing of bankruptcy law and labor law principles.growers then filed this timely appeal.
ii.whether the international has an equity interest in the local 
the bankruptcy code establishes a strict priority for satisfaction of obligations of a debtor.b b.claims of equity holders are always junior to claims of both secured and unsecured creditors.see everett perez in re perez,cir.under the new value exception that this circuit recognizes,an equity holder may retain its interest only if it contributes sufficient new value to ensure successful reorganization.see case los angeles lumber prods.bonner mall bancorp mortgage in re bonner mall,cir.
the absolute priority rule is generally applied to corporations facing bankruptcy,where an equity owner seeks to retain property,often represented by stock.see,norwest bank worthington ahlers,d pac.ry.boyd.see also john ayer,rethinking absolute priority after ahlers,discussing how the goal of limiting collusion between secured creditors and stockholders in private sector railroad ventures gave rise to the absolute priority rule.the only apparent circuit decision to deal directly with the issue of whether entities affiliated with a organization have equity interests for purposes of the absolute priority rule held that they did not because the essence of an equity interest was an ownership or an interest in the organization profit.see wabash,at.
in wabash,the seventh circuit considered the situation of the wabash valley power association,a cooperative controlled by members who were themselves electric utility cooperatives.the wabash cooperative filed for bankruptcy after an investment in nuclear power.a creditor then claimed that wabash reorganization plan violated the absolute priority rule in part because it allowed wabash members to retain control of it.the court held that compliance with the absolute priority rule depended on whether the members held an equity interest,and whether they retained property in the cooperative because of that interest.id.at.the court held they did not because members of the cooperative could not use whatever control they had over the utility cooperative to generate present or future profits from it and the members did not have an ownership interest in corporate assets.where control does not convey the ability to make commercial decisions that generate profits or corporate ownership,there is no property retained on account of an equity interest and therefore no absolute priority problem.id.at.since the cooperative members had no equity interest,the plan did not violate the absolute priority rule.
growers attempt to distinguish wabash on three principal grounds.first,they contend that local unions are really subdivisions of the parent national or international organizations and are therefore unlike the independent electric utility cooperatives that banded together to create the electricity generating association in wabash.
it is true that local unions are generally required to abide by the national organization constitution.see william leiserson,american trade union democracy myron roomkin,union structure,internal control,and strike activity indus.lab.rel.it does not follow,however,that the international controls the local or profits from it,so that bankruptcy laws should regard the international as an owner that can be forced to choose between making contributions sufficient to sustain the local or causing the local to be liquidated.such a choice makes eminent good sense in the context of a corporation in bankruptcy.such a corporation equity owners should be required to choose between contributing value or forcing liquidation of their interest in a commercial venture.this is because the equity owners only concern is with the profitability of the corporation,and the decision is purely an economic one.this is what the seventh circuit recognized in wabash.at when associated with an equity interest in a business corporation,control contributes to the premium investors are willing to pay for a controlling interest in a business corporation.
in the labor relations context,the absolute priority rule makes even less sense than it did in the electric utility context in wabash.labor unions are governed by a unique set of labor relations laws that are designed in large measure to insure that the workers are represented by the collective bargain
