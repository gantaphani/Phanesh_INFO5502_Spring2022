opinion of the court 
in this matter of first impression for the courts of appeals,we must decide whether a restitution order from a state criminal prosecution for theft by deception,which directs payment to the fraud victim,is exempt from a chapter bankruptcy discharge under a this case distills into a judgment between the literal language of this bankruptcy code provision and federalism doctrine as expounded by the supreme court in kelly robinson,d.having determined that the supreme court meant what it said in kelly when it held that a preserves from discharge any condition a state criminal court imposes as part of a criminal sentence,id.at.emphasis added,we will affirm the judgment of the district court.in this case,at least,federalism concerns embodied in a long tradition of courts unwillingness to discharge monetary obligations that form part of a state criminal judgment when applying federal bankruptcy statutes,and congress deference to that tradition,trump a literal reading of the statutory text.we thus hold that a preserves from discharge thompson state criminal restitution debt.
in october,robert hewitt hired gerald thompson,a developer with cash flow problems,to build a house.unbeknownst to hewitt,thompson diverted some of hewitt materials payments to other projects,to the tune of over.by the time hewitt became aware of thompson deceit,the complete house hewitt had paid for was a doorless skeleton without an exterior finish.
hewitt lodged a criminal complaint against thompson in the superior court of new jersey,cape may county.the criminal case was pursued by a county prosecutor.thereafter,thompson filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter,an action he soon converted to chapter.hewitt was listed as a creditor and received notice of the filing and of the deadlines in the case.though the debt thompson owed hewitt was the result of deception,hewitt did not object to the discharge of the debt under a a or a,which except from discharge debts arising from fraud and larceny,respectively.hewitt merely sent a letter protesting discharge to the chapter trustee thompson received his chapter discharge on february.he filed a chapter bankruptcy petition on february.
on january,thompson pled guilty to issuing bad checks in the criminal case that originated with hewitt complaint.on april,thompson was sentenced to,inter alia,five years probation and restitution.the restitution was payable at per month through the cape may probation department.the restitution payments were to be forwarded to hewitt and another of thompson victims.
thompson filed this action for injunctive relief as part of his chapter bankruptcy to determine whether thompson obligations to hewitt under the restitution order were discharged in the chapter case 
thompson conceded at oral argument that neither a nor any other bankruptcy code provision empowers a federal court to enjoin the continuance of a state criminal proceeding to collect a debt incurred through fraud thompson also acknowledged that a federal court would be powerless to block a state court from imposing some other punishment,such as incarceration,upon a debtor as a substitute for his restitution obligation.rather,thompson argues that the payable to and for the benefit of a governmental unit qualifier of a,and this court interpretation of the clause in in re rashid,cir per curiam,compels us to prohibit new jersey from collecting through the criminal restitution order thompson debt to hewitt that was discharged in the chapter proceeding.we believe kelly forecloses thompson preferred result,and that rashid and the case it principally relied upon,in re towers,cir,invite our disposition of this case.
kelly involved a connecticut welfare cheat,carolyn robinson,who pled guilty to larceny.at.as part of her sentence,the connecticut superior court ordered robinson to pay restitution to the state probation office in the amount of welfare benefits she wrongfully received.id.robinson filed a chapter bankruptcy petition three months later.id.at.when the probation office informed robinson that it considered the restitution obligation to have survived her discharge,robinson filed a declaratory judgment action to determine whether a rendered the restitution nondischargeable.id.at.
section a contains three criteria,each of which a creditor must establish to prevail.the debt must be a fine,penalty,or forfeiture,subject to the qualifications that it is payable to and for the benefit of a governmental unit and is not compensation for actual pecuniary loss.kelly began its analysis by observing that under the bankruptcy act of,courts,exercising their traditional reluctan ce to interpret federal bankruptcy statutes to remit state criminal judgments,at,had established an exception to bankruptcy discharge for criminal sentences,including restitution orders.id.at.because congress had not explicitly abrogated this judicial exception in the bankruptcy code,under the normal rule of statutory construction,the court determined restitution remained in the class of penalties excepted from discharge.id.at.as it would several times in the opinion,the court iterated that its primary interpretive heuristic for the bankruptcy code must reflect the basis for this judicial exception,a deep conviction that federal bankruptcy courts should not invalidate the results of state criminal proceedings.id.again emphasizing that by its failure to explicitly address the longstanding judicial exception to the discharge of state criminal restitution orders in the bankruptcy code,congress seemingly accepted it,the court continued 
we do not think congress lightly would limit the rehabilitative and deterrent options available to state criminal judges this court has recognized that the states interest in administering their criminal justice systems free from federal interference is one of the most powerful of the considerations that should influence a court considering equitable types of relief.citing younger harris,d.this reflection of our federalism must influence our interpretation of the bankruptcy code in this case.
regarding the second of the two qualifying clauses of a,though the restitution appeared to be calibrated to the penny of robinson wrongful receipts,the court did not consider the restitution to be compensation for the state actual pecuniary loss.id.at.because the decision to impose restitution generally does not turn on the victim injury,but on the penal goals of the state,and the situation of the defendant,the court reasoned,restitution orders are primarily intended to effectuate the state penal and rehabilitative interests,and are only incidentally assessed to compensate the victim.id.at.accordingly,thompson restitution order fits a fine,penalty,or forfeiture rubric,and was not compensation for hewitt actual pecuniary loss.
the first qualifying clause of a,that the debt be payable to and for the benefit of a governmental unit,was not in doubt in restitution was payable to the state probation office,and the payments would be added to connecticut treasury.tellingly,however,the court,reading the provision to create a broad exception for all penal sanctions,id.at,went out of its way to engage this qualifying clause and to stress that it posed no serious threat to criminal restitution orders imposed by a state.the court declared uncategorically that in its view neither of the qualifying clauses of a allows the discharge of a criminal judgment that takes the form of restitution.id.at.
the only meaningful factual difference between kelly and this case is the identity of the victim.whereas in kelly,the state welfare agency was defrauded and the state itself would receive the debtor restitution payments,here the recipient is an individual.where,as here,state criminal restitution orders are implicated,however,this distinction does not seem to matter under kelly,and we are to give great weight to the supreme court considered dicta in limning the breadth of situations its decisions govern.see in re mcdonald,cir w e should not idly ignore considered statements the supreme court makes in dicta.the supreme court uses dicta to help control and influence the m
