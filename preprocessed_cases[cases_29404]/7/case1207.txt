this appeal from the dismissal of a class action presents novel issues at the intersection of bankruptcy and class action law.a procedural chronology will help in framing them.
april.david morlan files this class action suit as the representative of a class of insurance agents of the defendants,affiliated insurance companies that maintain employee welfare benefit plans.morlan suit charges that the defendants,in breach of the fiduciary duty that erisa imposes on fiduciaries of pension and welfare plans,see a,improperly treated him and the other members of the class as independent contractors,when actually they were employees of the defendants and so were entitled to the health,vacation,and other benefits to which the defendants plans entitled the defendants acknowledged employees.
may.morlan files for bankruptcy.
september.the bankruptcy court orders morlan debts discharged,on the basis of the trustee report that the estate in bankruptcy has no assets and that consequently the trustee has made no distribution to the creditors,and dismisses the bankruptcy proceeding.
january.morlan files an amended complaint in the class action suit.
august.the suit is certified by the district court as a class action with morlan the only named plaintiff.
september.having learned about the bankruptcy,the district judge decertifies the class in morlan erisa suit and dismisses the suit without prejudice.morlan claim under erisa,the judge reasons,became an asset of the estate in bankruptcy and was not abandoned by the trustee.so when the class was certified,the named plaintiff morlan had no standing to sue because he did not own the claim that he was suing upon.
morlan asks us to reverse the dismissal of his suit.
the dismissal presupposes the assignability of morlan erisa claim to the trustee in bankruptcy.if it was assignable and assigned,it became property of the estate in bankruptcy,as in in re polis,cir if it was not assignable,morlan rather than the trustee was entitled to sue to enforce it.
erisa requires pension plans to include a provision forbidding the assignment or alienation these are synonyms,riordan commonwealth edison,cir,except that the addition of alienation to assignment makes crystal clear that the provision bars involuntary as well as voluntary assignments of benefits,d plumb fluid pump service,cir,and thus keeps such property out of the plan participant or beneficiary estate in bankruptcy.c patterson shumate,d in re weinhoeft,cir.some types of claim are nonassignable voluntarily but assignable involuntarily,as in in re polis,supra,at.tort claims,for example,normally are not assignable,but they do become property of the claimant estate in bankruptcy by operation of bankruptcy law.erisa clause,however,as the patterson and weinhoeft cases make clear,bars the latter type of assignment as well.
erisa imposes no similar requirement on welfare plans nor do the plans at issue in this case contain a clause forbidding assignment or alienation.since,however,morlan claim is in part a claim for pension benefits,in part it is indeed nonassignable and so the dismissal of his suit was improper.but it will make a difference on remand whether he can sue on all or only the pension part of his claim and so we proceed to a consideration of whether the part of his claim that concerns welfare benefits was assignable.
several cases hold that welfare benefits are generally nonassignable,just as pension benefits are,despite the absence of a counterpart to section d applicable to welfare benefits.these cases reason that because erisa authorizes suits for plan benefits only by participants,beneficiaries,fiduciaries,or the secretary of labor,a,an assignee who does not come under one of these descriptions is ineligible to maintain the suit.see,simon value behavioral health,cir.
the cases,it is true,carve an exception for medical benefits assigned to a provider in exchange for health care,a common method of financing such care.see,principal mutual life ins.charter barclay hospital,cir.that would not support a conclusion that morlan erisa claim for welfare benefits was assignable to the trustee in bankruptcy,however,because the trustee is not a provider.our court has a case of that sort,but our opinion in that case takes no position on whether other types of welfare benefit are assignable and if so whether there is any restriction on who the assignees may be.plumb fluid pump service,supra,at and.however,in kennedy connecticut general life ins,cir,we rejected the reasoning later adopted in cases like simon by holding that a properly assigned erisa claim makes the assignee a participant or beneficiary within the meaning of the act.
only the fifth circuit has actually held that claims for such benefits are assignable without restrictions.the principal case is hermann hospital meba medical benefits plan,cir,which,though it too concerned health benefits,based its holding that they are assignable on the absence of a statutory provision forbidding their assignment,a ground independent of the nature of the welfare benefits or whom they are assigned to.another fifth circuit decision,texas life,accident,health hospital service ins.guaranty ass gaylord entertainment,cir,holds that claims for welfare benefits are assignable regardless of their nature,though the ground of the decision a ground equally applicable to pension plans,by the texas life involved a pension plan,not a welfare plan is one we have difficulty understanding.it is that benefits,and a claim that benefits were withheld in breach of the plan administrator fiduciary obligations,are different animals,so that the statutory provision is interpretable as forbidding assignment of benefits but not of benefit claims that have matured into causes of action.
now that we must resolve the issue,we hold that claims for welfare benefits,not limited to benefits,are assignable,provided of course that the erisa plan itself permits assignment,assignability being a matter of freedom of contract in the absence of a statutory bar.kennedy connecticut general life insurance,supra,at.the absence of a counterpart to the provision for pension plans is telling and in this regard we do not understand how the courts that have held welfare benefits nonassignable square their conclusion with the supreme court decision in mackey lanier collection agency service,d,which held that,precisely because there is no provision for welfare plans,erisa does not prohibit a state from garnishing benefits payments due plan participants.see in re taft.garnishment and an assignment for the benefit of creditors are the same kind of animal.
pertinent too is the general principle of the law that contractual claims which is the essential character of claims to benefits pursuant to private pension or welfare plans for the payment of money are assignable.in re new era,cir citibank,cir collins carboline,allan farnsworth,contracts,ed.this principle,however,comes with an important exception,which turns out to be pertinent to this case,for cases in which the personal acts and qualities of one of the parties form a material part of the contract.first illinois national bank knapp,d.if you made a contract with john singer sargent for him to paint your portrait,he could not assign his contractual duty to another painter without your consent.nor could you assign your automobile liability insurance policy to another driver,since he might be in a different risk class from you.and likewise morlan could not assign to the trustee in bankruptcy his right to participate in his employer welfare benefits plans,thus substituting the trustee,or the creditors,for would be nonsensical.
insofar as morlan is seeking past monetized or monetizable benefits,this problem does not arise,because such a claim is independent of all personal differences between morlan on the one hand and the trustee or creditors on the other,and so it is assignable.but he is claiming both past and future benefits,and,consistent with the personal obligations doctrine,the future benefits are not here is another piece of his claim that,like his claim for pension benefits,clearly remained with him despite the bankruptcy.still,the conclusion from the analysis thus far is that the trustee could take over at least a chunk,for all we know the biggest chunk,of morlan claim as an asset of the bankrupt estate,and this conclusion requires us to consider whether that chunk was revested in morlan,enabling him to sue to enforce it in his class action suit.if it was not revested,if it was not his property,he did not have standing to sue for it.for if it was not his property he would not benefit from an order requiring the defendants in the class action suit to render up the property.
after a suit is certified as a class action,a loss of standing by the named plaintiff does not destroy or if it affects just one of several claims curtail the federal court jurisdiction he can be replaced by a member of the class who has standing.parole commission geraghty,d.but until certification,the jurisdiction of the district court depends upon its having jurisdiction over the claim of the named plaintiffs when the suit is filed and continuously thereafter until certification,walters edgar,cir nelson murphy,cir lusardi xerox,cir,because until certification there is no class action but merely the prospect of one the only action is the suit by the named plaintiffs.morlan declared bankruptcy in may,before the class was certified.upon that declaration he lost the chunk of his erisa claim that we concerned with in this part of the opinion it fell into the estate in bankruptcy.but in september the bankruptcy proceeding was dismissed,and there is an argument,as we about to see,that the effect of that dismissal was to revest morlan with his entire claim.
that might seem too late to save morlan standing to sue on the entire claim were it not for his having filed an amended complaint in january.that filing cured any problem.quite apart from the doctrine of.c,which allows even jurisdictional defects in the original complaint to be cured provided the amended complaint relates back,as this one did,squibb sons,lloyd,cir per curiam black secretary of health human services,flores cameron county,cir,the filing of the amended complaint was the equivalent of filing a new suit,and so it would matter had there been no jurisdiction over morlan original suit,illinois ex rel.barra archer daniels midland,cir sun refining marketing rago,cir see also carver condie,cir duda board of education,cir wellness wellness house,cir ferdik bonzelet,cir,unless one wanted to make a fuss over the filing fee.the only significance of relation back is avoidance of the bar of the statute of limitations,flores cameron county,supra,at,and that is not an issue here.
clearly,then,if the assignable part of morlan erisa claim,having been transferred to the estate in bankruptcy by operation of law when morlan filed for bankruptcy,was abandoned before the amended complaint was filed,he could sue to enforce it,because the effect of a trustee abandoning a claim is to revest the ownership of it in the debtor,koch refining farmers union central exchange,cir catalano commissioner,cir in re interpictures,cir per curiam.and actually,despite the attention we been paying to getting the sequence right,the sequence does matter for when property of the bankrupt is abandoned,the title reverts to the bankrupt,nunc pro tunc,so that he is treated as having owned it continuously.wallace lawrence warehouse,cir see also sessions romadka.catalano commissioner,supra,at in re dewsnup,cir per curiam.the purposes of retroactive vesting include to protect against the running of the statute of limitations,sessions romadka,supra,at,and to compensate the trustee for any cost he may have incurred in maintaining the property during his custody of it.brown.cardozo.
in arguing that the trustee abandoned morlan claim,morlan points to four things the tape recording of a creditors meeting at which he stated under oath in response to a question from the trustee about his assets i think i might be involved in a class action lawsuit involving an insurance company i used to work for a letter from the trustee to morlan lawyer stating that the trustee had decided to abandon any claim the bankruptcy estate might have to any future proceeds arising from that lawsuit the trustee report of no distribution and statement of abandonment of property,submitted to the bankruptcy court and the bankruptcy judge order approving the trustee statement of abandonment and report of no distribution,discharging the trustee,and closing the no asset case.
no doubt the trustee wanted and intended to abandon morlan claim.but the defendants argue,and the district court agreed,that the trustee attempt to abandon failed because the trustee failed to comply with the statutory requirements for abandoning an asset that is part of the debtor estate.the requirements are exacting,in recognition of the potential harm to creditors from the trustee abandoning property to which they would otherwise be entitled because it is property of the estate in bankruptcy,and of the fact that abandonment is revocable only in very limited circumstances,such as where the trustee is given incomplete or false information of the asset by the debtor,thereby foregoing a proper investigation of the asset.catalano commissioner,supra,at.
so let us consider the requirements for effective abandonment.the bankruptcy code provides that after notice and a hearing,the trustee,either on his own volition or under order by the bankruptcy court,may abandon any property of the estate that is burdensome to the estate or that is of inconsequential value and benefit to the estate.a.in addition,property that the bankruptcy court orders the trustee to abandon is deemed abandoned,b,and likewise property that has been scheduled,but not otherwise administered at the time of the closing of a case.c.property not abandoned under one of these three subsections remains property of the debtor estate unless the court orders otherwise.d.
section,to which subsection c refers,requires the debtor to file so far as bears on this case a schedule of his assets.morlan did so,but he did not list his erisa claim on the schedule,and so abandonment was not authorized by section c.as for section a,the trustee did not notify the creditors that he was considering abandoning morlan claim,or conduct a hearing on the matter.of course,if after notice the creditors do want a hearing,the failure to conduct one would not nullify the abandonment.a requirement of notice and a hearing really means notice and the opportunity for a hearing.in fact the bankruptcy code is explicit in defining after notice and a hearing as authorizing an act without an actual hearing if such notice is given properly and no interested party requests a hearing.b.see in re,cir.but there was no notice here and so section a is available either.nor is b the bankruptcy judge did not order the trustee to abandon anything.
as for subsection d,the bankruptcy judge order closing the case as a,bankruptcy in part on the basis of a statement of abandonment might seem interpretable as the order ing otherwise to which the subsection refers.but no,because the statement of abandonment that the trustee submitted to the bankruptcy court and that the court in effect incorporated by reference in its order says only that any scheduled property is abandoned emphasis added,and morlan erisa claim was not scheduled.
we conclude that the abandonment of the assignable and thus assigned part of morlan claim by the trustee was not in compliance with section and was therefore ineffective.but this does not end the case.we must decide what the consequences of noncompliance were and specifically whether they included dismissal of the class action.clearly not dismissal in its entirety,since part of morlan claim was nonassignable but dismissal of the assignable part of the claim.in addressing this question we begin by noting that it was virtually inevitable that the trustee would abandon the claim,precisely because it was the claim of the representative plaintiff in a class action suit,albeit a suit not yet certified for class action treatment.what trustee in bankruptcy would think it worthwhile to insert himself in the place of the n
