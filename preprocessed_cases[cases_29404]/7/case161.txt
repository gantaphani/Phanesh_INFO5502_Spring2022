this appeal raises an interesting question relating to the importance for a debtor to maintain and preserve the debtor financial records for a reasonable period prior to filing for bankruptcy to allow the bankruptcy court to make an intelligent inquiry of the debtor financial status.in this case,frank schifano the debtor filed for personal bankruptcy under chapter of the bankruptcy code,frustrating the efforts of alfred and henry razzaboni the razzabonis to collect a judgment against him.the razzabonis alleged that under a the debt should not be discharged because the debtor transferred or concealed assets,made false oaths,and failed to keep adequate records.the bankruptcy court granted summary judgment to the debtor on all three claims,and the united states bankruptcy appellate panel for the first circuit bap affirmed.the razzabonis timely appealed to this court.
we agree that the razzabonis have failed to produce sufficient evidence to survive summary judgment on their claims of concealment of assets and false oaths.however,we believe that there is a material issue of fact as to whether the debtor failed to maintain adequate records.thus,we will affirm in part,reverse in part and remand for trial on the issue pertaining to the adequate maintenance of records.
we recognize the bitterness that often prevails when creditors are frustrated in the collection of a just debt due to the debtor filing a petition in bankruptcy.although creditors often challenge the discharge in bankruptcy of the debtor on grounds of fraud,concealment of assets,or other justifiable grounds,the challenge can not survive summary judgment on mere speculation or accusation.creditors must produce competent evidence.see boroff tully in re tully,cir.yet,in producing competent evidence,a creditor may be hindered by the debtor unwillingness to turn over financial records or the debtor failure to maintain adequate records that would document any potential fraud or wrongdoing.because the debtor is often the gatekeeper to any incriminating evidence,the bankruptcy code will avoid a discharge if a debtor fails to maintain adequate records to reasonably ascertain his financial condition.a.
the bankruptcy court in this proceeding granted the debtor motion for summary judgment from the bench without a written opinion or a statement of facts.upon appeal,the bap filed a written opinion recounting the relevant evidence of this case and affirming the bankruptcy court on all counts.the razzaboni claims of concealment,false oaths and failure to maintain records involve three assets relevant to this case the construction companies owned by the debtor and his brother,the debtor family residence,and gifts and loans paid by family members to the debtor.we review the evidence from the record regarding each of these assets in the light most favorable to the razzabonis as the party.pacific ins,eaton vance,cir.
a.the schifano corporations 
the debtor has been involved with several family owned construction companies over approximately years.his original company,frank schifano building and design corporation the schifano corporation contracted with the appellants,the razzabonis,for a construction project that resulted in the razzabonis suing the debtor in massachusetts state court.the razzabonis obtained a default judgment against the debtor personally in the amount of on january.the debtor began making payments on the judgment until he filed a bankruptcy petition under chapter of the bankruptcy code on march.
the schifano corporation was dissolved in,and the royal crest corporation royal crest was formed the same year to take its place.the bap opinion acknowledged that the record was not clear on this point,but it appears that royal crest was originally formed with the debtor as the president,but with the debtor brother,joseph schifano,as the sole shareholder.then,in,when the debt to the razzabonis threatened the business,joseph schifano claims that he transferred ownership of royal crest to the debtor so that joseph could start a new business,northlantic construction corporation northlantic.neither the debtor nor joseph has explained what consideration,if any,was paid for the transfer of royal crest to the debtor.the debtor has produced no records of this transaction.
joseph schifano claims that he capitalized northlantic with approximately of his own savings,although no records have been produced documenting this capitalization.joseph admits that he created the company to avoid the problems with royal crest.northlantic occupies the same office space as royal crest,uses all the same equipment,and employs the same people.northlantic pays the debtor a salary of per week,and pays the debtor wife per week for book keeping.northlantic also made loans to the debtor of approximately over several months in,just after the corporation was formed.
after joseph schifano formed northlantic to replace royal crest,the debtor extracted from royal crest in what he described as loan repayments.the debtor supplied the cancelled checks to document these payments,but did not supply any records of the original loans that he alleges he had made to royal crest.the debtor and his wife do not maintain a bank account,so they do not have any method of proving their payments made or income received.they pay all of their bills in cash or money orders.the debtor wife stated that they do not maintain a bank account so that the internal revenue service irs can not levy their funds.
b.the stoneham property 
since,the debtor and his family have resided in a home at dapper darby drive in stoneham,massachusetts the stoneham property.the stoneham property was purchased on february,by massbay land management corporation massbay.the debtor was the president of massbay,but his father,rosario schifano,was the record sole shareholder.metropolitan bank issued a mortgage on the property for,signed by the debtor personally and as president of massbay,and by rosario as treasurer of massbay.in,massbay borrowed from joseph pascuccio,and backed the loan with a note on the stoneham property.in june of,metropolitan bank initiated foreclosure proceedings on the first mortgage,but sold the mortgage to pascuccio,leaving pascuccio holding the mortgage note on the stoneham property for a total of approximately.the razzabonis offered in evidence an appraisal of the property in,which valued the property at.
massbay dissolved in december of,apparently transferring the stoneham property to rosario as massbay sole shareholder,even though the debtor continued to live in the property.rosario died in,leaving all of his assets to his wife,norma schifano,who is the debtor mother the debtor explained that he pays his mother per month as rent to live in the stoneham property.the rental amount is exactly equivalent to the monthly mortgage payment that is due to pascuccio.pascuccio has testified that since he has held the mortgage on the stoneham property,he has received mortgage payments from rosario,norma,and from the debtor.even though the debtor maintains personal liability on the mortgage for the stoneham property and lives in the property,he claims that he has no ownership interest in it because the title to the property originally was held by massbay,then transferred to rosario,and finally transferred to norma.
gifts and loans 
the debtor testified that over the course of several years preceding his filing for bankruptcy,he received over from family members,including his parents,brothers and cousins.the debtor describes these payments as loans and gifts,although he maintains no records of them,and has no bank account statements to verify the transactions or amounts.
in january of,the razzabonis obtained a default judgment against the debtor and attempted to collect on the judgment.the debtor filed his petition for personal bankruptcy under chapter on march.on july,the razzabonis filed objections to the discharge of the debt owed them.they alleged that the debtor made a false oath by failing to list material assets and liabilities in his bankruptcy filing in violation of a,and transferred or concealed property within one year of filing the petition,thereby justifying an exclusion of discharge under a a.although the original complaint was limited to these two claims,the razzabonis also argued in the court proceedings that the debt should not be discharged because the debtor failed to keep adequate records of his financial dealings under a 
on january,the debtor filed a motion for summary judgment,alleging that there was no evidence of fraudulent transfers or false oaths to support the razzaboni objections to the discharge of their debt.the bankruptcy court held a hearing on the motion on march,and issued an oral order granting summary judgment for the debtor.the bankruptcy court also found the razzabonis objection to be completely meritless and awarded sanctions against the razzabonis in the amount of the debtor attorneys fees.the razzabonis appealed to the bap on march.for the next five and a half years,the case moved back and forth between the bap,the bankruptcy court,and the first circuit regarding a procedural issue involving a potential settlement.finally,after a settlement was determined to be impossible,the bap considered the appeal on the merits.on september,the bap affirmed the bankruptcy court order of summary judgment for the debtor.the bap concluded that the razzabonis failed to produce sufficient evidence on all three claims,thereby upholding the discharge of the debt owed to the razzabonis.the bap did not address the issue of sanctions levied against the razzabonis.this appeal followed.
the bap obtained appellate jurisdiction over the original appeal in this case under b.this court maintains jurisdiction over this matter as an appeal from a final decision of the bap under d.

transfer or concealment of assets 
section a a of the bankruptcy code states that a court will not discharge a debt if the debtor,with intent to hinder,delay,or defraud a creditor has transferred,removed,destroyed,mutilated,or concealed,or has permitted to be transferred,removed,destroyed,mutilated,or concealed property of the debtor,within one year before the date of the filing of the petition.the elements that must be proved to avoid discharge under this provision are a transfer or concealment of property,belonging to the debtor,within one year of filing a petition for bankruptcy,and with the actual intent to hinder,delay or defraud the creditor.in re hayes.
the bankruptcy court and the bap found that the razzabonis failed to produce sufficient evidence creating a material issue of fact regarding the debtor transfer or concealment of assets one year prior to filing for bankruptcy.we agree.
first,regarding the northlantic assets,the razzabonis could point to no specific evidence that the debtor maintains an interest in the company because all of the company stock is owned by the debtor brother,joseph.the razzabonis speculate that the debtor and his brother shifted assets away from the debtor and royal crest to shield those assets from the creditors.in fact,the debtor wife and brother both admitted in depositions that northlantic was created to escape the hassle from the creditors.however,there is a complete lack of evidence showing any transfer of assets from the debtor to northlantic.thus,the debtor interest in northlantic remains unsupported speculation,which is insufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment,at.
with regard to the stoneham property,the razzabonis argue that there are badges of ownership indicating that the debtor actually maintained an ownership interest in it.for example,the debtor and his family resided in the property,paid the mortgage on the property,filed property damage insurance claims on the property,and claimed a homestead exemption for the property in the bankruptcy filings.but,there is no evidence showing that any transfers or concealment occurred in the year prior to the bankruptcy filing.the stoneham property was purchased in,and the debtor began living in the property at that time.since the property was purchased,it was technically owned by massbay,then transferred to rosario,and then transferred to norma at rosario death.although the debtor was a signatory on the original mortgage,he never retained any title of record to the property.even if there were a plausible argument that some form of economic interest in the property should be attributed to the debtor,that interest did not accrue in the year preceding the bankruptcy filing.thus,there are no facts alleged that could reasonably prove that the debtor concealed his interest in the stoneham property during the year prior to the bankruptcy filing.summary judgment,therefore,is appropriate on this claim.
finally,as to the gifts and loans,the debtor argues that most of the money he received from family members was given more than one year prior to the bankruptcy.the bap found that there was no evidence that these loans were anything more than handouts from family members to help the debtor through a difficult financial period.the razzabonis point to no reliable evidence to establish that the debtor transferred or concealed assets derived from these loans during the year prior to filing for bankruptcy.thus,summary judgment was appropriate.
false oath or account 
section a of the bankruptcy code states that a court will not discharge a debt if the debtor knowingly and fraudulently,in or in connection with the case made a false oath or account.the elements that must be proved to avoid discharge under this provision are the debtor knowingly and fraudulently made a false oath,and the false oath related to a material fact in connection to the bankruptcy case.see,boroff tully in re tully,cir.
as presented in this case,there is significant overlap between the claim that the debtor transferred or concealed assets,and the claim that he made false oaths regarding those assets.the razzabonis point to one specific item that the debtor failed to disclose in his bankruptcy filings.the debtor did not disclose his liability related to the mortgage on the stoneham property,given that he was a signatory on the primary mortgage.when the razzabonis raised this issue before the bankruptcy court,the debtor immediately acknowledged his oversight and disclosed the liability.similarly,massbay corporate tax return for showed that the debtor was the owner of the company common stock,but the debtor explained that this was an accountant error,and corrected the record.all other tax returns showed the debtor father,rosario,as the sole shareholder.the only argument that would support these omissions or misstatements being deemed material or made with knowing and fraudulent intent would be that the debtor was attempti
