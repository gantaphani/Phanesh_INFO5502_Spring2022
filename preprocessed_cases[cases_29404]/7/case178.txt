this case requires us to decide whether the chapter debtor in possession must pay in excess of million in severance pay,pursuant to the terms of two prepetition contracts,as an administrative expense to an executive who was terminated after rendering postpetition services.we affirm the bankruptcy court grant of summary judgment,denying administrative priority status to the executive claim.
on may,filene basement,a fbi distribution,then a wholly owned subsidiary of filene basement a fbc distribution collectively,debtors or debtor in possession hired kathleen mason as president of filene basement division and chief merchandising officer.mason left a position as president of home goods,a subsidiary of tjx companies,to join filene at a time when it was already experiencing financial difficulty as a prelude to her employment,the parties signed two written agreements the employment agreement and the retention agreement.the employment agreement set the initial term of employment at three years and entitled mason to an annual base salary of,in addition to fringe benefits,stock options,and bonuses,including a signing bonus of.it also provided that in the event mason was terminated without cause,she was entitled to receive three years salary and other fringe benefits.the retention agreement was essentially a golden parachute,which,in general terms,provided that should mason employment terminate following a qualifying change in control,she would receive three years salary plus other benefits,including legal fees and expenses 
on august,filene basement,and filene basement filed for relief under chapter and continued to operate pursuant to sections and of the bankruptcy code,as debtor in possession following the filing,mason continued to render services pursuant to the prepetition employment agreement,for which she received her full salary and benefits owed thereunder.according to mason,she was induced to remain with the company by the debtor in possession postpetition promise that her two agreements were in effect and would be honored.mason also queried her counsel about the status of the two agreements her counsel recommended that the debtor in possession seek formal bankruptcy court approval of the agreements.when mason relayed her counsel recommendation to the debtor in possession,she was allegedly told that both agreements had already been approved by them and that only the paperwork needed to be done before seeking court sanction.
in the meantime,the operations were quickly downsized of the stores were closed shortly after the petition date,and in the wake of these closures,on november,mason was notified that she was being put on administrative leave,with pay,pending a motion to reject both agreements under.while the motion was under advisement,on february,the debtor in possession sold substantially all of its remaining assets to another corporation.
on february,the bankruptcy court granted the motion to reject the employment agreement but ruled that the retention agreement could not be rejected because that agreement was nonexecutory the court agreed with mason that the retention agreement could not be considered executory because she ha d no performance obligations thereunder.neither party appealed these rulings.four days later,on march,mason was terminated.
mason then filed a request for payment of chapter expense,in which she claimed that her termination benefits specified in both agreements,including legal fees and expenses,were entitled to first priority as administrative expenses under and b because she was terminated after rendering postpetition services and after a qualifying change in control had taken place during the reorganization.in addition,she maintained that because the debtor in possession induced her to continue working by promising to honor the two agreements,they were bound by the terms of those agreements.the appellees,the official committee of unsecured creditors the committee for the estate,opposed the request,and both parties filed motions for summary judgment.
in a thorough,opinion,the bankruptcy court granted summary judgment in favor of the committee on the ground that the consideration supporting the termination agreement to forgo her employment opportunities at home goods,supplied to the debtors when mason signed the two agreements consequently,she had only a general unsecured claim for damages not entitled to administrative priority.the court also rejected her inducement argument as implausible given mason distrust of the debtor in possession and her consultations with counsel about the status of the two agreements.finally,the court held that the general unsecured claim under the employment agreement was subject to the cap pursuant to b as for the retention agreement,the court held that mason was entitled to benefits under the agreement since she was terminated subsequent to a qualifying change in control,but because the contract was nonexecutory,the rights springing from the agreement were prepetition general unsecured claims not entitled to administrative priority.unlike the claim under the employment agreement,however,the claim was not subject to the cap on appeal,the united states district court for the district of massachusetts affirmed on a different ground,holding that mason had failed to show that her postpetition services were necessary to preserve the estate under b.

the paramount objective of a chapter reorganization is to rehabilitate and preserve the value of the financially distressed business.bildisco,at.otte united states,d.to accomplish this objective,subsection a of the bankruptcy code.a,grants first priority in the distribution of the limited assets of the estate to administrative expenses allowed under section,which include the actual,necessary costs and expenses of preserving the estate,including wages,salaries,or commissions for services rendered after the commencement of the case,b a.congress recognized that granting first priority to administrative expenses would encourage creditors,otherwise wary of dealing with chapter businesses,to provide the goods and services required for successful rehabilitation,sess,cong.at cramer mammoth mart,in re mammoth mart,cir.and since the estate creditors who have claims will presumably benefit more from rehabilitation than from liquidation,it is not surprising that those creditors bear the costs of the rehabilitation.granting priority status,however,is contrary to the fundamental principle of bankruptcy law that the debtor limited resources are to be distributed equally among similarly situated creditors,see,sess,cong.at thus,statutory priorities are narrowly construed,and the burden of proving entitlement rests with the party seeking it.in re hemingway,cir.
in general,for a claim to qualify as an administrative expense under subsection b,it must have arisen from a transaction with the trustee or debtor in possession,rather than from a prepetition transaction with the debtor,and the consideration supporting the claim must have benefitted the estate in some demonstrable way.id.at mammoth mart,at.here,there was no postpetition agreement between mason and the debtor in possession.as mason stated,it is undisputed that her postpetition services were rendered pursuant to her employment agreement.in such circumstances,we need to explore the interplay between subsection b and the code treatment of executory contracts under.
subsection a allows a debtor in possession,subject to the court approval,to assume or to reject a prepetition executory contract.a.the debtor in possession may make this decision at any time prior to the confirmation of the plan,unless the court orders otherwise upon request of the nondebtor contracting party.id.d.this latitude allows the debtor in possession an opportunity to determine which of the prepetition executory contracts are beneficial to the estate and which should be assumed or rejected.see pub.serv.of cooperative,in re pub.serv.of,cir the code afford s breathing space to decide which contracts they wish to assume or reject.if a debtor in possession assumes an executory contract under subsection a,it assumes the contract cum onere,and the liabilities incurred in performing the contract will be treated as administrative expenses.bildisco,at.see also in re frontier,cir.if the contract is rejected,on the other hand,the contract is deemed breached on the date immediately before the date of the filing of the petition,g,and the nondebtor party has a prepetition general unsecured claim for breach of contract damages,one not entitled to administrative priority,g.see bildisco,at.in re stewart foods,stewart foods,in re stewart foods,cir.it should be evident that the decision to assume or reject has significant consequences and that the authority to reject an executory contract is vital to the basic purpose to sic a chapter reorganization,because it can release the debtor estate from burdensome obligations that can impede a successful reorganization.bildisco,at.
where the debtor in possession,however,induces a nondebtor to render performance pursuant to an unassumed prepetition executory contract,pending its decision to reject or assume,the nondebtor party will be entitled to administrative priority only to the extent that the consideration supporting the claim was supplied to the debtor in possession during the reorganization and was beneficial to the estate.b mammoth mart,at see also bildisco,at.the facts and holding of mammoth mart provide an apt illustration.the employees in that case sought administrative priority for their severance pay,which was based on length of service.the employees had been terminated by the debtor in possession during the reorganization and had been paid their wages plus severance pay attributable to the services rendered after the filing date.not happy with this outcome,the employees requested that the court order the debtor in possession to pay as an administrative expense all of their accrued severance,including severance that had been earned from rendering prepetition services.the court denied the employees claim on the ground that the consideration supporting the claim for severance consisted of the prepetition services rendered for the debtor no part of their present claims arose from services performed for the mammoth mart,at.the rationale underlying the holding was that because severance pay was a component of compensation for services is,the employees wages included severance could be entitled to administrative priority,but only to the extent that it was earned postpetition.furthermore,it made no difference that the right to payment for the severance earned prepetition arose during the reorganization.what did matter was when the consideration supporting the claim was supplied.id.at see also b for services rendered after the commencement of the case emphasis added.
contrary to mason assertion,the terms of the prepetition contract do not determine the amount of the question we left open in mammoth mart,at does the contract become enforceable against the debtor in possession simply because it elects to receive benefits under the contract after the filing date although during the chapter proceeding a prepetition executory contract remains in effect and enforceable against the nondebtor party to the contract,the contract is unenforceable against the debtor in possession unless and until the contract is assumed.bildisco,at.f rom the filing of a petition in bankruptcy until formal acceptance,the executory contract is not an enforceable contract against the debtor in possession and may never be enforceable again.united states ex rel.united states postal serv.dewey freight,cir citing bildisco,at.and other cases in re.med,cir in re pub.serv.of,at see also in re alongi,in re el paso refinery.as instructed by the supreme court in bildisco,
if the elects to continue to receive benefits from the other party to an executory contract pending a decision to reject or assume the contract,the is obligated to pay for the reasonable value of those services,which,depending on the circumstances of a particular contract,may be what is specified in the contract.
at.emphasis added citations omitted.thus,under bildisco,absent a assumption,from the date of the filing of the chapter proceeding,mason employment agreement was unenforceable against the debtor in possession despite their election to continue her employment she is entitled to only the reasonable value of her postpetition services that benefitted the estate.although the employment agreement may be probative of the reasonable value,it is not the dispositive measure.
we recognize that bildisco addressed a particular type of executory contract,a collective bargaining agreement.yet the court did not limit its discussion to collective bargaining agreements,but instead discussed general principles of executory contract law.further,in,in response to bildisco,congress amended the code by adding,which provides special treatment for collective bargaining agreements.bankruptcy amendments and federal judgeship act of,stat.among other things,overturned that part of bildisco that allowed the trustee to make unilateral changes in the terms or conditions of a collective bargaining agreement during reorganization.see united food commercial workers union,local,almac,cir.however,congress left intact bildisco discussion of the enforceability of garden variety executory contracts during chapter proceedings.
in the same act,congress also added subsection d,d,which requires a debtor in possession to timely perform all the obligations of the debtor arising under any unexpired lease of nonresidential real property during chapter proceedings,until such lease is assumed or rejected,and subsection d,d,which provides that if the debtor in possession fails to assume such a lease within days,the lease is deemed rejected.bankruptcy amendments and federal judgeship act of,d,d,stat.emphasis added.thus,congress eliminated the rule that landlords were entitled only to the reasonable value of the benefits bestowed upon the debtor in possession and forced the debtor in possession to decide whether to assume the lease within days.obviously then,when congress thought that certain executory contracts were more deserving of special treatment,it said so.but no such specificity is provided for prepetition employment contracts.congress familiarity with bildisco and its failure to provide special treatment to garden variety employment contracts indicates that congress intended that employment contracts be subject to the general principles governing executory contracts outlined in bildisco.
to avoid the realities of the foregoing principles,mason relies principally upon footnote in mammoth mart to argue that there is,or should be,an exception where a debtor in possession induces the nondebtor party to continue to perform the prepetition contract by a promise to honor the terms of that contract.in such a case,the theory goes,both parties are bound by all of the terms of the contract,including,in this case,the contractual termination provisions.although mason argument seems consistent with footnote of mammoth and may carry some equitable appeal,it runs directly contrary to not only the general principles governing executory contracts,see supra part,but also to the language of and policies served by section,and,for that matter,to the goals of chapter,which is the successful rehabilitation of the business for the benefit of both the debtor and all its creditors.
mason argument amounts to a claim that the debtor in possession assumed the employment agreement by implication.it is well settled,however,that an executory contract can not be assumed by the unilateral acts of the debtor in possession during the reorganization of the business.thinking machs.mellon fin.servs.in re thinking machs,cir holding that court approval is a condition precedent dewey freight,at matter of whitcomb keller mortgage,cir in re.rather,the plain text of section requires express approval by the court.t he
