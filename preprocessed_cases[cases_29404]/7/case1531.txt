this case requires us to decide whether an attorney who prepares an order to show cause for a judge is entitled to absolute immunity.we hold that he is not and affirm the judgment of the district court.
freddy joe burton burton was injured in a collision.he incurred in related medical expenses and loans and retained jan paul koch koch to file a lawsuit on his behalf.burton granted certain creditors,including valley hospital medical center,liens on his personal injury claim.valley hospital then sold its account receivable to infinity capital management infinity,the president of which is anne pantelas pantelas.koch settled burton personal injury claim for.
koch placed the settlement funds in his client trust fund account and paid himself his attorney fee and costs.koch then recommended that burton declare bankruptcy and hire bankruptcy attorney david crosby crosby.after paying a retainer fee to crosby and receiving his personal injury settlement exemption,burton had left of his settlement in the trust fund account.
that same month,nancy alff alff,who represented infinity at the time,told koch that a state interpleader action would resolve the interests of the lien holders more quickly than the bankruptcy court.infinity filed an interpleader lawsuit in state court against all other similarly situated lien holders making a claim upon burton settlement.neither burton nor koch were named as parties in the state interpleader case.the honorable ronald israel judge israel was assigned to the case.salvatore gugino gugino was substituted for alff as infinity attorney of record.
crosby filed burton bankruptcy petition in bankruptcy court.four days later,judge israel held a status hearing on the state interpleader case,and koch attended that hearing at judge israel request.at the hearing,gugino appeared for infinity,and steven baker baker appeared for one of the defendants in the case.judge israel questioned koch as to why he had not interpled all of the funds that burton had received for his settlement to the court clerk as required by michel eighth judicial district court ex rel.county of clark.koch informed judge israel that burton had filed bankruptcy and he would be depositing the remaining settlement funds with the bankruptcy clerk.those present at the hearing were confused about the proper course to take given the bankruptcy proceeding and the fact that burton was neither a plaintiff nor defendant in interpleader.both gugino and baker voiced concern about the interpleader case moving forward in light of the bankruptcy.judge israel ordered the parties to appear approximately two months later for a status hearing regarding the state of the bankruptcy proceeding.
three days before the status hearing,gugino sent all parties to the interpleader case and koch a letter with a copy of the minutes from the prior hearing and an update on the bankruptcy case,including both an explanation of his initial attempt to resolve the interpleader issue with the trustee and confirmation that koch had deposited the settlement funds with the trustee.
koch did not appear at the status hearing.at the hearing,gugino handed a copy of his letter to judge israel,and he informed the court that koch had deposited the settlement funds with the bankruptcy trustee.judge israel responded,i ordered koch to place all the funds in here i going to issue an order to show cause.i want koch to appear and show tell us why he did deposit his attorney fees into pursuant to michel i want him to personally appear and tell why he has otherwise,i hold him in contempt.neither gugino nor baker voiced any opposition to judge israel in light of the bankruptcy.the following colloquy then occurred 
gugino well,the plaintiff in the case,the injured party was in addition to the the money that koch was giving himself for his attorney fees,he also paid burton under nrs.so.
baker which is a fraudulent transfer.

gugino i i do know what to say.
the court is well,obviously the bankruptcy court going to have to deal with part of that,but who wants to prepare the order 
gugino what day 
the court gugino 
gugino i prepare it,your honor.
the court thirty days.
the clerk thirty days,we set it for july and that be 
gugino okay.
on that same day,gugino prepared a proposed order to show cause and sent it to all of the interpleader parties and koch.a cover letter stated that,unless gugino heard from them to the contrary,he would assume it met with their approval and would submit it to the court for the judge signature.the proposed order ordered koch to appear to explain to the court why he should not be held in contempt for failure to comply with michel as directed by the court.that same day,koch replied by sending gugino a fax objecting to the order and stating,you are violating the automatic stay provisions of.
the following day,koch sent gugino a fax and a fourpage letter.the letter stated that the automatic stay prevented proceedings directed toward the property of the bankruptcy estate,threatened that he would file a complaint against gugino,infinity,pantelas,and judge israel if at any time he bec a me aware of further action in the infinity litigation pursued by anyone,and made personal attacks on gugino competency.the fax stated that the complaint was complete and included a draft copy of the complaint.
the order drafted by gugino was never filed.instead,judge israel faxed the minute order from the june status check hearing to the parties of the interpleader case and koch.the minute order stated 
gugino noted the letter provided to the court changes things.gugino further noted koch took the remaining money and gave it to the bankruptcy trustee.colloquy regarding koch not present today and issues regarding following the michel case.court directed counsel to prepare an order for a show cause hearing and court set hearing.
court orders all parties to appear,including koch,to advise the court of

why koch should interplead the entire proceeds of the settlement per the michel case into this court immediately.
status on lifting the stay.
court ordered matter from a show cause hearing to a status check regarding bankruptcy interpleader.
later that day,gugino faxed a letter to koch that included the minute order.the letter stated in part 
first,let me make it clear that you did not attend the june,status check before judge israel,even though you were aware of the hearing date.had you been present,all of this might have been avoided.at the hearing,i presented the court with my june,letter and attachments,which had been previously sent to you and the attorneys involved in this litigation.it was my expectation that we would be going forward in the bankruptcy court under some sort of stipulation and order.however,at the hearing,judge israel ordered that an order to show cause be issued against you,and he then directed me to prepare the order.this was not my idea,nor did i recommend it to the court.after preparing a draft of the proposed order,i sent it to your attention for your review.had you called me upon receipt,you could have avoided incurring the hours you claim to have spent preparing a class action complaint against my client,her company,myself and judge israel 
gugino also included a footnote stating,it is not my habit to refuse to obey a directive of a judge.i simply followed his directive to prepare a draft of the order later that same day,koch faxed a response to gugino stating,in response to your letter attached hereto please find the rough draft of the federal lawsuit that i am filing.
the following day,koch sent gugino a copy of a memorandum in support of jurisdiction by fax and stated in part,why do you dismiss the interpleader,and get your funds from the bankruptcy trustee otherwise,what do you suggest i hold up and wo send copies to judge israel,pending your reply.
nearly a month later,koch sent gugino a fax stating,do know why you never responded to my last entreaty.guess it matters not.it been filed.here a copy.see ya in court.
koch then filed a complaint in federal district court,on behalf of himself and burton,alleging that all defendants violated the provision of a.he claimed actual damages of,plus attorney fees,and sought damages in excess of.
judge israel filed a motion to dismiss the complaint,arguing that koch claims were barred as a matter of law by the doctrine of absolute judicial immunity.gugino filed a separate motion to dismiss,arguing that because his acts were taken under the direction of judge israel,koch claims were barred by the doctrine of absolute immunity.the district court converted both motions to dismiss into motions for summary judgment because the parties attached various exhibits outside of the pleadings.the court held judge israel was entitled to absolute judicial immunity.however,the court held gugino was not entitled to immunity because gugino volunteered to prepare the order in direct violation of the stay.gugino had a duty to not prepare or present the order.this appeal followed.
we review a district court order denying a converted motion for summary judgment de novo.lewis united states,cir.we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,here koch and burton.cnty.of tuolumne sonora cmty,cir.the proponent of a claim for absolute immunity bears the burden of establishing that such immunity is justified.curry.castillo in re castillo,cir.
this case does not concern whether the automatic stay is violated when an attorney drafts,at the behest of a judge,an order to show cause that was never filed,much less whether such an act is actionable in a damage suit under k rather,the sole question in this appeal is whether an attorney who drafts an order at the request of a judge is entitled to absolute immunity.we conclude that he is not.
absolute judicial immunity insulates judges from charges of erroneous acts or irregular action.castillo,at citing forrester white.absolute immunity is not reserved solely for judges,but extends to nonjudicial officers for all claims relating to the exercise of judicial functions.id.quoting burns reed,scalia,concurring in part and dissenting in part.the supreme court has been quite sparing in its recognition of absolute immunity,and has refused to extend it any further than its justification would warrant.id.internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.the justification for absolute immunity is the protection of the judicial process.it shields independent and impartial adjudication and prevents the deflection of an officer energies from his public duties.burns,at.the supreme court has made it clear that it is the interest in protecting the proper functioning of the office,rather than the interest in protecting its occupant,that is of primary importance.kalina fletcher.
thus,we take a functional approach to determining whether a nonjudicial officer is entitled to absolute immunity by looking to the nature of the function performed and not to the identity of the actor performing it.castillo,at.to qualify for absolute immunity,the function performed must be a judicial act with a sufficiently close nexus to the adjudicative process.id.however,it is only when the judgment of an official other than a judge involves the exercise of discretionary judgment that judicial immunity may be extended to that nonjudicial officer.id.at.the supreme court established the requirement for discretionary judgment in antoine byers anderson,where it declined to extend the immunity to court reporters because transcribing verbatim transcripts does not involve the level of authoritative or discretionary decisionmaking that the doctrine of judicial immunity is designed to protect.to be protected,the function performed must involve the exercise of discretion in resolving disputes.castillo,at citing antoine,at.
before turning to the functional approach,we first inquire into the immunity historically accorded attorneys.id.we have afforded immunity to bankruptcy trustees because they were exercising judgments while performing acts closely related to the judicial process.id.at see also lonneker farms,klobucher,cir holding that a trustee in bankruptcy is entitled to derived judicial immunity because he is performing an integral part of the judicial process.for similar reasons,we afforded united states trustees immunity.balser dep t of justice,cir.absolute immunity has been extended to attorneys for performing the duties of a prosecutor,imbler pachtman,butz economou,but the supreme court has not extended the immunity beyond the prosecutorial function.even defense attorneys do not enjoy immunity because despite being officers of the court,attorneys are not in the same category as marshals,bailiffs,court clerks or judges.ferri ackerman.in ferri,the supreme court declined to extend immunity because the primary office performed by appointed counsel parallels the office of privately retained counsel where an attorney owes a duty to his client,not the public.id.at.this implied disinclination to grant immunity to private counsel was solidified after the supreme court concluded that private actors are not entitled to the absolute immunity granted to some government officials,such as prosecutors and judges.kimes stone,cir citing wyatt cole.
not only does this precedent forestall extending absolute immunity to gugino,the functional approach,which requires us to look past his identity as an attorney and focus only on the function he performed,also denies gugino immunity.although the function performed by gugino had a close nexus to the judicial process he prepared the order during a judicial proceeding,and orders are a basic and integral part of judicial proceedings preparing the order did not involve the kind of discretionary judgment that is protected by the doctrine.
preparing an order on behalf of a court does require the preparer to make important decisions about language and tone,but the ultimate discretion in determining whether an order will be integral to resolving a dispute lies with the judge,not the preparer.only the judge can exercise the unique authority vested in him by signing an order of the court.because the judge must approve of an order before it is filed and before it can affect the course of the judicial proceeding,it can not be said that simply preparing an order involves the substantial discretion that results in absolute immunity.see castillo,at.
gugino argues that he is entitled to absolute immunity because a law clerk would have been entitled to absolute immunity for preparing the order.although law clerks are entitled to absolute immunity and certainly prepare orders,an attorney can not be compared to a law clerk,who is probably the one participant in the judicial process whose duties and responsibilities are most intimately connected with the judge own exercise of the judicial function.moore brewster,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
gugino also contends he is entitled to absolute immunity because he was doing what judge israel asked him to do.other circuits have held that a function undertaken pursuant to the explicit direction of a judge entitles the subordinate to absolute immunity.kincaid vail,cir citing examples from five circuits extending immunity for carrying out judicial directives.we have previously held that court clerks are entitled to absolute immunity even in the absence of a judicial directive so long as the acts were not done in the clear absence of all jurisdiction.mullis united states bankruptcy court for dist.of,cir.however,immunity was extended in all of those cases to court officials,and gugino is not a court official.additionally,the district court here characterized gugino action as one he volunteered to do.gugino maintains that he was directed to prepare the order,and judge israel minute order stated that the court directed counsel to prepare an order for a show cause hearing.nevertheless,when we view the transcript of the hearing in a light most favorable to burton and koch,we resolve the inference in their favor.gugino responded when judge israel asked,who wants to prepare the order and,unlike the first status hearing,gugino did not voice any concern about preparing the order in light of the bankruptcy
