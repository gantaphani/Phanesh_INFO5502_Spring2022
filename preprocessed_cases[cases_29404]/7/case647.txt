this is an appeal by appellant,chapter debtor,valley historic limited partnership debtor,from the district court determination that the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction over the debtor adversary proceeding against appellee,the bank of new york bank,for breach of contract and for tortious interference.we affirm the district court determination that the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction.
in may,valley historic properties,borrower acquired two office buildings in downtown staunton,virginia.the borrower financed the acquisition and renovation of the buildings through the issuance of economic development bonds.first vantage bank,first virginia bank,and first bank trust owned the beneficial interest in the bonds.the bonds were payable solely from revenues derived from payments under a loan agreement and promissory note,which were ultimately assigned to the bank as successor indenture trustee.the loan agreement,which was secured by a first priority lien on the property and an assignment of leases,rents,and profits,called for scheduled payments over a period,with all payments to have been completed by may.lease payments,under a lease of the property by a single tenant,valley community services board,provided the borrower the source of funds to make the monthly payments to the bank that the loan agreement required.following the execution of the loan agreement and the issuance of the bonds,the borrower conveyed its interest in the property to the debtor.
in,the bank apprised the debtor that the loan agreement required the debtor to increase its monthly payments nearly tenfold to per month for the period of may through may so that the loan would be paid fully,rather than simply mature,in may.the debtor disagreed and continued to pay at the same rate it had in the past.consequently,in february the bank issued a notice of default,and the debtor responded by filing its chapter bankruptcy petition that same month.
the debtor filed a plan of reorganization plan on september.the bank objected to the plan and filed a proof of claim in the amount of,to which the debtor objected.the bankruptcy court ultimately confirmed the plan on december,granting the bank an allowed secured claim in the amount of.the plan provided,in part,that the court would fix and liquidate the amount of the bank claim subject to the debtor claims,setoffs,which would be liquidated at another date via an adversary proceeding and that the bankruptcy court would retain jurisdiction over the adversary proceeding filed by the debtor against the bank.the plan did not provide for the use of any recovery from the adversary proceeding but instead provided for the satisfaction of the debtor obligations entirely from the rents and earnings of the debtor through the operation of its real estate.
after confirmation,the tenant vacated the debtor property,and the debtor sold that property on march,and used the proceeds to pay all of its creditors,including the bank.approximately three months later,the debtor filed an adversary proceeding raising two claims against the bank.in count i,the debtor alleged that the bank breached the loan agreement when it increased the monthly lease payments and declared the debtor to be in default.in count ii,the debtor alleged that the bank and the three beneficial owners of the bonds tortiously interfered with the debtor contractual relationship with its tenant in december by meeting with the tenant and offering to sell the property to the tenant below fair market value.
the bank moved to dismiss on the grounds that the bankruptcy court lacked subject matter jurisdiction,that the proceeding was not a core proceeding,and that the debtor complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.the bankruptcy court held that it had jurisdiction,that the proceeding was a core proceeding,and that the debtor complaint stated valid claims.the bank took an interlocutory appeal pursuant to a,and the district court reversed.the district court found no related to jurisdiction over count i,the contract claim,because the debtor plan of reorganization had been confirmed and substantially consummated by the time the debtor filed the complaint.it found no arising in jurisdiction over count ii,the tortious interference claim,because,according to our precedent,proceedings or claims arising in title are those that are not based on any right expressly created by title,but nevertheless,would have no existence outside of the bankruptcy.grausz englander,cir quoting bergstrom dalkon shield claimants trust in re robins,cir.it also found that neither count i nor count ii was a core proceeding and that because there was no privity between the debtor and the bank,count i failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.
because the district court sits as an appellate court in bankruptcy,our review of the district court decision is plenary.see bowers atlanta motor speedway,in re se.hotel props,cir.therefore,we review the district court decision by applying the same standard of review that it applied to the bankruptcy court decision.that is,we review findings of fact for clear error and conclusions of law de novo.kielisch educ.credit mgmt.in re kielisch,cir citations omitted.
the bankruptcy court derives its jurisdiction from the district court.see a,b.district courts have original and exclusive jurisdiction of all cases under title,and original but not exclusive jurisdiction of all civil proceedings arising under title,or arising in or related to cases under title.a,b.the debtor maintains that the bankruptcy court had both arising in and related to jurisdiction over its adversary proceeding against the bank as well as jurisdiction to adjudicate its claims under e,which gives the district court in a case under title exclusive jurisdiction over a debtor property as of the commencement of the case and of property of the estate.additionally,it maintains that the confirmation order,which reserved jurisdiction over the debtor adversary proceeding,is preclusive and bars the bank from relitigating the bankruptcy court jurisdiction.we conclude,however,as did the district court,that the bankruptcy court did not have jurisdiction to adjudicate the debtor claims.
a proceeding or claim arising in title is one that is not based on any right expressly created by title,but nevertheless,would have no existence outside of the bankruptcy.grausz englander,cir quoting bergstrom dalkon shield claimants trust in re robins,cir.therefore,a controversy arises in title when it would have no practical existence but for the bankruptcy.id.quoting bergstrom,at.the debtor argues that there is arising in jurisdiction under b because the breach of contract caused its bankruptcy and the tortious interference complicated the administration of the bankruptcy case.we do not find the argument persuasive.
it seems that a claim,like the debtor breach of contract claim,that the filing of the chapter case can not be said to have arisen within that case,and whether it caused the bankruptcy is immaterial.indeed,if causation were a sufficient touchstone,then any debt would confer arising in jurisdiction.however,the very purpose of bankruptcy is to discharge or restructure the debt that has caused the bankruptcy.nor is it sufficient to establish arising in jurisdiction that a claim,like the debtor tortious interference claim,arises during the pendency of the chapter.here,the debtor claims bear only a coincidental relationship to the debtor bankruptcy case.they would have existed whether or not the debtor filed bankruptcy.it follows that because the debtor breach of contract claim and tortious interference claim would have existence outside of the bankruptcy,they were not within the bankruptcy court arising in jurisdiction.
the debtor also asserts that the bankruptcy court had subject matter jurisdiction because his claims are related to a case under title.this court,like the majority of the other circuits,has adopted the test articulated by the third circuit in pacor,higgins,cir,for determining related to jurisdiction.see robins piccinin,cir in short,the test for determining whether a civil proceeding is related
