opinion of the court 
this appeal requires us to decide how bankruptcy courts should value collateral retained by a chapter debtor in order to determine the amount of a creditor secured claim under a.appellants,a group of creditors known as the cornerstone investors,claim that the bankruptcy court erred by valuing their secured claims at zero based on an appraisal of debtors real estate offered by the official committee of unsecured creditors.we conclude that the bankruptcy court did not err in its valuation of the real estate,and that it properly determined that the cornerstone investors held only unsecured claims.in so concluding,we also clarify the burden of proof with respect to such valuations in the a context.
background 
debtors heritage highgate,and heritage twin ponds ii,embarked upon the development of a residential subdivision in lehigh county,pennsylvania the project in august.the project was to consist of townhouses and detached homes.
debtors entered into a series of construction loan agreements,first borrowing from a group of banks led by wachovia the bank lenders.pursuant to their agreement,the bank lenders retained a lien on substantially all of debtors assets as collateral for the loan.debtors subsequently borrowed from several individuals and entities,known collectively as the cornerstone investors.pursuant to those agreements,the cornerstone investors similarly received liens,of equal priority with the bank lenders and each other,on substantially all of debtors assets.the cornerstone investors,however,later agreed to subordinate their secured claims to the secured claim of the bank lenders in a set of intercreditor agreements.
on january,after building and selling approximately a quarter of the planned units,debtors filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code.on june,debtors filed a joint proposed plan of reorganization,which provided that they would complete development of the subdivision and make distributions to their creditors according to a set of projections.in the initial proposed plan,debtors projected that they would first pay the secured claim of the bank lenders in full,then pay the secured claims of the cornerstone investors in full,and thereafter pay all unsecured claims at a rate of approximately each,from the funds earned through lot sales.
in connection with a contested cash collateral hearing debtors offered an appraisal of the project prepared by an experienced real estate appraisal company,reaves lukens,in february to demonstrate the worth of their collateral.the page appraisal set forth in detail the company estimation of the real estate development fair market value pursuant to two appraisal methodologies,the sales comparison approach and the income capitalization approach according to the appraiser,both analyses were well supported by market evidence and yielded virtually identical estimations.the appraiser favored the results of the latter because it more accurately considered the time and expenses related to a real estate development like the project.the bankruptcy court accepted the appraiser calculation of the project fair market value as approximately million,which was then sufficient to cover the entirety of the secured debt.
on september,the official committee of unsecured creditors the committee filed a motion to value the secured claims of the cornerstone investors pursuant to a and federal rule of bankruptcy procedure.the committee claimed that the bankruptcy court should value the secured claims at zero because the collateral securing the cornerstone investors liens,the project,was worth less than the bank lenders senior secured claim.as proof of the collateral worth,the committee submitted the february appraisal previously accepted by the bankruptcy court as evidence of the project fair market value at the contested cash collateral hearing.however,when reduced by interim sales,the fair market value was approximately million the committee urged that,because this amount was insufficient to pay the bank lenders in full,the secured claims of the cornerstone investors were valueless.in response,the cornerstone investors argued that their claims should be deemed wholly secured because projections that accompanied the plan filed by debtors estimated that debtors would derive revenue from the project sufficient to pay their claims in full.the parties agreed to postpone consideration of the motion until after confirmation of the reorganization plan.
on march,debtors submitted their final plan of reorganization.the plan specified that claims of the cornerstone investors would be secured to the extent determined by the bankruptcy court in ruling on the committee motion.the final plan included a projected budget that anticipated full payment of both the bank lenders senior secured debt and the cornerstone investors junior secured debt through the development and sale of lots with completed townhouses and homes over the course of months.according to the budget,unsecured claimants would receive distributions amounting to approximately of their claims.no interested party,including the cornerstone investors,objected to debtors final plan of reorganization.on april,the bankruptcy court entered an order confirming the plan.the bankruptcy court concluded,as required by a,that the plan was feasible,that further liquidation or reorganization beyond the plan provisions would be unlikely.
with the plan confirmed,the bankruptcy court took up the committee motion to value the cornerstone investors secured claims.on april,the parties filed joint stipulations of fact to assist the bankruptcy court in ruling on the motion.they agreed that the bank lenders were then owed approximately million,while the cornerstone investors were owed approximately million.debtors and the cornerstone investors stipulated that the appraised value of the project should be reduced due to debtors sale of lots since the appraisal completion on february,and that,b ased on the appraisal,the total fair market value of the project as of the confirmation date wa s.additional assets held by debtors raised the total value of the collateral securing liens to.
on may,the bankruptcy court held a hearing on the committee motion.at the hearing,the committee reiterated its argument that the appraisal,as adjusted,reflected the worth of the project in accordance with a namely,its fair market value as of confirmation.the appraisal,argued the committee,demonstrated that the fair market value was less than the bank lenders secured claim,such that no value remained to secure the cornerstone investors liens.while they agreed that the appraisal depicted the project fair market value,the cornerstone investors contended that it did not control because a requires that the value of property be determined in light of its proposed disposition or use and the plan budget demonstrated that the debtors would be able to pay their claims in full over time as more homes were sold.they also urged the court to adjudge their claims fully secured,arguing that to deprive them of project revenue to be generated over and above the appraisal value would constitute impermissible lien stripping.
the bankruptcy court agreed with the committee.it determined that the proper method of valuing the cornerstone investors secured claims was the fair market value of the project as of the plan confirmation date.the cornerstone investors did not dispute the accuracy of the fair market value set forth in the appraisal,choosing instead to rely upon the plan budget.the bankruptcy court accepted the appraisal as a proper basis for the valuation.because the amount remaining due on debtors obligation to the bank lenders exceeded the sum of the project fair market value and the value of other assets held by debtors,no collateral remained to secure the cornerstone investors claims.therefore,the bankruptcy court ruled,the cornerstone investors would be treated as unsecured creditors.
the cornerstone investors appealed the bankruptcy court ruling to the district court for the district of new jersey.the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court ruling.relying upon the supreme court decision in associates commercial rash,d,it considered the project fair market value controlling and found the appraisal to have accurately measured that value.the district court rejected the cornerstone investors suggestion that the plan budget constituted the appropriate basis for valuing their secured claims because they knew that the amount of their secured claims would be determined pursuant to the committee motion,as the plan specifically so stated.the plan budget,the district court stated,merely constituted projections meant to demonstrate the plan feasibility,not the project present value.the district court noted that,while the supreme court has prohibited lien stripping in liquidation cases,see dewsnup timm,d,nothing prohibited lien stripping in the reorganization context.
this timely appeal followed.the cornerstone investors make two interrelated arguments,emphasizing throughout that a requires that property be valued in light of its proposed disposition or use.first,the cornerstone investors contend that the project discounted present value,as reflected in the appraisal,can not control the extent to which their claims are secured because the plan calls for debtors to develop and sell homes in the subdivision over time.the bankruptcy court,the argument proceeds,could only have valued the project in a manner respectful of its proposed disposition or use by awaiting the results of the planned.second,the cornerstone investors contend that,by pinning a value to the project prior to the plan completion in violation of a dictates,the bankruptcy court denied them revenue that would ultimately be realized from the project in excess of its appraisal value.they urge that depriving them of any increase in the worth of their collateral beyond its judicially determined value violates restrictions on lien stripping imposed by the supreme court in dewsnup.
after briefly turning to the burden of proof,we address each aspect of the cornerstone investors argument in turn.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction over the instant dispute pursuant to.the district court had jurisdiction to review the final order of the bankruptcy court pursuant to.a.we have jurisdiction pursuant to d.
because the district court sat as an appellate court,reviewing an order of the bankruptcy court,our review of the district court determinations is plenary.in re rashid,cir,superseded on other grounds as stated in in re warfel,cir.in reviewing the bankruptcy court determinations,we exercise the same standard of review as did the district court.fellheimer,eichen braverman,charter,cir.accordingly,the bankruptcy court findings of fact are reviewed only for clear error,while legal determinations are reviewed de novo.in re engel,cir.
iii.discussion 
burden shifting framework 
neither the code nor the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure allocates the burden of proof as to the value of secured claims under a.in the absence of explicit direction,courts have arrived at divergent formulations.although neither the bankruptcy court nor the district court considered this issue,addressing it informs our review of the question on appeal and provides guidance to courts generally.accordingly,we requested supplemental briefing on the issue.we now hold that a framework controls valuations of collateral to decide the extent to which claims are secured pursuant to a.
three approaches to the burden of proof in proceedings to value secured claims under a have predominated in bankruptcy cases.some courts have concluded that the secured creditor bears the burden of proof.see,in re sneijder.other courts have held that the party challenging the value of a claim,usually the debtor,bears the burden of proof.see,in re weichey.a third group of courts has settled on a analysis,pursuant to which the debtor bears the initial burden of proof to overcome the presumed validity and amount of the creditor secured claim,but the ultimate burden of persuasion is upon the creditor to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence both the extent of its lien and the value of the collateral securing its claim.in re robertson.
the circumstances will dictate the assignment of the burden of proof on the question of value.in re young.cognizant of this principle,a approach strikes us as most appropriate in the instant scenario.the initial burden should be on the party challenging a secured claim value,because a and bankruptcy rule f grant prima facie effect to the validity and amount of a properly filed claim.in re williams.it is only fair,then,that the party seeking to negate the presumptively valid amount of a secured claim and thereby affect the rights of a creditor bear the initial burden.see in re brown.if the movant establishes with sufficient evidence that the proof of claim overvalues a creditor secured claim because the collateral is of insufficient value,the burden shifts.the creditor thereafter bears the ultimate burden of persuasion to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence both the extent of its lien and the value of the collateral securing its claim.in re robertson,at.
before applying the framework to this dispute,we must first grapple with the two more fundamental challenges raised by the cornerstone investors that use of the collateral fair market value violated a proposed disposition or use language and,that the collateral increase in value after the a valuation rightly accrues to their benefit.that is because,if either contention is correct,the appraisal would not have constituted a proper basis for the bankruptcy court ruling.
section a valuation standards 
central to resolution of this matter is the text of a.it provides in pertinent part 
an allowed claim of a creditor secured by a lien on property in which the estate has an interest is a secured claim to the extent of the value of such creditor interest in the estate interest in such property and is an unsecured claim to the extent that the value of such creditor interest is less than the amount of such allowed claim.such value shall be determined in light of the purpose of the valuation and of the proposed disposition or use of such property 
a emphasis added.the provision,therefore,calls for the division of secured creditors claims into secured and unsecured portions,with the secured portion s of the claim s limited to the value of the collateral.rash,at.
though the statute requires that collateral be valued,it does not specify the appropriate valuation standard.see in re winthrop old farm nurseries,cir the statute does not direct courts to choose any particular valuation standard in a given type of case.according to a house report on a,v alue does not necessarily contemplate forced sale or liquidation value of the collateral nor does it imply a full going concern value.see,at,reprinted in.rather,congress envisioned a flexible approach to valuation whereby bankruptcy courts would choose the standard that best fits the circumstances of a particular case.id.courts will have to determine the value on a basis,taking into account the facts of each case and the competing interests in the case.congress did make at least one thing clear,though the proposed disposition or use of the collateral is of paramount importance to the valuation question.rash,at.
if that language is to be afforded any significance,then,the appropriate standard for valuing collateral must depend upon what is to be done with the property whether it is to be liquidated,surrendered,or retained by the debtor.in rash,the supreme court considered how to value collateral retained by a chapter debtor exercising the cram down option in a b of the code.the court distinguished that option from the alternative available to the chapter debtor in which its collateral would be surrendered to the objecting debtor when deciding the proper valuation standard under a see id.at the disposition or use of the collateral thus turns on the alternative the debtor chooses.when a debtor elects to use the collateral to generate an income stream as in a cram down,the court noted,use of a standard would be improper because a foreclosure sale will not take place.id.by contrast,the standard values the creditor interest in the collateral in light of the proposed repayment plan reality no foreclosure sale and economic benefit for the debtor derived from the collateral equal to its replacement value.id.quoting in re winthrop old farm nurseries,at alterations in original.accordingly,the court held that under a,the value of property retained is the cost the debtor would incur to obtain a like asset for the same proposed use,its replacement value id.
courts have recognized that similar reasoning applies with equal force in the chapter reorganization context.see,in re mays lake village plainfield campus,the same replacement value can be used in this matter,even though a chapter cram down plan is involved.where a chapter plan of reorganization provides for a debtor to retain and use collateral to generate income with which to make payments to creditors,a a valuation based upon a hypothetical foreclosure sale would not be appropriate,as it would be inconsistent with the provision dictates.in ordinary circumstances the present value of the income stream would instead be equal to the collateral fair market value.in re winthrop old farm nurseries,at.indeed,the rash court considered its use of the term replacement value consistent with the meaning of value because both reflect the price a willing buyer in the debtor trade,business,or situation would pay a willing seller to obtain property of like age and condition.at.the proper measure under a must therefore be the collateral fair market value because it is most respectful of the property anticipated use 
by contrast,the cornerstone investors urge a,or,approach to valuation of the project.they argue that if the property,when sold,will bring in sufficient dollars to pay their secured claims in full,their claims should reflect that value.they suggest that,because debtors will continue to develop and sell lots during the plan life,the extent to which their claims are secured should similarly be calculated over time.to our knowledge,however,under no circumstances has such an approach been used,even when the collateral at issue was of a similar nature.see,in re tamarack trail,valuing a partially completed development project based on the fair market value in its current condition.its absence is for good reason.a approach would in effect do away with bankruptcy courts obligation to determine value under a that result is at odds with the bankruptcy code.in a,congress expressly provided for the division of allowed claims supported by liens into secured and unsecured portions during the reorganization,before the plan success or failure is clear.the fact that its proposed disposition or use should be factored into the valuation does not mean that the time as of which property is valued is to be postponed or altered.
both the bankruptcy court and the district court accurately characterized the budget as simply a set of projections offered in support of the plan feasibility,to demonstrate that the plan would have a reasonable probability of success.see in re tci holdings,llc,the key element of feasibility is whether there is a reasonable probability the provisions of the plan can be performed.it was not intended to function as anything more,and most certainly not as a determination of the value of the cornerstone investors interest in the project.this is clear from the fact that the plan expressly states that the amount of their secured claims will be determined by the bankruptcy court pursuant to the committee motion.more fundamentally,the projections regarding monies to be realized from the sale of lots over time do not equate to value as of confirmation because they anticipate debtors spending time and money to realize value at a later date.that future value should not be credited to the secured creditor at confirmation.a probability of realizing the budget is not a certainty of its realization.in sum,valuations must be based upon realistic measures of present worth.
applying these precepts to the matter at hand,we hold that the bankruptcy court properly concluded that the fair market value of the project as of the confirmation date controls whether the cornerstone investors claims are secured or not.that is because the confirmed plan of reorganization called for debtors to retain ownership of the real estate subdivision in order to complete its development.the discounted fair market value of the property as of the confirmation date,therefore,best approximated just how secure the liens held by creditors namely,the bank lenders and cornerstone investors were at the relevant point in debtors bankruptcy because,as the cornerstone investors stipulated,the appraisal accurately calculated the project fair market value,the bankruptcy court correctly concluded that claims of the cornerstone investors were wholly unsecured.
lien stripping in chapter reorganizations 
the cornerstone investors argue that denying them future lot sale proceeds that exceed the project judicially determined value as of confirmation constitutes a form of lien stripping disallowed by the supreme court decision in dewsnup.for the reasons set forth below,however,we reject this argument.
in dewsnup,the supreme court considered some ambiguities in and its relationship to other provisions of the bankruptcy code when a chapter debtor property increases in value between the time of its judicial valuation and the time of its foreclosure sale.at.guided by the principle that liens are to pass through bankruptcy unaffected,the court rejected the notion that a mortgagee could be forced to accept the judicially determined value,even if the foreclosure sale produced more 
the practical effect of petitioner argument is to freeze the creditor secured interest at the judicially determined valuation.by this approach,the creditor would lose the benefit of any increase in the value of the property by the time of the foreclosure sale.the increase would accrue to the benefit of the debtor,a result some of the parties describe as a windfall.
we think,however,that the creditor lien stays with the real property until the foreclosure.that is what was bargained for by the mortgagor and the mortgagee.
id.at.expressly limiting its focus to the specific facts presented,the court held that a ny increase over the judicially determined valuation during bankruptcy rightly accrues to the benefit of the creditor.id.at.
dewsnup involved a chapter liquidation proceeding and the supreme court did not address whether the same result would be reached in chapter reorganization cases.see id.a great majority of courts that have considered the issue have concluded that the holding in dewsnup should be limited to chapter cases in re johnson.that is because t he rationales advanced in the dewsnup opinion for prohibiting lien stripping have little relevance in the context of rehabilitative bankruptcy proceedings under chapter.in re bartee,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.particularly significant is the fact that,as hinted by the dewsnup court itself,law did provide for the modification of liens in reorganization cases.harmon united states,cir.congress must have enacted the code with a full understanding of this practice.dewsnup,at.the distinction makes sense chapter liquidation proceedings involve the sale of liened property chapter reorganizations involve the retention and use of that property in the rehabilitated debtor business.the code makes that clear the process of lien stripping is ingrained in the reorganization provisions of the bankruptcy code to such an extent that any attempt to extend the holding in dewsnup to chapter cases would require that numerous provisions of the statute be ignored or construed in a very convoluted manner.johnson,at see also in re dever.indeed,congress addition of b permitting modification of the rights of holders of secured claims,except those secured solely by a debtor principal residence seems to constitute explicit approval of lien stripping in chapter bankruptcies.johnson,at.
we therefore agree with the majority of courts that dewsnup holding should not be imported into chap
