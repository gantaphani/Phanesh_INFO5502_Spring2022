amended opinion 
in this case we resolve two questions of first impression in our bankruptcy jurisprudence.first,we hold that a bankruptcy court considering the feasibility of a plan of reorganization under a must evaluate the possible effect of a debtor ongoing civil case with a potential creditor,whether that litigation is pending at the trial level or on appeal.second,we conclude that under limited circumstances,a bankruptcy court may exercise its equitable powers to grant retroactive approval of a financing transaction pursuant to c.
factual and procedural background 
in,jeffrey sherman sold his law practice to harbin apc the professional corporation of john harbin through an asset purchase and consulting agreement.the terms of the agreement are not part of the record on this appeal.however,it is undisputed that as part of the deal,harbin apc agreed to pay sherman a month for ten years in exchange for his consulting services.in,harbin apc stopped making the consulting payments to sherman.
sherman sued harbin,harbin apc,and others in california state court for breach of contract among other things.harbin filed a for a declaratory determination that he was not personally liable for any breach of the consulting agreement.following the first phase of the trial,the jury rendered a special verdict holding both harbin and harbin apc liable for breach of contract in the amount of plus interest,costs,and attorneys fees.while the trial court ruling on harbin declaratory judgment motion was still pending,harbin filed a voluntary chapter bankruptcy petition,triggering the automatic stay provision of.
in june,the trial court set aside the jury original verdict and held that harbin was not personally liable for breach of the consulting agreement.harbin then moved to dismiss his chapter petition.when the bankruptcy court denied the motion,harbin converted the case to chapter.in the meantime,sherman appealed the trial court ruling holding harbin not personally liable 
while his state appeal was pending,sherman filed both an adversary action for breach of contract and a proof of claim in the amount of the jury original state court verdict,plus interest,costs,and attorneys fees in harbin bankruptcy case.in the adversary action,the bankruptcy court granted harbin summary adjudication motion and dismissed sherman claims for relief based on collateral estoppel.while dismissing the adversary action,the bankruptcy court ruled that sherman could seek to reinstate that action if the state appellate court ruled in his favor.the bankruptcy court also sustained harbin objection to sherman proof of claim,again noting that sherman could seek to reinstate his claim should he prevail on his state court appeal.
on december,before the state appellate court decided sherman appeal,the bankruptcy court confirmed harbin second amended plan of reorganization.the plan required harbin to pay his listed creditors percent of their claims following confirmation.the bankruptcy court found the plan feasible under a because harbin allowed creditors were to be paid in full sherman,as a party in interest,objected to the confirmation.sherman argued that harbin plan was not feasible under section a because it did not reserve an allowance for sherman claim should he prevail on appeal.in such event,sherman argued,harbin would not have sufficient assets to cover sherman claim and would be forced into further liquidation or reorganization.
the bankruptcy court rejected this argument on several grounds.the bankruptcy court reasoned that because it had previously disallowed sherman claim,it could not make any provision for the claim or consider the claim in its feasibility evaluation.additionally,the court concluded that the doctrine precluded it from considering the likely outcome of sherman state court appeal.however,the bankruptcy court stated that it would not discharge sherman claim.the court confirmation order provided that if sherman prevailed on his state court appeal,he could file a motion for reconsideration in the bankruptcy court pursuant to cobe smith in re cobe,cir.bap 
at the time it confirmed harbin plan,the bankruptcy court also granted nunc pro tunc approval of a previously unauthorized,refinancing of harbin home in january,harbin wife applied for a loan to refinance the mortgage on their coronado residence.although harbin interest in the residence was an asset of the bankruptcy estate,his wife loan application listed her as the sole borrower.to facilitate the loan transaction,harbin executed a quitclaim deed granting his interest in the residence to his wife,so that his wife would appear on the title to the residence as the sole owner.after the refinancing lender,indymac bank,indymac,funded the loan,harbin wife quitclaimed her interest in the residence back to herself and harbin,as joint tenants,thereby returning harbin interest in the residence back to the bankruptcy estate.
harbin filed with the bankruptcy court a motion for nunc pro tunc approval of the refinancing after it was completed.in a declaration supporting his motion,harbin stated,i am aware that i should have obtained court approval prior to conducting this refinancing transaction.
indymac joined harbin motion for nunc pro tunc approval and filed its own motion seeking the same.indymac declarations submitted to the court stated it had not been aware that harbin interest in the residence was an asset of his bankruptcy estate and had inadvertently overlooked the title report notation indicating that harbin was in bankruptcy at the time he conveyed his interest in the residence to his wife.
indymac argued that the completed refinancing benefited the bankruptcy estate.the harbins used the loan from indymac to retire the mortgage on the coronado residence,thus reducing harbin mortgage payments by more than per month.the harbins also paid off outstanding property taxes of.finally,the refinancing provided to fund harbin second amended plan of reorganization which,if confirmed,would have paid all of harbin creditors in full.
sherman objected to both parties motions for nunc pro tunc approval.sherman argued that harbin and his wife acted in bad faith and that indymac had constructive knowledge of the bankruptcy proceedings through the title report.moreover,sherman claimed that the refinancing did not benefit the bankruptcy estate because it merely lowered harbin monthly mortgage payments which were paid out of harbin earnings.
applying a test similar to that set forth in atkins wain,samuel in re atkins,cir,the bankruptcy court granted nunc pro tunc approval of the refinancing transaction.specifically,the bankruptcy court ruled it would have approved the refinancing had harbin made a timely prior application the refinancing benefited the bankruptcy estate indymac had a good faith belief that it could enter into the refinancing transaction and c ompelling equities and the absence of prejudice to interested parties supported the grant of nunc pro tunc approval 
sherman appealed both the bankruptcy court confirmation of the plan and its grant of nunc pro tunc approval to the district court.while this appeal was pending,the california court of appeal resolved sherman state court appeal by reinstating harbin personal liability on the original jury verdict.the district court took judicial notice of the court of appeal decision and held that in light of this changed circumstance,the plan proposed by harbin was no longer feasible.the district court thus vacated the bankruptcy court order confirming the plan and remanded the case to the bankruptcy court for further proceedings.the district court also affirmed the bankruptcy court grant of the nunc pro tunc approval of the refinancing.
harbin now appeals the district court decision holding that his plan is not feasible.sherman the district court affirmance of the bankruptcy court grant of nunc pro tunc approval of the refinancing transaction.indymac responds to sherman.
jurisdiction and standards of review 
we have jurisdiction over the final order of the district court reviewing the final order of the bankruptcy court.d.
because we are in as good a position as the district court to review the findings of the bankruptcy court,we independently review the bankruptcy court decision.pizza of hawaii,shakey,in re pizza of hawaii,cir.the issue whether a plan is not likely to be followed by liquidation or further one of fact,which we review under the clearly erroneous standard.id.the bankruptcy court application of the doctrine is a question of law,which we review de novo.see id.we review the bankruptcy court decision to grant nunc pro tunc approval for abuse of discretion or erroneous application of the law.atkins,at.
discussion 
we first address the question whether the bankruptcy court erred in confirming harbin second amended plan of reorganization.to confirm a plan,a bankruptcy court must find that the plan is feasible,meaning that c onfirmation of the plan is not likely to be followed by the liquidation,or the need for further financial reorganization,of the debtor.a.
to be feasible for purposes of section a,a plan must take into account the possibility that a potential creditor may,following confirmation,recover a large judgment against the debtor.pizza of hawaii.in pizza of hawaii,pizza,the debtor in the bankruptcy proceedings,was embroiled in contractual and trademark litigation with shakey,a national franchiser of outlets.id.at.before the extent of pizza potential liability to shakey was resolved in the civil action,the bankruptcy court confirmed pizza plan of reorganization,expressly finding the plan feasible notwithstanding the fact that it failed to provide for the possibility that shakey would recover a large judgment.id.at.as approved,the plan provided only that should the civil action be decided in shakey favor,there shall be no further distributions to claimants in the class to which shakey claim belongs,or to junior classes of claimants,until shakey has received the money or property to which it would have been entitled from the date of confirmation of this plan,had its claim initially been allowed in the amount finally determined.id.at quoting the confirmed plan alteration in pizza of hawaii.
the district court ruled that the bankruptcy court finding of feasibility was clearly erroneous because the plan failed to provide for the possibility that shakey would recover a large judgment in the civil case.id.therefore,the district court vacated the plan and remanded to the bankruptcy court to reconsider the plan feasibility in light of its estimate of shakey claim.id.we agreed,noting that if shakey prevailed in the civil action and attempted to collect under the plan,pizza would be unable to pay of its claims.id.alternatively,if shakey prevailed in the civil action after pizza had paid all its claims,shakey efforts to collect its claim could likely force pizza into chapter.id.
under pizza of hawaii,a bankruptcy court can not adequately determine a plan feasibility for purposes of section a without evaluating whether a potential future judgment may affect the debtor ability to implement its plan.id.a bankruptcy court failure to consider such a possibility in discharging its duties under section a is clear error.see also brutoco eng g constr.dennis ponte,in re dennis ponte,cir.bap.
here,the bankruptcy court concluded that it could not consider the effect of sherman pending appeal in its feasibility analysis for several reasons.we find none of them persuasive.
first,the bankruptcy court distinguished pizza of hawaii because the creditor claim in that case had not been reduced to judgment in state court.this distinction is irrelevant.our reasoning in pizza of hawaii was not based on the fact that the claim was pending in the state trial court.instead,we held generally that the bankruptcy court finding of feasibility was clearly erroneous because the plan failed to provide for the possibility that shakey would recover a large judgment in the civil case.at emphasis added.under pizza of hawaii,the bankruptcy court obligation to evaluate the effect of a pending claim on the feasibility of a plan does not hinge on whether the claim is pending in the state trial court rather than in the state appellate court.
second,the bankruptcy court reasoned that it could not consider the effect of sherman claim on the plan because it had previously conditionally disallowed this claim,whereas the bankruptcy court had not disallowed shakey claim in pizza of hawaii.however,under the bankruptcy court rulings,sherman claim could significantly affect the plan feasibility in the future.for example,the bankruptcy court held that sherman claim was not being discharged,and sherman could move to have his claim reinstated if he prevailed on appeal.as in pizza of hawaii,if sherman prevailed on appeal before harbin cash reserves were paid out,and sherman successfully reinstated his bankruptcy claim,harbin could not satisfy the plan obligations to other creditors.see id.if sherman prevailed on appeal after harbin cash reserves had been paid out,sherman could force harbin into liquidation or further reorganization.see id.because sherman claim could affect the feasibility of harbin plan notwithstanding the bankruptcy court conditional disallowance of the claim,the bankruptcy court was still obliged to consider the claim under section a.
third,the bankruptcy court concluded that the doctrine precluded the court from taking into consideration the possibility that sherman could prevail on appeal.the bankruptcy court deemed sherman challenge to the feasibility of harbin plan to be a collateral attack on the litigation pending in state court,because it would,in effect,nullify the state trial court determination that sherman had no claim.
the bankruptcy court conclusion on this point reflects a misunderstanding of the scope of the doctrine.the doctrine arises from the unremarkable observation that congress has not given district courts general appellate jurisdiction over state court judgments.gruntz county of los angeles in re gruntz,cir en banc.briefly stated,the doctrine bars a losing party in state court from seeking what in substance would be appellate review of the state judgment in a united states district court,based on the losing party claim that the state judgment itself violates the loser federal rights.johnson de grandy,d.accordingly,the doctrine is confined to cases brought by losers complaining of injuries caused by judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.exxon mobil saudi basic indus,d.
sherman challenge to the feasibility of harbin plan did not implicate the narrow ground occupied by rooker feldman,because sherman was asking the bankruptcy court only to consider the possibility that the state appellate court would reinstate the original jury verdict,not to make any substantive ruling or to review and reject the state trial court judgment.congress has explicitly given the bankruptcy court jurisdiction to consider questions concerning confirmation of a debtor plan,and in doing so to estimate the various claims and interests against the debtor estate.see b b l see also gruntz,at when congress gives a federal court express jurisdiction over state court matters,for example,by giving the bankruptcy court authority to void,modify,or discharge state court judgments,the doctrine has no application.the bankruptcy court thus erred in concluding that the doctrine prevented it from considering the consequences of sherman appeal 
because the bankruptcy court failed to consider the consequences of sherman potential success on appeal,it clearly erred in failing to discharge its obligations under section a.see pizza of hawaii,at in re dennis ponte,at.therefore,we affirm the district court ruling vacating the bankruptcy court confirmation of harbin second amended plan.in doing so,we emphasize the limited reach of our holding.under the plain language of section a and our decision in pizza of hawaii,a bankruptcy court must evaluate the possible impact of the debtor ongoing civil litigation on the feasibility of the proposed plan.however,our decision today does not dictate the conclusion a bankruptcy court should reach after conducting such an evaluation rather,the bankruptcy court must exercise its sound discretion in considering how such litigation may affect the feasibility of any specific plan 
we thus affirm the district court vacatur of the bankruptcy court order of confirmation without reaching the question whether a plan that was feasible when confirmed may,due to changed circumstances on appeal,subsequently become infeasible.see padilla terhune,cir this court may affirm the district court on any ground supported by the record,even if it differs from the reasoning of the district court.although we hold that the bankruptcy court failed to comply fully with the requirements of section a,we can not conclude,without the benefit of the bankruptcy court analysis of the issue,whether the plan was in fact feasible when confirmed.the bankruptcy court is best situated to evaluate,in the first instance,how the potential outcome of sherman state appeal might affect the feasibility of harbin plan.therefore,we affirm the district court ruling vacating the bankruptcy court confirmation of the plan and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion 
we next turn to the bankruptcy court nunc pro tunc approval of the secured refinancing of harbin residence pursuant to section c.on appeal,sherman contends that the bankruptcy court abused its discretion in granting nunc pro tunc approval and seeks to set aside that ruling 
we begin with the underlying rule that chapter debtors in possession are required to obtain the approval of the bankruptcy court when they wish to incur secured debt.see c,c thompson margen in re mcconville,cir.this obligation stems from section of the bankruptcy code,which prohibits encumbrances on the bankruptcy estate.after a debtor files for bankruptcy,an automatic stay goes into effect prohibiting,among other actions,any act to create,perfect,or enforce any lien against property of the estate.a see also schwartz united states in re schwartz,cir.
section c provides an exception to this prohibition against creating a lien on property of the bankruptcy estate.specifically,section c provides that the court,after notice and a hearing,may authorize the obtaining of credit or the incurring of debt secured by a lien on property of the estate that is not otherwise subject to a lien.c.
we have interpreted section c as requiring a debtor to obtain the bankruptcy court authorization before incurring secured debt.mcconville,at.mcconville held that if the debtor fails to obtain prior authorization,the bankruptcy court may exercise its corrective power to rescind the transaction.id.however,mcconville also stressed that t he exercise of this corrective power should not occur without regard to the equities of the situation.id.where the debtor incurs debt without first obtaining court authorization,the bankruptcy court may exercise its equitable discretion to develop an appropriate remedy,provided,of course,that the chosen remedy is consistent with the provisions of the bankruptcy code.id.
nunc pro tunc authorization with concurrent relief from the automatic stay is one such available remedy.applying principles of equity,we have recognized the bankruptcy court equitable discretion to grant retroactive authorization in other contexts where such relief was necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of the code.see,atkins,at pac.shores,llc v.at home in re at home,cir see also a granting bankruptcy courts the equitable power to issue any order that is necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of the bankruptcy code.under the right circumstances,retroactive validation of a refinancing transaction will further the provisions of the code.the bankruptcy court grant of retroactive approval may provide a significant benefit to the debtor estate,or otherwise assist the debtor in funding a successful plan for reorganization.
moreover,nothing in the language of the bankruptcy code precludes the court from considering nunc pro tunc authorization of the refinancing as one possible remedy in response to the equities of the situation before it.see norwest bank worthington ahlers,d whatever equitable powers remain in the bankruptcy courts must and can only be exercised within the confines of the bankruptcy code.section c does not,by its express terms,require the bankruptcy court to authorize the financing transaction before the debt is incurred.therefore,should a debtor improperly obtain secured financing without prior court authorization,a bankruptcy court exercise of its equitable discretion in granting nunc pro tunc approval pursuant to section c will not be inconsistent with the express provisions of the bankruptcy code.
in this case,although the refinancing transaction of harbin residence did not comply with the prior authorization requirement imposed on section c by our case law,mcconville,at,the bankruptcy court elected to exercise its equitable discretion to grant nunc pro tunc approval of the transaction.in doing so,the bankruptcy court applied the standards set forth in atkins,at.
although decided in a different context,atkins provides useful guidance on the circumstances that warrant an equitable exception to the prior authorization requirement.atkins involved a violation of a,which we interpreted as requiring prior court authorization of professional services rendered to the bankruptcy estate.at.we noted that bankruptcy courts possess the equitable power to approve retroactively a professional valuable but unauthorized services,but limited that retroactive approval to situations in which exceptional circumstances exist.id.at see also okamoto thc fin.in re thc fin,cir fanelli hensley in re triangle,cir cautioning that the availability of an equitable exception should not invite the general of the prior authorization requirement,and that nunc pro tunc approval should be limited to exceptional circumstances.we held that t o establish the presence of exceptional circumstances,professionals seeking retroactive approval must satisfy two requirements they must satisfactorily explain their failure to receive prior judicial approval and demonstrate that their services benefited the bankrupt estate in a significant manner.atkins,at.in addition,we held that retroactive authorization may be granted only where the untimely request otherwise satisfies the express requirements for such approval prescribed by the code.id.at.
the criteria for retroactive approval set forth in atkins are generally consistent with the equitable principles identified in mcconville.mcconville,like the case before us,addressed a lender failure to obtain prior authorization under section c.at.mcconville noted that in tailoring an appropriate equitable remedy for a violation of section c,a court should consider whether the lender has adequately explained its failure to seek prior authorization thus demonstrating its good faith and whether the loan transaction provided a benefit to the bankruptcy estate.id.
from our decisions in mcconville and atkins,we distill four factors that the bankruptcy court should consider in determining whether to exercise its equitable discretion to grant nunc pro tunc approval of financing under section c whether the financing transaction benefits the bankruptcy estate whether the creditor has adequately explained its failure to seek prior authorization or otherwise established that it acted in good faith when it failed to seek prior authorization whether there is full compliance with the requirements of section c and whether the circumstances of the case present one of those rare situations in which retroactive authorization is appropriate.see mcconville,at atkins,at.provided that these criteria are met,the bankruptcy court may,but need not,grant an application for nunc pro tunc authorization.
under this standard,the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in granting nunc pro tunc approval of harbin refinancing transaction.first,on the record before us,the bankruptcy court finding that the refinancing benefited the bankruptcy estate was not clearly erroneous.the refinancing benefited harbin bankruptcy estate by providing the necessary cash infusion to fund harbin second ame
