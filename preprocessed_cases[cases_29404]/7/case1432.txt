greg and lynne gebert brought a qui tam action against transport administrative services tas and david steward.the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment on the grounds of res judicata,judicial estoppel,standing,and release.the geberts appeal and we affirm.
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo and apply the same standards as the district court.united states ex rel.glass medtronic,cir.summary judgment is proper only when all the evidence presented demonstrates that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
greg gebert is a former officer and shareholder of tas,which did business as worldwide technology.his wife,lynne gebert,was an employee of tas.david steward,an,was the owner,president,and of tas.in,steward submitted an application to the small business administration sba on behalf of tas for certification as a enterprise under section a of the small business act,e several months after the successful certification,tas claimed that it had discovered evidence that the geberts had misappropriated over in company assets.tas terminated the geberts employment effective september.
in july,the geberts filed a bankruptcy petition under chapter of the bankruptcy code.the petition was converted into a chapter liquidation,and a chapter trustee was appointed.as a part of the bankruptcy proceeding,the geberts were required to file a schedule listing all of their assets schedule b.the geberts did not list a claim against tas under the false claims act on their schedule 
in the bankruptcy proceedings,tas filed claims against the geberts seeking the recovery of more than in misappropriated funds.the geberts,in turn,charged that they were entitled to million from tas.with litigation looming,the geberts,the bankruptcy trustee,tas,steward and the largest secured creditor entered into a settlement agreement and release.as part of the agreement,the geberts and the bankruptcy trustee agreed to release tas and steward 
from any and all manner of action,causes of action,claims,debts,demands,damages,liabilities,controversies suits,known or unknown,that the geberts now have or at any time heretofore had or held against tas or steward by reason of any cause,matter or thing whatsoever that occurred or existed as of november.
settlement agreement and release.in december,the settlement agreement was approved by the bankruptcy court.the geberts were discharged from bankruptcy in june,and a final decree closed the proceedings in april.
on february,the geberts filed a qui tam lawsuit that named tas and steward as defendants.qui tam is a provision of the false claims act fca that allows private citizens known as relators to file a lawsuit and seek recovery in the name of the federal government against those who knowingly present a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the federal government.a when a qui tam action is filed,the complaint is sealed and the government is notified.id.b.the government then has a specified period in which it decides whether or not to intervene in the action.id.b b.if the government intervenes,it shall have the primary responsibility for prosecuting the action,and shall not be bound by an act of the person bringing the action.id.c.if the government chooses not to intervene,the relator has the right to conduct the action.id.b b.if the qui tam relator proceeds without the government,the relator is entitled to a and thirty any damages awarded the remainder goes to the united states.id.d.
the geberts qui tam complaint alleged that tas application to the sba violated the fca by providing false and misleading information about steward degree of ownership and control over tas,which was dispositive in the government decision to certify tas as a enterprise under section a of the small business act.as required under the fca provisions,the geberts filed the complaint under seal and did not serve it on steward or tas.see b.for over a year,the united states evaluated whether it would exercise its statutory right to intervene in the case.the government ultimately decided not to intervene.the complaint was then unsealed and served on steward and tas,and the united states reserved the right to monitor the litigation.
on august,steward and tas filed a motion to dismiss the complaint or,alternatively,for summary judgment.the defendants argued that the geberts failure to list the qui tam claim on their schedule b in the bankruptcy proceedings barred them from subsequently proceeding with the claim.specifically,the defendants contended that the geberts could not proceed in their qui tam action because after the bankruptcy became final,the qui tam claim was an asset of the bankruptcy estate and only the bankruptcy trustee,not the geberts,had standing to bring the suit the previous bankruptcy settlement and release between the geberts and the qui tam defendants barred the claim the claim is prohibited under judicial estoppel principles based on the geberts irreconcilable positions of first failing to list the qui tam claim as an asset in the bankruptcy proceeding and then filing the qui tam claim in another court and the final judgment of the bankruptcy proceedings barred the claim under res judicata.the district court granted the defendants motion on all four grounds standing,release,judicial estoppel,and res judicata.the geberts appeal.
the geberts first argue that the district court erred in finding that they did not have standing to bring the qui tam claim.the district court held that because the geberts failed to list the potential qui tam claim on their schedule b,the unscheduled qui tam claim became the property of the bankruptcy estate at the conclusion of the bankruptcy proceedings.because debtors generally may not pursue unscheduled claims after bankruptcy,the court held the geberts lacked standing to bring the claim.
under the bankruptcy code,a,all of the debtors legal and equitable interests are transferred to the bankruptcy estate at the time the bankruptcy petition is filed.the property of a bankruptcy estate is broadly defined,sosne reinert duree in re just brakes,cir,cert.denied,d,and encompasses conditional,future,speculative,and equitable interests of the debtor.affiliated computer,sherman in re kemp,cir per curiam.most importantly,the property of the bankruptcy estate includes all causes of action that the debtor could have brought at the time of the bankruptcy petition.see mixon anderson in re ozark rest.equip,cir,cert.denied,d.
the record shows that,as of july when the geberts filed for bankruptcy,they possessed all of the information necessary to file the qui tam claim against tas and steward.the law is clear that once the geberts filed the bankruptcy petition in all of their property rights and interests became assets of the bankruptcy estate.see koch ref.farmers union cent,cir,cert.denied,d.accordingly,at the time the geberts filed the qui tam claim,the claim had long since passed to the bankruptcy estate and the geberts no longer had standing to bring it.
the geberts argue that,despite their earlier bankruptcy,they can not be divested of standing to bring the qui tam claim because it is the united states that imparts standing to the geberts,not the geberts own.we disagree.the supreme court recently held that a qui tam relator has article iii standing to bring suit.agency of nat.res.united states ex rel.stevens,d.the court reasoned that the qui tam provisions of the fca impart statutory standing on the relator,and that a qui tam relator has a concrete private interest in the outcome of the suit.id.at quoting lujan defenders of wildlife,d alteration in original.the court went on,however,to wrestle with the reality that the only concrete private interest a relator has in a qui tam action is the prospect of receiving money damages the court stated that an interest that is merely a byproduct of the suit itself can not rise to a cognizable injury in fact for standing purposes.id.at quoting steel citizens for a better env t,d.the court ultimately reconciled the derivative nature of a qui tam relator claim with the requirement of article iii standing under the framework of a relationship between the united states and the relator.the court held that adequate basis for the relator suit for his bounty is to be found in the doctrine that the assignee of a claim has standing to assert the injury in fact suffered by the assignor.the fca can reasonably be regarded as effecting a partial assignment of the government damages claim.id.
the question that remains after stevens is whether a relator can maintain article iii standing once the assignee of the qui tam,for all intents and purposes,an assignor to the bankruptcy estate of the portion of the claim assigned to the relator.we think not.as we noted above,stevens framed the issue of a qui tam relator article iii standing around the potential recovery that the relator may realize from the claim and the united states assignment of its.at.after bankruptcy,the relator no longer has an interest in any damages because the claim is no longer his the relator right to the claim including any money damages is now the property of the bankruptcy estate.at the time the geberts filed the qui tam claim,they no longer had a stake in the litigation or in any money damages that might flow therefrom,there was no bounty that they would be entitled to in the event their claim was successful.if article iii standing in qui tam cases is founded in a statutory assignment of the government to the relator,as stevens says it is,then the bankruptcy proceeding,which divests the relator of the ability to retain an assignment from the united states,would also divest the relator of standing to bring the claim.
the united states,as amicus curiae,tries to get around the assignment of the gebert qui tam claim to the bankruptcy estate by contending that the united states had not yet assigned the claim to the geberts at the time of bankruptcy.this argument fails for three reasons.first,neither the geberts nor the united states point to any authority that supports their proposition that the united states assignment of its occurred at the time the qui tam case was filed.in fact,the caselaw goes the other way.see united states ex.rel.kelly boeing,cir noting that the fca effectively assigns the government claims to qui tam plaintiffs who then may sue emphasis added,cert.denied,d.second,we reject the notion that the qui tam claim was only perfected subsequent to the bankruptcy.the record is clear that the geberts possessed all the necessary information about tas and steward for the qui tam claim to proceed at or before the time of bankruptcy they gained little,if any,information subsequent to the bankruptcy.it is also clear that the geberts could have filed the qui tam claim in irrespective of any action or inaction on the part of the united states.third,even if we accepted the proposition that the united states had assigned the qui tam claim to the geberts subsequent to their filing for bankruptcy,it can not be disputed that the geberts had assigned their right to the qui tam claim to the bankruptcy estate through the settlement agreement and release.the geberts fail to recognize that the critical point is when they transferred their right to the qui tam claim to the bankruptcy estate,not when the united states claims it assigned the claim to the geberts.an assignment from the united states subsequent to the geberts discharge in bankruptcy would simply pass to the bankruptcy estate,leaving the geberts without standing to bring the qui tam claim.we find that the geberts lack standing to bring the claim.
the geberts and the bankruptcy trustee entered into a settlement agreement and release with steward and tas that bars all known or unknown cause s of action,claim s,and suits among the parties.settlement agreement and release.the terms of the agreement clearly preclude the geberts qui tam claim.the geberts,however,argue that the enforcement of a release of a qui tam claim is against public policy because the release was executed without the united states knowledge or consent and because the geberts are not the real party in interest specifically,they argue that the district court should have followed the ninth circuit holding in united states northrop,cir,cert.denied,d,that a qui tam action survives a general settlement and release for public policy reasons.in northrop,the court looked to the text and legislative history of the fca to determine whether a relator had authority to settle a qui tam claim before it is filed.the text of the statute and the legislative history were silent on the issue.the court then sought a federal common law rule that would dictate an answer and turned to the balancing test of town of newton rumery,d,and a subsequent case that applied rumery,davies grossmont union high school district,cir,cert.denied,d.
the supreme court in rumery held enforceable an agreement by which a prosecutor agreed to waive criminal charges against a defendant if the defendant agreed to drop his civil rights claims against the prosecutor.the court employed a balancing test to weigh the competing interests and concluded that only private rights were affected by the agreement and that there was no broad public interest that outweighed rumery decision to enter into the agreement.for our purposes here,the importance of rumery is the balancing test that the court used to analyze the agreement.a promise will be found unenforceable if the interest in its enforcement is outweighed in the circumstances by a public policy harmed by enforcement of the agreement.at.
the ninth circuit reached its decision in northrop by applying the rumery balancing test and weighing the interests in enforcing the parties release against the effect on the public interest if the release was not enforced.the release,the court contended,threatened to undermine the efficacy of the fca qui tam provisions in their entirety because employers with qui tam liability would settle with employees for an amount less than they would pay as a result of a successful qui tam action.northrop,at.a rational employee would accept a settlement and release in which the employer would pay all monies to the employee and none to the government.a rational employer would settle with the potential relator at an amount significantly lower than the employer qui tam exposure.because the potential qui tam relator would recover more money through a private settlement than he would had he received only a portion of a qui tam judgment,the incentive for a relator to bring a qui tam claim would dissolve.as a result,few would bring qui tam claims and the government would no longer benefit from the significant revenues that qui tam actions yield the court ultimately held that the enforcement of releases of qui tam claims would undermine the qui tam provisions of the fca to such a degree that such releases should be unenforceable.id.at.
we agree with the parties that the rumery test applies to the agreement between the geberts and the qui tam defendants,see id.at,but we find that northrop differs from this case in one crucial,and ultimately dispositive,respect the geberts entered into the settlement agreement and release of the qui tam claim in the context of a bankruptcy proceeding,not through a general,independent release of a claim for money,as was the case in northrop.we recognize the threat that general releases pose to the viability of the qui tam provisions but we find that the threat to the public interest that was essential to the holding in northrop is not implicated by the instant agreement.
on the one hand,a court refusal to enforce a settlement agreement and release of a qui tam implicates some value to the public interest.most obviously,if another relator did not come forward after the first relator settled,the actual qui tam claim would never be filed,and the united states,unless it became aware of the claim and filed its own action,would not be able to recover any money damages from transgressors.this would not only lead to a loss of revenue to the united states,but it would also lead potential transgressors to act with more impunity in violating the fca.in addition,the cost to potential qui
