when john catt,a builder,declared bankruptcy,the hashes,who had been joint venturers with catt and had obtained a fraud judgment against him in an indiana state court for almost half a million dollars,sought a ruling from the bankruptcy judge that the judgment debt to them was not dischargeable in bankruptcy.a a.the judge ruled,however,that the hashes could not use the doctrine of collateral estoppel to make the state court finding of fraud binding in the bankruptcy proceeding they would have to prove fraud anew in that proceeding to defeat discharge.they declined to do so,standing on their claim of collateral estoppel,and so the bankruptcy judge ruled the debt dischargeable.the district judge affirmed,and the hashes appeal.d mellon bank,dick,cir.
hash had been catt business manager.she and her husband had made a deal with catt building company which has declared bankruptcy separately and is not a party to this case to buy jointly a piece of land on which catt would build a house.the plan was that when the house was sold,the hashes and catt would split the profits.construction was delayed,building costs soared,and the parties had a falling out.catt company sued the hashes for their share of the cost of the house and they counterclaimed for fraud and also filed a complaint against catt himself,whom they depict as the main perpetrator of the fraud,the company being merely his cat paw.the alleged fraud,so far as can be gleaned from a very sparse record,consisted of his having obtained the hashes consent to use the construction loan from the bank to defray the exorbitant costs of construction that catt had incurred,without telling the hashes that to use the proceeds of the loan in this matter would just be to throw good money after bad.
a hearing was held two and a half weeks before the trial in the state court was scheduled to begin,to consider catt failure to cooperate in discovery.at the hearing catt lawyer indicated that catt was planning to declare bankruptcy and did seem interested in continuing with the litigation.later the lawyer filed a motion to withdraw as counsel on the ground that catt was cooperating with him.the judge granted the motion the day before the trial was to begin.the next day the hashes and their lawyer appeared for the trial,but no catt.the trial was more than an hour or two.it consisted of a handful of questions asked the hashes by their lawyer,and their answers.at the conclusion of the trial the lawyer submitted findings and conclusions to the judge,who found fraud and awarded the hashes in damages,including in punitive damages.

do these states have a deviant understanding of collateral estoppel,or,worse,are they violating due process the answer to both questions is no.
surprisingly,there is no uniform agreement on the criteria for giving findings collateral estoppel effect.the supreme court has said that they are entitled to such effect as long as there was an opportunity for a full and fair hearing,parklane hosiery shore,d,which suggests that findings made in a default proceeding might well have such effect.but the court has also suggested the contrary by ruling that an issue must be actually litigated for the resolution of it to collaterally estop.arizona california,d see also restatement second of judgments,comment e,charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice procedure ed.arizona california involved findings made in a consent proceeding rather than in a default proceeding but in holding that such findings do not collaterally estop unless the parties to the consent decree had indicated that they intended them to do so,the court quoted with approval the passage in the restatement,cited above,that says that findings made in default proceedings are not to be given collateral estoppel effect either.an old supreme court decision,cromwell county of sac,actually says that findings in a default proceeding are not entitled to such effect.

but the federal rule is necessarily a rule about federal judgments.all that is important in this case,given that the criteria for precluding relitigation of findings or a judgment are established by the jurisdiction that renders the judgment,is that due process does not require in every case either a hearing or that a particular issue be actually litigated it requires that the party sought to be precluded have had an opportunity for a hearing,richards jefferson county,d united states james daniel good real property,d.
catt had that.he says his lawyer did tell him he was withdrawing from the case,but even if that is true it does not relieve catt from the consequences of his default.he knew about the suit,of course he knew that a trial was scheduled he had no reasonable ground for thinking that the trial would not be held merely because his lawyer was quitting and he could have sought a continuance to enable him to hire another lawyer.it is apparent that,as his lawyer thought,catt was determined to bypass the state court litigation in the hope that any judgment rendered against him in that suit would be wiped out by a discharge in his anticipated bankruptcy.
thus,had there been no trial at all but merely the entry of a default judgment on motion by the hashes when catt failed to appear at the trial,the state court finding of fraud,being an essential predicate of the judgment,would,under indiana law and consistent with due process and therefore binding on the bankruptcy court,have had the same collateral estoppel effect as if the finding had been made after a full adversary proceeding.so the fact that the trial which was actually held in the indiana state court was a travesty of a trial,lacking as it did an adversary dimension or for that matter the kind of active judicial participation that characterizes the inquisitorial systems of the continental european fact that it was no better,really,than a default bail catt out.in re bursack,cir.in general and in the present setting,the greater includes the lesser.if,as we have just held,a default judgment is entitle
