appellant brian beitel appeals the district court order affirming the bankruptcy court denial of his motion to set aside or to vacate the default judgment against him.concluding that the bankruptcy court erred by employing the incorrect burden of proof,we vacate both the bankruptcy court denial of beitel motion to set aside or to vacate the default judgment and the district court order,and remand to the bankruptcy court to conduct a de novo evidentiary hearing.
facts and proceedings 
this appeal arises from an adversary proceeding in the chapter bankruptcy of appellee oca,and its subsidiaries,including appellee oca outsource,collectively,oca.in,beitel,a solo pediatric dental practitioner,entered into an outsource agreement with oca.in this agreement,oca agreed to provide specified business and administrative services to beitel practice in exchange for a monthly service fee.on the same day that he signed the outsource agreement,beitel signed two promissory notes payable to oca which permitted him to obtain loans aggregating up to.by late,beitel had stopped paying oca the monthly service fees as they became due and had defaulted on the promissory notes.
having previously filed a petition voluntarily commencing chapter bankruptcy proceedings,oca initiated the instant adversary proceeding on august,by filing a complaint against beitel.in it,oca sought to recover for,inter alia,beitel breach of the outsource agreement and default on the promissory notes.
on august,oca served beitel with copies of the summons and complaint via mail,as permitted by federal rule of bankruptcy procedure,addressed to both his home and office.beitel denies receiving either of these mailings.
on february,the bankruptcy court consolidated this adversary proceeding with approximately one hundred other oca adversary proceedings.the court specified that these proceedings would be tried in blocks and permitted oca to schedule which adversary proceedings would be tried in which blocks.oca included its proceeding against beitel in its proposed june trial schedule as one of ten cases for the second round of trials scheduled for june.oca mailed this schedule to beitel,and he admits receiving it but insists that this was the first time that he had received notice of any action against him by oca.
beitel then contacted his attorney,clement cartron,who on may,spoke with oca counsel,marguerite kingsmill.cartron asserts that kingsmill told him that the adversary proceeding against beitel would not be called until the last week of the june round of trials.cartron also asked to be sent a copy of the summons and complaint.one week later,on may,oca copies of the summons and complaint to cartron.
as cartron is a general practitioner without significant bankruptcy experience,he encouraged beitel to seek special bankruptcy counsel.in response,beitel contacted michael lee,a bankruptcy practitioner,to discuss representation.on june or,lee contacted a different oca attorney,drew ballina.lee recalls that ballina told him specifically that no default would be taken against beitel and that the merits would be addressed after beitel filed an answer.ballina claims,however,that he told lee that trial would occur according to the proposed june trial schedule.ballina also claims that lee told him that beitel had not yet officially retained him as counsel.
on june,oca filed a proposed pretrial order in which the instant adversary proceeding was scheduled to commence on june,however,the bankruptcy judge called the adversary proceeding against beitel for trial on the same day that the proposed schedule was filed,june.neither beitel nor his counsel appeared.when the bankruptcy judge inquired whether beitel had filed an answer,oca counsel responded that none had been filed he did not,however,volunteer the fact that lee had just contacted ballina.unaware of the negotiations between opposing counsel,the bankruptcy court proceeded to hear the case.oca called one witness,its chief restructuring officer,who testified regarding the pertinent contracts and the amounts due under these agreements.the bankruptcy court granted oca a default judgment in the amount sought and requested that oca prepare and submit a proposed judgment.
a week later,beitel filed his original answer to oca complaint.although his answer is dated june,it was not filed until june.beitel filed an amended answer three days later.on that same day,june,the bankruptcy court entered oca proposed default judgment against beitel in the amount of plus costs and interest.
on july,beitel filed a motion to set aside or to vacate the june default judgment.beitel asserted that he was never served with the complaint pursuant to federal rule of bankruptcy procedure he first learned of the existence of an action against him by way of the proposed june trial schedule he was misled by oca in telephone communications just prior to trial regarding the status of his adversary proceeding and he had a meritorious defense to oca claim.oca opposed beitel motion to vacate.
on august,the bankruptcy court held a hearing on the motion and ruled in oca favor.recognizing that oca was entitled to a presumption of valid service,the bankruptcy court ruled that beitel had failed to rebut this presumption by clear and convincing evidence.specifically,the bankruptcy court stated 
i convinced that beitel simply ignored the service of the complaint and the summons and that you have not has not carried the burden of overcoming the presumption of valid service that attaches to the two certificates of service,one of which shows that service was made at his home by mailing on august an envelope that was duly stamped and correctly addressed,and another that was mailed to his correct office address also on august.
on the basis of the case law and on the basis of the two certificates of service i hold that beitel has not overcome the presumption that proper service was made of both the complaint and the summons.in addition,there is evidence,uncontroverted evidence that many other things were mailed to these same two addresses and that they were not returned and there no complaint about there sic not having been received.to the contrary,you admit that he received a number of things at these addresses.the one instance in which something was misaddressed was acknowledged to be received by him.
so,every presumption in this case shows that beitel knew of the complaint,knew of the summons,and knew of the trial date,and that he simply failed to react in time and did not file the pleadings or make an appearance at the trial until after the trial was held on june,which resulted in the judgment against him that i refuse to set aside.emphasis added.
beitel timely appealed the bankruptcy court denial of the motion to vacate to the district court where,for the first time,he challenged the bankruptcy court exercise of core jurisdiction.the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court,holding that it had acted within its statutory authority in entering the default judgment.the district court held that,even though this adversary proceeding was,beitel had impliedly consented to the bankruptcy court entry of final judgment by failing to object to its assumption of core jurisdiction.the district court then reviewed the bankruptcy court denial of the motion to vacate for abuse of discretion,concluding that there was no reason to disturb the bankruptcy court finding that beitel received service of oca complaint and notice of the trial schedule for his adversary proceeding and elected not to respond.describing beitel inaction prior to the trial date as emblematic of the very behavior that the fifth circuit has found to constitute willful default,the district court concluded that the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to vacate.this timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
standards of review 
this court reviews the decision of a district court,sitting as an appellate court,by applying the same standards of review to the bankruptcy court findings of fact and conclusions of law as applied by the district court.we thus generally review factual findings for clear error and conclusions of law de novo 
jurisdiction is a question of law which we review de novo we review a determination that a default should not be set aside for abuse of discretion.because of the seriousness of a default judgment,even a slight abuse of discretion may justify reversal.if a district court findings rest on an erroneous view of the law,they may be set aside on that basis.although we review a decision to set aside a default judgment for abuse of discretion,whether a defendant failure to answer was willful is a factual determination that we review for clear error 
bankruptcy court adjudicative authority 
as a threshold matter,we consider beitel that he made for the first time on appeal to the district the bankruptcy court was without power to enter the default judgment against him.we must determine,in a inquiry,whether the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction,and,if we find that it did,the extent of that court judicial power.bankruptcy courts have jurisdiction over,inter alia,civil cases related to chapter bankruptcy cases a proceeding is related to the main case if the outcome of that proceeding could conceivably have any effect on the estate being administered in bankruptcy.the instant case obviously could have an affect on the bankruptcy estate because a judgment against beitel could increase the estate.the bankruptcy court thus had jurisdiction over the instant adversary proceeding.
a bankruptcy court adjudicative authority is constrained,however,if the proceeding is.bankruptcy courts have full adjudicative power over core proceedings in proceedings they are restricted to issuing proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law,which the district court may adopt or reject a list of core proceedings appears in b.in in re wood,judge wisdom distilled the formula for core proceedings thus we hold that a proceeding is core under section if it invokes the substantive right provided by title or if it is a proceeding that,by its nature,could arise only in the context of a bankruptcy case.we agree with both beitel and the district court that this proceeding is.as in in re wood,the instant claim is not based on any right created by the federal bankruptcy law,but instead is simply a state contract action that,had there been no bankruptcy,could have proceeded in state court.oca attempts to classify its adversary proceeding as specific to bankruptcy fail.
even though this is a proceeding,we nevertheless conclude that the bankruptcy court exercised its adjudicative power appropriately because beitel impliedly consented to the bankruptcy court entry of final orders and judgments.in a proceeding,the parties may consent to have a bankruptcy court enter appropriate orders and judgments.such consent may be express or implied failure to object in the bankruptcy court may constitute implied consent even if we ignore any opportunity that beitel might have had to challenge the bankruptcy court adjudicative authority prior to its entry of default judgment,his conduct was entirely inconsistent with raising such a challenge.when beitel sought to set aside the default judgment in the bankruptcy court,he never once raised the issue,and even filed an answer admitting to the complaint allegation that t his matter is a core proceeding pursuant to b.
beitel mounts a challenge regarding his implied consent.first,he contends that only the bankruptcy court,not the district court sitting as an appellate court,may determine consent,a fact issue.the case cited by beitel for this proposition,however,does not go that far,stating only that consent to jurisdiction is not lightly to be inferred and requires a clear manifestation by the adverse party.this language does not lend support to beitel contention it neither indicates that only the bankruptcy court may make determinations as to consent nor causes us to question whether beitel consented in this case.
beitel contends alternatively that his conduct is irrelevant on this point,beitel misinterprets our precedent a defendant may lose the opportunity to object after a relevant hearing,but a defendant does not possess free license not to object after a hearing this is particularly true in the context,in which a defendant may not have had an opportunity to object previously.to hold otherwise would only create needless appellate litigation by encouraging defendants like beitel to wait until appeal to object to the bankruptcy court jurisdiction.
we agree with the district court observation that beitel objection to the bankruptcy court jurisdiction at this stage of the proceeding more closely resembles an afterthought than a bona fide objection.the bankruptcy court had both jurisdiction over the instant case and authority to enter final orders and judgments.
setting aside the default judgment 
legal standard 
federal rule of civil procedure applies in adversary proceedings the former version of rule c,which applies here,states that f or good cause shown the court may set aside an entry of default and,if a judgment by default has been entered,may likewise set it aside in accordance with rule b.because the bankruptcy court entered a judgment on beitel default rule b applies.this rule allows a court to grant relief from a final judgment under any of six provisions,including mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or excusable neglect.in assessing a motion to vacate a default judgment,we have interpreted rule b as incorporating the rule standard applicable to entries of default 
in determining whether good cause exists to set aside a default judgment under rule b we examine the following factors whether the default was willful,whether setting it aside would prejudice the adversary,and whether a meritorious defense is presented.courts may also consider whether the public interest was implicated,whether there was significant financial loss to the defendant,and whether the defendant acted expeditiously to correct the default.the district court need not consider all of the above factors in ruling on a defendant b motion the imperative is that they be regarded simply as a means of identifying circumstances which warrant the finding of good cause.
this inquiry follows a recognition in our previous holdings that courts apply essentially the same standard to motions to set aside a default and a judgment by default.yet,we have also stated that the former is more readily granted than a motion to set aside a default judgment.on multiple occasions,we have declined to decide whether the standard is equivalent to the standard applied to relief from default judgment under rule b.although the recent revision to rule c may one day cause us to reassess the relationship between the rule c standard and rule b we have no occasion to do so in the instant case and instead conduct our inquiry in accordance with our recent decision in jenkens gilchrist in any event,conflation of the applicable standards in this case would be harmless because we have held that willful default,the key factor in the instant case,would certainly not constitute excusable neglect,one of the rule b factors 
of the relevant factors,two have particular significance here,the defendant default was willful or the defendant failed to present a meritorious defense sufficient to support a finding on the merits for the defaulting party.if a district court or a bankruptcy court makes either finding,we may hold that it was within its discretion in refusing to grant relief from a default judgment still,rule b is applied most liberally to judgments of default,since trial on the merits is to be favored over such a truncated proceeding.unless it appears that no injustice results from the default,relief should be granted.in light of the general disfavor of default judgments,where there are no intervening equities any doubt should,as a general proposition,be resolved in favor of the movant to the end of securing a trial upon the merits.
rulings of the bankruptcy court 
in the bankruptcy court,beitel urged that oca never effected service and his default was not willful,but was caused both by oca misrepresentations to him and by its purposeful to the bankruptcy court of key information regarding recent communications between beitel counsel and counsel for oca.
the bankruptcy court determined that beitel had submitted no evidence that would overcome the presumption of valid service.on this point,beitel had a heavy burden mail that is properly addressed,stamped and deposited into the mails is presumed to be received by the addressee.the presumption can only be overcome by clear and convincing evidence that the mailing was not,in fact,accomplished.the bankruptcy court correctly applied the standard,and beitel offers no competent evidence that causes us to question the court conclusion 
the bankruptcy court determination of willfulness,however,is problematic.just before the court issued its ruling,the following exchange occurred 
beitel counsel well,then why did not oca counsel say to me that beitel would be up second,or third up,or fourth,or why did other oca counsel tell beitel counsel that beitel would be second up or third up 
the court i do know that.that again weighing he said,she said,and that not sufficient to overcome the presumption of valid service or to show by clear and convincing evidence.if the court has to weigh two conflicting statements,that not clear and convincing evidence.
this exchange unquestionably addressed whether beitel default was willful,not whether the presumption of valid service was overcome.the bankruptcy court then immediately announced its ruling 
i convinced that beitel simply ignored the service of the complaint and the summons and that you have not has not carried the burden of overcoming the presumption of valid service and every presumption in this case shows that beitel knew of the complaint,knew of the summons,and knew of the trial date,and that he simply failed to react in time and did not file the pleadings or make an appearance at the trial until after the trial was held on june,which resulted in the judgment against him that i refuse to set aside.emphasis added.
the bankruptcy court refusal to weigh what it called he said,she said evidence and its subsequent conclusions demonstrate that the court applied the incorrect burden of and convincing create a presumption of willfulness yet,the presumption properly applies only to the component of a court inquiry.if courts were to require clear and convincing evidence to overcome a putative willfulness presumption,the instruction to apply rule b most liberally when considering whether to vacate a default judgment would be rendered meaningless instead,trial courts must apply only the standard when assessing willfulness under this less demanding burden of proof,the bankruptcy court had no choice but to inject itself into a murky he said,she said dispute before making its factual determination that beitel simply ignored the complaint and summons,that he willfully did so.such credibility determinations are often the very essence of making a finding by a preponderance of the evidence 
the bankruptcy court was required to make a factual determination regarding what contact was made between beitel and oca prior to the entry of the default judgment and what,if any,assurances oca counsel had given.if the court had determined that oca represented to beitel that no default would be taken against him and that he would be permitted to file an answer and have his case decided on the merits,then a willfulness finding would likely be clearly erroneous.if,on the other hand,the court had determined that oca never made any such representations,a finding of willfulness would likely have withstood our deferential review.but,in the absence of a factual finding by the bankruptcy court after applying the correct burden of proof,we owe the bankruptcy court conclusion no deference.
the district court sitting in an appellate capacity was in no better position than are we to affirm a willfulness finding by the bankruptcy court based on the erroneous burden of proof we can not defer to the district court conclusion that the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that beitel failure to respond was intentional because the decision was based on deference to the bankruptcy court holding,a deference that it was not due.
we thus must disregard the bankruptcy court willfulness finding,apparently the only one other than beitel failure to overcome the presumption of proof of service that the bankruptcy court made in support of its holding.this conclusion,however,does not end our inquiry.before we may reverse the bankruptcy court entry of default judgment,we must also ask whether the record could support a finding in beitel favor.
support for setting aside the default judgment 
in ruling on a rule b motion,courts are not required to state findings or conclusions therefore,in the absence of such an optional statement,a remand for specific findings is not necessary if the record would not support a finding in the appellant favor,and if such a finding would be deemed clearly erroneous had it been made.
we first address whether beitel has presented a meritorious defense,as a refusal to set aside a default judgment is proper in the absence of such a defense in determining whether a meritorious defense exists,t he underlying concern is whether there is some possibility that the outcome of the suit after a full trial will be contrary to the result achieved by the default.on careful review,we can not say that the record could not support a finding that beitel has a meritorious defense.beitel submitted an affidavit that he borrowed only from the more than that oca his office manager submitted an affidavit with similar assertions.beitel also contends that the promissory notes functioned as open lines of credit that he had not drawn down to the extent oca alleges.on the discrete facts of this case,this factual basis is sufficient in theory to support a conclusion that there is a possibility that the outcome after trial would not mirror the default judgment.
we must also determine whether the record precludes a finding in beitel favor on the issue of willfulness our discussion of willfulness confirms that this is an issue that turns largely on testimony that the bankruptcy court labeled he said,she said evidence.weighing each party statement,a function peculiarly within the trial court domain,is likely determinative on the willfulness issue.thus,we can not say that the record precludes a finding in favor of beitel on this issue.
the other relevant,but not singularly determinative,factors prejudice to oca,the effect,if any on the public interest,whether there was significant financial loss to beitel,and whether beitel acted expeditiously to correct the not so heavily weighted against beitel that they alone would support our affirming the default judgment against him at least two of these factors likely weigh in beitel favor beitel hundred thousand likely significant to him,and beitel appears to have acted expeditiously following entry of the default judgment by immediately thereafter filing an amended answer and then actively attempting to set aside that judgment.the factor may cut both ways because there is a value both in allowing trial of cases on the merits and in adhering to procedural rules.and,only one factor likely weighs in oca favor it would likely experience some harm,perhaps minimal,in having to its liability and damages.
we conclude that the record does not offer sufficient support for the district this make an independent determination that the bankruptcy court decision was within its discretion.
iii.conclusion 
we vacate both the bankruptcy court denial of beitel motion to set aside or to vacate the default judgment against him and the district court order affirming the bankruptcy court.we remand this matter to the bankruptcy court for it to the willfulness element of beitel motion under the correct burden of proof,preponderance of the evidence,with instructions that the bankruptcy court review include,at a minimum,an evidentiary hearing on the willfulness question.vacated and remanded with instructions.
