appellee jason rutz was a listed creditor in his stepfather appellant lon proceedings.rutz,a minor at the time,did not file a complaint of nondischargeability in those proceedings.as a result,the bankruptcy court issued an order discharging rutz claim and issued a permanent injunction barring rutz from collecting on the debt.after rutz attained maturity,he nonetheless filed a civil action against mcghan to collect on the discharged debt.over mcghan objections,the state court in which that action was filed ruled that rutz action could proceed because rutz had inadequate notice of the earlier bankruptcy proceedings.arguing that only the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction to resolve that question,mcghan then moved the bankruptcy court to reopen his bankruptcy case to review the state court decision.the bankruptcy court denied the motion,reasoning that mcghan desire to relitigate an issue already heard in state court was insufficient cause to reopen the case.we reverse.relying on gruntz county of los angeles in re gruntz,cir en banc,we hold that state courts lack jurisdiction to determine whether a listed and scheduled creditor received adequate notice of discharge proceedings.we also hold that the state court lacked authority to modify the bankruptcy court orders discharging rutz claim and permanently enjoining rutz from collecting on the debt.in light of those holdings,we conclude that it was an abuse of discretion for the bankruptcy court to decline to reopen mcghan bankruptcy case.the bankruptcy court was required to reopen the proceedings to protect its exclusive jurisdiction over the enforcement of its own orders.
facts and procedural background 
in,mcghan was charged with five counts of sexual molestation of rutz,his stepson.at the time the charges were filed,rutz was years old.mcghan pled guilty to one count of felony violation of california penal code a lewd and lascivious acts committed on a child under.
shortly after his conviction,mcghan filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under chapter of the bankruptcy code.when a debtor files a chapter petition,the debtor lists each of his creditors.the appointed bankruptcy trustee convenes a meeting of these creditors pursuant to a all creditors must receive at least days advance notice of the creditors meeting.rule c.within days after the date first set for that meeting,any creditor wishing to have a debt characterized as nondischargeable must file a complaint alleging nondischargeability of the debt.id.if the creditor has adequate notice of the meeting but fails to make a timely complaint,his claim is automatically discharged pursuant to c.although debts for intentional torts such as rutz claim ordinarily are not dischargeable under a of the code,which states that debts for willful and malicious injury are nondischargeable,such claims will be discharged automatically if the listed creditor fails to make a timely objection.when a debtor is discharged under the bankruptcy code,the discharge operates as a permanent injunction against any attempt to collect or recover on a debt.irizarry schmidt in re irizarry,cir accord am.hardwoods,deutsche credit in re am.hardwoods,cir.
a different provision of the code is implicated when the creditor was not listed on the bankruptcy petition.an unlisted creditor claim ordinarily is not discharged.under a of the code,however,the debt will be discharged if the creditor had notice or actual knowledge of the bankruptcy proceedings in time to permit the creditor to file a proof of claim and,if necessary,challenge its dischargeability.under a b,which applies to debts for willful and malicious injury defined by a,the debt will not be discharged if the creditor was neither listed nor scheduled and did not have notice or actual knowledge of the case in time for timely filing a proof of claim and timely request for a determination of dischargeability.federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over a nondischargeability of willful and malicious injury and c adequacy of notice to a listed creditor of the code,whereas state and federal courts have concurrent jurisdiction over a unlisted or unscheduled debt proceedings.
with respect to rutz claim,mcghan bankruptcy proceedings followed the general scheme for a listed creditor rather than an unlisted one.his petition for bankruptcy listed rutz as a creditor holding an unsecured nonpriority claim against him as rutz guardian,rutz mother received timely notice of the creditors meeting and the deadline for creditors to file a complaint objecting to discharge of the debtor or to determine dischargeability of debts,but she did not file a nondischargeability claim on her son behalf.applying c,the bankruptcy court issued a discharge order automatically discharging mcghan debt to rutz.the discharge order also stated that any judgment obtained in any court other than this court is null and void as a determination of the personal liability of the debtor with respect to any debt under a.pursuant to,the discharge order also permanently enjoined any listed creditor from instituting or continuing any action to collect such debts as personal liabilities of the debtor.the bankruptcy court closed mcghan case.
upon reaching adulthood,rutz filed a civil action against mcghan in california superior court,seeking damages arising out of his sexual molestation at the hands of mcghan.mcghan promptly moved to dismiss the action,arguing that rutz claim had been discharged by the bankruptcy court discharge order and that rutz civil suit was enjoined by the discharge injunction.at mcghan request,the state court took judicial notice of numerous documents from mcghan bankruptcy case,including mcghan bankruptcy petition,which listed rutz as a creditor,and the discharge order containing the permanent injunction,which showed that rutz claim had been automatically discharged.mcghan contended that the bankruptcy court possessed exclusive jurisdiction over the dischargeability of rutz claim and that rutz was estopped from collaterally attacking the validity of the discharge order and injunction in state court.rutz responded that neither he nor the state court should be bound by the discharge order or permanent injunction because he had not received the notice required by c as a prerequisite to automatic discharge.because notice of the proceedings had been provided only to his mother and her interests had conflicted with his own,he contended,the bankruptcy court orders did not apply to his action against mcghan the superior court agreed with rutz.first,the court reasoned that it had jurisdiction pursuant to a to determine the sufficiency of rutz notice and the applicability of the discharge order.second,the court agreed with rutz that notice had been inadequate accordingly,the court ruled that rutz was not bound by the discharge order and allowed rutz case to proceed 
mcghan then sought to collaterally attack the state court ruling in federal court.he moved to reopen his chapter bankruptcy case in the bankruptcy court,seeking leave to file a complaint against rutz for violation of the permanent discharge injunction.in denying mcghan motion,the bankruptcy court agreed that the state court had jurisdiction to adjudicate the adequacy of rutz notice under a b and reasoned that mcghan desire to relitigate an issue already properly decided by the state court did not constitute sufficient cause to reopen the bankruptcy appellate panel bap affirmed,holding that the bankruptcy court had not abused its discretion in refusing to reopen mcghan case.like the state court and the bankruptcy court,the bap assumed that the state court jurisdiction validly rested on a.the bap also affirmed on the alternative ground that the doctrine precluded the bankruptcy court from reversing or modifying the state court decision mcghan appeals.

discussion 
state court jurisdiction 
to assess whether the bankruptcy court abused its discretion by denying mcghan b motion to reopen his bankruptcy case,we first must determine whether the state court had the authority to adjudicate the adequacy of rutz notice and modify the bankruptcy court discharge order and permanent discharge injunction.relying on our en banc opinion in gruntz county of los angeles in re gruntz,cir,we conclude that the state court lacked that authority.in reaching a contrary conclusion,the state court asserted that it had jurisdiction pursuant to a,which vests state courts with concurrent jurisdiction to adjudicate the adequacy of the notice provided to creditors who were neither listed nor scheduled.because rutz was a listed and scheduled creditor,a has no application here.
gruntz involved a chapter debtor who was prosecuted by the los angeles county district attorney,convicted for misdemeanor failure to support his dependent children and sentenced to days in jail.gruntz subsequently filed an adversary proceeding against the county in bankruptcy court,asking the court to declare the state proceedings void as violative of the a automatic stay on proceedings to collect debt.reasoning that the state court judgment included a determination that the automatic stay did not enjoin the state criminal proceeding,the bankruptcy court dismissed the complaint as collaterally estopped by the state judgment.the district court,acting in its appellate capacity,affirmed the dismissal on the basis of the doctrine,which prohibits direct appellate review of state court decisions by federal courts other than the supreme court.at.
we reversed.gruntz,as well as our later decision in contractors state license bd.dunbar in re dunbar,cir,stand primarily for the proposition that federal courts are not bound by state court modifications of the automatic stay.gruntz,at.gruntz held that the doctrine does not deprive federal courts of jurisdiction over the scope and applicability of the stay.id.at.dunbar added that state court modifications of the automatic stay do not preclude federal relitigation of the scope and applicability of the stay under the doctrines of collateral estoppel and res judicata.dunbar,at 
gruntz hasbroader implications,however,that dictate the outcome here.first,gruntz holds not only that a federal court may review state court decisions modifying an automatic stay,but also that state courts lack jurisdiction in the first instance to modify the stay.id.at.because bankruptcy court orders are not subject to collateral attack in other courts,a ny state court modification of the automatic stay would constitute an unauthorized infringement upon the bankruptcy court jurisdiction to enforce the stay,and actions and judicial proceedings taken in violation of the automatic stay are void.id.at see also gonzales parks,cir congress grant to the federal courts of exclusive jurisdiction over bankruptcy petitions precludes collateral attacks on such petitions in state courts.
second,gruntz bars state court intrusions on all bankruptcy court orders or other core bankruptcy proceedings,at,not just the automatic stay.as we stated in gruntz,state courts should not intrude upon the plenary power of the federal courts in administering bankruptcy cases by attempting to modify or extinguish federal court orders such as the automatic stay.id.at emphasis added.thus,just as a state court does not have the power to modify or dissolve the automatic stay,id.at,a state court also lacks authority to modify or dissolve a discharge order or the discharge injunction see lenke tischler in re lenke,applying gruntz and holding that state courts lack jurisdiction to modify a bankruptcy court discharge order see also pavelich mccormick,barstow in re pavelich,cir congress has plenary authority over bankruptcy in a manner that entitles it to preclude state courts from doing anything in derogation of the discharge.
our extension of gruntz to modifications of the discharge order and discharge injunction flows naturally from the policy concerns that informed our decision there.our decision was animated by our concern that permitting a state court to modify the federal automatic stay would undermine the principle of a unified federal bankruptcy system,as declared in the constitution and realized through the bankruptcy code.at.if state courts were empowered to issue binding judgments modifying the federal injunction created by the automatic stay,creditors would be free to rush into friendly courthouses around the nation to garner favorable relief.id.at.the same concerns arise when california courts purport to modify a discharge order and to grant relief from the bankruptcy court permanent injunction.
accordingly,we conclude that the state court lacked authority to adjudicate the adequacy of the notice received by rutz.by reaching that issue,the state court held that rutz was bound by neither the discharge order nor the discharge injunction,documents that on their face plainly barred rutz action.the state court effectively modified both orders,and in so doing impermissibly infringed upon the bankruptcy court jurisdiction to enforce its orders.see gruntz,at.
in so deciding,we do not hold that a state court is divested of all jurisdiction to construe or determine the applicability of a discharge order when discharge in bankruptcy is raised as a defense to a state cause of action filed in state court by a listed creditor.see pavelich,at holding that state courts have the power to construe the discharge and determine whether a particular debt is or is not within the discharge because discharge in bankruptcy is a recognized defense under state law it plainly was in the power of the state court to take judicial notice of mcghan proceedings.in this case,those documents showed that rutz was a listed creditor,that rutz claim was discharged and that rutz was enjoined from taking any action to collect on the debt.the state court should have given effect to the bankruptcy court orders.by going further,the state court exceeded its jurisdiction,even if the state court believed that rutz had valid grounds to object to the orders.as we noted in gruntz,persons subject to an injunctive order issued by a court with jurisdiction are expected to obey that decree until it is modified or reversed by the issuing court,even if they have proper grounds to object to the order.at quoting celotex edwards,d.
nor do we suggest that a listed creditor such as rutz is without means to attack a discharge order on grounds of inadequate notice or to repel attempts to enforce the order against him if notice was insufficient.rather,we hold that only the bankruptcy court could grant such relief.rutz had several options,such as addressing the validity of the discharge order before proceeding in state court by petitioning the court to reopen the mcghan proceedings or by petitioning the bankruptcy court for leave to file an untimely complaint of nondischargeability.if rutz was unaware of the existence of the bankruptcy order until after he filed his state action,he could have sought to stay the lawsuit and petitioned the bankruptcy court for relief before proceeding in state court.
in concluding that it possessed jurisdiction to adjudicate the adequacy of rutz notice and to modify the discharge order and injunction,the state court erroneously relied on a.state and federal courts have concurrent jurisdiction over actions brought under a,which allows debtors to extend the coverage of the discharge order to creditors who were not listed but who had actual notice of the bankruptcy proceedings.see menk lapaglia in re menk,cir.by its plain language,however,that subsection applies only to creditors neither listed nor scheduled during the initial bankruptcy proceedings.see,malandra,at holding that a listed creditor contending that he did not receive notice of the case until after the discharge had issued did not raise a a claim because not being listed is a prerequisite to raising an issue under that subsection.rutz offers no authority to the contrary.there is no dispute
