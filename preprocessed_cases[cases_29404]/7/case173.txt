in this case of first impression at the federal appellate level,we must address the effect of default and consequent relief from the automatic stay on the bifurcated lien of a secured creditor.the creditor claims that,in such circumstances,relief from the automatic stay nullifies the earlier order,mends the bifurcation,and restores the lien on the collateral to its original shape.both the bankruptcy court and the district court rebuffed this claim.we too reject it relief from the automatic stay,in and of itself,works no such alchemy.
background 
the relevant facts are undisputed.in,the debtors,maria celina carvalho and francisco andrade,borrowed from federal national mortgage association fnma.they signed a promissory note in that amount and secured it by granting fnma a first mortgage on a residence in dorchester,massachusetts the property.
approximately five years later,the debtors filed a voluntary petition under chapter of the bankruptcy code.see allowing individual debtors to reorganize their debts.fnma filed a proof of claim,presumably including arrearages,accrued interest,late charges,and the like,in the amount of.several other creditors also filed claims.
alleging that the value of the property was less than the amount owed to fnma,the debtors asked the court to bifurcate fnma claim into secured and unsecured portions.see a stating that the allowed claim of a creditor secured by a lien on property,is a secured claim to the extent of the value of such creditor interest and is an unsecured claim to the extent that the value of such interest is less than the amount of such allowed claim see also id.a making general provisions under chapter of the bankruptcy code applicable to bankruptcy cases under,inter alia,chapter.after some skirmishing,not relevant here,the parties stipulated to the applicability of this protocol.they then agreed to divide the debt into a secured claim of representing the agreed value of the property and an unsecured claim for roughly representing the balance of the indebtedness owed to fnma.
in due course,the bankruptcy court confirmed a chapter plan the plan that embodied the bifurcation.under the terms of the plan,the debtors were to make regular payments to a trustee,who would then disburse funds to the various creditors including fnma according to a set schedule.under this scenario,fnma was to receive fixed monthly payments on the secured portion of its bifurcated claim until that item was paid in full but was to receive only an aggregate dividend on the unsecured portion.see id.b allowing bankruptcy courts to approve chapter plans modifying the rights of most secured creditors see also lomas,louis,cir interpreting sections a and b of the bankruptcy code to allow bifurcation of a secured creditor claim in a chapter proceeding.the plan also incorporated an agreement to the effect that the debtors would continue to pay fnma directly to fund an escrow account for taxes and insurance on the property.
at some exact date is of no debtors began struggling to meet their obligations under the plan.when they failed to make the obligatory escrow payments,fnma sought relief from the automatic stay in order to exercise its right of foreclosure against the property.see a d staying proceedings against a debtor or her estate but allowing a court to lift or modify the stay for cause.fnma motion acknowledged the bifurcation of its claim and prayed generally for relief from the stay.it did not,however,specify the amount of the debt that it envisioned as secured.
the debtors were not represented by counsel at this point in time and interposed no objection.accordingly,the bankruptcy court granted fnma motion.the court order did not specify the amount of the secured claim,nor did it mention let alone revoke the earlier bifurcation.
notwithstanding the lifting of the automatic stay,the debtors continued,albeit with an occasional misstep,to make payments to the trustee as called for by the plan when the debtors finally obtained counsel,they moved to vacate the order granting relief from the automatic stay.the bankruptcy court denied this motion on november.for reasons that are not readily apparent from the record,fnma nonetheless refrained from moving forward with a foreclosure proceeding.
near the end of the following year,the debtors moved to discharge fnma mortgage.by then,they had completed payment of fnma secured and unsecured claims as called for by the plan and had offered to pay the arrearages incurred with respect to the escrow account.although fnma had not yet foreclosed on the property,it steadfastly refused to accept payments from either the trustee or the debtors after the date of default.
consistent with this position,fnma objected to the proposed discharge.the main thrust of its objection was that the debtors had not in fact fully paid or offered to pay their debt because their payments had tracked the plan instead of the terms of the seminal promissory note.in fnma view,the latter,rather than the former,limned the extent of the debtors actual obligation because the bankruptcy court order lifting the automatic stay had,in effect,nullified the earlier bifurcation and reinstated the debt to its original shape.on this basis,fnma asserted that the debtors could obtain a discharge of the mortgage only by paying the full contractual amount owed on the original indebtedness,dollar for dollar.
the debtors vehemently disagreed with this logic,and the bankruptcy court rejected it.the court concluded that lifting the automatic stay lacked the talismanic significance envisioned by fnma.it held,moreover,that the confirmation of the plan had a res judicata effect,thus limiting fnma entitlement to the amounts provided for in the plan.accordingly,the court enjoined any foreclosure pending an assessment of the debtors ability to cure the earlier default.
on fnma appeal,the district court affirmed the injunction albeit on a somewhat different rationale.this appeal followed.see a d.
as the parties have framed the case,the central issue is not whether the debtors have a right to attempt to cure their default,but,rather,how much they must pay in order to do so.in making this determination,the court of appeals normally looks to the bankruptcy court decision,scrutinizes that court findings of fact for clear error,and affords de novo review to its conclusions of law.see jamo katahdin fed.credit union in re jamo,cir.under this paradigm,we owe no particular deference to the conclusions of the intermediate appellate tribunal be it a district court or a bankruptcy appellate panel.brandt repco printers lithographics,in re healthco int l,cir.where,as here,the core dispute is over a question of law,engendering de novo review,jamo,at,we are not wedded to the bankruptcy court rationale,but,rather,may affirm its decision on any independently sufficient ground made manifest by the record.t i fed.credit union delbonis,cir resolution trust best prods.in re best prods,cir.
before plunging into our analysis,we deem it important to note what fnma does not contest.in mounting this appeal,it challenges neither the validity of the plan nor the bifurcation of its claim within the plan as originally formulated.this bears out our intuition that both the plan and the bifurcation were properly drafted and implemented under existing law.see,lomas,at sapos provident inst.of,cir turning to the contentions that fnma does advance,its principal thesis is that relief from the automatic stay,in and of itself,unlocked the shackles of the plan once the bankruptcy court lifted the stay,this thesis runs,the plan no longer bound it in any way and,therefore,the concessions embodied in the plan went up in smoke.
the debtors initial response is that the fact of confirmation has a res judicata effect sufficient to trump fnma thesis.this counterattack has a certain superficial appeal.broadly stated,the doctrine of res judicata operates to bar the relitigation of issues that were or could have been raised in an earlier action between the same parties prescinding from the same set of operative facts.see allen mccurry,d kale combined ins,cir.the doctrine is not foreign to bankruptcy
