appellants michael ackerman and floyd kuriloff appeal the district court orders affirming the bankruptcy court denial of three motions motion to compel arbitration and to stay adversary motion to compel arbitration motion for relief from the automatic stay under motion for relief from automatic stay and motion to vacate order re automatic stay motion to vacate.this appeal turns on the tension between the federal arbitration act,et faa,and the united states bankruptcy code,et bankruptcy code,and more specifically,a bankruptcy court jurisdiction to determine dischargeability pursuant to a,and.
we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying ackerman and kuriloff motion to compel arbitration because granting the motion would have conflict ed with the underlying purposes of the bankruptcy code.cont l ins.thorpe insulation in re thorpe insulation,cir see also united states lines,am.owners mut.prot.indem.ass n,in re united states lines,cir where the bankruptcy court has properly considered the conflicting policies in accordance with law,we acknowledge its exercise of discretion and show due deference to its determination that arbitration will seriously jeopardize a particular core bankruptcy proceeding.
we need not address the district court decision affirming the bankruptcy judge denial of ackerman and kuriloff motion for relief from the automatic stay or the motion to vacate because the stay had already dissolved before the bankruptcy judge ruled on these motions.the stay dissolved when the bankruptcy judge issued a discharge under,replacing the stay with an injunction under.aldrich imbrogno in re aldrich.therefore,the result of this case would be unaffected regardless of whether we affirmed or reversed these motions.

iv.analysis 
ackerman and kuriloff attempt to parse the underlying dispute between the parties into three separate and distinct claims liability,damages,and if liability is found,dischargeability.they argue that liability and damages are matters based on new york law and that dischargeability is a core matter based upon the bankruptcy code.ackerman and kuriloff argue that where there are both and core claims involved,the right to arbitration can not be denied unless the party opposing the motion to compel arbitration shows,and the bankruptcy court makes a finding that,enforcing the parties arbitration agreement would inherently conflict with the bankruptcy code or necessarily jeopardize its objectives.appellants further contend that no such finding was made by the bankruptcy court.rather,the bankruptcy court decision to deny their motion to compel arbitration was based upon its view that it could be barred from deciding issues related to dischargeability as a result of collateral estoppel if an arbitrator made certain findings.
eber retorts that ackerman and kuriloff admitted in their complaint that the claims they assert against eber constitute core proceedings pursuant to b i,despite now arguing that liability and damages should be treated as claims.eber also points out that the bankruptcy court made factual findings that,by seeking to compel arbitration,ackerman and kuriloff were attempting to have an arbitrator determine the dischargeability of their a,and claims.
the bankruptcy court denied ackerman and kuriloff motion to compel arbitration,finding unpersuasive their argument that they were simply seeking to enforce their contractual right to arbitrate liability and damages,and intended to leave the determination of dischargeability for the bankruptcy court to decide.the bankruptcy court explained 
greenberg we are not asking the arbitrator to decide dischargeability.we have never asked that.
the court oh,i know you say that.but i respectfully disagree.
greenberg okay.
the court that really what you you asking.what you are asking is for that arbitrator to decide things which then would be collateral estoppel.of course,that what you doing 
greenberg well 
the court because there no other reason let not kid each other.of course,that what you doing.
greenberg okay.
the court so if in fact they make the required findings,then for all practical purposes,the arbitrator is deciding it,even though technically not.
the district court noted that implicit in the bankruptcy court ruling was the recognition that establishing liability on causes of action based on fraud pursuant to a,breach of fiduciary duty pursuant to a,and intentional acts based on a,is tantamount to establishing.this district court held that the bankruptcy court made a factual determination that the claims ackerman and kuriloff sought to arbitrate go to the issue of dischargeability,and that arbitration of dischargeability inherently conflicts with the goals of centralized resolution of bankruptcy issue
