this is an insurance coverage dispute arising in the context of bankruptcy.it turns on the insured versus insured exclusion.we also resolve an associated attorneys fees dispute.
the district court dismissed the case for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted,under rule b.the complaint was supplemented by attachment of the insurance policies at issue to the defendants motions the complaint and the insurance policies control the outcome.visitalk,an arizona corporation,purchased directors and officers liability insurance from reliance insurance company and twin city fire insurance company a corporation frequently agrees to protect and indemnify its directors and officers against claims made against them,such as in shareholders derivative suits,on account of their work for the company.the policies in this case named,and its directors and officers as insureds,and promised to pay losses that visitalk and the directors and officers became liable to pay as a result of covered claims 
insuring agreements 
this policy affords the following coverages 
a directors and officers liability 
except for loss which the insurer pays pursuant to insuring agreement b of this policy,the insurer will pay on behalf of the directors and officers loss which the directors and officers shall become legally obligated to pay as a result of a claim first made during the policy period or the discovery period,if applicable,against the directors and officers for a wrongful act which takes place during or prior to the policy period 
b company reimbursement 
the insurer will pay on behalf of the company loss for which the company has,to the extent permitted or required by law,indemnified the directors and officers,and which the directors and officers have become legally obligated to pay as a result of a claim first made during the policy period or discovery period,if applicable,against the directors and officers for a wrongful act which takes place during or prior to the policy period 
the policies excluded from this coverage various claims,such as personal injury,defamation,and,central to this case,claims brought by visitalk itself against its own officers or directors.there is an exception to this exclusion for stockholder derivative actions and claims by former officers and directors for wrongful termination,discrimination or sexual harassment 
exclusions 
the insurer shall not be liable to make any payment for loss in connection with any claim made against the directors and officers 
d brought or maintained by or on behalf of an insured in any capacity or by an security holder of the company except 
a claim,including,but not limited to,a security holder class or derivative action that is instigated and continued totally independent of,and totally without the solicitation of,or assistance of,or active participation of,or intervention of an insured 
an employment practice claim by a former director or a present or former officer 
a claim for contribution or indemnity if the claim directly results from another claim that is otherwise covered under this policy or 
a claim by any employee s of the company described in iv.d of the policy.
this case turns on the exclusion from coverage quoted above,commonly called the insured versus insured exclusion.basically,if visitalk sues its directors or officers itself,they have no liability coverage.some covered claims,such as shareholders derivative actions,are excepted from the exclusion,even though they are at least in theory on behalf of the corporation.but the exception to the exclusion only applies if the claims are instigated and continued totally independent of the corporation.
the exclusion was put at issue when,after two years in business,visitalk filed a chapter bankruptcy petition.visitalk,as debtor and debtor in possession,sued some of its recently discharged officers and directors for breaches of their fiduciary duties.the attorney representing visitalk as debtor in possession told the insurers that officers and directors of visitalk had looted the company.he asserted that they had charged grossly excessive amounts as expenses for inappropriate things,such as personal expenses,strippers,lavish trips,and gifts of no value to the company,and failed to institute appropriate financial controls to prevent this sort of thing.he claimed that the directors and officers purchased unnecessary software and usurped corporate opportunities.he also claimed that the directors had paid one officer more than a million dollars to cover up the inappropriate issuance of warrants to other officers to purchase visitalk common stock.the insurers declined to cover the claims.
this case arises out of a variation on what insurance litigators often call the confession of judgment,assignment of rights,covenant not to execute technique.sometimes when a liability insurer denies coverage and declines to defend,the injured party sues the insured tortfeasor,and they agree on a confession of judgment,assignment of rights,and covenant not to execute.that way the insured party obtains protection from having to pay anything,and the injured party steps into the insured shoes in order to sue the liability insurer.the injured party may be able to get more than the policy limits from the insurer,if he prevails on coverage,because damages for bad faith denial of coverage and punitive damages are in the nature of tort damages,not limited by the insurance contract.
visitalk filed a chapter reorganization plan which assigned its claims against the directors and officers to a trust established for its creditors the visitalk creditors trust and named biltmore as trustee.biltmore and four directors and officers against whom visitalk had asserted claims then agreed to settle visitalk claims for about million.the four directors and officers assigned to the creditors trust their rights against the liability insurers.the complaint does not say whether the confession of judgment and assignment of rights was coupled with the typical covenant not to execute against the settling directors and officers personally.but the existence of such a covenant does not matter here.basically,visitalk sued its directors and officers for breach of their fiduciary duties,the directors and officers liability insurers refused coverage under the insured versus insured exclusion,visitalk assigned the claims to its creditors trust,and biltmore,as trustee,then settled with four directors and officers for a confession of judgment of million and an assignment of whatever claims the directors and officers had against the insurers.
biltmore,as trustee for the creditors committee,then sued the insurance companies on the basis of these claims the district court dismissed the case because the complaint failed to set forth sufficient facts to show that the named defendant,twin city,had obligated itself as successor to reliance to cover the reliance policy period,and failed to allege sufficient facts to show that the underlying claims were made within the twin city policy period.the district court also relied in part on a local rule governing motions practice.the district court awarded attorneys fees to the insurers and against biltmore personally,under arizona statute adopting the english rule for contract cases biltmore timely appeals both decisions 
we affirm the dismissal of the complaint,but on different grounds also urged in district court and fully briefed here,that the insured versus insured exclusion applies.we do not decide whether the district court grounds for dismissal were correct.we remand the award of attorneys fees to clarify that biltmore is not personally liable,because it was acting as representative of the trust and was not personally at fault.
ii.the insured versus insured exclusion.
in appeal number,biltmore appeals the dismissal of its complaint for failure to state a claim.we review the b dismissal de novo we can affirm on any ground supported by the record we conclude that insured versus insured exclusion in the relevant policies bars coverage for biltmore claims,because a debtor in possession acts in the same capacity as the debtor for the purpose of directors and officers liability insurance.there are two issues what the insured versus insured exclusion means,and how bankruptcy law affects its application.
a.the meaning of the exclusion.
as shareholder derivative suits and class actions against directors and officers became more common,people began to demand that companies indemnify them against the risks of liability if they were to serve as directors and officers.corporations accordingly bought liability insurance for their directors and officers to induce qualified people to serve insured versus insured exclusions are boilerplate in these and other kinds of liability policies directors and officers liability policies are colloquially called d o insurance.the exclusion arose in d o policies as a reaction to several lawsuits in the in which insured corporations sued their own directors to recoup operational losses caused by improvident or unauthorized actions such lawsuits created problems of moral hazard,collusion,and unintended expansion of coverage.the reasonable expectations of the parties were that they were protecting against claims by outsiders,not intracompany claims.
the exclusion at issue in this case provides t he insurer shall not be liable to make any payment for loss in connection with any claim made against the directors and officers brought or maintained by or on behalf of an insured in any capacity.this is not the gobbledygook it sounds like to the uninitiated on an overly rapid reading.insurance against shareholders derivative suits and employment claims is essentially liability insurance.the trigger for liability insurance is a claim by someone not under the control of the insured himself.by contrast,people buy casualty insurance against the risks created by their own bad luck or carelessness.thus,one buys fire insurance and gets indemnified even for carelessly leaving a lit candle untended and burning down one own house.and one buys automobile comprehensive and collision coverage to get indemnified for carelessly damaging one own car.
though there is overlap,many of the risks that affect the price of liability insurance differ from the risks that affect casualty insurance,particularly moral hazard and collusion.for example,almost nobody intentionally induces someone else to collide with his car,but someone might have an interest in burning down his own house if he owed more on it than it was worth.companies have traditionally purchased fidelity bonds to insure the company against employees dishonesty thus if an employee was bonded and stole from the company,the insurance company that had issued the bond would have to indemnify the company for the loss.
because risks such as collusion and moral hazard are much greater for claims by one insured against another insured on the same policy than for claims by strangers,liability policies typically exclude them from coverage.allowing such claims would turn liability insurance into casualty insurance,because the company would be able to collect from the insurance company for its own mistakes,since it acts through its directors and officers.the exclusion protects of course against collusion,and also against the risk of selling liability insurance for what amounts to a fidelity bond.if the exclusion were ignored,then those companies who only want to pay for protection against third party claims they can not control would have to bear the additional financial burden of paying for claims over which companies have more control.
biltmore does not and could not argue that the exceptions to the insured versus insured exclusion apply.the claim is not by a fired director for wrongful termination or one of the other excepted employment practice claims,and the claim is not brought by a security holder,as the exception to the exclusion for shareholders derivative actions requires.the only question before us on the language of the exclusion is whether the underlying suit was brought or maintained on behalf of an insured in any capacity.
appellant argues that this claim is on behalf of the creditors and brought by the creditors trustee,biltmore,so it is not brought or maintained on behalf of an insured in any capacity.we conclude that this argument is mistaken.first,the underlying lawsuit,for which coverage is sought,alleged that the directors and officers of visitalk breached their statutory and fiduciary duties.a cause of action for mismanagement belongs to the corporation shareholders and creditors can bring a suit for mismanagement only derivatively,on behalf of the corporation.true,the directors and officers have coverage for derivative claims,but not for claims by visitalk.coverage is excluded if visitalk sues them,and it did.the lawsuit was instigated and continued by visitalk.that the creditors rather than the shareholders will get whatever money the insurer pays does not avoid the exclusion.creditors get much,most,or even all of the money any business collects,as part of the business overhead,which is why a landlord is always happy to see diners in his tenant restaurant.
second,the claim has to be made by an insured party for it to have any contractual basis in the insurance policies.the named insured and others insured are defined in all the policies here to be visitalk,and its directors and officers,and no one else.none of the insurance companies issued any policies to biltmore,or to visitalk creditors.sometimes a promisee buys insurance to protect against a potential debtor risk,as when a concert promoter buys life insurance on a star,but visitalk creditors bought no insurance on visitalk and its principals.the creditors have no independent contractual claim against the insurance companies,because they are not insureds.
third,the claim for which coverage is sought was indeed instigated and continued by visitalk,as a chapter debtor and debtor in possession.the first amended complaint says in paragraphs and that visitalk filed a complaint in the underlying case against the four directors and officers,and then assigned its claims to the creditors trust with biltmore as trustee.biltmore sued the insurers as assignee of the directors and officers claims for failure to cover and its bad faith in so doing.an assignee of a claim against an insurance company can have no stronger claim than the assignor who assigned the claim biltmore has to step into an insured shoes as assignee to have any claim against their insurers,since biltmore is not an insured.and in those shoes,it is barred by the exclusion.biltmore can not jump into the insureds shoes to bring the lawsuit,out of their shoes to claim not to be suing as though it were the insureds,and then back into their shoes to get compensatory and punitive damages for the insurers failure to cover their liabilities.
bankruptcy.
the additional feature of this case is bankruptcy.biltmore argues that visitalk,the chapter debtor in possession that brought the underlying suit,is not the same entity as visitalk,the insured corporation.several bankruptcy decisions around the country,including one in this circuit,treat a postbankruptcy entity as different from the debtor before it went into chapter for purposes of the insured versus insured exclusion several others hold that they are the same entity for this purpose few cases,and no circuit court decisions,deal with the specific situation of a chapter debtor in possession 
we conclude that for purposes of the insured versus insured exclusion,the prefiling company and the company as debtor in possession in chapter are the same entity.the bankruptcy code defines a chapter debtor in possession as the debtor the debtor,in turn,is defined as the person or municipality concerning which a case under this title has been commenced.bankruptcy cases can be filed only with respect to persons thus the debtor in possession is the debtor,and the debtor is the person,visitalk,that filed for bankruptcy.applying these statutory provisions literally,visitalk,the debtor in possession,is the same person for bankruptcy purposes as visitalk,the corporation.there is no good reason to interpret the language other than literally in this context.
in nlrb bildisco bildisco,the supreme court reached the same conclusion in the labor law context,stating it is sensible to view the as the same entity which existed before the filing of the bankruptcy petition.while the court divided on other points,it unanimously agreed that the new entity theory should be rejected biltmore argues that bildisco did not treat the as the same entity as the debtor,because it permitted the to reject a labor agreement which the debtor could not.that argument confuses the right of a bankrupt to reject an executory contract with the question of whether it is the promisor under the contract.bildisco explains that o bviously,if the were a wholly new entity,it would be unnecessary for the bankruptcy code to allow it to reject executory contracts,since it would not be bound by such contracts in the first place.the converse applies to the case at bar.two subsequent,similarly unanimous opinions of the court treat a bankrupt entity as the same as the entity 
our own authorities speak variously in different contexts to whether a chapter debtor in possession should be treated as a different entity for various purposes.biltmore points to two cases in which we stated that the debtor and are legally distinct entities,hillis motors,hawaii automobile dealers ass and bonner mall partnership bancorp mortgage in re bonner mall partnership hillis motors does not involve a debtor in possession or insurance.it concerns application of the automatic stay provision to the involuntary dissolution of a corporation by a governmental entity bonner mall addresses application of the new value doctrine to priorities between a bank and providers of new capital in a reorganization of a debtor in possession under chapter neither speaks to insurers obligations or the effect of the insured versus insured exclusion in debtor in possession in chapter bankruptcies.nor do they speak to the insuperable problem appellant has in this case,that if biltmore stands in visitalk shoes,it has no coverage because of the insured versus insured exclusion.
the more appropriate precedents are disalvo disalvo in re disalvo and teerlink lambert in re teerlink ranch though they too involve different factual circumstances.in disalvo disalvo,a debtor personally owed money to a creditor,but as debtor in possession sued the creditor for abuse of process and other torts the debtor purpose was to dump his debt into the pot for unsecured creditors,but recover outside the bankruptcy for a debt flowing the other way,to himself.we held that in the chapter context a debtor and debtor in possession are not to be treated as separate legal entities,applying the supreme court analysis in bildisco,though we recognized that bildisco was a labor law case and disalvo was not 
similarly,in teerlink lambert,we treated the debtor in possession as still the same old debtor satisfying the same old debt.this quotation was the holding of teerlink,rejecting the debtor in possession argument that it was no longer a debtor paying its own debt,but a hypothetical judicial lien creditor paying a stranger debt.that argument resembles biltmore,that for purposes of the insured versus insured exclusion,visitalk as debtor in possession is a different entity than it was before bankruptcy.as in bildisco,disalvo,and teerlink,visitalk in chapter and out of it are not to be treated as separate entities for purposes of what its directors and officers owe visitalk.
it is certainly true that the interests differ once a debtor goes into bankruptcy.prior to visitalk bankruptcy,the underlying lawsuit belonged to visitalk as a corporation.once it filed its voluntary bankruptcy petition,ownership of the cause of action fell into the bankruptcy estate visitalk became the debtor in possession of the bankruptcy estate,empowered to act as a trustee and required to act as a fiduciary for its creditors and shareholders the differences in the fiduciary responsibilities of visitalk management on account of bankruptcy,however,do not make visitalk a different entity for purposes of the insured versus insured exclusion 
biltmore argues that visitalk,as debtor in possession,brought the underlying suit as representative of the creditors of the bankruptcy estate,so the insured versus insured exclusion does not apply.this argument presupposes that a suit brought as representative of the creditors is brought on their behalf,conflating for the benefit of and on behalf of.just because the creditors could have asserted fiduciary duty claims outside the bankruptcy context similar to those pressed by the trustee,does not prove that the trustee is asserting creditors claims rather,it is simply because state law often permits creditors to pursue derivative claims on an insolvent corporation behalf.even if visitalk,as debtor in possession,is acting in the capacity of representative for the creditors,it is advancing their interests by bringing suit on behalf of the corporation.the suit is for the benefit of the creditors,but on behalf of the corporation.
it may be we do not know that every penny recoverable from the liability insurers would go to the creditors of visitalk and its principals.but that might happen even if there were no bankruptcy,and a debtor owed creditors every penny it could recover.in a sense,when any business obtains revenue,its success is on behalf of its employees and suppliers as well as or more than its owners,but that does not avoid the insured versus insured exclusion.the liability insurance that the corporation and its principals bought to protect against shareholders derivative suits can not be turned into an available pot for the corporation creditors by enforcing the insurers obligations while disregarding the parties agreement to limit those obligations to exclude insured versus insured claims.
biltmore argues that this analysis creates windfall for the insurance companies,because creditors would have a covered claim before the bankruptcy against the principals of an insolvent corporation,but not after.that is not quite right,because before bankruptcy,the creditor would first have to demand that the insolvent corporation bring the claim and if the corporation did,then the insured versus insured exclusion would still bar recovery.bankruptcy does not erect the bar to recovery,the insurance policy does.all bankruptcy did to the creditors was impose the automatic stay and require them to advance their claims within the bankruptcy proceeding it did not change the insurance policies.
we therefore affirm the dismissal of the complaint.the alternative position would create a perverse incentive for the principals of a failing business to bet the dwindling treasury on a lawsuit against themselves and a coverage action against their insurers,bailing the company out with the money from the d o policy if they win and giving themselves covenants not to execute if they lose.that is among the kinds of moral hazard that the insured versus insured exclusion is intended to avoid.
iii.attorneys fees.
in appeal number,biltmore contests the attorneys fees award in favor of the insurers.the fees were awarded under the arizona fee shifting statute for contract cases not as a sanction biltmore does not challenge whether the fees were properly awarded at all,nor does it challenge the amount.its challenge goes to whether fees could properly be awarded against biltmore personally,rather than in its representative capacity.the judgment says that it is against biltmore associates,as trustee of the visitalk creditors trust,but the judge denied biltmore motion to bar execution against its own assets.
biltmore makes two arguments on appeal.first,relying on bankruptcy law,it contends that our decision in metcalf golden in re adbox,barred the district court from properly imposing judgment against its personal assets because it acted solely in the representative capacity of a bankruptcy trustee.second,relying on the general law of trusts,biltmore posits that because it captioned its pleading biltmore associates,as trustee of the visitalk creditors trust,and because it was acting for the creditors trust,fees should have been awarded only against the trust.we deal with each o
