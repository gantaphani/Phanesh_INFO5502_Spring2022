defendant alfredo pacheco martinez was convicted of various offenses arising from his multiyear effort to swindle scores of unsuspecting victims out of over a million dollars and to manipulate the bankruptcy code in order to shield his gains from creditors.he now appeals from one of the counts of conviction,arguing that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury guilty verdict.he also attacks his sentence,arguing that the district court improperly calculated the applicable sentencing guidelines range and imposed a procedurally and substantively unreasonable sentence.we find no merit in any of these contentions and affirm pacheco conviction and sentence.
because pacheco challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction on one count,we recite the facts relevant to that claim in the light most favorable to the jury verdict.see united states burgos montes,wl,at cir.may.in discussing facts relevant to pacheco claims of sentencing error,we rely in part on unchallenged portions of the presentence investigation report psr.see united states v√°zquez larrauri,cir.we confine our discussion here to the background necessary to frame the issues raised on appeal.
in pacheco formed a limited liability company,international business group and affiliates ibganv,in nevada through a registered agent service,corporate services of america csa.csa offered a virtual headquarters program that gave entities which were not physically in nevada a legal presence in the state.pacheco was listed as the sole manager of ibganv.
also in,pacheco formed a corporation in puerto rico called international business group and affiliates which we will call simply ibga,for which he was the president and registered agent.pacheco daughter leyda was listed as the vice president of ibga,and his other daughter mayra was listed as the treasurer.ibga was not registered to make investments in puerto rico.
finally,in july,pacheco formed a third entity,liberty dollars of puerto rico,ldpr.pacheco was listed as ldpr registered agent and its only director and officer.the corporation physical address was a box in yauco,puerto rico.
pacheco used these entities to engage in two fraudulent schemes the liberty dollar program and the debt elimination program.under the first program,pacheco sold medallions with a small silver content to individuals as a substitute form of coinage.he obtained the liberty dollars from norfed,a national organization dedicated to the repeal of the federal reserve act and the internal revenue c ode.pacheco marketed the liberty dollars as protection against inflation,telling potential buyers that the liberty dollars,unlike currency,could not lose value based on the actions of the federal reserve.pacheco also marketed a variant on the liberty dollar called the boricua dollar that specifically targeted puerto rico.
the evidence at trial demonstrated that the liberty dollars and boricua dollars operated much like a pyramid scheme ibga would sell them through distribution channels,with each subsequent buyer paying a higher amount until the dollars reached a final user.pacheco told prospective buyers that they could either market the liberty dollars or use them as currency at certain businesses.the marketing materials pacheco issued in connection with the liberty dollars predicted that the annual returns for buyers would range from percent to over percent.
in,the mint notified pacheco that the introduction of liberty dollars into circulation was illegal,but he nevertheless continued to market and sell the coins.pacheco companies ultimately received from the sale of the liberty dollars and boricua dollars to the public.
under the debt elimination program,ibga marketed and sold,for a fee of,a program which purported to allow buyers to pay off their debts in a short amount of time.ibga obtained the program from a company called mortgage alternatives.between and,some people bought the debt elimination program,but their debts were not relieved.the program in fact did not work.
pacheco also sold investment contracts pursuant to which an individual would buy blocks of investments for each.pacheco represented that the money would be used to promote the marketing and sales of the debt elimination program,and guaranteed investors a minimum return of per month or percent per year for each block.
pacheco provided prospective investors with a proposal and business plan in spanish and a copy of the investment contract in english.the two documents differed in crucial ways the contract itself included a section advising that the investment was speculative and involved a substantial degree of risk of loss,while the spanish document omitted any mention of risk.
pacheco told prospective investors that he was ibganv representative in puerto rico,working under the local subsidiary ibga.he thus led the investors to believe that he was backed by a large united states corporation,when in fact no actual business programs or operations took place out of ibganv.after an individual invested with him,pacheco would for a short period of time make lulling interest payments to the investor in order to give him or her the mistaken impression that the investment was safe and would generate the promised return.but the investments were never fully or even mostly repaid.twelve individuals ultimately invested over million with pacheco and sustained losses of over.
while these fraudulent schemes were ongoing,in september,pacheco and his wife filed a joint petition for chapter bankruptcy.during the pendency of that bankruptcy proceeding,pacheco opened a bank account with the former western bank in the name of ibga and an account with wells fargo in the name of ibga,llc.the bankruptcy case was dismissed with no discharge in may on the recommendation of the trustee.
a month later,in june,pacheco and his wife once again filed for chapter bankruptcy.this case,too,was dismissed with no discharge on the recommendation of the trustee.
on october,the couple filed for bankruptcy a third time,this time under chapter.the case was assigned to a different trustee,and that trustee granted the discharge of pacheco debts.in connection with the third bankruptcy proceeding,pacheco represented untruthfully that he had no interest in any incorporated or unincorporated businesses.he failed to disclose his position or ownership interest in ibganv,ibga,or ldpr,and likewise failed to disclose the activities in which he had been engaging through those entities.
on october,the day after the third bankruptcy petition was filed,several checks were drawn from the western bank checking account pacheco had opened in the name of ibga.pacheco had his daughters use some of those funds all proceeds of pacheco fraudulent schemes to buy,in ibga name,an office condominium which pacheco had previously lost to foreclosure.
in december,while the third bankruptcy proceeding was pending,pacheco opened three more bank accounts one in the name of ibgapr,one in the name of ldpr,and one in the name of ibga gefc.various checks were drawn on these accounts referencing what the government characterizes as personal uses.
the fbi ultimately uncovered pacheco fraud after an investigation.pacheco was arrested and charged with securities fraud,mail fraud,conspiracy to conceal assets and make fraudulent transfers,concealment of assets,fraudulent transfer,uttering coins,and money laundering.a jury convicted pacheco on all counts and the district court sentenced him to a sentence of months imprisonment.the court guidelines calculation included a enhancement for abuse of a position of trust and a enhancement for sophisticated means.
pacheco first challenges the district court denial of his rule motion for judgment of acquittal on count of the indictment,which charged him with making a fraudulent transfer in violation of.we review the denial of a rule motion de novo,examining the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict,and asking whether a rational jury could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.burgos montes,wl,at citations omitted.
the statute of conviction,makes it illegal for any person to 
in a personal capacity or as an agent or officer of any person or corporation,in contemplation of a case under the bankruptcy code by or against the person or any other person or corporation,or with intent to defeat the provisions of the bankruptcy code,knowingly and fraudulently transfer or conceal any of his property or the property of such other person or corporation.
count of the indictment alleges that pacheco 
in his personal capacity and as an agent of ibga,with the intent to defeat the provisions of the bankruptcy code,knowingly and fraudulently transferred and concealed property belonging to him,without authorization and unbeknownst to the bankruptcy trustee,creditors,and the united states trustee,to wit the defendant used ibga monies,approximately,to purchase an office building,condominio las torres navel,yauco,puerto rico.
pacheco argues that ibga purchase of the office condominiums could not constitute a fraudulent transfer of pacheco own property emphasis added,and so he should have been granted a judgment of acquittal on count.
pacheco conduct fits the statute like a glove.he commenced a bankruptcy proceeding,failed to disclose his interest in an entity which he owned,and then used that entity funds funds pacheco had obtained by defrauding investors to buy back a property which he had previously owned but had been foreclosed upon.in other words,pacheco,in a personal capacity or as an agent of ibga with intent to defeat the provisions of the bankruptcy code,knowingly and fraudulently transfer ed or conceal ed his property or the property of ibga.
as we read pacheco brief,he does not dispute this analysis.instead,his argument is that his conduct did not fit the language of the indictment,which charged him with transferring or concealing his own property,rather than ibga property.we reject this contention for two reasons.
first,a jury could have reasonably found that the money pacheco used to buy the foreclosed condominium was pacheco property,even though it was nominally in a bank account under ibga name.the evidence presented at trial showed that the money pacheco obtained by duping investors flowed freely among pacheco,his relatives,and the various corporations that he set up.indeed,it was precisely because pacheco put the money in the ibga account that he was able to shield it from his creditors in the bankruptcy proceeding through his failure to disclose his interest in ibga and use it to buy back the condominium as we said in united states led√©e,cir,i t is inconceivable that such a blatant scheme to manipulate an estate asset could be insulated from criminal consequences simply because the funds at issue were nominally held in ibga name rather than pacheco.id.at.
second,even if we were to assume that the money did not belong to pacheco,it would mean only that there was a variance between the crime charged in the indictment and the evidence adduced at trial.see united states yelaun,cir.but a variance warrants reversal only if it is prejudicial,by undermining the defendant right to have sufficient knowledge of the charge against him to prepare an effective defense and avoid surprise at trial,and to prevent a second prosecution for the same offense.id.alteration in original quoting united states decicco,cir.there was no prejudice here.pacheco knew exactly what he was charged with doing.the indictment could hardly have spelled it out more clearly it alleges that the defendant used ibga monies,approximately,to purchase an office building,condominio las torres navel,yauco,puerto rico.
the district court did not err in denying pacheco rule motion.
we now turn to pacheco claims of sentencing error.the district court calculated pacheco total offense level as and his criminal history category as i,yielding a guidelines range of to months in prison.the court sentenced pacheco to a sentence of months.
pacheco argues that the district court erred in its guidelines calculation in two ways in applying a enhancement for abuse of a position of trust,sentencing guidelines,and in applying a enhancement for a fraud offense involv ing sophisticated means,id.b c.he also contends that the court failed to take account of key mitigating factors in sentencing him and imposed a sentence that was procedurally and substantively unreasonable.
in considering challenges to a sentence,we review legal conclusions de novo and factual findings for clear error.united states zehrung,cir.we review a district court application of the guidelines to a particular case on a sliding scale,with the intensity increasing the more as opposed to the judge conclusion is.see also united states sicher,cir.with respect to the procedural reasonableness inquiry,we look to whether the district court properly calculated the guidelines range,treated the guidelines as advisory,considered the various a factors,and adequately explained the chosen sentence.united states morales machuca,cir.and we review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence under a highly deferential abuse of discretion standard.id.
applying these standards,we find no merit to any of pacheco arguments as to his sentence.
abuse of a position of trust enhancement 
to apply the abuse of a position of trust enhancement,the district court must first decide that the defendant occupied a position of trust and then find that he used that position to facilitate or conceal the offense.sicher,at quoting united states gill,cir.the guidelines commentary provides that a position of trust is characterized by professional or managerial discretion.id.at quoting sentencing guidelines cmt.we may also consider whether the defendant used a personal relationship with the victim in order to facilitate the fraud.see united states,cir.
pachecho contends that the district court erred in applying the abuse of trust enhancement because he did not have a special relationship with his investors.instead,pacheco argues,he merely relied on his powers of persuasion and distinguished bearing in order to induce individuals to give him their money.
pacheco has not persuaded us that the district court erred.as the government correctly notes,pacheco did have preexisting relationships with at least some of his victims one victim was a family friend who rel ied on pacheco word that the investment contract which was in english was consistent with the document pacheco gave her.pacheco represented to the victim that he was giving her an exclusive opportunity because he knew her uncle.pacheco in fact had persuaded the uncle and his wife to invest with him as well.these victims gave pacheco the authority to invest large amounts of their money,based on their friendship with him and on pacheco assurances of the returns that would accrue.
based on this evidence,the district court reasonably concluded that pacheco occupied a position of trust as to at least some of his victims and abused that trust to further his scheme.see united states willeumier,app x,cir.
sophisticated means enhancement 
the guidelines commentary describes the sophisticated means enhancement as follows 
s ophisticated means means especially complex or especially intricate offense conduct pertaining to the execution or concealment of an offense.for example,in a telemarketing scheme,locating the main office of the scheme in one jurisdiction but locating soliciting operations in another jurisdiction ordinarily indicates sophisticated means.conduct such as hiding assets or transactions,or both,through the use of fictitious entities,corporate shells,or offshore financial accounts also ordinarily indicates sophisticated means.
sentencing guidelines cmt.b.the list in the commentary of conduct that warrants the enhancement is not exhaustive.the defendant need not have done any of the things listed in order to qualify for the enhancement,so long as the offense as a whole shows a greater level of planning or concealment than a typical fraud of its kind.united states knox,cir quoting united states wayland,cir.
the district court conclusion that this enhancement applied is unassailable.pacheco set up multiple corporate entities in order to facilitate his fraudulent schemes and hide his gains from creditors during the bankruptcy proceedi
