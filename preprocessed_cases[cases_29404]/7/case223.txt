statek now challenges the bankruptcy court decisions on the ground that they do not comply with our mandate in coudert for the reasons set forth below,we remand for the district court to instruct the bankruptcy court to reverse its orders denying reconsideration,vacate its claim disallowance order,and reinstate statek claim.
background 
this dispute arises out of statek claim in bankruptcy against coudert brothers llp coudert,a new york law firm and debtor in bankruptcy.see coudert i,at.the underlying facts are set forth in detail in our prior opinion.see id.at.we briefly restate the allegations in statek complaint.
from until,statek was controlled by hans frederick johnston,who looted its treasury.in,johnston caused statek to retain coudert as counsel,and thereafter coudert helped him hide his pilfered assets.
after statek removed johnston from power,coudert failed to turn over files and other materials relating to the johnston to which statek was entitled as a former client.because of this nondisclosure,it was not until that statek finally learned of coudert role in laundering johnston assets.coudert malpractice caused statek to undergo a prolonged,global search for its assets,at a cost of million.
by complaint dated october,statek sued coudert for malpractice in connecticut state court.coudert soon went bankrupt,and its september,petition for chapter bankruptcy in the southern district of new york automatically stayed the connecticut action.see.on march,statek removed the connecticut action to the united states district court for the district of connecticut pursuant to.and on may,statek filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy court,attaching as an exhibit the original connecticut action complaint.
in bankruptcy,appellee development specialists,the plan administrator the plan administrator,moved to disallow statek claim as.on july,the bankruptcy court granted that motion the claim disallowance order drain.the bankruptcy court reasoned that new york rules applied under the erie doctrine,and new york borrowing statute requires claims to satisfy both the relevant new york statute of limitations and the limitations period of the state where the cause of action accrued.see.the bankruptcy court found that statek did not satisfy those requirements.
statek moved for reconsideration,arguing that the bankruptcy court had erroneously applied the erie doctrine by not treating the bankruptcy court as the transferee court for the connecticut action.see generally ferens john deere,holding federal courts follow rules of the transferor court.on september,the bankruptcy court denied that motion,employing the federal rule of civil procedure e standard.see j fed.directing application of rule.the bankruptcy court reasoned that the transferee court argument was never raised before and therefore was a new argument that could not be considered on reconsideration.in re coudert.llp,rdd,wl,at.moreover,the bankruptcy court held,the argument was mistaken because statek claim was filed in new york and so there was no transfer.id.at.following statek appeal,the district court affirmed hellerstein.in re coudert.llp,civ.akh,wl,at june.
in coudert i,we reversed.we first noted that we did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the claim disallowance order because it was untimely appealed.coudert i,at holding federal rule of bankruptcy procedure a appeal deadline is jurisdictional.but we vacated the denial of statek motion for reconsideration and agreed with statek transferee court reconsideration argument.we held,on this question of first impression,that for practical purposes the bankruptcy court was to be treated as the transferee court of the connecticut action.id.at.therefore,we ruled,connecticut rules applied to statek bankruptcy claim.we then instructed 
the portion of the district court order affirming the bankruptcy court denial of statek motion for reconsideration is reversed,and the case is remanded to the district court with instructions to remand in part to the bankruptcy court with instructions to apply connecticut choice of law rules in deciding statek motion to reconsider.
id.at see also id.at instructing bankruptcy court to apply the choice of law rules of connecticut to decide statek motion for reconsideration.we did not,however,specifically address the alternative holding that the transferee court argument has been raised for the first time on the motion for reconsideration.
on remand,the bankruptcy court ordered additional briefing on whether it could still adhere to that alternative holding.on august,it concluded in in re coudert.llp coudert ii,rdd,wl,at,that it could.the bankruptcy court found,as an initial matter,that connecticut rules pointed to connecticut statute of limitations.while statek malpractice claim would be barred by connecticut limitations period for tort suits coudert failed to comply with statek requests in july,and statek sued in november the bankruptcy court acknowledged that connecticut continuing course of conduct doctrine possibly provided an exception.id.at.but the bankruptcy court ultimately concluded that this doctrine do es not lead to a clear answer on the timeliness of the claim and that there is no manifest answer to whether the claim should be allowed.id.at.
instead,in coudert ii,the bankruptcy court held that its alternative basis for denying reconsideration that statek transferee court argument was a new argument continued to apply.see id.at.in so concluding,the bankruptcy court determined that relying on its prior alternative holding complied with our mandate in coudert see id.at.
after coudert ii,statek asked for reconsideration once again,requesting that the bankruptcy court reconsider coudert ii and lift the stay of the connecticut action so that statek could amend its claim to plead additional facts relevant to the continuing course of conduct doctrine.on october,the bankruptcy court denied that motion.on september,the district court affirmed both denials of reconsideration for substantially the reasons relied on by the bankruptcy court swain.see in re coudert.llp,cv lts fm.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
when reviewing a bankruptcy court decision that was appealed to a district court,we review the bankruptcy court decision independent of the district court review.coudert i,at.typically,a bankruptcy court denial of a motion to reconsider a disallowed claim is a discretionary decision.id.here,however,that discretion was cabined by the mandate in coudert puricelli republic of argentina,cir.a lower court has no discretion in carrying out the mandate.in re ivan boesky sec,cir.we therefore review de novo whether the judgment comports with the mandate.carroll blinken,cir.
on appeal,statek primarily argues that the bankruptcy court decisions on remand ran afoul of our mandate in coudert i.the mandate rule has existed since the earliest days of the judiciary.briggs.by that rule,a lower court must follow the mandate issued by an appellate court.puricelli,at.
in following a mandate,the lower court must carry out its duty to give the mandate full effect.ginett comput.task,cir citing in re sanford fork tool,see united states du pont de nemours,concluding mandate must be scrupulously and fully carried out.the lower court can not vary it,or examine it for any other purpose than execution or give any other or further relief or review it,even for
