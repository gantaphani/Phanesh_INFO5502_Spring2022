the bankruptcy code federal fraudulent conveyance provision allows a trustee to avoid any transfer of an interest of the debtor in property within a two year reach back period where the transfer was actually or constructively fraudulent.a.the question in this case is whether an arizona disclaimer qualifies as a transfer of an interest of the debtor in property.because we answer this question in the negative,the bankruptcy appellate panel refusal to avoid the disclaimer under is affirmed.
on october,edward dittlof dittlof created the edward dittlof revocable trust trust under arizona law.the trust provided that upon dittlof death,the trust property would be distributed to several of dittlof children,including rachelle costas costas.should a beneficiary die prior to distribution,the beneficiary children would take the share.
dittlof died on february,leaving costas an interest worth at least.costas,however,refused to accept it and,on november,executed a disclaimer under arizona law to relinquish her claims to the trust property.
shortly thereafter,on december,costas filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code the code.maureen gaughan,the chapter trustee trustee,sought to avoid costas disclaimer of the trust property under.although a previous bap panel decision had rejected application of to similar state law disclaimers,wood bright in re bright,cir.bap,the trustee argued that the ruling had been undermined by the supreme court decision in drye united states,d.the bankruptcy court,however,found drye distinguishable.the trustee appealed and,in a thorough opinion,the bap also distinguished drye and adhered to its prior decision in bright.gaughan costas in re costas,cir.bap.the trustee now appeals from this decision.

iii.analysis 
the federal fraudulent conveyance provision of the code provides that t he trustee may avoid any transfer of an interest of the debtor in property that was made within two years before the date of the filing of the petition where the transfer involved actual or constructive fraud.a the parties dispute whether a disclaimer executed under arizona law qualifies as a transfer of an interest of the debtor in property.
property and arizona disclaimer law 
we begin with the two relevant and disputed terms from transfer and property or,more broadly,an interest in property.the code defines transfer expansively,reaching each mode,direct or indirect,absolute or conditional,voluntary or involuntary of disposing of or parting with i property or ii an interest in property.whether a particular action constitutes a transfer is a matter of federal law.walker first security bank of idaho,in re walker,cir quoting barnhill johnson,d.however,as the definition makes clear,a transfer can not occur without property or an interest in property.see.thus,the key issue in the case is elucidating the meaning of an interest in property.see frierdich mottaz,cir although the definition of transfer is obviously federal,its references to property and interests in property require an analysis of whether a property interest was created under state law.
the code does not define property or an interest in property.rather,congress has generally left the determination of property rights in the assets of a bankrupt estate to state law,butner united states,d,meaning that i n the absence of any controlling federal law,property and interests in property are creatures of state law.barnhill,at.citations omitted.therefore,to understand the definition and scope of property,we turn to arizona law.
like other states,arizona allows beneficiaries to renounce their interests in trusts through use of a disclaimer.see.repealed a disclaimer has been defined as the refusal to accept an interest in or power over property.uniform disclaimer of property interests act.at all relevant times,arizona law required disclaimers to be filed with the court and a representative or fiduciary of the decedent not later than nine months after the effective date of the instrument.b,c testamentary and,respectively.the disclaimer itself also had to describe the property or interest disclaimed,declare the disclaimer and its extent and be signed by the disclaimant.f.where the beneficiary had previously made a n assignment,conveyance,encumbrance,pledge or transfer of the property or interest or a contract or accepted certain benefits or interests in the property,the right to disclaim was barred.j,m.the trustee concedes the validity of costas disclaimer under arizona law.costas,at.
a properly executed disclaimer carries a significant advantage for an insolvent debtor it shields the disclaimed interest from the disclaimant creditors.arizona achieved this protection through g,which provides that a disclaimer relates back for all purposes to the date of death of the decedent.this rule,a common feature in many states,is a legal fiction that retroactively eliminates any property interest that a disclaimant previously held in the disclaimed property.as the supreme court has explained,an effective disclaimer relate s back to the moment of the original transfer of the interest being disclaimed,having the effect of canceling the transfer to the disclaimant ab initio and substituting a single transfer from the original donor to the beneficiary of the disclaimer.united states irvine,d.an important consequence of treating a disclaimer as an ab initio defeasance is that the disclaimant creditors are barred from reaching the disclaimed property.id.at.
in short,arizona rule says that a disclaimant neither transfers nor possesses an interest in disclaimed property and thus creditors can not reach the disclaimed interest.
state law deference 
to summarize,section only applies to interests in property,as defined by state law,and arizona law says that costas had no property interest in the disclaimed property.the remaining question,and the problematic one,is how to translate this state law rule back into the bankruptcy context.
ordinarily,bankruptcy courts look to butner to answer this question.there,the supreme court addressed a circuit split over the ownership of rents.butner,at.some circuits followed state law in determining who received rents,whereas other circuits fashioned a federal rule of equity to allow mortgagees to receive the rents.id.ultimately,the court rejected the federal equity rule,explaining that congress has generally left the determination of property rights in the assets of a bankrupt estate to state law.id.at.thus,u nless some federal interest requires a different result,there is no reason why such interests should be analyzed differently simply because an interested party is involved in a bankruptcy proceeding.id.at.
applying the principle of butner to similar disclaimers,several appellate courts have found inapplicable.simpson penner in re simpson,cir texas law jones atchison in re atchison,cir illinois law hoecker united bank of boulder,cir concluding that colorado disclaimer rules preclude use of the fraudulent conveyance provision contained in d of the bankruptcy act see also in re bright,washington law.for example,the seventh circuit took a broad view of butner,explaining that a ll applicable state law must be construed to determine whether a debtor possesses a property interest,including the relation back rule.atchison,at.the contrary view,the court found,fail ed to give full application to the relation back doctrine under applicable state laws.id.at.based on this deferential approach to state law,the atchison court concluded that a disclaimer was not a transfer of an interest in property subject to avoidance under a.id.at.
though most courts have found that butner principles preclude avoidance of disclaimers under,this line of authority has been thrown into doubt by drye united states,d in drye,a tax debtor inherited his mother estate afte
