background 
holthaus filed a bankruptcy petition under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code in october and failed to report various assets and liabilities.the bankruptcy court denied the discharge of holthaus debts because holthaus failed to disclose his assets truthfully.on july,holthaus was indicted for knowingly and fraudulently making a false declaration or statement under penalty of perjury in his voluntary bankruptcy petition.he pled guilty on september.
at sentencing,the parties agreed holthaus concealed the following assets valued at an inheritance,gambling winnings,a tractor,a cabin in equity,accounts receivable,and a shotgun.holthaus admitted he intended to defraud creditors when he failed to list the accounts receivable and the shotgun,but denied such intent when concealing the tractor,cabin,inheritance,and gambling winnings.in response,the government argued the circumstances surrounding the concealment evidenced holthaus intent to inflict a loss upon his creditors of the full in income and assets.
the district court determined the intended loss to be based on the total value of the assets and income holthaus fraudulently concealed.the district court calculated a base offense level of under a.the court then added a increase pursuant to b d for intending a loss of more than,and a increase under b b for misrepresentation or fraud during a bankruptcy proceeding.the court also departed downward two levels for acceptance of responsibility.holthaus adjusted offense level of,together with a criminal history category of i,resulted in an advisory sentencing guidelines range of to months.
on appeal,holthaus challenges the district court finding that holthaus intended to defraud his creditors of more than,which resulted in a increase under b d.holthaus argues he did not intend to defraud his creditors of more than,which would have resulted in an advisory sentencing guidelines range of only zero to months.holthaus also appeals the district court restitution order 
ii.discussion 
intended loss for sentencing purposes 
we review de novo the district court interpretation and application of the advisory sentencing guidelines.united states rouillard,cir.we review for clear error the district court factual determinations of loss.united states levine,cir.
loss means the greater of either actual loss or intended loss,cmt.a.because the bankruptcy court refused to discharge holthaus debt,no actual loss resulted from holthaus fraud.see united states wheeldon,cir.thus,we look to the probable intended loss for purposes of holthaus sentence increase under b.see id.the government must prove the intended loss by a preponderance of the evidence.united states staples,cir.the intended loss is the pecuniary harm holthaus intended to result from his offense,and it includes harm that would have been impossible or unlikely to occur.cmt.a ii.the district court need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss based on available information.cmt.c.
holthaus argues this intended loss for sentencing purposes was combined value of the accounts receivable and the shotgun,excluding the inheritance,gambling winnings,cabin,and tractor.
in discussing our decisions in wheeldon and united states dolan,cir,the parties each mischaracterize precedent when explaining the calculation of intended loss.in dolan,the defendant committed bankruptcy fraud,concealing in assets.dolan,at.the bankruptcy petition set forth in total liabilities,in property,and in arranged settlements with creditors.id.at.this left a discharge amount of approximately.by virtue of concealing nearly million,the debtor appeared eligible for the requested discharge of approximately in reported debt,thereby intending a loss to creditors of.
indeed,dolan also represented the rare situation in which the value of the concealed assets alone equaled more than the amount to be discharged.id.under those circumstances,we concluded intended loss should be calculated by using either the value of the assets concealed or the value of the debtor liabilities,whichever is less.id.at.this conclusion follows the general rule that intended loss usually does not exceed the value of the debts sought to be discharged or otherwise avoided.see see also united states edgar,cir capping intended loss at the amount of debt when the value of the concealed property exceeds the amount of debt owed to the creditors.because the defendant fraudulent concealment in dolan potentially could have effectuated a discharge of the debtor reported remaining liabilities of,the total discharge amount established intended loss.see dolan,at.
standing in contrast to the facts of dolan,in wheeldon,the debtor filed for bankruptcy,reporting no assets while concealing approximately in assets.wheeldon,at.the concealed assets were worth much less than the debtor discharge amount of approximately.id.because the total value of the debtor concealed assets plus disclosed assets was less than the total liabilities the debtor petitioned to discharge or avoid,the debtor concealment did not affect his actual insolvency status.the debtor illegal concealment of assets could not have effectuated discharge of his entire debt,so the intended loss did not encompass the entire discharge amount.see id.at.instead,the debtor intended loss extended only to the value of the assets he hid from his creditors.id.limiting intended loss to the assets creditors would have known about if the petition had been truthful 
when determining intended loss,we look to the amount of loss a defendant actually intended to cause his creditors.see united states wells,cir acknowledging actual intent controls,and when a court determines either that the defendant intended to succeed to the full extent of the fraud,or that there was no evidence that the defendant intended to cause less than the greatest possible loss in those circumstances,the intended loss can properly be measured by the possible loss see also staples,at.there is no blanket rule defining intended loss as the lesser of the value of assets concealed or the value of the debtor liabilities.indeed,some factual scenarios may require an intended loss calculation based on the greater of the value of the assets concealed or debt sought to be discharged.see united states shevi,cir noting if the debtor concealed assets plus his disclosed assets totaled more than his debts,then asset concealment was essential to establishing insolvency,and the debtor was not entitled to bankruptcy protection at all.even if the value of the assets concealed is less than the discharge amount,when a defendant fraudulent concealment creates an illusory eligibility for bankruptcy,intended loss extends to the entire discharge amount because he intends his crime to effectuate the improper discharge of all the reported debt.
concealed assets 
holthaus argues the district court erred by including his inheritance in the loss calculation because the government failed to prove holthaus retained any of the income when he filed for bankruptcy or spent it in contemplation of bankruptcy.holthaus claims he spent this income before filing for bankruptcy and therefore could not have intended to deprive his creditors of income he knew was unavailable to them.
the district court properly rejected this argument as.see dolan,at.the record indicates holthaus forestalled the bankruptcy trustee in locating his income,and it remained unclear throughout the sentencing hearing where the income went.holthaus asserts he made certain purchases after receiving the inheritance income but before filing for bankruptcy and argues these purchases constitute circumstantial evidence he spent the incom
