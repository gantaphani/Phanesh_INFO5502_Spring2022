the question in this appeal is how the rule of single satisfaction for claims brought by a bankruptcy estate should be applied to fraudulent transfers that were at least partially satisfied in a settlement of a lump sum of million involving transfers and several other parties.see d.patricia dzikowski,as chapter trustee for the estate of prudential of florida leasing,appeals the summary judgment in favor of northern trust bank of florida and against her complaint to avoid the fraudulent transfers and recover approximately for the debtor estate.the bankruptcy court applied florida law and credited the entire amount of the settlement to the trustee claims against northern trust,and the district court affirmed.because we conclude that the federal rule of single satisfaction requires the bankruptcy court to allocate the amount of the settlement that applies to the complaint against northern trust rather than apply florida law,we reverse and remand.
background 
robert new incorporated the debtor in.the debtor was purportedly in the business of leasing office equipment but was allegedly used to perpetrate a ponzi scheme.new solicited about million from numerous investors and used the money to pay personal expenses on behalf of himself and his spouse,monica new.between september and march,in different transactions,the news instructed northern trust to move a total of from the debtor account to cover overdrafts and expenses on their personal account.new died in march.
on february,dzikowski,as the trustee of the debtor estate,sued monica new,the estate of robert new,and several other defendants to recover approximately million by avoiding approximately transfers.northern trust was not a defendant in this first action but of the transfers concerned the funds transferred from the debtor to northern trust on the news behalf.the parties settled this first lawsuit for million.the trustee agreed to waive all claims against the defendants,and the defendants admitted no liability.the bankruptcy court did not apprise northern trust of the settlement.
the settlement expressly contemplated as follows that the trustee could pursue claims for fraudulent transfer against other parties 
it is expressly understood between the parties nothing in the settlement agreement is intended to in any way prejudice or limit the trustee ability to pursue any claims available to her against other parties,and that the release and waiver provided in this paragraph shall not be construed to release or waive any such claims.
except as provided in this settlement agreement,the trustee reserves all rights to pursue claims against any parties other than the parties to the settlement,including claims for fraudulent transfer,preferential transfer,or any other claims available to the trustee under bankruptcy law and state law.
on august,the bankruptcy court approved the settlement.
on may,the trustee filed an adversary action against northern trust to recover under section of the bankruptcy code approximately from the transfers.the parties both moved for summary judgment.northern trust argued that it was not the initial transferee of the transfers but instead an intermediate transferee.northern trust also argued that any award of damages based on these transactions would be double recovery for the trustee,first from the news under the settlement agreement and then from northern trust.the trustee argued that northern trust was the initial transferee of the transfers and that the bankruptcy court should find that the claims against northern trust had been only partially satisfied by the trustee settlement with the news.
the bankruptcy court granted partial summary judgment in favor of each party.the bankruptcy court concluded that the trustee was estopped from arguing that northern trust was the initial transferee because in the first lawsuit the trustee had argued that the news were the initial transferees.the bankruptcy court also concluded that the trustee had avoided the transfers as fraudulent in the first lawsuit and had received some value on account of them.the trustee appealed the decision about judicial estoppel to the district court,but neither party challenged the ruling that the transfers had been avoided by the new litigation.
the bankruptcy court reserved judgment on whether the trustee potential damages against northern trust should be offset by the total settlement amount or whether the trustee damages against northern trust should be offset by only part of the total settlement amount.the bankruptcy court asked each party to suggest methods of allocating the previous settlement among the claims to prevent double recovery for the duplicate claims.the trustee suggested that the court either weigh the strengths of each settled claim balanced with the likelihood of recovery or allocate the settlement sum pro rata across the claims.
the bankruptcy court held that florida law prohibited a hearing to determine the amount of setoff due northern trust.because the parties to the settlement had not specified an exact amount of settlement for each claim,the bankruptcy court found that the trustee had already recovered the full amount of the fraudulent conveyances by way of the million settlement.the bankruptcy court granted final summary judgment for northern trust.the trustee appealed to the district court.
the appeal of the final summary judgment was consolidated with the previous appeal of the earlier partial summary judgment.the district court affirmed the final summary judgment and dismissed the trustee appeal from the partial summary judgment as moot.

we review de novo a grant of summary judgment.in re optical,cir.
iii.discussion 
the trustee raises interrelated challenges to the judgment of the district court and the judgment of the bankruptcy court that the district court affirmed.first,the trustee argues that the bankruptcy court erred in applying the entire sum of the settlement against her claims against northern trust.second,the trustee argues that,even if the final summary judgment was correct,the district court incorrectly dismissed as moot her appeal from the partial summary judgment.the trustee argues that,if we reverse the final summary judgment,we should also reach and reverse the partial summary judgment even though the district court did not reach this issue.we address each of these issues and the opposing arguments of northern trust in order.
a.the district court erred in granting final summary judgment to northern trust.
section d provides that t he trustee is entitled to only a single satisfaction under subsection a of this section.d.section a of the bankruptcy code vests the trustee with a right of action to recover,to the extent that a transfer is avoided under another provision of the code,the property transferred,or the value of such property from the initial transferee of such transfer or the entity for whose benefit such transfer was made or any immediate or mediate transferee of such initial transferee.a.in other words,the trustee can not obtain twice the full value of a fraudulent transfer by recovering that value from both the initial transferee and a subsequent transferee.the trustee is limited to a single recovery for each transfer.
although setoff rights are preserved by section of the bankruptcy code,the rights described in that section are different from the rule of single satisfaction in section d.section provides that this title does not affect any right of a creditor to offset a mutual debt that arose before the commencement of the case.setoff under section is an established creditor right to cancel out mutual debts against one another in full or in part to avoid the absurdity of making a pay b when b owes in re patterson,cir.we have held that substantive law,usually state law,determines the validity of the right of setoff under the bankruptcy code.id.at see also collier on bankruptcy t he bankruptcy code does not create any setoff right it merely preserves certain rights of setoff that exist under applicable law.in contrast with the preservation of a right of setoff under section,the rule of single satisfaction under section d does not preserve any right created under state law.that these two concepts are both colloquially referred to as a right of setoff has no legal significance.
florida law,which was borrowed by the bankruptcy court,provides a traditional rule of single satisfaction with an unusual variation.like the law of most states,florida law prevents a party from recovering twice for the same damages.see.stat.unlike the courts of other states,florida courts have held that the full sum of an undifferentiated settlement of multiple tort claims should be applied against a judgment involving one of those claims against a nonparty to the settlement.compare nauman eason,so d,with walihan orthopedic group,distinguishing nauman and rejecting a full setoff unless both tortfeasors were potentially liable on both claims subject to the settlement agreement.relying on florida law,the bankruptcy court held that complete setoff is required where a previous settlement does not allocate damages among different parties or claims.
although federal law governs the interpretation of a federal statute,sometimes federal law provides a uniform common law rule and other times federal law adopts state law as the federal rule of decision.see united states kimbell foods,d.the bankruptcy court determined,and the district court agreed,that federal law borrows state law in the application of section d.northern trust defends that decision.
the trustee argues that the bankruptcy court erred by interpreting section d by reference to florida law.the trustee also argues that,even if florida law does provide the rule of decision,the decisions upon which the bankruptcy court relied are wholly inapplicable.because we conclude that state law does not provide the federal rule of decision in this appeal,we need not address the alternative argument.
federal law governs the rule of single satisfaction.
the question we must consider is whether state law should be used to apply section d rather than a federal rule of common law.f ederal courts should incorporat e state law as the federal rule of decision,unless application of the particular state law in question would frustrate specific objectives of the federal programs.kamen kemper fin,d citations omitted alterations in original.the presumption in favor of state law is particularly strong in areas in which private parties have entered legal relationships with the expectation that their rights and obligations would be governed by standards.id.the bankruptcy code is often interpreted by reference to state law because the code is built on commercial relationships and the property rights arising from those relationships.see,butner united states,d property interests in re conner,cir lien priorities.there are nevertheless instances where applying the code requires a uniform rule of federal common law.see,in re columbia gas,cir bankruptcy property rights in oil and gas refunds defined by federal common law.
this appeal presents an issue in which the objectives of the federal law of bankruptcy are better served by the adoption of a rule of federal common law.the decision to adopt state law or to fashion a nationwide federal rule is a matter of judicial policy dependent upon a variety of considerations always relevant to the nature of the specific governmental interests and to the effects upon them of applying state law.kimbell foods,at.at citation and quotation marks omitted.we must consider the need for uniformity,whether application of state law frustrates important federal policies,and the impact of federal common law on preexisting commercial relationships premised on state law.see redwing carriers,saraland apartments,cir.
first,a uniform rule of federal law is preferable because the rule of single satisfaction concerns the judicial process necessary to approve settlements that terminate bankruptcy proceedings and the valuation of settled claims in collateral litigation.the element of florida law implicated in this appeal is not a party substantive right to a setoff instead,the rule against holding an allocation hearing by the trial court in order to apportion the proceeds of a private settlement agreement concerns the procedure for crediting the amount of a settled claim.ass for retarded citizens,dade county,state dep t of health rehab,so d,see also mendez simon,so d,waiving the rule and requiring a judicial apportionment when a minor is involved.state law ordinarily does not govern the procedures of federal courts.see hanna plumer,d.
second,applying state law has the potential to frustrate the purposes of the bankruptcy code.the florida rule errs on the side of preventing a single satisfaction,but the underlying purposes of the trustee avoidance powers compel a different result.we have recognized that the power to avoid is an important exception to the general rule that the trustee takes the debtor estate as it is at the commencement of the bankruptcy.official comm.of unsecured creditors of psa,edwards,cir,cert.denied,d.the power of the trustee to avoid certain transfers prevents the depletion of the estate,promotes an equitable distribution of the debtor assets,and protects creditors who advanced credit in ignorance of fraud.see,in re bracewell,cir,petition for cert.filed,noting that the power to avoid protect s creditors interests and prevent s debtor abuse in re int l admin,cir t he character of a fraudulent transfer action is to expose fraudulent dealings.the florida presumption would undermine these federal policies of bankruptcy.
third,applying a uniform rule of federal law will not disturb any commercial expectations predicated on state law.section d applies only to specific federal rights of action,and the rule of single satisfaction applies only to settlements that have been approved by a bankruptcy court in a core bankruptcy proceeding.
both the textual and contextual differences between section and section d underscore our conclusion that federal,not state,law should provide our rule of decision.the text of section makes clear that it preserves rights to offset debt created by law that vested prior to the commencement of the bankruptcy case.section allows states unfettered discretion to create,eliminate,and otherwise define any rights to offset mutual debt and requires federal courts to recognize those rights.section d,on the other hand,creates a rule of single satisfaction without reference to state law.the rule of single satisfaction applies only to claims that arise under federal law,are brought in a federal proceeding,and vest after a bankruptcy case has commenced.in this circumstance,the states have no discretion to eliminate or create a bar against recovery by a trustee.
the bankruptcy court concluded that setoff rights pertaining to the new settlement must be construed under florida law because state law governs the interpretation of contracts,but whether florida law would govern the interpretation of the settlement agreement is beside the point.if the trustee and new had chosen the law of a foreign country to govern their settlement agreement,section d would still bar the trustee from taking more than a single satisfaction on account of the same avoided transfer.the right of northern trust to invoke the rule of single satisfaction arises from the bankruptcy code,not the settlement agreement.
citing in re jiffy lube securities litigation,cir,the bankruptcy court also erroneously concluded that federal common law is particularly inapplicable to the claims resolved by the new settlement because northern trust setoff rights may differ substantially under federal common law and florida law.in jiffy lube,the fourth circuit vacated a proposed settlement of a securities class action because the district court entered a bar order that required the defendants to give up any right of contribution or indemnification against the settling defendant but did not specify how much setoff credit the defendants would be given against damages awarded against them or the method for determining that credit.id.at.the fourth circuit acknowledged several difficulties in choosing a method for determining the credit amount,including that under a
