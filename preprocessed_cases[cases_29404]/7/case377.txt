background 
housecraft manufactured and assembled housewares and a variety of other plastic products at its plant in albans,vermont using raw plastic supplied by federal plastics.in august,housecraft entered into a contract with one of its customers,santé naturelle,ltee,to produce containers for nutribar,a dietary product sold by santé.by,housecraft was experiencing serious financial difficulties affecting its ability to pay suppliers such as federal plastics,and,as a result,scaled back its manufacturing activities.by the end of june,housecraft owed federal plastics.
in september,housecraft wrote to santé directing it to send payment for shipments of nutribar containers to a company known as primex plastics,claiming that primex was an affiliate of housecraft.in fact,primex was an unaffiliated canadian company controlled by the son of the owner of federal plastics.thereafter,housecraft shipped the containers to federal plastics instead of santé,and federal plastics sold the containers to santé through primex.federal plastics collected the payments made by santé for the nutribar containers,either directly or through primex.
housecraft filed for chapter bankruptcy protection in october.the case was converted to chapter in march.housecraft bankruptcy spawned criminal bankruptcy fraud charges against numerous individuals,including the president of housecraft,abraham murad,who pled guilty to bankruptcy fraud in march.in filing for bankruptcy,housecraft failed to list the nutribar container contract on its schedule of executory contracts.following the filing,housecraft continued to transfer nutribar containers to federal plastics,and federal plastics continued to sell these containers to santé and to collect payments from santé.this case arose from these transfers of containers both before and after housecraft filed for bankruptcy protection.
in april,the trustee and bnp brought claims against two abraham murad companies for turnover of property that had been seized by the fbi while investigating the housecraft bankruptcy.federal plastics intervened,claiming possession of some of the seized property.the trustee and bnp then amended their complaint to include claims against federal plastics pursuant to and of the bankruptcy code to recover the value of the nutribar containers section a provides for avoidance of fraudulent transfers based on a showing of actual or constructive fraud section a,which pertains to the avoidance of transfers,provides that the trustee may avoid a transfer of property of the estate that occurs after the commencement of the case and that is not authorized under this title or by the court.
federal plastics moved to dismiss bnp for lack of standing,arguing that and only authorize trustees or bring avoidance actions.the motion also sought to dismiss the claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under b,which grants district courts jurisdiction over all civil proceedings arising under title,or arising in or related to cases under title.in support of this assertion,federal plastics argued that b only confers jurisdiction over claims that can conceivably affect the bankruptcy estate,and the claims against it could not affect the estate because,as a secured creditor,bnp alone would be entitled to any recovery from the litigation.
in response to the motion,the trustee moved for retroactive ratification of an agreement between himself and bnp for joint prosecution of the adversary proceeding the agreement.under this agreement,the trustee and bnp were required to prosecute the claims against federal plastics jointly,and bnp was to bear the cost of the litigation.the agreement provided that bnp and the trustee will confer on decisions concerning the claims to be jointly prosecuted,and all such claims may be compromised or settled only with the express consent of bnp.in return for bnp financial assistance,the trustee agreed that any recovery from the litigation would be paid in the following order litigation costs and attorney fees to bnp,to housecraft estate,and the balance to be split,for bnp and for the estate.in support of the motion for ratification,the trustee asserted that housecraft estate,the trustee,and trustee counsel do not have the present resources to prosecute the l itigation and that w ithout bnp commitment to devote its own resources to prosecute the l itigation,the exercise of sound business judgment would require the trustee to abandon these claims.gleb glinka,trustee mot.for ratification of agreement between trustee and banque nationale de paris canada for joint prosecution,at.
federal plastics opposed the motion,claiming that the agreement amounted to a collusive sale to bnp of a claim belonging exclusively to the trustee for the sole purpose of creating federal jurisdiction.bnp and the trustee maintained that the agreement was a legitimate settlement of a potential dispute between them over the right to the proceeds of the litigation.although both plaintiffs agreed that bnp claim to the nutribar containers had priority,the nutribar containers had been sold,leaving recovery of a money judgment for the value of the containers as the sole viable remedy.the plaintiffs claimed that the agreement originated in part from their uncertainty over whether a secured creditor with a lien on fraudulently transferred inventory could also assert a lien on the trustee right to recover its value,and that the agreement represented a fair compromise of their anticipated dispute over this issue.
in june,the bankruptcy court ratified the agreement,finding that pursuing federal plastics to recover sizable fraudulent conveyances was in the best interest of the estate and creditors.the district court then denied federal plastics motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,as well as its motion to dismiss bnp for lack of standing.glinka.the court found that it had subject matter jurisdiction over the title claims because b confers arising under jurisdiction on any claim that relies on title for its cause of action.id.at.the district court also found that bnp had standing despite the fact that title expressly authorizes only the trustee or a to bring and claims.id.at.in making this determination,the court relied upon our decision in unsecured creditors committee noyes in re stn enterprises,cir stn,which permitted a committee of unsecured creditors to bring suit on behalf of a bankruptcy estate when the trustee unjustifiably refused to do so.although the trustee of housecraft estate was a willing participant in this lawsuit,the district court held that bnp had standing pursuant to stn because it was in the best interest of the estate.glinka,at.the court reasoned that 
the creditor is bearing the cost of the litigation.under the terms of the joint prosecution agreement,in order to be reimbursed out of any recovery,litigation expenses must be reasonable.any application for attorneys fees will be subject to judicial scrutiny.if their suit is successful,the plaintiffs have agreed upon their respective shares of any recovery,with the intention of avoiding additional litigation over bnp ability to assert a security interest in a recovery.
because the suit presents colorable claims for relief because trustee would have failed to pursue the suit without the assistance of bnp and because there is no net financial burden on the bankruptcy estate,bnp is entitled to standing under stn.

the case proceeded to trial in september.during the trial,federal plastics argued that the transfers did not violate because housecraft did not receive less than a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transfer or obligation,as is required to demonstrate constructive fraud under a b i.federal plastics claimed that it paid fair consideration for the containers via swap transactions,in which federal plastics gave housecraft three to four truckloads of raw plastic in exchange for nutribar containers.the district court rejected this argument,concluding that there was no credible evidence of these swap transactions because there was no documentation of the alleged shipments of raw plastic,while a ll other shipments of raw plastic by federal plastic s to housecraft were thoroughly documented.mem.of decision and order at.
federal plastics also claimed that the transfers did not violate because,after housecraft filed for bankruptcy,the two companies entered into a new business arrangement that was sanctioned by the bankruptcy court whereby federal plastics supplied the raw material to housecraft on consignment.again,the district court rejected federal plastics argument,finding that there was no credible evidence of this new arrangement because federal plastics invoices and internal documentation for the plastic shipped supposedly on consignment are identical to the documents produced under their previous credit sales arrangement.id.at.the court further noted that there was no evidence that housecraft obtained the authorization of or disclosed to the bankruptcy court the transfers of nutribar containers,as is necessary to avoid liability under.id.at.instead,the court concluded that a t a time when housecraft owed federal plastics more than for plastic purchased on credit that housecraft was unable to pay,housecraft and federal plastics made a deal that essentially transferred housecraft lucrative contract with santé to federal plastics.id.at.
based upon these factual findings,the district court held that housecraft conveyances were fraudulent transfers under and that the transfers were also fraudulent under.id.at.the district court also rejected federal plastics argument that it was entitled to a setoff against the judgment in the amount of for the value of the raw plastic it shipped to housecraft.id.at.the court reasoned that no authority existed for allowing such a setoff against the value of an avoided transfer of property.accordingly,the district court entered judgment in favor of the plaintiffs for,the full value of the property transferred,plus interest.federal plastics timely appealed.
discussion 
subject matter jurisdiction 
federal plastics argues that jurisdiction under b does not extend to claims that can not benefit or otherwise affect the estate,and,because bnp has a secured interest in the nutribar containers,prior to the agreement only not the have been entitled to any recovery from federal plastics.accordingly,federal plastics argues that the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the title claims before bnp relinquished a portion of the recovery to the estate by entering into the agreement.federal plastics then argues that,pursuant to,the plaintiffs could not create subject matter jurisdiction by entering into an agreement that assigned a token portion of the recovery to the estate 
we pause only briefly to address federal plastics jurisdictional argument,as claims arising under title need not affect or benefit the estate as a condition of bankruptcy jurisdiction.section b provides that the district courts shall have original but not exclusive jurisdiction of all civil proceedings arising under title,or arising in or related to cases under title.because the plaintiffs and claims clearly invoke substantive rights created by bankruptcy law,they necessarily arise under title.see browning levy,cir holding that arising under jurisdiction exists where one invokes a substantive right created by federal bankruptcy law wood wood matter of wood,cir finding that congress used the phrase arising under title to describe those proceedings that involve a cause of action created or determined by a statutory provision of title see also pereira sonia holdings,in re artha management,cir noting that a fraudulent conveyance claim brought pursuant to,inter alia,arose under the bankruptcy code b stating that b ankruptcy judges may hear and determine all cases under title and all core proceedings arising under title and that c ore proceedings include proceedings to determine,avoid,or recover fraudulent conveyances.consequently,arising under jurisdiction would exist here even if the litigation could not affect the estate 
ii.standing 
federal plastics argues that,as a secured creditor,bnp did not have standing to bring the title claims because the bankruptcy code limits standing under and to a trustee or a,see also a granting to a possession all the rights of a trustee serving in a case under this chapter.we disagree.although not explicitly authorized in the code,we have extended standing to bring fraudulent conveyance claims under and to additional parties such as creditors when to do so is in the best interest of the estate.in stn,an unsecured creditors committee moved for leave to sue the recipient of fraudulent transfers from the debtor.we held that an unsecured creditors committee may initiate an adversary proceeding in the name of a if the unjustifiably refuses to bring suit.stn,at.
in commodore international,gould in re commodore international,cir,we broadened this doctrine.commodore involved a suit brought by an unsecured creditors committee against various officers and directors of the debtor under b for fraud,waste,and mismanagement.commodore,at.unlike in stn,the in commodore had not unreasonably refused to bring suit,but they did consent to prosecution by the committee in their stead.we held that a creditors committee may bring suit even where the trustee or has not unjustifiably refused to do so,as long as the committee has the consent of the debtor in possession or trustee,and the court finds that suit by the committee is a in the best interest of the bankruptcy estate,and b is necessary and beneficial to the fair and efficient resolution of the bankruptcy proceedings.id.at citation omitted.
the case for recognition of creditor standing here is more compelling than in commodore because the trustee is also a named plaintiff,and federal plastics has not challenged his standing.of course,any such claim would be meritless because and both expressly provide that the trustee may avoid the fraudulent transactions described in each provision,and we have recognized that t he trustee of a bankrupt estate has broad powers under the bankruptcy code to avoid certain transfers of property made by the debtor either after or shortly before the filing of the bankruptcy petition.christy alexander alexander of in re finley,kumble,wagner,heine,underberg,manley,myerson casey,cir.because the trustee had standing,federal plastics would still be exposed to him for the full amount of the fraudulent transfer even if bnp did not have standing.
the trustee participation as a party is also significant because,unlike the plaintiffs in commodore,bnp is not replacing the trustee as a claimant it is simply assisting him with the litigation.the agreement requires that bnp and the trustee confer on decisions concerning the claims to be jointly prosecuted.consequently,the trustee has all the rights of a,including the right to control the course of the litigation with bnp under the supervision of the district court.
the agreement makes clear that bnp has the trustee consent to bring suit.thus,we need only discuss the second prong of the commodore test,which requires that the litigation be both in the best interest of the bankruptcy estate and necessary and beneficial to the fair and efficient resolution of the bankruptcy proceedings.commodore,at
