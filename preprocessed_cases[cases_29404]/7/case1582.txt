at issue in this bankruptcy appeal is a tax debt owed by brenda marie jones jones to the california franchise tax board ftb.the bankruptcy court and the bankruptcy appellate panel bap found that the debt was not excepted from discharge in jones chapter bankruptcy proceeding.although debts arising before a discharge order in a chapter proceeding are generally discharged,certain tax debts are excepted.see b see also id.a a,a.a statute of limitations,known as the lookback period,carves out tax debts arising from a taxable year ending on or before the bankruptcy petition is filed and for which the return was last due no more than three years before the petition is filed.id.a a see young united states.
because jones tax debt arose more than three years before she filed her chapter bankruptcy petition,it would be discharged unless the lookback period was suspended by statute.the lookback period is suspended by an unnumbered paragraph in a the suspension provision when,as relevant here,an automatic stay precludes the creditor from collecting on the debt.the only automatic stay provisions potentially at issue in this appeal are those that preclude creditors from pursuing collection actions against the property of a bankruptcy estate.see a,a the ftb argues that,as a consequence of jones prior chapter bankruptcy case,the lookback period was suspended and the tax debt not discharged.we are not persuaded.
when the bankruptcy court confirmed the joneses chapter plan,the estate property revested in jones and became jones property,thus lifting the applicable stay provisions.see id.a,a.since this revesting occurred before the tax debt came due,no stay precluded the ftb from collecting on the debt under.consequently,the tax debt was not excepted from the chapter discharge,and the principles of equitable tolling do not apply to extend the lookback period as the ftb was neither precluded from collecting on the tax debt nor did it actively try to protect its claim.we hold the debt was discharged and affirm the bap.
background 
jones and her husband filed a joint voluntary chapter bankruptcy petition in july.the act of filing the petition created a bankruptcy estate and imposed an automatic stay on creditor collection activities against property of the estate.see,a.the bankruptcy court confirmed the joneses plan in september.the joneses filed their joint income tax return for the year in october,pursuant to an extension,but they did not pay the approximately they owed in reported taxes.the bankruptcy court dismissed the joneses chapter proceeding in september.
thirteen months later,in october,jones,but not her husband,filed a voluntary chapter bankruptcy petition.she received a discharge of her existing debts,which would include the tax debt unless it was otherwise excepted,in january.see id.b.because the joneses tax return was due more than three years before jones filed her chapter petition,the debt is discharged unless the statutory suspension provision or equitable tolling apply to extend the lookback period.see id.a a.
in,the ftb successfully moved to reopen jones chapter case before the bankruptcy court and requested a determination that the tax debt was excepted from discharge.the bankruptcy court ruled in favor of jones,holding that neither the joneses confirmed chapter plan nor the automatic stay in place during the chapter proceeding prevented the ftb from collecting the debt from jones when the tax came due.the bap affirmed,holding that the lookback period was not suspended because the suspension provision,the unnumbered paragraph in a,applied only to the lookback period of jones prior chapter case,and equitable tolling did not apply.

ii.analysis 
a.the three year lookback period is defined with respect to jones chapter petition.
we begin with the basic proposition that the debt is discharged unless excepted,because the debt came due before the bankruptcy court ordered jones debts discharged.see b.importantly,however,one exception to a discharge is a tax debt as defined in a id.a a.subsection a a i in turn excepts a tax debt from discharge 
only to the extent that such claims are for 
a a tax on or measured by income or gross receipts for a taxable year ending on or before the date of the filing of the petition 
i for which a return,if required,is last due,including extensions,after three years before the date of the filing of the petition.
emphasis added.
this latter requirement,the lookback period,functions as a statute of limitations.young,at.section a a i defines the lookback period with respect to the petition emphasis added.the statute does not refer simply to a or any petition under the title,as the ftb would have us read the statute.instead,the plain language refers to the petition emphasis added,meaning,in this case,the chapter petition.see maney kagenveama in re kagenveama,cir where statutory language is plain,the sole function of the courts at least where the disposition required by the text is not absurd is to enforce it according to its terms.quoting lamie united states,abrogated on other grounds by hamilton lanning,see also united states ron pair,a s long as the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent,there generally is no need for a court to inquire beyond the plain language of the statute.thus,the lookback period defined in a a i must be the period preceding jones chapter petition that is,october through october.
as the debt came due in,outside the lookback period in jones chapter case,it is discharged unless we determine that statutory suspension or equitable tolling apply to extend the lookback period to encompass the due date.
b.the statutory suspension provision does not apply to jones tax debt.
section a suspends the lookback period only where the creditor was specifically precluded from collection.
ultimately,this appeal turns on our interpretation of the suspension provision,which provides that the lookback period 
shall be suspended for any period during which a governmental unit is prohibited under applicable nonbankruptcy law from collecting a tax as a result of a request by the debtor for a hearing and an appeal of any collection action taken or proposed against the debtor,plus days plus any time during which the stay of proceedings was in effect in a prior case under this title or during which collection was precluded by the existence of or more confirmed plans under this title,plus days.
the suspension provision contemplates three scenarios in which the lookback period is suspended.by the plain language of the statute,the first and third scenarios are limited to periods in which the government was prohibited from collecting a tax and in which collection was precluded by a confirmed bankruptcy plan.id.neither circumstance is applicable.instead,the second scenario is relevant here any time during which the stay of proceedings was in effect in a prior bankruptcy case.id.emphasis added.the ftb would have us read the statute to suspend the lookback period when a stay is in place against any creditor jones reads the statute narrowly to suspend the lookback period only where a stay precluding collection of this debt is in place.because neither party reading of the statute is obviously correct,the statute is ambiguous,and we look to the legislative history in deciphering its meaning.barstow irs in re of markair,cir.
