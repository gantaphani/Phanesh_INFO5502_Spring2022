leo leonard may and texas commercial energy tce sued the electric reliability council of texas ercot for drawing down a letter of credit in violation of a bankruptcy court order and confirmed reorganization plan that allegedly prevented ercot from taking that action to satisfy debts.the final judgment awarded contract damages and attorneys fees to the appellees.ercot now appeals,asserting that it had the right to draw down the letter of credit to pay tce debts.we agree,and accordingly reverse and render the judgment in favor of may 
background 
in,texas deregulated its energy markets.customers could choose to purchase electricity from a variety of retail electric providers.retail electric providers purchased electricity wholesale from ercot,the entity that manages the electric grid and market for electricity in the state.tce,one of the first retail electricity providers,purchased electricity from ercot pursuant to a contract,the qualified scheduling entity agreement the qse agreement.electricity can not be stored,so tce purchased electricity on a daily basis.because of volatility in both the price of electricity and the quantity of electricity demanded,tce daily charges could vary considerably.to address this inherent volatility,the qse agreement required tce to post standby letters of credit to guarantee payment.as a new company in a newly deregulated industry,however,tce soon began to falter.in march,due to large swings in the price of electricity,tce was about to default on approximately million in unpaid ercot invoices and filed for chapter bankruptcy.
tce continued to operate while in bankruptcy.to continue purchasing electricity from ercot,tce needed to assume the qse agreement.see generally.after negotiations,the bankruptcy court allowed tce to assume the qse agreement subject to modifications the september order.in pertinent part,the september order implemented the contractual modifications,stating 
ordered that debtor tce is hereby authorized to assume the qualified scheduling entity agreement with ercot,modified as follows 
defendant ercot is prohibited from directly or indirectly i taking any further action to collect the unpaid invoices,ii drawing down any letter of credit securing the obligation represented by those invoices,iii otherwise taking any action to facilitate the collection or payment of those unpaid invoices the obligation reflected therein,or iv the foreclosure of any collateral securing payment of those invoices or the obligation reflected by them except as authorized by further order of this court.
the overall effect of the september order was to prevent ercot from enforcing any rights in collateral to satisfy the unpaid invoices.ercot was permitted to maintain letters of credit to satisfy tce obligations.
in december,the bankruptcy court approved tce reorganization plan the tce plan.the tce plan took into account a million unsecured obligation owed to ercot the plan debt largely based on the unpaid invoices.ercot claim,although unsecured,was singled out from other unsecured claims because of its size,complexity,and a pending lawsuit against ercot and its member electricity suppliers.in addition,the tce plan formally incorporated the september order.after confirmation,tce was again obliged to guarantee electricity purchases by posting security with ercot pursuant to the assumed qse agreement.because tce did not have the resources to post sufficient collateral,may,tce principal,provided financing.on behalf of tce,may posted a standby letter of credit the loc,the subject of this dispute may personally purchased the loc from wells fargo bank through an intermediary,american national bank.
after confirmation,tce continued to struggle.it defaulted on the plan debt while remaining current on its invoices for electricity purchases.ercot decided to use the loc to satisfy some of the plan debt.it sent a letter to tce stating that the assumed qse agreement gave ercot the right to draw down the loc to satisfy the plan debt.tce responded that,pursuant to the tce plan,ercot could only draw down the loc to satisfy electricity purchases.because tce was current on the invoices,tce believed that ercot could not draw on the loc.
on march,ercot presented the proper documents to wells fargo,and wells fargo paid ercot pursuant to the loc.wells fargo sought repayment from american national bank,which then sought repayment from may.may then commenced this litigation in the bankruptcy court.to cover his guarantee obligations to american national bank,may executed a promissory note the may note and paid interest during the pendency of this litigation.tce became a chapter debtor shortly afterward,and its trustee was substituted for tce as an additional plaintiff.
may initially sought an injunction to prevent ercot from drawing down the loc under.bus.a.may asserted that ercot was committing a material fraud against him ercot had already drawn down the loc,however,so the adversary proceeding was modified to determine,inter alia,whether ercot was entitled to retain the may argued that ercot violated the loc underlying contract the qse agreement,the tce plan,and the september order.he asserted that the qse agreement and tce plan allowed ercot to draw down the loc only to satisfy electricity purchases,not the plan debt.in its first ruling,the bankruptcy court held that ercot breached the standby loc agreement,interpreted in light of the tce plan.the court awarded may in contract damages,but did not award attorneys fees.
both parties appealed to the district court.the district court essentially affirmed the judgment but for its decisional basis relied on ercot violation of the september order the court remanded to evaluate additional issues,including the trustee claim.
on remand,the bankruptcy court reaffirmed its judgment based on the theory and awarded may contract damages of to satisfy the may note in interest paid during litigation and prejudgment interest on the total award in the sum of.in addition,it held ercot in contempt for violating a court order the tce plan and awarded may attorneys fees.the district court reaffirmed the judgment.ercot now appeals to this court.
ii.jurisdiction 
before discussing the merits of this case,this court must first address the issue of subject matter jurisdiction.subject matter jurisdiction is reviewed de novo.gasch hartford accident indem,cir.bankruptcy jurisdiction,like all federal jurisdiction,must be based on a statute.in re bass,cir.in the face of ercot challenge,may raises various theories of jurisdiction.we need not address them all.as pled by may,the original petition sought in part an interpretation of the tce reorganization plan terms.tce joined the suit to pursue its own claims against ercot arising from tce construction of the plan.although an argument may be spun against bankruptcy court jurisdiction,this dispute was intimately tied to the terms of the tce plan and the court september order,and in particular,the extent to which the injunctive provision of that order limits ercot conduct.consequently,the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction over the dispute.see in re brass,cir citing in re craig stores of texas,cir.
iii.discussion 
on appeal,this court reviews the bankruptcy court judgment by the same standards that guided the district court scrutinizing the same judgment in its appellate capacity.in re drilling,cir.findings of fact are reviewed for clear error and conclusions of law are reviewed de novo.id.
the parties agree that if ercot violated the september order,then may is entitled to judgment.they part company over the extent to which the september order,after its incorporation in the tce plan,constrained ercot freedom to draw on the loc to satisfy the plan debt.resolving the issues requires interpretation of the september order and the tce plan according to general rules of contract interpretation.in re stratford of texas,cir.a bankruptcy plan,this court has said,represents a kind of consent decree that should be interpreted as a contract.id.the language of these documents taken as a whole,if unambiguous,is the controlling expression of the parties intentions.kimbell foods,republic nat.bank dallas,cir.
the september order,incorporated into the tce plan,states 
ordered that debtor is hereby authorized to assume the qualified scheduling entity agreement with ercot,modified as follows 
defendant ercot is prohibited from directly or indirectly i taking any further action to collect the invoices that are the subject of the adversary complaint,ii drawing down any letter of credit loc securing the obligation represented by those invoices,iii otherwise taking any action to facilitate the collection or payment of those invoices the obligation reflected therein,or iv the foreclosure of any collateral securing payment of those invoices or the obligation reflected by them except as authorized by further order of this court.
emphasis added.tce plan incorporated the september order as follows 
the order authorizing debtor to assume modified executory contract with electric reliability council of texas,order signed by the court on september,is incorporated into the plan and is to remain in full force and effect,except the payment terms set out herein to be made on the ercot claim shall supercede the payment terms regarding all payments to ercot under the order which were to begin on july.
ercot drew down the loc to partially satisfy tce default in payments on the plan debt.may challenges ercot action in several ways.may contends that the express terms of the september order were carried into the plan and prevented ercot from drawing down the loc for anything other than electricity purchases.may asserts that to hold otherwise renders the september order superfluous and conflicts with provisions of the tce plan that provided a different,exclusive means for satisfying the plan debt.may relies on parol evidence,admitted by the bankruptcy court,to explain the parties intentions.finally,may contends that ercot draw on the loc afforded it a disproportionate recovery in comparison to other unsecured tce creditors.we consider each argument in turn.
may first contention is that the plan debt owed to ercot upon confirmation constituted invoice s or an obligation represented by those invoices subject to the september order.the bankruptcy and district courts agreed with this characterization,but we do not.
fundamental to chapter reorganization is that unless a plan provides otherwise,the debtor obligations are replaced and superseded by the restructured debt arrived at in a plan.see d.discharge does not eliminate debt,but it effects an injunction against creditors enforcement of their rights against the debtor.thus o nce the reorganization plan is approved by the bankruptcy court,each claimant gets a new claim,based upon whatever treatment is accorded to it in the plan itself.in re benjamin coal,cir.
the tce plan follows the usual model.nowhere is ercot invoice debt excluded from discharge.on the contrary,section of the plan uses blanket language discharging all debts 
it is the intention of this plan that once confirmation occurs,the debtor will be fully,finally,and completely discharged from all liabilities including claims and debts and shall be revested with all property of the estate as herein provided.
in the same section,the plan states that ercot will not be allowed to assess estimated aggregate liability calculations based on tce discharged debt.emphasis added as ercot points out,the tce plan states nineteen times that debts owed by tce were discharged and extinguished upon confirmation.cumulatively,these sections leave no doubt that all obligations including ercot invoice debt were replaced with new contractual obligations through the plan.moreover,the tce plan modifies ercot invoice claims,explaining in section how the ercot claim the invoice debt is to be restructured and satisfied,inter alia,by a series of quarterly payments.if the invoice claims were not discharged,this section would be unnecessary.by changing the payment terms and amount of ercot invoice debt,tec assumed a new debt in accordance with the tce plan.because the plan debt owed to ercot is neither an invoice nor an obligation represented by those invoices,the september order injunction does not govern ercot action regarding the plan debt.
appellee contends that interpreting the september order in this plain language manner renders it superfluous if the september order did not cover the plan debt,it did not cover anything.yet a key tenet of contract construction is that each clause should be interpreted to give it effective meaning.reliant energy services,enron canada,cir.to give the september order effective meaning,the court must interpret it to cover the plan debt.
this argument is unpersuasive on two levels.first,the september order still had effect as applied to the actual invoices.it prevented ercot from collecting the invoices from any third parties that guaranteed the debt.e discharge of a debt of the debtor does not affect the liability of any other entity on,or the property of any other entity for,such debt.similarly,the september order prevented ercot from drawing on any remaining letters of credit that secured the invoice debt.second,from a larger perspective,the purpose of the september order was to craft tce assumption of its qse contract with ercot,which allowed it to continue in business.under the bankruptcy code,a debtor normally has to cure all defaults before it may assume a executory contract.b a.the september order was a compromise that allowed tce to assume the qse agreement without curing the default the invoices.the tce plan continued the september order in effect principally to preserve the compromise and achieve continuity in the assumed qse.this objective was by no means rendered superfluous.
may further argues that the september order prohibitions should cover the plan debt because the tce plan authorized an exclusive method by which ercot would receive payments on its plan debt.ercot was to be paid periodically from revenues and,failing that,could look only to its pro rata share of a million letter of credit to secure the plan debt.may asserts that the measly million letter of credit was the sole and exclusive collateral if tce defaulted on the plan debt and that the only other potential remedy was converting the case to chapter.
this is not what the tce plan says.the plan does not state that the million letter of credit must remain the sole and exclusive security for the ercot claim.businesses regularly add security to previously unsecured debts.that the unsecured creditors received a single,disproportionately small letter of credit pursuant to the plan does not preclude tce from providing other sources of collateral going forward.the tce plan can not be interpreted as making the million letter of credit the exclusive collateral for the plan debt still less could the plan constrain ercot from receiving an loc put up by may rather than tce.thus,our literal interpretation of the september order is not inconsistent with this provision.
may also contends that because the tce plan restricted ercot ability to calculate estimated aggregate liability eal,ercot can not draw down the loc to satisfy the plan debt.as has been noted,the eal calculations determined how much collateral tce was required to post with ercot to purchase electricity.the tce plan states that 
ercot will not be allowed to assess estimated aggregate liability calculations based on tce discharged debt.upon confirmation,tce eal calculations will be based solely upon obligations only.
the limited eal calculation is not relevant to whether ercot could draw down the loc to satisfy the plan debt.if anything,it emphasizes that tce knew how to insist on explicit limitations of ercot rights.this clause effectively reduced tce requisite collateral.an eal calculation including the plan debt would have required tce to post significantly more collateral with ercot,but it does not affect the nature of the collateral actually posted.the eal calculations do not control what ercot may do with posted collateral,only how much collateral tce must post.accordingly,a literal interpretation of the september order is not inconsistent with this provision.
may next asks the court to look beyond the pla
