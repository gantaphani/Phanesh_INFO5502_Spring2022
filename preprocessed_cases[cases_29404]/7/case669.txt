in this bankruptcy case,filed under chapter and later converted to chapter,a lessor of personal property asserted an administrative expense claim under d of the bankruptcy code for all payments due under the lease for the period beginning days after the order for relief and ending when the debtor rejected the lease.the lessor also sought immediate payment of the administrative expense.the bankruptcy and district courts determined that the lessor was entitled to only a fraction of the amount due under the lease and denied the request for immediate payment.we conclude that d entitles the lessor to an administrative expense for all lease payments due in the period.immediate payment is not required,however.
under a lease agreement entered into in february,midway airlines corporation midway leased telephone equipment or a telephone system from cit communications finance corporation cit.the lease was to run for sixty months beginning on june.the monthly payment was,representing in rent and in reimbursement for state and county taxes.the lease provided for payment of late fees,interest on late payments,and reasonable attorney fees and costs for collection efforts.on august,in the eastern district of north carolina,midway filed a voluntary chapter petition,which constitute d an order for relief under that chapter.midway bankruptcy petition had been filed for more than a year when,on october,cit filed a motion to compel midway to assume or reject the unexpired telephone equipment lease.on november,a consent order was entered allowing rejection of the lease.on december,cit filed a motion for the allowance of administrative expenses for past due lease payments.cit asserted that it was entitled to an administrative expense of under b a of the code for midway actual and necessary use of the telephone equipment during the first sixty days after the order for relief was entered and an administrative expense of under d for all rent,taxes,late fees,interest,and attorney fees due under the lease for the thirteen months beginning days after the order for relief was entered october,and ending on the date the lease was rejected november.
the bankruptcy court declined to rule immediately on cit b a claim,stating that an evidentiary hearing would be needed to consider both use and actual benefit to the bankruptcy estate.the court did rule definitively on the d claim.first,the court concluded that the equities of the case justified a reduced d allowance because the telephone equipment was of little use to midway,and cit knew that midway was making only limited use of the equipment,yet cit made no effort to seek adequate protection for the equipment until more than a year after the order for relief.as a result,the bankruptcy court allowed cit a d administrative expense for four months of rent and taxes beginning days after the order for relief.for the remaining nine months,the court allowed cit an administrative expense only to the extent that midway actually used and benefitted from the equipment.second,the bankruptcy court refused to allow cit any interest,late fees,or attorney fees.third,the bankruptcy court determined that cit was not entitled to immediate payment because the court had deferred payment of other allowed administrative expenses.
cit appealed the bankruptcy court order on the d claim to the district court on july.on october,midway chapter case was converted to chapter.see.later,on march,the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court order with respect to the d claim.cit appeals,asking us to review only conclusions of law reached by the bankruptcy and district courts.we review these conclusions de novo.see tavenner smoot,cir.
cit asserts on appeal that d entitles it to the full amount due under the telephone equipment lease for the period beginning days after the order for relief was entered.we agree for the following reasons.
when a debtor is a lessee on the date of bankruptcy,the lease does not automatically become an obligation of the estate.rather,the trustee or debtor in possession has the option to assume or reject the lease.see a william norton,norton bankruptcy law practice.section a automatic stay prevents the lessor from recovering the property or terminating the lease while the trustee is deciding whether to assume or reject it.see a norton,supra.moreover,during this period the trustee can force the lessor to continue performing under the lease.norton,supra.in the event the trustee ultimately decides to assume the lease,and the lease is in default,the trustee is required to cure the default or provide adequate assurance that a prompt cure will be forthcoming.see b a.
if the trustee decides to reject the lease,however,the code does not have a provision that requires the outright cure of any default.thus,if the lease is rejected,an issue arises as to the nature of the lessor remedy for recovering lease payments for the period during which the trustee was deciding to reject the lease and during which the estate possessed,and perhaps used,the property.prior to the lessor remedy was to file a claim for an administrative expense under b a,which allows a lessor to recover the actual,necessary costs and expenses of preserving the estate.under b a,however,a lessor is compensated only for the estate actual and necessary use of the property in other words,there is no automatic entitlement to all payments due under the lease.see ford motor credit dobbins,cir section b a requires actual use of the creditor property by the debtor,thereby conferring a concrete benefit on the estate before a claim is allowable as an administrative expense.internal quotation marks,citation,and emphases omitted see also in re gatti,i f the lease was ultimately rejected,the estate was liable only for the period of actual use and only to the extent of real benefit received by the estate.
in congress made it easier for lessors of personal property to recover lease payments by adding d to the code.section d provides that 
the trustee shall timely perform all of the obligations of the debtor,except those specified in b,first arising from or after days after the order for relief in a case under chapter of this title under an unexpired lease of personal property until such lease is assumed or rejected notwithstanding b of this title,unless the court,after notice and a hearing and based on the equities of the case,orders otherwise with respect to the obligations or timely performance thereof.
d.section d is modeled on a very similar provision of the code,d,which requires that a trustee timely perform all obligations under a lease of nonresidential real property after an order for relief is entered.notably,b oth sections impose a duty of timely performance on debtor s and both expressly specify that this duty exists notwithstanding section b of the code.in re.as a result,in construing d,courts often look to decisions construing d see id.
while it is clear that d and d impose on a trustee the duty to perform all lease obligations in a timely manner,these sections do not specify a lessor remedy should the trustee fail to perform.two lines of cases elaborate on the remedy available to a lessor.the first line of cases the majority interpretation holds that the lessor is entitled to an administrative expense for the missed payments under the lease.see towers chickering gregory,cir in re,at.under this interpretation a lessor is entitled to recover the total amount of payments due under the lease,including rent,taxes,interest,late fees,and attorney fees.see in re muma servs,holding that d allows recovery of taxes,late fees,and attorney fees to the extent permitted by the lease in re ms freight,same for d see also centerpoint props.montgomery ward holding,cir the clear and express intent of d is to require the trustee to perform the lease in accordance with its terms.according to the majority interpretation,this administrative expense claim arises directly under d and,as specifically stated in that statute,is independent from b.in re,at.this interpretation rejects the argument that a lessor is still required to assert an administrative expense claim under b a,reasoning that b y providing for timely performance of all lease obligations,notwithstanding section b,the statute has granted priority payment status to the full amount of rent.towers,at.if the majority interpretation was applied to the present case,it would mean that cit would be entitled to an administrative expense for all rent,taxes,interest,late fees,and attorney fees due for the period an amount totaling,according to cit.
the second line of cases the minority interpretation holds that d and d do not entitle the lessor to an administrative expense rather,the sections merely impose obligations on the trustee.see in re palace quality servs,in re gatti,at.according to the minority interpretation,if the trustee fails to perform his obligations under either section,the lessor must seek relief by invoking the more general remedies of the code.for example,the lessor may move to lift or modify the automatic stay or move to modify or terminate the debtor right to possession of the property.see in re gatti,at.if the lessor wishes to assert a claim against the estate for unpaid rent,it must apply for an administrative expense under b a,seeking recovery for actual and necessary use by the estate.see in re palace quality,at.if this interpretation was applied to the present case,it would mean that cit would have to assert an administrative expense claim under b a,and recovery would be limited to an amount representing midway actual and necessary use of the telephone system.
the correct interpretation of d,we conclude,lies somewhere between the majority and minority positions.we agree with the majority interpretation ultimate conclusion that a lessor is entitled to recover all payments due under the lease including rent,taxes,interest,late fees,and attorney fees as an administrative expense if the trustee fails to perform its obligations under d,and the court has not previously modified the trustee obligations pursuant to d.the provision makes clear that a lessor is entitled to the trustee performance of all obligations under the lease.we disagree,however,with the majority interpretation conclusion that d somehow creates an administrative expense claim that is distinct and independent from an administrative expense claim asserted under b.rather,we conclude that a lessor must still assert its administrative expense claim under b it simply does not assert the claim under the specific provision of b a.this conclusion is consistent with the language of d,and it avoids creating ambiguities and conflicts with respect to other provisions in the code.
again,d imposes on a trustee the duty to perform all obligations under a lease beginning days after the entry of an order for relief,but it does not specify the lessor remedy if the trustee fails to perform.see d.we agree with the minority interpretation that i t is obvious that congress knows how to provide a specific remedy for breaches of code obligations,but does not necessarily choose to do so for each affirmative duty imposed on a debtor.in re gatti,at.when a provision of the code imposes an obligation on the debtor or trustee but fails to provide the aggrieved party with a specific remedy,the aggrieved party must resort to the more general remedies afforded by the code.id.thus,we agree with the minority interpretation general proposition that a lessor remedy for a trustee failure to perform his obligations under d lies outside of d specifically,it lies under b.see in re palace quality,at.
however,we part ways with the minority interpretation ultimate conclusion that a lessor remedy for seeking payments due under d is to assert an administrative expense claim under b a.requiring the lessor to proceed under b a limits the amount the lessor can recover to a sum representing the actual and necessary use by the estate.though d does not set forth the lessor remedy should the trustee fail to perform his obligations,the section does indicate the relief that is available to the lessor.section d provides that the trustee shall timely perform all of the obligations of the debtor notwithstanding section b.d emphases added.the minority interpretation conclusion that a lessor must assert a claim under b a with recovery limited to an amount representing actual and necessary use goes against congress instruction that a lessor is entitled to the trustee performance of all lease obligations.the conclusion is also at odds with the notwithstanding section b proviso.as we will explain,d eliminates the requirement of asserting an administrative expense claim under b a and instead allows the assertion of a claim under the general provision of b for recovery of all payments due under the lease.
we first examine the structure and nature of,and then we consider a lessor options prior to the enactment of d.section b begins with the overarching directive that a fter notice and a hearing,there shall be allowed administrative expenses b.the term administrative expense is not defined in the code,but courts agree that an administrative expense has two defining characteristics the expense and right to payment arise after the filing of bankruptcy,and the consideration supporting the right to payment provides some benefit to the estate.see hicks,muse brandt,cir employee transfer grigsby,cir trs.of the amalgamated ins.fund mcfarlin,cir in re jartran,cir cramer mammoth mart,cir see also.of envt l res.clinical,cir t he language of b,read as a whole,suggests a quid pro quo pursuant to which the estate accrues a debt in exchange for some consideration necessary to the operation or rehabilitation of the estate.as a general proposition,lease payments should have these two characteristics because the right to payment arises after the filing of bankruptcy,and the consideration supporting payment provides some benefit to the estate the estate uses,or has the opportunity to use,the property.nevertheless,not all lease payments were recoverable by the lessor before d was enacted in.a lessor was prevented from the automatic recovery of the entire amount due under the lease because of b and its list of examples of administrative expense,one of which is the broad category of actual,necessary costs and expenses of preserving the estate.b a.before d was inserted in the code,it was that a lessor had to seek an administrative expense under b a,which by its plain language limited the lessor recovery to an amount representing the estate actual and necessary use of the property.see norton,supra.
section d changed this by directing the trustee to timely perform all of the obligations under a lease,notwithstanding section b.thus,when a lessor seeks an administrative expense for all of the obligations due under a lease,the notwithstanding b proviso in d relieves the lessor from proceeding under b a,which would limit the recovery to an amount representing only the actual and necessary use by the estate.cukierman uecker,cir t he notwithstanding section b proviso exempts the amount of lease obligations that a trustee must timely pay under d from b limitation of administrative expenses to the fair value of the debtor use of the property.the notwithstanding b language,however,does not exempt a claim for lease payments due under d from the general ambit of b.section d says only that a trustee shall timely perform notwithstanding section b.the proviso did not use the broader language,notwithstanding b,which would have exempted a claim for payments due under d from all requirements of b.this reading is consistent with b terms,which contemplate that a bankruptcy court may award administrative expenses for claims other than those specifically listed in b.see,in re white motor credit,noting that the general provision of b can be read broadly to cover expenses incurred by members of the official creditors committee.
a claim for lease payments due under d is still a claim for an administrative expense under b because it bears the two characteristics of an administrative expense the right to payment arises after the filing of the petition,and the estate receives beneficial consideration because the estate has the opportunity to use the property.a claim for unpaid lease payments is simply no long
