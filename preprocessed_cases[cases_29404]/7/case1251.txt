miller schroeder,m s was a securities underwriter and securities broker that primarily conducted business in minnesota.in,mi acquisition corporation mi acquired m s through a stock purchase,and,in conjunction with that transaction,purchased a insurance policy entitled directors and officers liability insurance policy including employment practices liability coverage the policy.at.m s is listed as the parent corporation under the policy.in july of,this initial directors and officers d o policy was renewed for another three years without substantive change to its terms.m s did not purchase a separate errors and omissions e o policy,which generally protect s against liability based on the failure of the insured,in his or her professional status,to comply with what can be considered in simplistic terms to be the standard of care for that profession.couch on insurance ed.
between december of and march of,m s underwrote worth of heritage bonds,and m s brokers in california sold the bonds in twelve municipal offerings.all of these bonds were eventually defaulted upon.purchasers of the heritage bonds initiated lawsuits and arbitration proceedings against m s,m s brokers,and m s directors and officers.the plaintiffs in these cases allege theories of liability,including violations of federal securities laws,state securities laws,the common law,and the rules and regulations governing members of the national association of securities dealers nasd.some of these claims allege that m s directors and officers were directly involved in illegal securities transactions,while others name m s directors as defendants solely because they were directors and officers exercising general authority over m s involvement in the heritage bond transactions.
in,m s and m s directors and officers tendered the claims to erii,but erii denied coverage,contending that coverage of the claims is precluded by endorsements in the insurance contract.m s then defended itself against these various claims and incurred in legal fees.as a result of the claims,m s was assessed millions of dollars in damages,and in january of,m s filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code.
appellee brian leonard,the trustee of m s bankruptcy estate,initiated this adversary proceeding against erii in october of in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of minnesota.the complaint alleged that erii breached its contract with m s by failing to defend m s against,and indemnify m s for,claims made against it in the heritage bond litigation.the complaint also sought both a declaration that the insurance policy provided coverage for these claims as well as damages in the full amount million of the policy coverage.two separate groups of made up of former m s directors and officers seeking the same relief sought by the bankruptcy previously commenced actions in the united states district court for the district of minnesota seeking defense costs and coverage under the same policy.both groups of intervenors were permitted to join the bankruptcy action,and their district court cases were stayed pending resolution of the bankruptcy case.
the trustee,the intervenors,and erii all filed motions for summary judgment.erii sought a declaration that it was not obligated to defend m s against,or provide indemnification for,claims brought in the heritage bond litigation.the trustee and intervenors moved for partial summary judgment,seeking a declaration that erii was obligated to defend m s against the heritage bond claims and provide coverage for at least some of those claims.as to the core issues raised by the trustee,the bankruptcy court denied erii motion for summary judgment and granted the trustee motion for partial summary judgment,concluding that the insurance policy endorsements relied on by erii did not preclude coverage of some of the heritage bond claims,such that erii was obligated to defend m s against all of the claims brought in the heritage bond litigation.as to the noncore issues raised by the intervenors,the bankruptcy court filed a report and recommendation to the district court that erii motion for summary judgment should be denied and that the intervenors motion for partial summary judgment should be granted for the same reasons the bankruptcy court had ruled in favor of the trustee in the core proceedings.erii filed objections with the district court as to the bankruptcy court report and recommendation concerning the intervenors.meanwhile,the parties entered into a stipulation in which they all agreed how to allocate the million policy limits,which all agreed would be exceeded by the litigation,in the event the bankruptcy court order and report and recommendation were affirmed.the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court report and recommendation as to the noncore issues.the bankruptcy court subsequently entered a final judgment as to the core issues based on the parties stipulation,and erii appealed that judgment to the united states district court for the district of minnesota.the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court judgment as to the core issues,and it separately entered a final judgment as to the noncore issues based on the parties stipulation.erii timely appealed each judgment,which we have consolidated on appeal.
the sole issue on appeal is whether the district court erred by concluding that the insurance policy provides defense costs and indemnification for claims brought against m s and its directors and officers in the heritage bond litigation.

the parties agree that our interpretation of the insurance policy is controlled by minnesota law and that our analysis of the policy is governed by general principles of contract interpretation.see lobeck state farm mut.auto.ins,general principles of contract interpretation apply to insurance policies.when construing insurance policies,minnesota courts must consider the policy as a whole,giving effect to all of its provisions.mills,gold medal ins.if the policy language is unambiguous,minnesota courts give that language its plain and ordinary meaning.lobeck,at see hammer investors life ins.of,the court is not free to construe policy language in such a way as to afford coverage or to identify an ambiguity where none exists.our duty is to fastidiously guard against the invitation to create ambiguities where none exist.columbia heights motors,allstate ins,internal quotations and citation omitted.
whether policy language is ambiguous is a question of law for the court.am.commerce ins.brokers.mut.fire cas.under minnesota law,a policy provision is ambiguous if it can reasonably be given more than one meaning on the basis of its language alone.id.extrinsic evidence of the parties subjective intent can not be used to create contractual ambiguity where none exists on the face of the policy.in re hennepin county recycling bond,see also.teamsters pub.law enforcement employees union,local county of louis,writings other than the contract can not be used to create an ambiguity which does not exist in the contract itself.internal marks omitted.ambiguity in an insurance policy is generally construed against the insurer.thommes milwaukee ins.
the orders of both the district court and the bankruptcy court state that erii concedes that the insurance policy provides coverage for the claims brought against m s and the intervenors,except to the extent the policy endorsements exclude coverage of those claims.erii does not dispute coverage on appeal and instead confines its argument to the contention that endorsement excludes coverage of the heritage bond claims.
endorsement provides 
in consideration of the premium charged,this policy does not apply to any claim based on,arising out of,directly or indirectly resulting from,in consequence of,or in any way involving any actual or alleged violation of 
the securities act of,the securities exchange act of,the investment company act of,any other federal law,rule or regulation with respect to the regulation of securities,any rules or regulations of the united states securities and exchange commission,or any amendment of such laws,rules or regulations or 
any state securities or blue sky laws or rules or regulations or any amendment of such laws,rules or regulations or 
any provision of the common law imposing liability in connection with the offer,sale or purchase of securities.
the plain language of endorsement is broad and unqualified.the endorsement not only precludes coverage for claims that allege actual violations of the enumerated federal and state securities laws,it goes further and precludes coverage of any claim based on,arising out of,directly or indirectly resulting from,in consequence of,or in any way involving any actual or alleged violation of those laws.id.nowhere does this contract language limit its applicability to a specific category of securities transaction,or type of offering or offeror.
notwithstanding endorsement unqualified plain language,the bankruptcy court concluded that the provision unambiguously excludes covered actions taken in connection with the sale of miller schroeder securities but not otherwise.erii add.at.the district court adopted the same,qualified and restricted interpretation of the exclusion.in drawing the same conclusion,the two courts did not discuss the text of endorsement in any way.both courts relied,in part,on the deposition testimony of the insurance broker who sold the policy,who testified that this securities exclusion is typically intended to exclude coverage for liability resulting from the insured sale of its own stock.both courts conclusion that the contract is unambiguous and their reliance on the broker deposition testimony are legally incompatible both courts erred by relying on extrinsic evidence of the parties intent in order to create an ambiguity in endorsement.see recycling bond,at observing that extrinsic evidence may not be considered if the relevant contract language is unambiguous murray puls,noting that extrinsic evidence may be considered if ambiguity exists.
both courts also reasoned that their limited interpretation of endorsement is the only interpretation that makes sense because most insureds who purchase d o policies are not engaged in the sale of securities unless they sell their own securities,and,accordingly,endorsement language typically only precludes coverage for liability resulting from an insured sale of its own securities.erii add.at.because the typical effect of endorsement is to preclude coverage resulting from the insured sale of its own the courts reasoning meaning of endorsement in this policy must accord with that typical effect.but the effect of endorsement as it may be generally applied in practice is not the legal authority that governs our coverage inquiry here it is the mutually agreed upon policy plain language that binds m s and erii in the first instance.
both the bankruptcy court and the district court found endorsement to be unambiguous.but instead of applying the plain unambiguous language of the endorsement,both courts looked beyond the plain language and used extrinsic and in our view highly equivocal evidence concerning one purpose among several for which the exclusion is used in the insurance industry to graft a limitation into endorsement that it does not contain.in doing so,the courts below ran afoul of established minnesota law by using extrinsic evidence to construe,rather than directly apply without the aid of extrinsic evidence,language determined to be unambiguous.see am.commerce,at if no ambiguity exists,there is no reason for construction berken beneficial standard life insur,bobich oja,where there is no ambiguity there is no room for construction.see also firemen ins.of newark,viktora,unambiguous language is not subject to application of rules of construction which favor finding coverage.
in the absence of contractual ambiguity,whether policy coverage makes sense as a business matter is largely irrelevant freely contracting actors in the marketplace,particularly sophisticated business entities who rely on experts to advise them,are best suited to determine what makes the most economic sense,and the language they have mutually negotiated and agreed to is the best evidence of what those parties intended.standing alone,endorsement can not be given more than one reasonable meaning on the basis of its plain language.see piper jaffray union fire ins,concluding that a similarly worded exclusion clearly denies coverage to any claim arising out of the ownership or control or management of mutual funds.similarly,endorsement is unambiguous and applies generally to any claim based on or in any way involving an actual or alleged violation of the enumerated securities laws.at emphasis added.the word any when r ead naturally has an expansive meaning.united states gonzales,d.absent an irreconcilable conflict with an independent portion of the contract,endorsement is not limited to claims arising out of m s sale of its own securities.such a limitation is nowhere to be found in its language.
m s and the intervenors contend that endorsement conflicts with endorsements and,and that the resulting contractual ambiguity must be construed against erii.see agency,am.family mut.auto.ins,an insurance contract is ambiguous if there exists an irreconcilable conflict between its terms or provisions.the text of endorsement states that endorsement will not apply to any claim made against an insured person arising out of the offering,sale or purchase of common stock as described more fully in the private placement dated as of may.at.the language of endorsement limits the broad exclusion accomplished by endorsement,ensuring that endorsement does not exclude coverage for liability arising out of the specified may,securities placement.endorsement limitation on the scope of endorsement does not produce a conflict between the two policy exclusions,and endorsement in no way compels the limited reading of endorsement adopted by the courts below.endorsement import is the same regardless of whether endorsement excludes coverage for any violation in accordance with its plain language or if it is construed,as the courts below did,to be limited to coverage for liability arising out of m s sale of its own securities.either way,endorsement ensures that endorsement does not exclude coverage for liability arising out of the specified securities placement.simply stated,endorsement states a specific exception to the broad exclusion contained in endorsement.
whether endorsement and endorsement are reconcilable on the basis of the policy plain language is a more difficult question.endorsement general e o exclusion with management carveback provides 
in consideration of the premium charged 
no coverage will be available under the policy for loss including defense expenses for any claim made against any insured based on,arising out of,directly or indirectly resulting from,in consequence of,or in any way involving an insured actual or alleged rendering or failure to render the following services
