the defendants are three castaways managers.dan shaw was the chairman and chief executive officer of the castaways at the time the plaintiffs were discharged.michael villamor was responsible for handling labor and employment matters at the castaways.and james van woerkom was the castaways chief financial officer.shaw had a percent ownership in the castaways,and villamor had a percent ownership interest.the plaintiffs allege that each defendant had custody or control over the plaintiffs,their employment,or their place of employment at the time that the wages were due.

ii.discussion 
this court reviews de novo dismissals for failure to state a claim under.b.see simon hartford life,cir citation omitted.all allegations of material fact shall be taken as true and construed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.see id.at.
whether managers can be employers under state law 
chapter of the nevada revised statutes provides a statutory scheme for wage protection.an employer shall pay to the employee wages for each hour the employee works.whenever an employer discharges an employee,the wages and compensation earned and unpaid at the time of such discharge shall become due and payable immediately.if an employer fails to pay a within days after the wages or compensation of a discharged employee becomes due the wages or compensation of the employee continues at the same rate from the day he was discharged until paid or for days,whichever is less.
the application of these statutes to the present case depends on whether the defendants were employers under chapter.employer includes every person having control or custody of any employment,place of employment or any employee.whether the defendants as individual managers can be held to be employers under is a question of first impression.neither the nevada supreme court nor the ninth circuit had published an opinion analyzing the definition of employer under nevada revised statutes.because this question has significant implications for nevada wage protection law and because we could not be certain how the nevada supreme court would resolve the matter,we certified the question to the nevada supreme court.see boucher shaw,cir.
the nevada supreme court held that individual managers could not be found liable as employers under chapter.boucher shaw.the court explained that it would not expand the common law definition of employer to include individual managers without a clear expression of legislative intent.at common law,an employment relationship was defined by agency principles,under which,unless otherwise agreed,an agent,a manager for a disclosed principal,the employing company does not become party to the employment contract for the principal debts.id.at.as stated above,the nevada legislature has enacted a statutory definition of employer,but that definition does not unequivocally indicate the legislature intent to depart from the common law rule.id.at.in particular,nevada statutory definition of employer does not include corporate managers,agents or officers in an enumerated list of employers,as is the case in the statutes of other states.instead,the statute ambiguously provides that e mployer includes every person having control or custody of any employment,place of employment or any employee,without defining person,or offering guidance on what constitutes control or custody.in the absence of clear legislative intent,the nevada court refused to presume that the legislature meant to equate individual managers with employers.id.
it follows that the managers in the present case can not be held personally liable as employers under chapter.the plaintiffs state law claims were properly dismissed.because the union is a plaintiff only with respect to the state law claim,the issue of the union standing is moot and we do not reach it.
whether managers can be employers under the flsa 
the only remaining claim seeks unpaid wages under the flsa.ballard is the only named plaintiff who has sued under the flsa.the flsa provides that e very employer shall pay to each of his employees who in any workweek is engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce,or is employed in an enterprise engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce,a minimum wage.a.any employer who violates the provisions of section or section of this title shall be liable to the employee or employees affected in the amount of their unpaid minimum wages,or their unpaid overtime compensation,as the case may be,and in an additional equal amount as liquidated damages.b.ballard alleges that the castaways managers are individually liable for unpaid wages as employers under the flsa.the flsa defines employer as any person acting directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer in relation to an employee d.
we have held that the definition of employer under the flsa is not limited by the common law concept of employer,but is to be given an expansive interpretation in order to effectuate the flsa broad remedial purposes.lambert ackerley,cir en
