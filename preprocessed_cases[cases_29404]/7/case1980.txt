this case involves a scheme to use electronic billboards and kiosks collectively kiosks for advertising.the promoters of the executed it in the following way.first,they organized optical technologies,and a group of affiliated companies,recomm international display,recomm operations,and recomm enterprises,hereafter referred to collectively with optical technologies,as recomm recomm,in turn,convinced several advertising agencies of the merits of advertising via kiosks,and convinced pharmacists,veterinarians,optometrists,and others of the profits they would earn by locating the kiosks at their places of business.having accomplished this,recomm acquired the necessary kiosks,leased them to the pharmacists and others the lessees,assigned the leases to finance companies the lessors and entered into advertising contracts with the lessees.these contracts provided that the lessees would receive a stated percentage of the fees recomm received from the advertising agencies.recomm,the lessees,and the lessors contemplated that the lessees share of the advertising fees would more than cover the lessees lease payments.
the scheme worked for the benefit of all parties for a few years,until,when recomm began to experience problems and ceased remitting to the lessees their portions of the advertising fees.the lessees responded in two ways.first,they quit paying the lessors the rent due on the kiosk leases then,they sued recomm.as the law suits multiplied,recomm turned to the bankruptcy court for relief.in january,recomm filed a chapter in the bankruptcy court for the middle district of florida 
while reorganization efforts proceeded,recomm business was carried on,made possible in part by contributions from some of the lessors,including finova capital corporation finova,the appellee in this case.over the course of the bankruptcy litigation,several reorganization plans were proposed.only the third and fourth plans are relevant here.
the bankruptcy court balked at the third the third amended joint plan of reorganization of the debtors third amended plan after discovering that recomm essentially had no assets of any value because the kiosk network had remained in the hands of recomm affiliates that had not filed for bankruptcy.the proponents of the plan argued that there had been a de facto merger between recomm and these affiliates,but this did not satisfy the court.it refused to confirm the third amended plan see in re optical.
in january,just a month after the bankruptcy court denied confirmation of the third amended plan,the remaining recomm international corporation,recomm international display corporation,and recomm international display,rid also filed for bankruptcy.all of the recomm cases were thereafter consolidated.see in re optical.with no questions lingering about whether the primary assets were actually part of the bankruptcy estate,a fourth amended plan of reorganization of the debtors fourth amended plan or plan soon evolved.although the lessees did not receive a copy of the plan itself,they were served with a summary of the plan,which highlighted differences from the third amended plan they also were served with an order modifying schedule of confirmation related dates,which set a confirmation hearing for april.the lessees did not appear at the hearing,but attorneys for the committee of unsecured creditors did appear and approved the fourth amended plan.the bankruptcy court confirmed the plan on may.
sometime later,after the confirmation order became final and nonappealable,finova sent statements of revised lease terms and options under fourth amended plan the statements to the lessees whose leases it held as recomm assignee.finova claimed that the statements reflected its understanding of the new lease terms as modified by the fourth amended plan.taking a less charitable view,these lessees,the appellants here,claimed that the effect of the statements was unilaterally to revive and to extend leases between entities pursuant to terms which finova propounded only after the confirmation order appeal period had expired.appellants br.seeking to enforce the terms outlined in these statements,finova initiated an adversary proceeding against each finova lessee in the bankruptcy court,essentially asking the court to declare that the plan modified their leases and that the statements comported with the plan.
in the adversary proceedings,some of these lessees,responding to finova prayer for relief,claimed that their leases with rid had expired before rid filed for bankruptcy,reasoning that the fourth amended plan could not have modified a lease that was no longer in effect.the bankruptcy court adopted this logic without reservation or elaboration,concluding with regard to appellant lokensgard expired lease,for example f rom this follows the obvious,that there was no longer a live lease,which could have been modified.the court reached similar conclusions respecting the expired leases of appellants groveport,falk woodland,and larson.
some of the finova lessees with expired leases also had leases that were still in effect at the time rid filed for chapter relief.they and the remaining finova lessees claimed that they were not afforded sufficient notice that their leases would be modified by the fourth amended plan and that the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction to enforce such a modification as the leases were exclusively between nondebtor parties.once again,the bankruptcy court held for the lessees.regarding appellant lokensgard unexpired lease,the court explained 
this court has serious misgivings to accept the proposition that this court has the power and jurisdiction to modify leases between notwithstanding the order of confirmation,which was not appealed.be as it may,this court is constrained to reject the proposition that these lessees,who never filed a proof of claim,who never participated in the chapter case of recomm,were given a meaningful opportunity to make an intelligent judgment to agree or not to agree to be a participating lessee.
for its part,finova argued that the confirmation order was res judicata,barring reevaluation of the bankruptcy court subject matter jurisdiction to enter the confirmation order,and also that the lessees were estopped from raising affirmative defenses in the first place.the confirmation order provided for a release and waiver of claims and defenses by the lessees against the lessors,and,moreover,enjoined the lessees from prosecuting any claims against the lessors.
the court rejected finova argument,essentially concluding that the waiver question was coterminous with the notice question,presumably under the theory that if the lessees lacked sufficient notice that their leases were being modified,they also lacked sufficient notice to be bound by any of the other provisions of the fourth amended plan or the confirmation order.the court also rejected the res judicata argument.without addressing it explicitly,the court held that it had the power and the ongoing obligation to evaluate its own jurisdiction even if the parties did not raise the issue.the court granted summary judgment for the lessees,rejecting the lease modifications.see finova capital m j lokensgard,in re optical,pro,slip op,see also finova capital martin in re optical,pro,slip op.june,finova capital cofield in re optical,pro,slip op,finova capital falk woodland pharmacy,in re optical,pro,slip op,finova capital alpha veterinary clinic,in re optical,pro,slip op,finova capital bushey drug,in re optical,pro,slip op,finova capital larson pharmacy,in re optical,pro,slip op.
finova appealed,and the district court reversed.it first determined that the confirmation order was res it had become final and none of the lessees had the lessees defenses in finova adversary proceedings collateral attacks on the confirmation order.as a result,it also held that the bankruptcy court was not authorized to review its subject matter jurisdiction de novo,holding instead that the confirmation order could be voided only where there is a plain usurpation of power,when a court wrongly extends its jurisdiction beyond the scope of its authority.finova capital larson pharmacy,tbm,slip op.at,quotation marks and citations omitted.finding no such usurpation and rejecting the lessees due process and expired lease arguments,the district court refused to void the confirmation order.it held that the fourth amended plan and the lease modifications it contained were binding on the lessees.the lessees now appeal the district court judgment.
in the bankruptcy context,this court sits as a second court of review and thus examines independently the factual and legal determinations of the bankruptcy court and employs the same standards of review as the district court.in re issac leaseco,cir quotation marks and citation omitted.generally,we review legal conclusions by either the bankruptcy court or the district court de novo.in re financial federated title trust,cir.we review the bankruptcy court findings of fact for clear error.id.at.
in considering the bankruptcy court interpretation of the effect of its own order,we apply a different standard of review.while we have not definitively articulated that standard,we have said that we are reluctant to disturb a bankruptcy court judgment interpreting its own earlier order,and that the bankruptcy judge who has presided over a case from its inception is in the best position to clarify any apparent inconsistencies in the court rulings.in re ranch house of,cir.
the other circuits that have considered this question have uniformly agreed that our reluctan ce to disturb a bankruptcy court judgment in this context is akin to the reluctance we exhibit when exercising abuse of discretion review.see in re consolidated indus,cir we will not reverse a bankruptcy court interpretation of its own order unless it is a clear abuse of discretion,because a court that issued an order is in the best position to interpret it.in re dial business forms,cir adopting abuse of discretion review and collecting cases from the second,fifth,and sixth circuits that have done the same.we adopt this view.accordingly,will defer to the bankruptcy court interpretation of its order confirming the fourth amended plan,unless it clearly abused its discretion.
appellants now argue that the fourth amended plan on its face did not modify their leases with finova,that the bankruptcy court rulings effectively decided as much,and that,in the alternative,the bankruptcy court could not have intended that its confirmation order provide the result finova seeks because it lacked jurisdiction to effect such a result.
to address these arguments,we proceed as follows.first,we determine whether and to what extent res judicata applies to the bankruptcy court confirmation order.to the extent that it does,any unambiguous provision of that order must be enforced.second,we address whether the provisions of the confirmed plan modify the leases at issue.finally,we turn to whether the bankruptcy court confirmation order or parts thereof are void due to a plain usurpation of power.
it is established law that a confirmation order satisfies the requirements of a judgment that can be given preclusive effect.in re justice oaks ii,cir.we set forth the requisites of claim preclusion in justice oaks as follows 
first,the prior judgment must be valid in that it was rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction and in accordance with the requirements of due process.second,the judgment must be final and on the merits.third,there must be identity of both parties or their privies.fourth,the later proceeding must involve the same cause of action as involved in the earlier proceeding.
id.at citations omitted.although appellants stress that this case is not really about res judicata,but the interpretation of the which they are quite do challenge the res judicata effect of the confirmation order on the basis of the first two res judicata prongs enumerated above.what they are really contending,however,is that no final,nonappealable order has yet been entered that definitively holds the provisions of the fourth amended plan to mean what finova says they mean.appellants suggest in their argument on the first res judicata prong,for example,that the bankruptcy court recognized the injustice that would be perpetrated by granting finova requested declaration,allowing terms to sneak into a confirmed plan via the statements after the time to appeal had run.appellants br.addressing the second prong,requiring a final judgment on the merits,appellants similarly argue that the substantive issue of whether the leases as modified by the statements are valid and enforceable,or whether they are even consistent with the confirmation order has never been litigated.appellants br.
these are not res judicata arguments.the first argument is simply an assertion of the very thing appellants must establish to prevail namely,that the statements issued by finova are at odds with the language of the fourth amended plan.the second argument is a reassertion that it is not a question of res judicata,but the same interpretation issue that is central to the resolution of this proceeding.as such,we take appellants at their word when they admonish us that they do not wish to relitigate what was determined in the confirmation order.appellants br.the confirmation order and the provisions of the fourth amended plan are therefore res judicata what remains for us to determine is what they mean.
we begin our analysis of the interpretation question by briefly observing what res judicata bars appellants from claiming.appellants were scheduled as creditors of a bankrupt and were served with copies of the third amended plan,summaries of the fourth amended plan,and copies of the disclosure statement.this satisfies the notice requirement for bankruptcy purposes.see in re williamson,cir section makes actual notice sufficient to impose a on the creditor.quoting in re alton,cir.thus,save for the question of voidability of the judgment,the confirmation order addressed can not raise objections to the actual terms of the fourth amended plan or the confirmation order,as these were deemed waived when they failed to object to confirmation.justice oaks,at holding that any claims that were actually made,or could have been made in an objection to confirmation are barred from relitigation in collateral proceedings.appellants seem to understand this,conceding as they must,for example,that it is beyond debate that the chapter plan modified certain of the rights between the debtors and certain of their creditors.appellants br.to state things in proverbial terms,however,appellants appear to have tried to cloak a number of wolves in sheep clothing.
pointing to isolated definitions of various terms in the fourth amended plan and engaging in strained statutory wordplay,appellants advance numerous theories culminating in their desired conclusion that the plan and confirmation order could not bind them in the manner that finova suggests.the basic logic is as follows 
the plan says x about y 
the definition or statute that discusses y does not explicitly embrace x 
therefore,the plan must actually mean something other than x about 
appellants evaluate the definition of claim under the plan,for example,and determine that its definition precludes plan terms that would bind creditors each other.appellants br.they find statutory support for this proposition from a,which they read to bind any debtor,and any creditor,but not,by implication,one creditor to another.appellants br.they evaluate and conclude that it does not contemplate readjustment of relations.appellants br.they conclude that the confirmation order,because it does not expressly cover the terms that finova now seeks to have enforced,must not have contemplated such terms.appellants br.
if the provisions of the plan and confirmation order unambiguously modify the leases as finova suggests,these arguments either are impermissible collateral attacks barred by res judicata or merge with the jurisdictional argument we take up below.we turn,now,to appellants two interpretation arguments first,that the bankruptcy court holdings in the adversary proceedings on summary judgment constitute interpretations of its confirmation order and are thus due abuse of discretion deference and second,that,in any event,the terms of the plan and confirmation order are inconsistent with finova statements reflecting the purportedly modified leases.
appellants argue that the bankruptcy court was unable to declare that the plan and confirmation order did what finova says they did.appellants br.the district court erred in reversing the bankruptcy court,they continue,because the bankruptcy judge is in the best position to interpret the confirmation order.thus,they argue,the district court should have limited its review to abuse of discretion.appellants br.citing ranch house,at.
it is true,as we discuss supra,that a bankruptcy court interpretation of its own prior order is entitled to substantial deference.the proposition advanced by appellants,however,appears to sweep much more broadly than this,and to insulate all aspects of the bankruptcy court opinion from anything more searching than abuse of discretion review.the rationale for deferring to a court interpretation of its own order does not extend to its analysis of broad legal principles,and we decline to afford additional deference in this area.other courts have reached similar conclusions.in re vms sec,cir abuse of discretion is the proper standard of review when a district court interprets its own order nonetheless,in applying the abuse of discretion standard,we do not give equal deference to every aspect of a court decision.the abuse of discretion standard is used to evaluate the court application of the facts to the appropriate legal standard,and the factual findings and legal conclusions underlying such decisions are evaluated under the clearly erroneous and de novo standards,respect ively.quotation marks and citations omitted.we must therefore distinguish between those parts of the bankruptcy court statements that interpret the confirmation order and those that merely analyze legal issues or constitute findings of fact.
although the bankruptcy court separately considered each appellant motion for summary judgment,it essentially reached two holdings regarding the plan and the confirmation order and then applied one or both of these holdings to each motion as warranted.as discussed supra,the court first decided that certain leases were not modified because they had expired before rid filed for bankruptcy.second,it decided that the remaining leases could not be modified because of notice and jurisdiction problems.to analyze the court reasoning on both these scores,we examine its holding on appellant larson motion for summary judgment,which concerned one lease of each type,expired and unexpired.
the court began by observing that larson first lease expired prior to the time rid filed for bankruptcy.it then asserted simply,from this follows the obvious there was no longer a live lease,which could have been modified.the court provided some additional analysis in its discussion of appellant cofield expired lease,emphasizing that the lease had never been assumed by rid in the bankruptcy pursuant to the requirements of these are all legal conclusions the bankruptcy court did not state that it was interpreting the plan or the confirmation order.thus,the proper scope of the district court and this de novo.
the district court held that w hile arguably the bankruptcy court should not have confirmed a plan that purported to modify leases that expired prior to rid filing for bankruptcy,the fact of the matter is that under the terms of the plan,the plan applies to leases that expired before rid filed for bankruptcy.finova,slip op.at.
we agree with this conclusion.the plan,in the section relating to the modification of leases indicates that the present value taken into account for determining new lease terms shall be determined as of december,based upon a discount rate of six percent.plan,emphasis added.thus,for purposes of determining whether the plan purports to modify leases that had expired before rid filed for bankruptcy,this provision suffices to show that any lease that was still in effect as of december,is covered by the plan.thus,as a matter of interpreting the plan,it is of no moment that there was no longer a live lease at the time of confirmation that could have been modified.these terms are plain on their face,and any objection to them could have been raised by appellants at the time of confirmation.
turning to larson unexpired lease,the bankruptcy court again refused to enforce the modifications advanced by finova 
this court has serious misgivings to accept the proposition that this court has the power and jurisdiction to modify leases between notwithstanding the order of confirmation,which was not appealed.be as it may,this court is constrained to reject the proposition that larson,who never filed a proof of claim,who never participated in the chapter case of recomm,was given a meaningful opportunity to make an intelligent judgment to agree or not to agree to be a participating lessee.
without further analysis,the court granted larson motion for summary judgment.
the district court again reversed.it addressed this part of the bankruptcy court decision in its discussion of due process and notice.although the district court did not expressly address the question whether the plan provisions purport to modify the unexpired leases,its discussion indicates that it thought as much the third and fourth amended plans contained the formulas for determining the effect of the lease modifications.finova,slip op.at.the district court also rejected the notion that the plan might apply to some parties,but not to appellants 
while the third and fourth amended plan do not refer to appellees,appellants here by name and address,the plans clearly applied to participating lessees,appellants here and that term was sufficiently defined in the plans to put appellees on notice that they were considered participating lessees under the plan.
again,we agree with the district court.even before turning to the plan terms,we note that it is evident from the bankruptcy court own language that it,too,understood the plan,by its terms,to modify the unexpired leases.otherwise,its use of the phrases notwithstanding the order of confirmation and this court is constrained to reject the proposition that larson was given a meaningful opportunity to agree to be a participating lessee would be both unnecessary and out of place.also telling is that the bankruptcy court did not point to any provision of the plan or the confirmation order that,by its terms,would somehow exempt or exclude larson from its scope.in short,the bankruptcy court appears to have been fretting that it had opened pandora box,not denying that it had done so 
that albeit implicit interpretation is entitled to abuse of discretion review.it also accords with the district court reading of the plan provisions,which provide that a participating lessee means a lessee who is a party to a lease with a participating lessor and a guarantor with respect to such lease.plan.the participating lessor is defined as a lessor that 
a is a lender as of may,b elects on or before may,to participate in the plan and i is a proponent of the plan or ii is identified on exhibit b hereto as a participating lessor 
plan.lest anything be left to doubt,the first entity listed as a participating lessor in exhibit b of the plan is finova.plan,exh.b.in short,there is no ambiguity with which to wrestle here.even appellants seem to concede that they are contemplated by these terms of the plan there can be no question that the lessees in the instant appeal are lessees of lessors as defined in the plan.appellants br.the bankruptcy court and the district court correctly concluded that the terms of the plan embrace appellants and their leases with finova.the plan therefore modifies the expired and part or all of the confirmation order must be voided.
in ruling on appellant cofield motion for summary judgment,the bankruptcy court announced that it was satisfied that it has the authority to constantly review its subject matter jurisdiction at every step in a case or proceeding.it did review its subject matter jurisdiction in granting summary judgment to appellants lokensgard,larson,and bushey drug,
