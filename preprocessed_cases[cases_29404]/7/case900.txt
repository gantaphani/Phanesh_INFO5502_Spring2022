bernard francis schultz and elizabeth mary sabatine hereinafter the schultzes,husband and wife and residents of hamilton county,tennessee,filed for bankruptcy under chapter in the united states bankruptcy court for the eastern district of tennessee.independently,the schultzes filed a complaint for declaratory judgment in the united states district court for the eastern district of tennessee,alleging that the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of bapcpa or the act violates article i,section,clause of the constitution the bankruptcy clause,which gives congress the power to establish uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies throughout the united states.const,cl.emphasis added.the district court granted the government motion for summary judgment and dismissed the schultzes complaint.for the following reasons,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
individual consumer debtors generally choose between two forms of relief afforded by the bankruptcy code chapter and chapter in a chapter proceeding,an individual debtor receives an immediate unconditional discharge of personal liabilities for debts in exchange for the liquidation of all assets.see.by contrast,in a chapter proceeding,a debtor commits to repayment of a portion of his or her financial obligations over a specified period of time generally three to five years in exchange for retaining assets and receiving a broader discharge of debt than is available under chapter.see.under the bankruptcy system prior to the bapcpa,stat.codified as amended in scattered sections of title of the united states code,debtors had a presumption of eligibility to file under chapter,with the final determination made by the bankruptcy court on an individualized basis.
in,the landscape for bankruptcy filings dramatically changed.responding to a growing belief that bankruptcy relief may be too readily available and is sometimes used as a first resort,rather than a last resort,i,at,and the prevalence of opportunistic personal filings and abuse,id.at,congress enacted the bapcpa in order to require income debtors to make more funds available for the payment of unsecured creditors.as a result,debtors with the ability to repay a substantial portion of their debts without significant hardship are now required to do so by filing under chapter rather than chapter.
the centerpiece of the act is the imposition of a means test for chapter filers,which requires debtors to demonstrate financial eligibility to avoid the presumption that their bankruptcy filing is an abuse of the bankruptcy proceedings.by its terms,the bapcpa authorizes a bankruptcy court to dismiss a debtor petition filed under chapter or,with the debtor consent,to convert such a petition to chapter if it finds that the granting of relief would be an abuse of the provisions of chapter.b.under this test,the first step instructs the bankruptcy court to compare the debtor annualized current monthly income to the median family income of a similarly sized family in the debtor state of residence.if the debtor current monthly income is equal to or below the median,then the presumption of abuse does not arise.b.if,however,it exceeds the median,the act directs the court to recalculate the debtor income by deducting certain necessary expenses specified by the statute.id.b a ii.these reductions are derived from the national and local standards contained in the internal revenue service financial analysis handbook.see internal revenue,internal revenue manual,financial analysis handbook irs handbook,available at.
because of these deductions,eligibility under the new regime is calculated at least in part based on the state and county where the debtor resides.the housing expense deduction,for example,is governed by the county where the debtor resides.id.a although the national standards,which identify amounts for food,housekeeping supplies,apparel and services,and personal care products and services,and a fixed miscellaneous amount,id,are mostly uniform throughout the united states,the local standards,which define amounts for housing and transportation,vary greatly.
if after deducting these necessary expenses and specified amounts,the debtor current monthly income exceeds certain mathematical benchmarks,then the presumption of abuse arises.b a i.this presumption may be rebutted only if the debtor demonstrates special circumstances justifying any additional expenses or adjustments to the debtor income for which there is no reasonable alternative,and that those special circumstances reduce the debtor income below the specified benchmarks.id.b b.and even if the presumption of abuse does not apply,or has been rebutted by the debtor,the bapcpa empowers a bankruptcy court to consider whether it believes the debtor filed the petition in bad faith,or whether the totality of the circumstances of the debtor financial situation demonstrates abuse.id.b.
to implement and enforce these reforms,the united states trustee or the bankruptcy administrator reviews a chapter debtor petition and files with the court a statement explaining whether a presumption of abuse arises.id.b.if the trustee determines that it does,then the trustee is directed either to file a motion to dismiss,a motion to convert the petition,or to provide a statement explaining why such a motion is inappropriate.id.b.
the bapcpa also amended two aspects of chapter.first,disposable income is now defined as currently monthly income received by the debtor less amounts reasonably needed to be expended.b.if a debtor annualized monthly income exceeds the median family income for a similarly sized family in the applicable state,the act requires the bankruptcy court to calculate amounts reasonably necessary to be expended in accordance with the same irs handbook national and local standards used in chapter.id.b.if a debtor is below the median income,the amounts reasonably necessary to be expended are instead determined as they were the bankruptcy court assessing whether the expenses listed by the debtor in schedule j which must be filed along with the bankruptcy petition are reasonably necessary for the debtor maintenance and support.id.b.second,if the debtor income still exceeds the median after recalculation,the act imposes an applicable commitment period of not less than years.id.b a ii.however,if the debtor annualized income is less than the median,then the applicable commitment period is three years.id.b a i.
on november,the schultzes filed for bankruptcy under chapter in the united states bankruptcy court for the eastern district of tennessee.on january,the bankruptcy court confirmed their plan,which required payment for sixty months and resulted in a distribution to unsecured creditors of less than of their allowed claims.
concurrently,the schultzes brought a separate suit against the united states,which challenges the five sections of the bapcpa that employ the means test sections b,b,b,b,and b under one central theory because calculations are based,at least in part,on the state and county in which the debtor resides,the bapcpa is not a uniform law on the subject of bankruptcies throughout the united states.const,cl.emphasis added.
at the time of their chapter filing,the schultzes had an annualized current monthly income of,an amount that is above the median family income for a family of five for tennessee residents which is,but below the median family income of connecticut,hawaii,massachusetts,maryland,new hampshire,and new jersey as a result of this benchmark in tennessee,the schultzes applicable commitment period was five,rather than three,years,and in calculating their disposable income they were limited to the expense deductions set forth in sections b a and b.b.
after the parties filed for summary judgment,the district court granted the government motion and dismissed the schultzes complaint.canvassing relevant supreme court precedent,the district court concluded that the uniformity requirement does not proscribe different results in different states because of state law variations.schultz united states.in response to the schultzes argument that the bapcpa amendments are unconstitutional because they create variations in different states based on federal instead of state law,the district court explained that there is no principled reason for concluding that variations resulting from federal statistics create unconstitutional,whereas variations resulting from state law do not.id.the court concluded that d isposable income might vary from place to place,but it is based on uniformly calculated national statistics.the variations in the results produced by these statistics are of no constitutional consequence.id.at.

ii.analysis 
as a threshold matter,we address briefly the government contention that the schultzes lack standing to challenge two bapcpa provisions affecting chapter bankruptcy filings sections b and b.we review de novo the question of standing,sandusky county democratic party blackwell,cir,even where standing has erroneously been assumed below,adarand constructors,mineta,d a plaintiff has article iii standing when he or she can show an that was fairly traceable to the defendant allegedly unlawful conduct and is likely to be redressed via a favorable decision.prime media,city of brentwood,cir quoting lujan defenders of wildlife,d.the only question in dispute is whether the schultzes have shown an,or an invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized,and b actual or imminent,lujan,at.citations omitted,by the two sections intended for chapter debtors.in applying the first requirement of a concrete injury,the supreme court made clear that a plaintiff is not entitled to injunctive or declaratory relief a bsent a sufficient likelihood that he will again be wronged in a similar way,city of los angeles lyons,d,unless the plaintiff is subject to continuing,present adverse effects,littleton,d.
the problem,as the government sees it,is that the schultzes never filed a chapter bankruptcy petition,nor do they intend to do so in the future.although the schultzes have shown that their income is above the applicable median family income for tennessee,potentially subjecting them to the challenged chapter provisions,they have not established that they would be exposed to the presumption of abuse after their monthly income is reduced by allowable expenses specified by the statute.see b.the schultzes,in turn,argue that the potential for being subject to the presumption of abuse under chapter forced them into filing under chapter.and requiring a debtor to file a chapter petition with full knowledge that it would be dismissed subjects the debtor to years of litigation while his bankruptcy case,and financial situation,remain in limbo.
the questions of whether the schultzes were deterred from filing a chapter petition,and whether the presumption of abuse would have applied after the appropriate reductions and calculations,are irrelevant for one simple reason the parties concede that the schultzes have standing to challenge the chapter b and which use the same median income levels and varying local standards as the chapter amendments.based on their median family income calculation in tennessee,the schultzes are currently repaying debt under a chapter plan,and receive less favorable treatment in their plan than individuals in other states.moreover,their housing and transportation expenses were determined by reference to the irs handbook,which varies by locality.
because our resolution of the schultzes chapter challenges effectively addresses the identical claims for the chapter provisions,without regard to whether they have standing to challenge those provisions,we find no need to resolve this issue.to put it simply,we could not invalidate some of the means test provisions without invalidating the others.
we turn to the central issue in this case is the bapcpa a uniform law on the subject of bankruptcy the bankruptcy clause of the constitution grants congress the power to establish uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies throughout the united states.const.art.i,cl.what distinguishes these peculiar terms from the other article i powers is the concept of uniformity,which,as chief justice marshall noted nearly two centuries ago,deserve s notice.congress is not authorized merely to pass laws,the operation of which shall be uniform,but instead to establish uniform laws on the subject throughout the united states.sturges crowinshield,wheat.
echoing justice marshall concern that the concept of uniformity is,perhaps,incompatible with state legislation,the schultzes contend that the classification scheme adopted by congress based upon whether a debtor is above or below the median income of his particular state of residence violates the bankruptcy clause because it results in some debtors receiving different bankruptcy relief under federal law based solely upon the state or county in which they happen to reside.appellants br.implicit in their argument is what the supreme court has referred to as personal uniformity,or the notion that the bankruptcy laws should apply identically to individual debtors,regardless of the state or locality in which the debtor resides.the court,however,has consistently described the bankruptcy clause uniformity requirement as geographical,and not personal,hanover bank moyses,which is wholly satisfied when existing obligations of a debtor are treated alike by the bankruptcy administration throughout the country regardless of the state in which the bankruptcy court sits,vanston bondholders protective comm.green.frankfurter,concurring.
over the last century,the supreme court has wrestled with the notion of geographic uniformity,ultimately concluding that it allows different effects in various states due to dissimilarities in state law,so long as the federal law applies uniformly among classes of debtors.in moyses,one of the first cases dealing with the validity of a bankruptcy statute,the court upheld the incorporation of varying state exemptions into the bankruptcy act.at.geographic uniformity in this context,the court observed,was satisfied when the trustee takes in each state whatever would have been available if the bankrupt law had not been passed.the general operation of the law is uniform although it may result in certain particulars differently in different states.id.at.in,the court reaffirmed the moyses principle in a case involving the bankruptcy act incorporation of varying state fraudulent conveyance statutes,despite the fact that the laws may lead to different results in different states.stellwagen clum.see also vanston,at.explaining that the bankruptcy clause does not mean wiping out the differences among the states and holding that state tort and contract law may determine the validity of creditors claims.
nearly sixty years later,the supreme court,applying moyses,held that congress may enact laws to deal with geographically isolated problems as long as the law operates uniformly upon a given class of creditors and debtors.blanchette connecticut general ins,d.in blanchette,the court considered the constitutionality of the regional rail reorganization act rail act,which operated only in a single statutorily defined region the northeast united states.in explaining why such a specific statute did not exceed congress power under article i,the court noted that at the time congress passed the rail act,all of the railroads then operating under the bankruptcy laws were contained within the northeast region,and thus,even had the statute been drafted to be of general applicability,its operation and effect would have been unchanged.id.at.the court ultimately concluded that the uniformity provision does not deny congress power to take into account differences that exist between different parts of the country,and to fashion legislation to resolve geographically isolated problems,id.at,so long as the law appl ied equally to all creditors and debtors,id.at.see also leidigh carriage stengel,cir holding that the bankruptcy clause imposes no limitation upon congress as to the classification of persons who are to be affected by such laws,provided only the laws shall have uniform operation.
only once has the court struck down a statute as.in railway labor executives ass gibbons,d,the court determined that congress overstepped its authority in passing a private bankruptcy law that affected only the employees of a single company,the rock island pacific railroad company.while acknowledging that the uniformity requirement is not a straightjacket that forbids congress to distinguish among classes of debtors,id.at,the court found that the act was a response to the problems caused by the bankruptcy of one railroad and was therefore nothing more than a private bill,id.at.the court documented the chaos created by discriminatory state legislation during the articles of confederation,and concluded that the uniformity requirement was drafted in order to prohibit congress from enacting private bankruptcy laws.id.at.the lesson,in short,is that t o survive scrutiny under the bankruptcy clause,a law must at least apply uniformly to a defined class of debtors.id.at.
applying these principles to the instant case,we conclude that the bapcpa is a constitutionally uniform law.congress is allowed to distinguish among classes of debtors,and to treat categories of debtors differently,whether it be through the incorporation of varying state laws affecting dower,exemptions,the validity of mortgages,priorities of payment and the like.stellwagen,at.and this is precisely what the bapcpa does sections b,b,and b distinguish between two classes of debtors,those whose annualized current monthly income is above the family median income for the applicable state and those whose income is below.all chapter debtors have only a instead of a applicable commitment period,and are subject to more favorable treatment in calculating their disposable income than all debtors above the median all debtors are subject to an applicable commitment period of not less than years,and have their income recalculated in accordance with the irs handbook national and local standards.yes,the schultzes may receive less favorable treatment simply because they are residents of tennessee,a state whose median monthly income is lower than a host of others,but the same could be said of debtors living in states with less favorable state property exemption laws.see moyses,at.accordingly,t he general operation of the law is uniform although it may result in certain particulars differently in different states.moyses,at.
had congress described the means test in explicit geographic terms,by enacting legislation exempting residents of certain states without justification,we would be faced with a significantly different case.in angelo victoria farms,cir,for instance,the ninth circuit considered whether a statutory amendment extending the deadline for two states to implement an administrative program violated the uniformity provision of the bankruptcy clause.the bankruptcy judges,united states trustees,and family farmer bankruptcy act of,stat,permanently established the united states trustee program,an administrative agency responsible for overseeing the administration of bankruptcy cases and private trustees.congress curiously chose to phase the program in over a period for every state except north carolina and alabama,who instead had the option of voting into the trustee program over an extended period of time.several years later,in section of the judicial improvements act of,stat,congress extended the deadline for north carolina and alabama to implement the program to october,without any corresponding explanation for the special treatment.angelo,at.
finding that the exemption was not a provision which has different effects due to differences in the laws of these two states,id.at,and that congress did not provide any indication that the exemption in question was intended to deal with a problem specific to north carolina and alabama,the ninth circuit concluded that the law did not apply uniformly to a defined class of debtors,id.at.
but there are key differences between the bapcpa and the statute in angelo.for one,as we have already noted,the bapcpa is uniform in form all debtors whose income is above the median family income are treated alike,as are all debtors whose income falls below.the resulting differences based on the state in which the debtor resides are analytically indistinguishable from the differences resulting from the incorporation of various state laws.for another,whereas in angelo there was no indication that congress intended for the exemption to deal with a problem specific to north carolina and alabama,the bapcpa directly addresses regionally isolated problems.because debtors in certain parts of the country are likely to pay more for housing than debtors in other parts,congress believed that the means bankruptcy relief could gauge varying costs of living,and thus ensure that debtors repay creditors the maximum they can afford.i,at.the bankruptcy clause does not deny congress power to take into account differences that exist between different parts of the country,and to fashion legislation to resolve geographically isolated problems,blanchette,at,and it is not for us as an appellate court to pass judgment on the wisdom of congressional legislation.
the schultzes next argue that the uniformity requirement was enacted in response to the fear that the national government would use its power over commerce to the disadvantage of particular states.appellants br.amicus br.accordingly,even if a federal bankruptcy law may vary in application from state to state,employing federal income standards enables the preferential treatment of debtors in some states over debtors in other states,a form of discriminatory treatment the framers explicitly prohibited.we do not find their argument or their view of history compelling.
first,supreme court precedent lends no support to the federal versus state distinction.moyses,stellwagen,and blanchette can not be read as standing for anything more than their precise holding that congress does not exceed its constitutional powers in enacting a bankruptcy law that permits variations based on state law or to solve geographically isolated problems.although the supreme court has not specifically addressed classifications based on federal law such as those in the bapcpa,we find no reasoning within the relevant case law explaining why employing federal variations somehow makes a bankruptcy law.the lesson of moyses and its congress may permissibly address regional apply equally to variations based on either state laws or federal statistics.
and gibbons does not counsel a different result.there,the court struck down a federal bankruptcy law as violative of the uniformity provision on the ground that the act was a law designed for and applied to only one bankrupt railroad.at.the bapcpa,in contrast,is uniformly applicable across the nation and does not target any isolated entity.
true,the court has recognized that the bankruptcy clause itself contains an affirmative limitation or restriction upon congress power.gibbons,at.but a strict reading of this statement overlooks the flexibility inherent in the constitutional provision,blanchette,at,and improperly cabins the reach of congress authority.it is worth noting that in every case considering the scope of the clause,the court merely assumed that the term uniform implied an affirmative restriction,and ultimately concluded that such a restriction could be satisfied by a law that is uniform only in form.
nor does the original understanding of the bankruptcy clause support the federal versus state distinction that the schultzes urge us to adopt.we need not belabor the point,as a historical account of the bankruptcy clause has been recounted numerous times,including once recently by this circuit.see in re hood,cir,aff on other grounds,tennessee student assistance hood,d.it suffices to say the following the bankruptcy clause emerged amidst a depressed economy,collapsing business ventures,and the prospect of commercial warfare between the various states.to combat mounting debt crises in the newly confederated america,states enacted an ignoble array of legislative schemes discharging the d
