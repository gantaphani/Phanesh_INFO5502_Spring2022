in the chapter bankruptcy proceeding of computer learning centers,clc,the bankruptcy court entered an order dated august,awarding interim fees to the trustee and trustee counsel,as well as to the accountants.the awards were made for the period that ended at the time the trustee resigned because of a conflict of interest and a successor trustee was appointed.by order dated january,the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court order.
the former trustee and trustee counsel have now appealed the district court order to this court,raising issues about the amount of the fees awarded.we conclude,however,that the bankruptcy court order was not a final order under a and that,therefore,the district court order was not a final order in the bankruptcy case that is reviewable by this court under d.accordingly,we dismiss this appeal without reviewing the merits of the questions raised and remand with instructions to the district court to vacate its january,order for lack of jurisdiction.
clc formerly operated a computer training school with students and employees at locations nationwide.when clc filed a voluntary petition under chapter of the bankruptcy code in january,the bankruptcy court appointed jason gold as chapter trustee.with the bankruptcy court permission,trustee gold then employed his law firm,gold,morrison laughlin gm l,as trustee counsel.when,in april,gm l merged into wiley,rein fielding llp,conflicts of interest arose for gold,and accordingly he resigned as trustee in july.
during his tenure as trustee,gold enjoyed substantial success in increasing the value of clc estate.through special counsel retained by him,gold was able to negotiate with the united states department of education for its unencumbering of certain clc assets that had become tainted due to clc unfulfilled liabilities to the federal government.he was then able to generate approximately million in proceeds from the disposal of those assets.in addition,gold operated clc collection division for months,collecting million of the approximately million in outstanding clc student loans and ultimately selling the remaining receivables for million.trustee gold was also involved in the establishment and operation of a records retention center to centralize and organize clc student and business records.according to gold,the clc case has been considered to be one of the most complex chapter bankruptcy cases ever filed in the region.he said that,even though some persons considered it a no asset case,he turned the case into a success acknowledged by virtually all major parties to the case.
for his work,trustee gold filed four interim fee applications with the bankruptcy court.in his first application,he requested and was awarded,the maximum allowable to trustees under a of the bankruptcy code,based on the estate disbursements as of that time.gold second,third,and fourth fee applications were addressed in the bankruptcy court august,order.they requested a total of,and the bankruptcy court awarded gold a total of.of the awarded,however,the bankruptcy court allowed immediate disbursement of only,noting that the balance owed to gold would be payable upon further order of the court as additional funds came into the estate and the maximum allowable trustee compensation under a of the bankruptcy code correspondingly increased.the bankruptcy court also observed that since gold had been forced to resign as trustee and a successor trustee had been appointed,it was impossible to determine,at that time,the total trustees fees that would be incurred in the case.a problem may arise,the court explained,if the total trustees fees exceed the allowable maximum provided by a.accordingly,the court made clear that the fees awarded were provisional only and might be adjusted at the conclusion of the case.
trustee gold law firm,gm l,likewise submitted a series of fee applications to the bankruptcy court.in its first application,gm l requested in fees and in expenses.the bankruptcy court awarded gm l the full fees and reduced the expenses to.gm l second through sixth applications,which requested a total of in fees plus in expenses,were addressed in the bankruptcy court august,order.the bankruptcy court awarded gm l a total of in fees,and of that amount,it characterized as attributable to services properly performable by the trustee,not trustee counsel.that amount was therefore subject to the aggregate cap on trustees fees.of the claim for expenses,the bankruptcy court awarded gm l.in its order,the bankruptcy court ordered disbursement of all sums allowed to gm l,except for of the fee award,stating that this amount shall be payable only upon further order of this court as the maximum compensation allowable for trustee fees is increased.as with its award to trustee gold,the bankruptcy court stated that it was awarding gm l interim fees and that a ll fees awarded were provisional and were subject to disgorgement.
in addressing trustee gold and gm l fee applications,the bankruptcy court employed the lodestar method,beginning with a determination of the allowable hourly rate.the court noted that n either the trustee nor his law firm had presented any evidence on the prevailing market rate for attorneys fees and rejected the per hour rate claimed by gold and gm l.the court explained that it was in an excellent position to evaluate the prevailing market rate for attorney fees by virtue of the innumerable fee applications presented to the court and concluded that per hour was the current prevailing rate.rejecting any enhancement of the lodestar,the court observed that the size of the estate and the concomitant complexity are fully accounted for in the compensation of the professionals by the additional hours expended to meet these challenges.
trustee gold and gm l appealed the august,fee award order to the district court,and the district court summarily affirmed by an order dated january,on the sound reasoning of the bankruptcy court.the district court concluded that the bankruptcy court findings were neither clearly erroneous,nor contrary to law.
from the district court january,order,trustee gold and gm l filed this appeal.they contend that the bankruptcy court misconstrued and misapplied a that the bankruptcy court erred in establishing as a prevailing market rate for attorneys fees that the bankruptcy court improperly denied reimbursement for computer assisted legal research and,in doing so,subtracted the incorrect amount from gm l expenses when excluding that research and that the bankruptcy court erred in denying them compensation for preparing fee applications for other professionals.steven goldblatt,esquire,whom we appointed as amicus curiae to respond to the appellants arguments,contends,among other things,that this court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over this appeal because the bankruptcy court order allowing interim fees was an interlocutory order not subject to appeal under or d.
at the outset,we determine whether we have jurisdiction to review the district court order,which depends on whether the district court had jurisdiction to review the bankruptcy court august,order.see a,d.section a of title gives district courts jurisdiction to hear appeals from final judgments,orders,and decrees entered by bankruptcy courts,and d gives courts of appeals jurisdiction over appeals from all final decisions,judgments,orders,and decrees entered by district courts reviewing bankruptcy court decisions under a.thus,if,in this case,the bankruptcy court order was not final,the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to review it on appeal,and the district court order was not a final order in the bankruptcy case giving us jurisdiction to review it on appeal.
the concept of finality in bankruptcy cases has traditionally been applied in a more pragmatic and less technical way than in other situations.robins,piccinin,cir quoting in re amatex,cir.accordingly,orders in bankruptcy cases may be immediately appealed if they finally dispose of discrete disputes within the larger case.in re saco local dev,cir breyer,see also robins,at citing with approval breyer characterization of finality in saco.
