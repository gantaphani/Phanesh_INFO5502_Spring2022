anna litton appeals the district court decision affirming dismissal of her chapter bankruptcy petition.see in re litton.litton maintains that the court erred in ruling that her proposed plan was an impermissible modification of a debt that she and her husband owed to wachovia bank,wachovia.because litton proposed plan does not constitute an impermissible modification,we vacate the district court dismissal and direct that it remand litton petition to the bankruptcy court for further proceedings.
this appeal arises from the third in a series of bankruptcy proceedings initiated in the western district of virginia by litton and her husband.the resolution of this appeal turns initially on our assessment of the intended meaning of a term used in an earlier settlement agreement that prohibited the littons from seeking any modification of a debt they owed wachovia.because we conclude that the provision of the settlement agreement embodies the concepts contained in of the bankruptcy code,we must decide whether litton proposed plan of reorganization seeks to modify the terms of that agreement or,alternatively,seeks to cure the litton default of their obligations to wachovia.while a modification would indeed be prohibited by the provisions of b,a cure is expressly authorized under b 
as an initial matter,it is necessary to review certain fundamental concepts of bankruptcy law.under chapter of the bankruptcy code individuals with regular income may petition a bankruptcy court for bankruptcy protection and for reorganization of their debts after a chapter petition has been filed,all claims against the petitioning debtor assets are automatically stayed.see a.a trustee,appointed by the government,oversees the administration of the debtor assets,or the bankruptcy estate.see id.after filing a chapter bankruptcy petition,a debtor must propose a plan of reorganization,which is scrutinized both by the bankruptcy court and by the,the debtor creditors and the trustee,in a confirmation hearing.see id.at the confirmation hearing,the are entitled to object to the court confirmation of the proposed plan.id.if the proposed plan is confirmed by the bankruptcy court,and if the debtor complies with the plan terms,the debtor obtains a discharge of his debts.
in proposing a plan of reorganization under chapter,a debtor may seek to catch up on payments or,in certain circumstances,to alter the terms of a debt.by contrast,a chapter plan of reorganization that includes a debt secured by a lien on the debtor principal residence may not propose to modify the terms of that debt.id.b.a proposed plan may,however,seek to cure any default,including a default on a claim secured by the debtor principal residence.id.b.with this background in mind,we turn to the relevant facts and procedural history of this appeal.
the littons live on and operate a small farm in washington county,virginia.they also own and manage several rental properties in that area.on may,the littons granted a deed of trust on their washington county farm which is their principal residence to central fidelity bank.this deed of trust secured repayment of a promissory note in the sum of.the littons granted an additional deed of trust to central fidelity bank on september,for the purpose of providing additional security for the promissory note.
after encountering financial difficulties,litton filed a petition in bankruptcy on march,seeking relief in the western district of virginia under chapter of the bankruptcy code the petition.in order to dispose of the petition,the bankruptcy court entered an agreed order of november,the modification order,which the littons and central fidelity executed.at some point after the execution of the modification order,wachovia purchased the assets of central fidelity bank,including the littons promissory note.
faced with continuing financial difficulties,litton,on september,filed a chapter bankruptcy petition in the same court the petition.similar to their settlement of the petition,the littons,in march of,entered into a settlement agreement with their creditors,including wachovia.this settlement agreement disposed of the petition and augmented the modification order.the terms of this agreement were incorporated into an order entered by the bankruptcy court on march,the order.
pursuant to the order,the littons were to pay to wachovia on or before june,the initial payment.the order further provided that,if the littons made the initial payment in a timely manner,wachovia would refinance the balance of its loan to the littons.conversely,if the littons failed to make the initial payment in a timely manner,wachovia could,under the terms of the order,pursue its rights and remedies with respect to the deeds of trust on the littons real estate,by implementing foreclosure proceedings on the littons farm.furthermore,the order,mirroring the language of b,prohibited the littons from seeking any further modification of the terms of the order in any future bankruptcy proceeding.
the littons failed to make the initial payment on time,and wachovia promptly moved to foreclose on the littons farm.on november,litton filed this chapter petition in the western district of virginia the petition,and the automatic stay arising under the bankruptcy code halted the foreclosure proceedings.at the time she filed the petition,and in accordance with the provisions of,litton proposed a plan of reorganization,seeking to reorganize her debts and emerge from bankruptcy the plan.the plan proposed the reinstitution of the terms of the order by obligating litton to resume her payments to wachovia.in particular,the plan provided t he term of this plan shall be three months debtor proposes to catch up in arrearages in payments to wachovia bank within days,and to make regular payments as called for in the order the case will then be concluded.
wachovia objected to confirmation of the plan,and it also sought relief from the automatic stay.in a separate filing,the chapter trustee also objected to confirmation of the plan,and she sought to have the petition either dismissed or converted to a chapter liquidation proceeding.on february,the bankruptcy court entered an order dismissing the petition,concluding that it constituted an improper use of chapter.litton promptly sought reconsideration of the bankruptcy court order,supporting her request with an affidavit that she jointly executed with her husband.the affidavit explained the extensive efforts that the littons had made,and the various difficulties they had encountered,in seeking to comply with the order on march,the bankruptcy court denied reconsideration.see in re litton.
litton appealed the bankruptcy court rulings to the district court for the western district of virginia.the district court agreed that the petition was an improper use of chapter,and it affirmed the bankruptcy court dismissal.see litton,at.litton has appealed the district court order to this court,and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to d.
we review the judgment of a district court sitting in review of a bankruptcy court de novo,applying the same standards of review that were applied in the district court.specifically,we review the bankruptcy court factual findings for clear error,while we review questions of law de novo.in re biondo,cir.any mixed questions of law and fact are also reviewed de novo.carter enters.ashland specialty.
the resolution of this appeal turns,first of all,on whether the parties intended the term modification,as used in the settlement agreement that was incorporated into the order,to be interpreted in accordance with the narrow provision of,or whether they instead intended the term to preclude all modifications,even those authorized by.
under virginia law,the cardinal rule applied in the construction of contracts is that the intention of the parties controls paul paul.where the language in a contract is unambiguous,it is inappropriate for the court to consider extrinsic evidence.great falls hardware of reston lakes vill.ctr.the great falls court noted that an unambiguous document should be given its plain meaning.see also ross craw,noting that contracts must be construed as written.
it is unclear whether the littons and wachovia intended the provision of the order to be interpreted narrowly or broadly,to proscribe only certain modifications or to proscribe all modifications.a contract is ambiguous when the language employed therein can be understood in more than one way or refers to two or more things at the same time.douglas hammett.because the prohibition on modification contained in the order is susceptible to more than one meaning,it is ambiguous.we must,therefore,turn to the subject matter of the order,and to the circumstances surrounding its entry,in an effort to discern the parties true intent.see monterey hart.
it is,it is this context,that the littons and wachovia agreed on the terms of the order to settle a pending bankruptcy case the petition,and to augment the settlement terms of an earlier bankruptcy case the petition.accordingly,we must conclude that the littons and wachovia intended the term modification,as used in the order,to be consistent with the meaning contemplated by of the bankruptcy code therefore,we must assess the extent and breadth of the provision of b.
on appeal,wachovia primary contention in support of the bankruptcy court dismissal of the petition is that the plan proposes a prohibited modification.by contrast,litton maintains that the plan constitutes a permissible cure under b,and that the petition should not have been dismissed.in affirming the bankruptcy court dismissal of the petition,the district court concluded that,because the order contained its provision,the plan proposed alterations of the order would be impermissible.see in re litton,at.
because the littons debt to wachovia is secured by an interest in the littons primary residence,would ordinarily prohibit a modification of the order.nevertheless,a separate provision of the same statute,b,provides that the littons are entitled to cure any default of their obligations relating to the debt on their principal residence we must therefore resolve whether the plan seeks to modify the order or,alternatively,whether it seeks to cure the littons default.in so doing,we must understand the interpretations accorded to the concepts of modification and cure in chapter jurisprudence.
the bankruptcy courts have consistently interpreted the provision of b to prohibit any fundamental alteration in a debtor obligations,lowering monthly payments,converting a variable interest rate to a fixed interest rate,or extending the repayment term of a note.see,in re schum,concluding that plan was impermissible modification because it proposed to reduce monthly payments and secured valuation.in in re gwinn,the court approved a plan as a permissible cure under b,because the plan did not propose to lower monthly payments,extend the repayment period,or make the obligation conditional.it instead sought only to reinstate the original contract with a minor delay in payment.see also in re cooper,finding impermissible modification where plan proposed new payment schedule.along similar lines,another bankruptcy court concluded that confirmation of a chapter plan would have constituted an impermissible modification because the plan proposed to alter fundamental aspects of the debtor obligations,the nature and rate of interest,and the maturity features of the loan.in re coffey.as these decisions have emphasized,b prohibits modifications that would alter at least one fundamental aspect of a claim.
conversely,a cure merely reinstates a debt to its position,or it returns the debtor and creditor to their respective positions before the default.in landmark financial services hall,cir,we had occasion to assess the meaning of the term cure,as it is used in b.in that decision,judge hall determined that a cure reinstates the original agreement of the parties and is not a modification of the creditor rights.cure by its very nature assumes a regime where debtors reinstate defaulted debt contracts in accordance with the conditions of their contracts.id.at emphasis added and internal citations omitted.
our sister circuits have taken a similar view of the use of the term cure in bankruptcy proceedings.for example,the second circuit has observed that,c uring a default commonly means taking care of the triggering event and returning to conditions.dipierro taddeo,cir.the dipierro court noted that w e do not read curing defaults under b or curing defaults and maintaining payments under b to be modifications of claims.id.at.
the seventh circuit has given a similar meaning to the term cure,as it is used in the bankruptcy code.it observed that t he terms modify and cure are nowhere defined in the bankruptcy code.however,it is clear that congress intended cure to mean something different from modify.in the matter of clark,cir.significantly,the clark court also observed that,o rdinarily,the means by which one cures a default is by paying all amounts due and owing thus,the plain meaning of cure,as used in b and,is to remedy or rectify the default and restore matters to the status quo ante.id.at emphasis added see also in re metz,cir interpreting cure provisions of chapter as permitting the debtor to cure,pay or bring current arrearages on the debt and thereby reinstate the debt.given these definitions and interpretations of the terms modify and cure,as they have been used in bankruptcy proceedings,we next examine whether the plan would fundamentally alter the terms of the order.
the petition was filed on november,when the littons only default,under the terms of the order,was their failure to make the initial payment.by providing for terms of payment virtually identical to those required by the order,the plan simply sought to return the order to its condition.see landmark,at noting that cure reinstates defaulted debt contract to its original terms.it proposed that litton pay all arrearages and maintain all payments during the life of the plan.it did not propose the reduction of any installment payments or of the amounts due to wachovia under the order it did not propose an extension of the final maturity date on the littons debt to wachovia and it did not propose an alteration of any other terms of the order.under these circumstances,the plan does not propose a modification of the order.rather,evaluated by its express terms,under the foregoing authorities,and by its proposed treatment of the order,the plan constitutes a cure under the bankruptcy code,in that it seeks to restore the status quo ante.clark.at 
finally,we briefly assess the district court alternate bases for affirming the dismissal of the petition.first,the court reasoned that,because the order provided for certain,the event of the littons default,the littons were precluded from altering the terms of the order by filing for bankruptcy.contrary to this reasoning,wachovia right to institute foreclosure proceedings is subject to the provisions of the bankruptcy code that permit a debtor to file a bankruptcy petition up to the time of a foreclosure sale.see c.because the bankruptcy code provides the framework within which a creditor may assert contractual remedies in the event of a default,the terms of the order do not,of their own accord,preclude litton from filing the petition and proposing to cure her default to wachovia.
second,the court concluded that,because the littons did not establish that they had experienced an unforeseen change in circumstances,the dismissal of the petition was warranted a change in circumstances,foreseen or unforeseen,is but one of many factors a court should consider when assessing whether a chapter petition or plan of reorganization has been filed in good faith it does not constitute an independent test for whether a petition should be dismissed.see neufeld freeman,cir.because the district court agreed with the bankruptcy court finding that the petition had been filed in good faith,in re litton,at,that petition should not have been dismissed simply because litton had failed to demonstrate an unforeseen change in circumstances 
in sum,the petition was filed in good faith and it proposed a permissible cure.in such circumstances,litton was not precluded from availing herself of the protections afforded to chapter debtors by the bankruptcy code.
pursuant to the foregoing,we conclude that the bankruptcy court erred in dismissing the petition.accordingly,we vacate the district court dismissal and direct that it remand litton petition to the bankruptcy court for further proceedings.
vacated and remanded with directions 
anna litton proposed chapter plan was a modification of wachovia rights,not a simple cure of a default.for this reason,the bankruptcy court was well within its authority to find that litton had violated the terms of the court settlement order and to dismiss her chapter petition.the bankruptcy court and the district court properly recognized the crucial fact in this case,that wachovia mortgage had already matured before litton missed the payment called for by the settlement order.thus,litton proposed plan required wachovia to extend the term of its already matured mortgage.this was a modification of wachovia rights,and it was not permissible under the bankruptcy code.i respectfully dissent.
wachovia mortgage on litton property matured at the latest on january.in march,wachovia entered into a settlement with litton to dispose of her first chapter case.according to the settlement,the littons would make payments of and to wachovia.if the littons made these payments by june,only would restructure the mortgage,the remaining balance using a term and the residential mortgage interest rate afforded by wachovia on june.under this new arrangement,the littons would make annual payments of at least,with the entire obligation to mature by balloon payment on march,or one year after construction of improvements to exit on interstate,whichever first occurred.the settlement further provided that if the littons failed to make the scheduled payments by june,then wachovia would be entitled to foreclose the property according to the underlying mortgage instruments.in other words,the parties agreed that litton payment of and by june,was a condition precedent to further financing by wachovia on new terms.at the parties invitation,the bankruptcy court entered an agreed order memorializing the settlement.
wachovia initiated foreclosure proceedings when litton failed to make the scheduled payment of by june.shortly before the foreclosure,litton filed the instant chapter petition and proposed a plan whereby she would catch up in arrearages in payments to wachovia bank within days,and make regular payments as called for by agreement.
the bankruptcy court dismissed litton petition,ruling that her proposed plan violated the terms of the agreed order because that plan proposed to make a new agreement between the parties directly contrary to the provisions of their original agreement.it was important to the bankruptcy it should be to this p rior to the making of such agreement the full balance owing on the note secured by the deed of trust was already due and payable.
the majority correctly recognizes that the outcome of this appeal turns on the characterization of litton proposed chapter plan as a modification or a cure modification and cure are distinct concepts in the bankruptcy code.landmark fin.servs.hall,cir matter of clark,cir in re taddeo,cir.
b provides that a chapter plan may modify the rights of holders of secured claims,other than a claim secured by a security interest in real property that is the debtor principal residence.this provision allows modification of the rights of both secured and unsecured creditors,subject to special protection for creditors whose claims are secured only by a lien on the debtor home.nobelman american sav.bank,d.by virtue of its mortgage contract with litton,wachovia is indisputably the holder of a claim secured by a lien on litton home.id.at.wachovia rights as mortgagee are those that are reflected in the relevant mortgage instruments and were bargained for by the mortgagor and the mortgagee.id.at.under the deed of trust at issue in this case,wachovia retained the right to foreclose litton property once the mortgage matured.under b,litton could not modify wachovia right to foreclose upon maturity of the debt.
the bankruptcy code does not define the term modify.other courts have held that a plan impermissibly modifies a mortgagee rights where it seeks to delay payment of an unaccelerated debt that has naturally matured prior to the filing of the case,see matter of cooper,it seeks to bifurcate treatment of the amount due under a mortgage into secured and unsecured claims,see in re schum,or it seeks to convert a demand loan obligation with a variable interest rate into a term loan with a fixed interest rate,see in re coffey.indeed,the majority is quite correct that an attempt to alter fundamental aspects of the debtor obligations is a modification forbidden by b.
cure under b is different.while a modification impermissibly alters the debtor obligations with respect to a the mortgagee of its original cure simply reinstates the existing mortgage agreement as if the debtor had never defaulted.landmark fin,at matter of metz,cir stating that a cure simply reinstates the original debt after correcting the arrearages.this court has noted that c ure by its very nature assumes a regime where debtors reinstate defaulted debt contracts in accordance with the conditions of their contracts.landmark fin,at internal quotations omitted.in other words,c uring a default commonly means taking care of the triggering event and returning to conditions.in re taddeo,at.accord in re hurt,cir.bap stating that a cure restores the debtor mortgage to its original state before the default regardless of what action the mortgagee has taken matter of clark,at a s the term relates to defaults,cure means to restore matters to the status quo ante.
litton proposed plan was not a cure because it would not merely restore the status quo ante to the contrary,it would the most basic terms of the mortgage.under the status quo ante,wachovia held a matured mortgage.although wachovia offered litton an opportunity to obtain further financing and avoid foreclosure,such financing was available only if litton made the payment by june.thus,on the date of the,was entitled to foreclose unless litton satisfied the condition precedent of payment.
rather than restoring the status quo ante,litton proposed plan would create a new mortgage altogether.under her plan,litton would make a payment of the payment she had missed to wachovia in return,wachovia would continue to finance her property on the new terms outlined in the settlement agreement.presumably,litton would be entitled to of the balance of her debt using a term and the residential mortgage rates prevailing on june.she would be entitled to a payment schedule calling for annual payments of with the entire obligation to mature in march.these are new favorable to which wachovia received no consideration at all.in short,litton plan would require wachovia to continue financing the purchase of her home under terms other than the terms of the mortgage instrument in effect before her default 
contrary to the majority assertions,litton proposed chapter plan did propose an extension of the final maturity date of the littons debt to wachovia,from january to march.and confirmation of litton plan will place wachovia in a worse position than it was in under the agreement wachovia will lose entirely the benefit of holding a matured mortgage,and it will be forced to undertake additional financing obligations on terms more favorable to litton.this plan simply is not a cure.
even if the majority were correct that litton proposed plan amounts to a cure,the relevant cure provision can not save litton in this case.section b permits cure only with respect to any unsecured claim or secured claim on which the last payment is due after the date on which the final payment under the plan is due.thus,if a large final balloon payment is due on a debt prior to the termination of the plan,section b may not be utilized.collier on bankruptcy,at ed.the final balloon payment on wachovia mortgage was due on january,months before litton even proposed her plan.accordingly,litton can not rely upon b to authorize any cure in this case
