richard mullarkey and the tamboers each owned an undivided interest in a parcel of property known as the princeton estates,or branchville road,hampton township,new jersey.the tamboers agreed to pay mullarkey original bank mortgage and,in turn,held a mortgage on his share of the property.the mortgage was dated june,and was recorded on february.mullarkey ultimately defaulted on his mortgage obligations.on july,the tamboers initiated a foreclosure action in new jersey state court.mullarkey did not appear and the state court entered a default judgment of foreclosure on march,and scheduled a sheriff sale.on june,mullarkey filed a chapter bankruptcy petition,which triggered the automatic stay provision of the bankruptcy code and stayed the sheriff sale.
on april,the tamboers filed a motion seeking relief from the automatic stay based on mullarkey continued failure to make payments pursuant to the terms of the mortgage.the bankruptcy court granted mullarkey additional time to obtain approval for subdivision of the property to enable him to sell his interest.the approvals were not obtained and approximately a year later,on march,the bankruptcy court entered an order granting the tamboers relief from the automatic stay.mullarkey appealed this decision to the district court and requested that the district court stay implementation of the stay relief order pending the outcome of the appeal.the court denied the stay request.mullarkey also sought to stay the sheriff sale in state court,which was also denied.in addition,he made an application to the bankruptcy court for an order vacating the order vacating stay,which was also denied.
the tamboers purchased the property at the sheriff sale on july.following the sheriff sale,mullarkey bankruptcy case remained open while he completed the sale of an unrelated property and made the payments called for by his reorganization plan.his reorganization plan was confirmed on april.
on december,mullarkey filed a pro se complaint against the tamboers in the united states district court for the district of new jersey the essence of mullarkey allegations is that the tamboers committed fraud on the bankruptcy court and that their actions constituted several acts of racketeering in violation of the federal racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations rico statute.the district court ultimately determined that the matter over which the plaintiff complains is related to the bankruptcy proceeding and referred the matter to bankruptcy 
after the complaint was referred to the bankruptcy court,mullarkey filed four motions.the court denied each motion in an order dated january.the motions were for a discretionary change of venue to the district court joinder of steven kartzman mullarkey former attorney as a necessary party a reference to a prosecuting authority and a motion to reconsider the order dismissing defendant gherlone.on january,mullarkey appealed the denial of these four motions.however,he incorrectly filed his appeal with the bankruptcy court.the appeal was eventually transferred to the district court and assigned civil docket number.it appears,however,that only two of the four orders were ever recorded on the district court docket.at all events,the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court denial of mullarkey motions on august.both parties seem to agree,however,that the district court never actually reviewed the bankruptcy court order denying the motions because the order refers to the april,order of the bankruptcy court dismissing mullarkey fraud complaint.on august,mullarkey filed a motion for reconsideration of the district court order.he did not argue that the district court did not consider the orders from which he appealed rather,he claimed that the district court overlooked the fact that the bankruptcy judge order dismissing the case was not on the merits.he argued that the district court erred by failing to consider the merits of his claim.on august,the district court denied the motion for reconsideration as untimely filed and without merit.mullarkey timely appealed to this court from the denial of his motion for reconsideration.
in the meantime,the tamboers moved to dismiss mullarkey complaint pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,which by virtue of rule b of the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure,is made applicable to bankruptcy proceedings.the bankruptcy court granted their motion to dismiss in an order and opinion dated april,the bankruptcy court concluded that the complaint allegations of fraud were raised in prior proceedings and therefore were barred by the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel or alternatively,the entire controversy doctrine,and that mullarkey did not have standing to bring criminal charges and so,to the extent his complaint can be read to include criminal charges,he lacked standing to bring them.
mullarkey appealed the bankruptcy court order granting the motion to dismiss.the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court order in a order dated august,and denied mullarkey motion for reconsideration on october.mullarkey timely appealed to this court from the denial of his motion for reconsideration.
in this appeal,mullarkey argues that bankruptcy jurisdiction did not exist over his complaint,and that even if there was bankruptcy jurisdiction,the district court erred in treating the matter as a core the bankruptcy court to enter a final judgment pursuant to and applying a deferential standard of review in lieu of the required de novo review.mullarkey further argues that his complaint should not have been dismissed on preclusion grounds,and that he may seek a civil remedy for the defendants violation of the federal rico statute.
the district court had jurisdiction to review the bankruptcy court order under.we have jurisdiction under d and.our review of the district court ruling in its capacity as an appellate court is plenary,and we review the bankruptcy judge legal determinations de novo,in re,cir.we review its factual findings for clear error and its exercise of discretion for abuse thereof.in re united healthcare,cir.the first question we must resolve is whether the bankruptcy court had subject matter jurisdiction and the final adjudicative authority to resolve the claims alleged in mullarkey complaint.
as with all courts,courts in bankruptcy must satisfy themselves of subject matter jurisdiction.a bankruptcy court has subject matter jurisdiction over all cases under title and all core proceedings arising under title,or arising in a case under title,referred under subsection a of this section,and may enter appropriate orders and judgments,subject to review under section of this title.b therefore,a bankruptcy court must make an initial determination that the claims before it fall within the purview of section of title.once this determination has been made,invests two levels of authority in a bankruptcy judge depending upon which of the two categories a case or proceeding falls into.in re seven fields dev,cir citing.the two categories are all cases under title and all core proceedings arising under title,or arising in a case under title,b collectively known as core proceedings,and a proceeding that is not a core proceeding but that is otherwise related to a case under title,c proceedings.id.citations omitted.while it is clear that a bankruptcy court has jurisdiction over all proceedings related to a bankruptcy case,the distinction is relevant to the scope of the bankruptcy court powers upon referral in core proceedings,the bankruptcy judge may issue final orders and judgments.see b.in proceedings,the bankruptcy court powers are more circumscribed it must submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to the district court,which enters an order only after conducting de novo review see c.
thus,the distinction is a critical one with respect to a bankruptcy court adjudicative authority.to this end,b states that 
the bankruptcy judge shall determine,on the judge own motion or on timely motion of a party,whether a proceeding is a core proceeding under this subsection or is a proceeding that is otherwise related to a case under title.a determination that a proceeding is not a core proceeding shall not be made solely on the basis that its resolution may be affected by state law.
b.as the bankruptcy court in the instant case failed to make any such determination before granting a dispositive motion and entering final judgment,we must decide whether this statutory provision requires a bankruptcy court to explicitly determine,as a jurisdictional prerequisite,if a proceeding is core.the fourth circuit in in re johnson,cir,pointed out that 
s ome courts hold that failure of the bankruptcy court to make a b finding deprives the bankruptcy court of jurisdiction and the failure of the parties to request the finding does not waive their right to later object that the finding was a necessary predicate to jurisdiction.in re wefco,failure to determine whether matter is core or is not harmless error in re marill alarm systems,aff sub nom.marill alarm equity funding,cir not precedential if bankruptcy judge enters final judgment without making determination under b it must be invalidated failure of parties to move for determination does not waive error in re nell,same.other courts hold that a party failure to request a b finding waives any objection to the lack of such finding.in re rath packing,aff sub nom.rath packing united food,cir,cited in collier on bankruptcy mb at ed rainey international harvester credit.
the fourth circuit was persuaded by the latter view,concluding that the lack of a jurisdictional finding under b does not,in itself,deprive a bankruptcy court of jurisdiction.in re johnson,at.
we agree with the view adopted by the fourth circuit and hold that the bankruptcy court was not deprived of jurisdiction over mullarkey complaint for failure to make the determination under b.we are persuaded that this is the correct approach because b only requires that a bankruptcy judge determine whether a proceeding is core or.such a determination does not affect the bankruptcy court power to hear the case.rather,it affects the form of the bankruptcy court disposition,whether it is final and appealable to the district court,or a report and recommendation to be reviewed by the district court.in addition,the text of b suggests that a party may waive the right to this determination by failing to make a timely motion.see,in re sheridan,cir t he protections afforded by the northern pipeline distinction may be waived or forfeited,either by i consenting to the bankruptcy court treatment of an otherwise proceeding as core,or ii failing to raise or pursue the issue adequately on appeal.in re johnson,at by failing to object to the lack of a jurisdictional determination under b,and acquiescing to the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court to enter dispositive orders canal and red waived any requirement the bankruptcy court had to make a determination of its jurisdiction under b.fairly interpreted,the purpose of b is to assure that a bankruptcy court acts with the appropriate adjudicative authority in considering claims in bankruptcy.while parties may acquiesce in a bankruptcy court entry of a dispositive order within its subject matter jurisdiction,subject matter jurisdiction may neither be waived nor forfeited by the parties.thus,we are satisfied that b is not jurisdictional.
the next step in our analysis requires us to determine whether the bankruptcy court had subject matter jurisdiction over mullarkey complaint,and if so,whether the claims contained within it constitute core or proceedings.this determination will also reveal the bankruptcy court adjudicative authority and the district court standard of review.as our opinion in in re seven fields illustrates,we could proceed by engaging in a analysis in which we first inquire whether there is federal jurisdiction over mullarkey proceeding by asking whether the case is related to the bankruptcy,because related to is the broadest category of cases over which federal bankruptcy jurisdiction is exercised.see at.pursuant to that approach,we would then determine whether the matter is for the bankruptcy court to issue the final order that it did in this a matter,in which the bankruptcy court was only permitted to make recommendations to the district court.see id.however,if we conclude that the case arises in the bankruptcy proceeding,then by definition the bankruptcy court has both subject matter jurisdiction and the authority to enter final orders.see id.at.accordingly,we would not need to follow the approach.we pursue this latter course.
in order to determine whether mullarkey claims fall within the bankruptcy court core jurisdiction by arising in the bankruptcy,we must examine the allegations in mullarkey complaint.in halper halper,we adopted a approach to determine the extent of a bankruptcy court jurisdiction,cir citing in re parent,e ach of debtor fourteen causes of action will have to be separately analyzed to determine whether it falls within the bankruptcy court core jurisdiction.in the case at bar,the complaint was filed pro se.like many pro se pleadings,it is not a model of clarity.we think,however,that it is fair to characterize mullarkey submissions to the court as follows 
that the defendants knowingly and fraudulently concealed from the trustee belonging to his estate.
that the defendants knowingly and fraudulently made a false certification to the bankruptcy court under penalty of perjury.
that the defendants presented a false claim of to the bankruptcy court.
that the defendants attempted to obtain property title in a fraudulent manner.
that the defendants committed the crime of solicitation of conspiracy.
that these acts occurred over the course of several years and caused economic injury.
that the defendants were involved in a conspiracy.
that the defendants fraudulently foreclosed on the property with a bogus lien.
that the defendants concealed the sale of the property from the bankruptcy through false statements.
that the defendants have violated the rico statute.
we are satisfied that these allegations state,at least,a claim for fraud with regard to an asset of the bankruptcy estate,as the alleged fraud occurred during the bankruptcy process itself.the allegations of fraud presented in paragraphs one through four and nine are predicated on conduct that occurred during the bankruptcy process as such,the alleged fraud implicated the integrity of the entire bankruptcy process and was inseparable from the bankruptcy context.see in re seven fields,at.if we accept mullarkey allegations as true,the bankruptcy court granted relief from the automatic stay as a result of the conduct of the defendants,thereby allowing the defendants to proceed with the foreclosure and sale of mullarkey share of the property.if,but for the defendants conduct,the disposition of the property would have been otherwise and would have resulted in additional funds for the bankruptcy estate,it appears that the conduct of the defendants implicated the integrity of the bankruptcy process.thus,the allegations of misconduct here are similar in nature to the misconduct which our court was concerned with in in re seven fields and which we concluded fell within the bankruptcy court core jurisdiction.
in in re seven fields,the bankruptcy court exercised jurisdiction over a complaint alleging state law claims of professional negligence,fraud and deceit,and negligent misrepresentation against the accounting firm of ernst young.at.the complaint alleged that as a result of the work that ernst young performed during the bankruptcy proceedings and its representations to the bankruptcy court,the bankruptcy court deemed the debtors to be insolvent.id.at.the complaint further alleged that these representations of insolvency were a significant factor in bringing about the court confirmation of the plan.id.essentially,the parties were led to believe that they were in serious debt and,because of that,the parties sold their assets at below market value,suffering losses on their investments and failing to realize a return of the full amount of their investments.id.at.in concluding that aris ing in jurisdiction was present,our court noted that the claims arose inasmuch as the conduct on which the parties predicated the claims occurred during the bankruptcy process.id.at.second,we noted that the alleged malpractice implicated the integrity of the entire bankruptcy process and was inseparable from the bankruptcy context.id.at.
while our in re seven fields holding involved allegations of professional malpractice,the same concern for misconduct that directly affects the bankruptcy estate exists in the present case.indeed,our court stated that few issues are as important in the bankruptcy process as the bankruptcy court conclusion as to the solvency of a debtor.the solvency analysis is the cornerstone of the distribution plan.here,both the integrity of the bankruptcy process and the solvency of the debtors have been drawn into question.id.presumably,in our case,mullarkey interest in the property at issue would have had an effect on the bankruptcy court evaluation of his solvency had he been able to realize the value of that interest through sale of the property.
based on the foregoing,we conclude that the bankruptcy court had subject matter jurisdiction over the complaint filed by mullarkey.because the matters were core,the court properly exercised final adjudicative authority over the matter,and the district court did not err in applying a deferential standard of review.
the bankruptcy court erred,however,with respect to the merits.on april,the bankruptcy court filed an order granting the defendant motion to dismiss mullarkey complaint.the bankruptcy court held that mullarkey claims were precluded by the doctrines of res judicata,collateral estoppel,and alternatively,the entire controversy doctrine,because a ll of his arguments have been repeatedly rejected by this court,by the district court on appeal and on subsequent motions for reconsideration,as well as by the state court.based on the record before us,we are compelled to disagree.
as part of its analysis of the res judicata and collateral estoppel doctrines,the bankruptcy court noted that there is no dispute as to party identity.it also found that the claims and issues involving mullarkey and the defendants are identical to those previously raised and litigated not only in this court,but in the district and state courts as well.that court stated that the language in mullarkey present complaint is similar to submissions he made in prior proceedings before the bankruptcy court and other courts.finally,the bankruptcy court asserted that all of mullarkey claims were considered and rejected in its initial determination granting the tamboers relief from the automatic stay in march,as well as in the debtor motion for a stay of the stay relief order.
the doctrine of res judicata bars not only claims that were brought in a previous action,but also claims that could have been brought.post hartford ins,cir.it protect s litigants from the burden of relitigating an identical issue with the same party or his privy and promot es judicial economy by preventing needless litigation.id.quoting parklane hosiery shore,d.both new jersey and federal law apply res judicata or claim preclusion when three circumstances are present a final judgment on the merits in a prior suit involving the same parties or their privies and a subsequent suit based on the same cause of action.id.quoting lubrizol exxon,cir.
in addition,new jersey courts bar the relitigation of finally determined issues through the doctrine of collateral estoppel.collateral estoppel bars relitigation of any issue which was actually determined in a prior action,generally between the same parties,involving a different claim or cause of action.tarus borough of pine hill,quotations omitted.a party asserting collateral estoppel must show that 
the issue to be precluded is identical to the issue decided in the prior proceeding the issue was actually litigated in the prior proceeding the court in the prior proceeding issued a final judgment on the merits the determination of the issue was essential to the prior judgment and the party against whom the doctrine is asserted was a party to or in privity with a party to the earlier proceeding.

the bankruptcy court reliance on its stay proceedings to support preclusion,either by res judicata or collateral estoppel,was error.the prior bankruptcy orders respecting the motion to stay were not final judgments,and by their nature can not have preclusive effect on the instant action.the hearing on a motion for relief from stay is meant to be a summary proceeding,and the statute requires prompt action by the bankruptcy court.e section e provides that a bankruptcy court must hold a preliminary hearing on a motion to lift the stay within thirty days from the date the motion is filed,or the stay will be considered lifted.id.in addition,relief from a stay is obtained by a simple motion,and it is a contested matter,rather than an adversary proceeding.grella salem five cent sav.bank,cir citing.advisory committee note to.r equests for relief from the automatic stay do not commence an adversary proceeding.
the first circuit in grella recognized that a hearing on a motion for relief from stay is a summary proceeding of limited effect,and that 
t he limited grounds set forth in the statutory language,read in the context of the overall scheme of,and combined with the preliminary,summary nature of the relief from stay proceedings,have led most courts to find that such hearings do not involve a full adjudication on the merits of claims,defenses,or counterclaims,but simply a determination as to whether a creditor has a colorable claim to property of the estate.
at the court concluded that t he statutory and procedural schemes,the legislative history,and the case law all direct that the hearing on a motion to lift the stay is not a proceeding for determining the merits of the underlying substantive claims,defenses,or counterclaims.id.at.as the seventh circuit also pointed out,at issue in a hearing is only whether there is a colorable claim of a lien on property of the estate.in re vitreous steel prod,cir.as such,it held that the determination of the motion was not a bar to the prosecution of the adversary complaint before it.id.at.it explained that 
collateral estoppel is not a bar because the only issues necessarily decided at the hearing were whether the bank had a colorable claim of a lien and whether the amount of that lien exceeded the value of the property.it was not necessary to reach questions of collu sion with the bank,or questions of preferential transfers under,or questions of fraudulent conveyances under,or questions of commercial reasonableness of the sale under state law.indeed,none of these issues could properly have been raised,and therefore the hearing was not res judicata as to those issues.
here,the initial bankruptcy order vacating the automatic stay,dated march,is brief and does not suggest the basis upon which the court granted relief from the stay there is nothing in the record to suggest that any allegations of fraud had been made up to this point.it would certainly be reasonable to infer that the bankruptcy judge vacated the stay because of mullarkey continued failure to make his regular monthly mortgage payments outside of his chapter plan,as well as his failure to sell his interest in the property.in light of the record on appeal,and the summary nature of stay proceedings in general,we conclude that the bankruptcy court initial grant of relief does not have preclusive effect on mullarkey complaint 
the bankruptcy court also indicated that the new jersey state court foreclosure proceedings have preclusive effect over the instant complaint.we are at a loss to determine how to afford these proceedings preclusive effect.the record on appeal provides us no indication as to whether there was a merits determination during the new jersey state court foreclosure proceeding.the defendants initiated a foreclosure action in state court and a judgment of foreclosure was entered on march,when mullarkey failed to appear and a sheriff sale was scheduled for may.the sheriff sale did not take place as scheduled and it subsequently was stayed when mullarkey filed a chapter bankruptcy petition.after the bankruptcy court vacated the stay on march,mullarkey also sought to stay the sheriff sale in state court.the state court denied mullarkey request after a hearing,and the property was sold on or about july,to the tamboers.
the record,by way of the bankruptcy court order dismissing mullarkey complaint,does indicate that mullarkey submitted a certification to the state court in support of his motion to stay the sheriff sale,and that in it he specifically alleged that the defendants fraudulently stated that the mortgage was due,that the defendants fraudulently concealed the contract of sale for the property from him and the bankruptcy court,and that the defendants fraudulently stole the property.the text of the order fails to enlighten us,however,because it establishes only that mullarkey attempted to raise his allegations of fraud.nothing in the record suggests that the state court actually considered these allegations,let alone passed on them in denying the motion.under new jersey law,if the judgment of a court is based on one or more of several grounds,but does not expressly rely on any of them,none is conclusively established,in that another court subsequently reviewing that judgment can not tell what issue or issues were fully adjudicated.ettin,at citation omitted.
because this is the only information in the record that addresses what occurred in the new jersey state court,we are hesitant to conclude that either the bankruptcy proceedings or the new jersey state court proceedings bar consideration of mullarkey complaint.
the bankruptcy court alternatively relied on the new jersey entire controversy doctrine to bar consideration of mullarkey complaint.this doctrine 
requires that a person assert in one action all related claims against a particular adversary or be precluded from bringing a second action based on the omitted claims against that party.this reflects new jersey view that the entire controversy,rather than its constituent causes of action,is the unit of litigation.a plaintiff must seek complete vindication of the wrong he charged.
melikian corradetti,cir citations omitted.under the entire controversy doctrine,a party can not withhold part of a controversy for later litigation even when the withheld component is a separate and independently cognizable cause of action.paramount aviation agusta,cir.the doctrine has three purposes complete and final disposition of cases through avoidance of piecemeal decisions fairness to parties to an action and to others with a material interest in it and efficiency and avoidance of waste and delay.id.citing ditrolio antiles.as an equitable doctrine,its application is flexible,with a appreciation for fairness to the parties.id.the entire controversy doctrine does not apply to bar component claims that are unknown,unarisen,or unaccrued at the time of the original action.mystic isle dev.perskie nehmad,citations omitted.
as is reflected by our determination that mullarkey claim is a core matter,we find that it relates to conduct that was intrinsic to both the bankruptcy and foreclosure proceedings which were occurring simultaneously.as mullarkey characterizes it,the prior proceeding itself was the alleged vehicle of the defendant misconduct.in such an instance,it seems illogical and unfair to hold the prior proceeding preclusive of subsequent claims relating to that misconduct.see.landis sewerage,the entire controversy doctrine is an equitable preclusionary doctrine whose purposes are to encourage comprehensive and conclusive litigation determinations,to avoid fragmentation of litigation,and to promote party fairness and judicial economy and efficiency.
leisure klingbeil holding,reiterates the importance of the entire controversy doctrine and confirms that it is applicable to foreclosure proceedings.however,it illustrates that the entire controversy doctrine has a narrower application to foreclosure proceedings,extending only to germane counterclaims leisure,at.the use of the word germane in the language of the rule undoubtedly was intended to limit counterclaims in foreclosure actions to claims arising out of the mortgage transaction which is the subject matter of the foreclosure action.id.in leisure technology,the trial judge had granted the plaintiff motion to strike the defendant first affirmative defense of fraudulent conduct on the part of the plaintiff.id.at.specifically,the defendant alleged that the plaintiff had breached the underlying agreement in relation to which the mortgage had been executed,thereby causing the defendant to be unable to make his mortgage payments.id.in addition,the judge also granted the plaintiff motion to sever the defendant counterclaim and transfer it to the law division.id.on appeal,the superior court concluded that the trial judge took too narrow a view of the scope of permissible chancery litigation.id.at.the court noted that,here the thrust of the counterclaim is the assertion that plaintiff had breached the underlying agreement in relation to which the mortgage was executed and interfered with defendants rights under that agreement.in the usually understood sense of the word,these claims were germane to the foreclosure action.id.at.
because counterclaims in foreclosure proceedings must be germane,and because germane claims are those arising out of the mortgage transaction which is the subject matter of the foreclosure action,we are satisfied that the claims mullarkey asserted then,and now,are not germane to the foreclosure proceeding.indeed,mullarkey does not contend that the defendant actions caused the default of his mortgage obligations.rather,his claims are based on the actions and representations of the tamboers during the bankruptcy proceedings.
ultimately,given the nature of the case and the fact that mullarkey proceeded pro se during much of it,it is difficult for us to discern what specific claims he is now alleging as compared to which claims he did and did not raise previously.more importantly,it is unclear if mullarkey could have raised the present claims in foreclosure,whether they had accrued at that time or were even justiciable.because the entire controversy doctrine is an equitable principle under which the court may exercise its judicial discretion based on the particular circumstances inherent in a given case,mystic isle dev,at,we decline to apply the doctrine in this case.indeed,the new jersey courts in applying the entire controversy doctrine have displayed a heightened concern for pro se litigants,particularly in summary or proceedings.see,cafferata peyser,it would obviously be counterproductive in the extreme were a preclusionary rule enforced in such a way as to penalize,without any concomitant benefit to the parties or to the system,a pro se litigant participation in the small claims mediation process or other expedited processing mechanism.such enforcement would convert the entire controversy doctrine from an equitable device into a trap for the unsuspecting.that is not its function.
finally,both parties agree that the district court reviewed the wrong bankruptcy order when it rejected mullarkey appeal of the bankruptcy court four interlocutory orders mullarkey initially appealed the orders to the bankruptcy court,and they were eventually transferred to the district court where they were given civil action number.on appeal,in an order bearing the same civil action number,
