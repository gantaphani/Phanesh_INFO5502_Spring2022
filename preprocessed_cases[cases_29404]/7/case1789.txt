this is a bankruptcy case turning on lien priorities.
international factors,in whose shoes harrison jewell now stands,financed fleet manufacturing.fleet was a corporation.kevin and maryann stanton,husband and wife,owned all the shares.international factors took a security interest in fleet property in,with several continuing financing arrangements.that same year,the stantons personally guaranteed fleet obligations to international factors.
fleet got a big order from,and needed more financing than in the past to make what had ordered.as a condition of increasing its advances to fleet manufacturing,international factors obtained a second mortgage on the stantons house.later that year,the stantons but not fleet went bankrupt and filed a september,petition for chapter bankruptcy.international factors continued to advance funds to fleet on the lien on the stantons house.
on may,the bankruptcy proceeding was converted to chapter.the bankruptcy trustee sold the stantons house,and international factors sought to attach the proceeds of the sale,based on the lien created by its deed of trust.on september,the trustee filed this action,seeking to avoid international factors lien.both sides filed motions for summary judgment.
the bankruptcy court granted the trustee motion,on the theory that the stantons had encumbered estate assets without court authority when fleet took on more debt after the stantons filed for bankruptcy 
the bankruptcy appellate panel reversed,with one judge dissenting the bap held that the stantons encumbered their house before the bankruptcy,and further financing of fleet after the stantons filed for bankruptcy did not amount to creation of a new lien.
we affirm the decision of the bap.
we review a bankruptcy court decision to grant a motion for summary judgment de novo 
the trustee appeal 
the stantons owned all the stock of fleet,but there has been no finding and no contention that fleet was a sham or alter ego or that the corporate veil ought to be pierced for any reason.thus for purposes of this appeal,fleet is a separate person from the stantons.the stantons went bankrupt,not fleet manufacturing.the trustee in bankruptcy sold the stantons house.this appeal is a dispute between the trustee in the stantons bankruptcy and the factor over which is entitled to the proceeds from that sale.
the trustee theory was that it was entitled to avoid international factors mortgage lien on the house,because the lien secured advances international factors made to fleet after the stantons bankruptcy petition.the bankruptcy appellate panel correctly ruled that the lien could not be avoided,because it was created when the stantons mortgaged their house,not when the advances were made,and fleet did not need court approval to advance additional money after the stantons filed for bankruptcy,because the advances were to fleet,which did not file for bankruptcy.
the trustee argues that the automatic stay provision,applied and prohibited the factor advances to fleet violation of the automatic stay is a serious business,exposing the violator in some circumstances to punitive damages and sanctions for contempt banks and other lenders may well tremble at the notion that they and possibly their officers could face such severe sanctions if they lend money to a corporation one of whose shareholders has gone bankrupt.many close corporations,such as small manufacturers and professional practices,secure debt with shareholders property as well as corporate property.shareholders sometimes go bankrupt while the corporation continues as a financially healthy business.
section a does not apply.that subsection stays any act to create,perfect or enforce any lien against property of the estate.a loan of money to a debtor not in bankruptcy does none of those things,as the bankruptcy appeals panel majority stressed a business relationship of stock ownership does not ipso facto extend the automatic stay to.the lien against the stantons house was created when they gave the factor a second mortgage,prior to the bankruptcy filing.that was a conveyance of an interest in real property,namely,a lien.the subsequent advances merely affected how much money the lien secured.
as the bankruptcy appellate panel recognized,c is therefore beside the point.it enables the trustee in bankruptcy to encumber assets of the estate with court approval the reason this is beside the point is that the stantons house was encumbered before the bankruptcy,and international factors did not lend any money to the stantons.as the bankruptcy appellate panel observed,following the stantons chapter petition,the bankruptcy estate included the house subject to the existing liens,which included the lien created by the prepetition trust deed.international factors thus loaned the money to a going,corporation in which the stantons owned stock.fleet did not need court approval to incur debt because fleet was not in bankruptcy.the stantons would have needed court approval to incur additional secured debt,but they did not incur any additional secured debt.were we to hold that fleet needed court approval,we would be piercing the corporate veil,and there is no justification for piercing it 
the factor lien on the house did not arise anew each time the factor made an advance.the deed of trust secures any and all indebtedness of fleet manufacturing company,inc incurred at any time in the future.factors have traditionally used such boilerplate future advances clauses because they are practical osborne has a particularly lucid explanation of the practicalities 
there are many transactions in which business desirability is heavily on the side of a mortgage securing not only a presently created or preexisting debt but future obligations as well such as fluctuating current balances under lines of credit established with the mortgagee the mortgagor saves interest on the surplus until ready to use it and escapes the burden of proper investment of it for the interim.he also avoids the expense and inconvenience of refinancing the mortgage so as to include the additional needed sum,or,in the alternative,of executing second and later mortgages for each new advance with attendant higher interest rates and financing charges.the mortgagee,on his part,minimizes the bother and costs of frequent financing which even though not borne by him tend to discourage borrowing t he conveyance of the interest in the property,made when the transaction is first entered into,is not a piecemeal affair but is intended to stand as security from the outset for the entire performance by the mortgagor of this one promise 
if it were correct that washington law refused recognition to the traditional future advances clauses,and treated each subsequent advance as a new lien,a different analysis would apply.but as the bankruptcy appellate panel correctly held,washington law is to the contrary.john keltch,don hoyt,holds that a mortgage for future advances becomes an effective lien as to subsequent encumbrances from the time of its recordation,rather than from the time when each advance is made.
this does not necessarily mean that international factors wins all the marbles.under john and under national bank of washington equity investors,it would matter that the factor had discretion whether to make the subsequent advances to fleet,and was not obligated to do so.national bank of washington holds that where the advances of promised loan moneys are,under an agreement to lend money,largely optional liens attaching prior to an optional advance would thus be superior to it.this does not mean that when international factors loaned money to fleet after the stantons went bankrupt,a new lien was created on the stantons house.if national bank of washington is still good law,it would mean that when these optional advances to fleet were made,the factor lien on the house,to the extent of these subsequent advances,was junior to the priority of intervening claims.national bank of washington thus would affect the priority of an optional lien but would not change the existence of the lien itself.
following a amendment to the lien priority statute in the mechanics lien chapter,it may be that national bank of washington is either limited in the mechanics lien context or entirely abrogated but the parties neither briefed this issue nor addressed it in their argument to us.we thus need not reach the question whether any advances made are subordinate to intervening claims,and we leave that to the bankruptcy court to determine if necessary on remand.
the factor lien preexisted the bankruptcy.no one violated the automatic stay provision.neither the factor nor fleet manufacturing needed court permission for the factor to advance additional money to fleet.to hold otherwise would allow the bankruptcy of a corporation shareholder to clog the going business of the corporation and its creditors.the bankruptcy at most affected the priority of the factor security interest,but not its existence 
the factors 
the bankruptcy appellate panel remanded to the bankruptcy court for a determination of how much of the sale proceeds from the stantons house should go to each party.international factors this remand on the ground that the amount they were owed on the date of the bankruptcy filing exceeded the sale proceeds,so they should get all the proceeds and no remand is needed.
the bap held that because the bankruptcy court did not address the validity of international factors lien under d,it would not make that determination for the first time on appeal.the bap remanded,advising the bankruptcy court to address not only the and arguments but also other claims that remain unresolved.despite jewell argument to the contrary,because the bankruptcy court did not make these determinations in the first instance,the remand was not erroneous.
i would reverse the decision of the bankruptcy appellate panel bap and reinstate the bankruptcy court order granting summary judgment to the trustee.the majority errs by misinterpreting washington lien law and then misapplying federal bankruptcy law based on its erroneous interpretation of washington law.based on my view of applicable law,i regret i can not join my colleagues,and instead i respectfully dissent from the majority opinion.
kevin and maryann stanton debtors owned all the shares of a business called fleet manufacturing fleet,which was organized as a closely held corporation.to finance fleet,debtors and fleet entered several agreements with international factors,creditor,including a recourse factoring,financing,security agreement factoring agreement,a continuing guaranty and waiver guaranty,and a deed of trust and security agreement deed of trust.the factoring agreement provides that creditor will buy fleet accounts receivable at a discount,as requested by fleet,subject to creditor deeming the accounts acceptable in its sole discretion.the factoring agreement was signed on april.also on april,debtors signed the guaranty,under which they agreed to be held personally liable for fleet debts to creditor.on july,debtors signed the deed of trust on their home,which assigned a security interest in the home to creditor it was recorded on july.the deed of trust provides that it is created to secure debtors and fleet obligations under the guaranty and the factoring agreement.
on september,debtors filed a petition for chapter bankruptcy.on may,the bankruptcy proceeding was converted to chapter.the trustee sold the debtors residence,and creditor sought to attach the proceeds of the sale,based on the lien allegedly created by the deed of trust.on september,the trustee filed this action,seeking to avoid liens based on transfers.both sides filed motions for summary judgment.the bankruptcy court,i believe correctly,granted trustee motion.beeler stanton in re stanton,stanton i.
the bap reversed,with one judge dissenting.jewell beeler in re stanton,cir.bap stanton ii.the bap majority held that,because a lien to secure future advances is established at the time of recording under washington law,the lien itself was created before both the chapter petition for bankruptcy and the conversion of the proceeding to chapter.the bap majority also held that the encumbrances did not violate because they were for fleet benefit rather than to aid debtors and therefore were not within the scope of.because the bap misinterpreted washington law and because the advances to fleet further encumbered the debtors estate in violation of,i would reverse the bap majority and reinstate the initial decision of the bankruptcy court,agreeing with the position with the bap dissent.i respectfully submit that the majority errs in failing to do so.
debtors encumbrances violated and.
as the bankruptcy court here recognized,once a debtor files for bankruptcy,he or she loses the right further to encumber the assets of the bankruptcy estate and may do so only with the permission of the bankruptcy court.see snyder dewoskin in re mahendra,cir.the bankruptcy estate consists of all of the debtor legal and equitable property interests that existed as of the time that the bankruptcy petition was filed.id.citing a.it is beyond dispute that debtors house was part of the bankruptcy estate and could not be further encumbered after debtors filed for bankruptcy.the only questions,then,are whether creditor advances to fleet further encumbered debtors house and whether,under washington law,creditor advances created new liens.
section provides that,after a debtor files for bankruptcy,an automatic stay goes into effect prohibiting,among other actions,any act to create,perfect,or enforce any lien against property of the estate.a.section c provides a limited exception to a.specifically,c allows the bankruptcy court,after notice and a hearing,to authorize the obtaining of credit or the incurring of debt secured by a lien when necessary to provide the trustee with the funds to pay administrative expenses.c,emphasis added see also d allowing the court to authorize senior and equal liens on encumbered property in certain circumstances.
section exception to automatic stay did not apply.
creditor argues,and the majority holds,that does not require court approval in these circumstances because the debt was incurred by fleet,a entity,rather than by debtors.thus,according to the majority and creditor,there was no new lien,just a prior lien that had existed from the outset of the guarantee relationship,before the bankruptcy.though this argument has some force,it can not be squared with the protective purposes of to safeguard the debtors estate,nor with the pertinent definition of debt that controls whether creditor needed bankruptcy court permission to increase debtors liability after the bankruptcy petition was filed.
i agree with the analysis of judge perris,the bap dissenter.as she recognized,c barred the debtors attempt to use their house as collateral without prior court approval because,in continuing to use their house as collateral for fleet debts on advances,the debtors incurr ed debt within the meaning of c.the bankruptcy code defines debt as liability on a claim and defines claim as either a right to payment or to an equitable remedy for breach of performance if such breach gives rise to a right to payment.it is difficult,if not impossible,to dispute that the debtors continued use of their house as collateral for fleet debts on new advances resulted in their incurring new and increased liability on creditor lien claim,an equitable remedy,against debtors as guarantors,for breach of performance by fleet on its obligations arising after the petition was filed to increase the amount of the liens was to increase liability on a claim,and,as such,creditor actions increasing debtors liability required prior court approval,which was not obtained.see stanton ii,at perris,dissenting.
the majority argues,in note,that debtors did not encumber their property after bankruptcy filing because there was a preexisting lien.but the majority proceeds on the mistaken assumption that washington law does not create a new lien when optional advances were made by the factor to fleet after the debtors bankruptcy.see ii.infra.these optional advances increased debt of the debtors and further encumbered the bankruptcy estate.
the majority errs by interpreting without reference to the defin
