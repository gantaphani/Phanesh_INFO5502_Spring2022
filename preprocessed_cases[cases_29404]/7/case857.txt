appellant rodney tow,trustee,appeals the order of the united states district court affirming the final order of the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of texas.the bankruptcy court order denied the trustee objection to the claim of exemption for proceeds from the sale of the homestead filed by appellees,debtors michael and jamie zibman,holding,inter alia,that because the zibmans bankruptcy petition was filed during the six months in which proceeds from the sale of a homestead enjoy protection from creditors under texas law,the proceeds remained permanently exempt from the bankruptcy estate.because the facts and the law applicable on the date that a petition for bankruptcy is filed determine the exemptions available to a debtor,and because the time limit is an integral feature of texas statutory exemption for proceeds from the sale of a homestead,we reverse the district court order,render judgment for the trustee,and remand this matter to the bankruptcy court for continued proceedings consistent herewith.
facts and proceedings 
the facts in this case are simple and basically uncontested.the zibmans owned two jewelry stores in texas,one in san antonio,and one in houston.in,they began having financial difficulty,and in october,they closed the san antonio store.michael moved to massachusetts to work in the jewelry business,while jamie remained in texas to manage their houston store.on november,the zibmans sold their houston home and placed the proceeds from the sale in a general,unsegregated account that already held approximately in january,the zibmans closed the houston store,and on february,jamie moved to massachusetts to join michael.four days later,on february,the zibmans filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter,claiming as exempt the full amount of the proceeds from the sale of their houston homestead.on the same day,the zibmans moved into a townhome in massachusetts under a lease.the zibmans both testified that they had no intention of reinvesting the proceeds in a texas homestead within six months following the date of the sale or in the foreseeable future,and they did not,in fact,purchase another texas homestead within the period.
in may,just over six months after the zibmans had sold their home,the trustee objected to the zibmans claimed exemption of the sale proceeds on the alternative grounds that under texas law,the proceeds from a homestead sale that have not been reinvested in another texas homestead within six months after the sale cease to be exempt from creditors claims and the zibmans had waived the exemption of the proceeds by abandonment and by commingling the proceeds with other funds.the bankruptcy court and,on appeal,the district court,relied on the snapshot rule to allow the exemption as permanent,that is,no longer subject to automatic expiration upon failure to reinvest within six months.the court also held that the debtors had not waived the exemption as of the date the petition was filed either through abandonment or by commingling the sale proceeds with other funds.the trustee timely appealed the district court order affirming the bankruptcy court.
ii.analysis 
jurisdiction and standard of review 
district courts jurisdiction to hear appeals in bankruptcy cases encompasses final judgments,orders,and decrees,as well as certain interlocutory orders and decrees courts of appeals,in turn,have jurisdiction to hear bankruptcy appeals,but the appellate courts jurisdiction is limited to all final decisions,judgments,orders,and decrees of district courts or a bankruptcy appellate panel an order that grants or denies an exemption is deemed a final order for the purpose of d determination whether an exemption from the bankruptcy estate exists is a question of law,which we review de novo 
exemption of proceeds from the sale of a homestead under texas law 
the bankruptcy and district courts determined that the zibmans filing of a bankruptcy petition during the period in which proceeds from the sale of a homestead enjoy protection from creditors under texas law froze the exemption as it existed on the date of filing.these courts reasoned that,on that one day,the exemption was in existence,and subsequent,the expiration of the balance of the period without reinvesting the not retouch the snapshot.the trustee contends that this determination was error because the limit of the exemption for proceeds is an integral feature of the texas law applicable on the date of the filing of the bankruptcy petition.therefore,reasoned the trustee,this essential element of the exemption must continue in effect even during the pendency of a bankruptcy case.we agree with the trustee 
under the bankruptcy code,the commencement of a bankruptcy case creates an estate comprising all legal and equitable interests in property including potentially exempt property of the debtor as of that date the debtor may have certain property exempted from the bankruptcy estate by electing to take advantage of either the federal exemption provisions in the bankruptcy code or those provided under state law as to the alternative,the bankruptcy code provides the exemption for 
any property that is exempt under state or local law that is applicable on the date of the filing of the petition at the place in which the debtor domicile has been located for the days immediately preceding the date of the filing of the petition,or for a longer portion of such period than in any other place 
as the supreme court noted in owen owen n othing in subsection b of or elsewhere in the code limits a state power to restrict the scope of its exemptions indeed,it could theoretically accord no exemptions at all.any exemptions claimed,however,are determined by the facts and the law as they exist on the date of filing the bankruptcy petition this focus on the status as of the date of filing is commonly referred to as the snapshot approach to determining the extent of the bankruptcy estate and the scope of the exemptions.
when the zibmans filed their bankruptcy petition on february,they exercised the option and elected to claim exemptions offered by texas state law.now as in february of,texas law provides a homestead exemption,as follows 
interests in land exempt from seizure 
a a homestead is exempt from seizure for the claims of creditors except for encumbrances properly fixed on homestead property.
c the homestead claimant proceeds of a sale of a homestead are not subject to seizure for a creditor claim for six months after the date of sale 
as noted above,the zibmans sold their texas homestead in late november,and filed for bankruptcy just over three months later,in early february.when,by may,the statutory protection period had expired without the zibmans having reinvested their homestead sale proceeds in a new texas homestead,the trustee objected to the exemption of the proceeds.in rejecting the trustee objection,the bankruptcy court stated that,o n the petition date,these funds were exempt.post petition acts or failures to act does sic not effect sic the exempt status.
in reaching its conclusion,the bankruptcy court cited in re harlan a bankruptcy court case that also involved the filing of a bankruptcy petition during the period in which proceeds from the sale of a homestead continued to enjoy protection under the texas statute.the harlan court in turn relied on white stump to arrive at its holding that the debtors homestead proceeds were exempt on the date that they filed their petition because their petition was filed within six months of the date of the sale of their homestead,and that because the substantive rights of the parties were fixed on the date of the filing of the petition the proceeds must,therefore,be allowed as exempt,regardless of what use the debtors might make of the proceeds after the date of the filing of their petition.as the following analysis will show,white stump introduced the snapshot theory,but both courts misapplied the holding of white to this fact pattern.a later supreme court case,myers matley illustrates the appropriate refinement of white when the state law in question includes a condition on its application.
