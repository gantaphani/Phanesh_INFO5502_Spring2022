james petralia appeals the bankruptcy appellate panel bap affirmance of the bankruptcy court order granting judgment in favor of debtor george jercich in petralia action seeking to have a debt excepted from discharge under a.we have jurisdiction under d.we reverse.
the underlying facts of this case are undisputed.from june to january,petralia was employed by george jercich,a real estate company wholly owned and operated by debtor jercich.the company performed mortgage broker services,and petralia primary duty was to obtain investors to fund loans arranged by jercich.pursuant to an employment agreement between petralia and jercich,petralia was to be paid a salary plus a commission for loans which were funded through his efforts.the commissions were to be paid on a monthly basis.
jercich failed to pay petralia his commissions as required under the employment agreement.petralia quit his employment with jercich in january and in february filed an action against jercich in california state court.in this action,petralia sought to recover,among other things,unpaid wages,waiting time penalties penalties imposed on employers under california law for failure to timely pay employees,and punitive damages.
after a bench trial,the state court granted judgment in favor of petralia.the court found that jercich had not paid petralia commissions and vacation pay as required under the employment contract that jercich had the clear ability to make these payments to petralia,but chose not to that instead of paying petralia and other employees the money owed to them,jercich utilized the funds from his company to pay for a wide variety of personal investments,including a horse ranch and that jercich behavior was willful and amounted to oppression within the meaning of california civil code the state court held,in relevant part,that petralia was entitled to his unpaid wages that jercich owed petralia waiting time penalties and that because jercich failure to pay was willful and deliberate and constituted substantial oppression,punitive damages would be assessed against jercich in the amount of.the state trial court judgment against jercich was affirmed by the california court of appeal in an opinion filed in may.
while the appeal of the state trial court judgment was pending,jercich filed a chapter bankruptcy petition.in november,after the state trial court judgment had been affirmed on appeal,petralia initiated the present adversary proceeding seeking to have the state court judgment excepted from discharge under a 
the bankruptcy court resolved the adversary proceeding in favor of jercich.the court found that under the supreme court decision in kawaauhau geiger the state court would have had to find that jercich did what he did with a specific intent,to use a criminal law term,of harming petralia.but no such finding was made,nor can that conclusion be inferred from the findings that were made by the state court.the bankruptcy court therefore held that the debt was dischargeable.
bap affirmed in a published opinion,but for different reasons than stated by the bankruptcy court.bap held that where a debtor conduct constitutes both a breach of contract and a tort,the debt resulting from that conduct does not fit within a unless the liability for the tort is independent of the liability on the contract.defining a tort as independent only if the conduct at issue would be tortious even if a contract between the parties did not exist,bap concluded that there was not a tort independent of the contract and that the debt was not,therefore,excepted from discharge under a 
we review independently the decision of the bankruptcy court,showing no deference to the decision of the bap.we review de novo the bankruptcy court conclusions of law,and we review for clear error the bankruptcy court findings of fact.
section a excepts from discharge debts resulting from willful and malicious injury by the debtor to another entity or to the property of another entity.in in re riso,we recognized that a simple breach of contract is not the type of injury addressed by a and held that a n intentional breach of contract is excepted from discharge under a only when it is accompanied by malicious and willful tortious conduct.
by holding,in the present case,that the debt was not excepted from discharge under a,bap imposed an additional requirement not only must there be tortious conduct,but according to bap,this conduct must be tortious even if a contract between the parties did not exist.we disagree with the imposition of this additional requirement.
first,there is nothing in the language of a to indicate that a debt arising from a breach of contract is excepted from discharge only if the debtor conduct would be tortious even if no contract existed to the contrary,although a generally applies to torts rather than to contracts and an intentional breach of contract generally will not give rise to a nondischargeable debt,where an intentional breach of contract is accompanied by tortious conduct which results in willful and malicious injury,the resulting debt is excepted from discharge under a 
moreover,one of the fundamental policies of bankruptcy law is to give a fresh start only to the honest but unfortunate debtor.in fact,congress decision to make the debts listed under a nondischargeable reflect s a decision by congress that the fresh start policy is not always paramount.for example,some of the exceptions to discharge in a are based on a corollary of the policy of giving honest debtors a fresh start,which would be to deny dishonest debtors a fresh start.see,a,and.allowing discharge of debts simply because the tortious conduct at issue would not be tortious in the absence of a contract would negate this fundamental policy.
we therefore hold that to be excepted from discharge under a,a breach of contract must be accompanied by some form of tortious conduct that gives rise to willful and malicious injury.in so holding,we reject bap imposition of a requirement that the conduct at issue be tortious even if a contract between the parties did not exist.
tortious conduct 
to determine whether jercich conduct was tortious,we look to california state law under california law,c onduct amounting to a breach of contract becomes tortious only when it also violates an independent duty arising from principles of tort law.
outside the area of insurance contracts,tort recovery for the bad faith breach of a contract is permitted only when,in addition to the breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing a defendant conduct violates a fundamental public policy of the state.the california court of appeal has held that the prompt payment of wages due an employee is a fundamental public policy in california as that court explained 
public policy has long favored the full and prompt payment of wages due an employee.wages are not ordinary debts.because of the economic position of the average worker and,in particular,his family,it is essential to the public welfare that he receive his pay promptly.thus,the prompt payment of wages serves society interest through a more stable job market,in which its most important policies are safeguarded.
labor code section,subdivision a provides any employer who,having the ability to pay,willfully refuses to pay wages due and payable after demand has been made is guilty of a misdemeanor.the legislature decision to criminalize violations of the prompt payment policy also supports the conclusion that the policy for full and prompt payment of wages involves a broad public interest,not merely the interest of the employee 
in the present case,the state trial court found that jercich had the clear ability to pay petralia his wages when they were due,but willfully chose not to in violation of california law the court also found that jercich acts amounted to oppression under california civil code,which by definition must involve despicable conduct that subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that person rights.as the court explained few,if any,areas of the law are more important than an employer obligation to pay his employee wages.california courts
