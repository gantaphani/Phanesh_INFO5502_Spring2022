this bankruptcy appeal is the latest in litigation over a lucrative banquet facility,the regatta club in newport,rhode island,which was constructed on a parcel of land at a time when the validity of the development rights to that parcel was in dispute.in and,the rhode island supreme court found that the development rights had expired at the time of construction.see am.condo.ass idc,america i,am.condo.ass idc,america ii.as a result,it found that title to both the land and the regatta club belonged to a group of condominium associations,not to idc,and idc properties,properties,the development entities that had incurred the cost to build the club.two of the associations,capella south condominium association,and goat island south condominium association,the associations,are the appellees and in this suit.idc clambakes,clambakes,the debtor here,was not a party before the rhode island supreme court.
following the america decisions,clambakes,which operated the regatta club,voluntarily filed for bankruptcy under chapter of the bankruptcy code.the associations then filed proofs of claim seeking relief for clambakes alleged trespass on their property between and april,the date of the america ii decision.in,this court rejected that trespass claim,affirming the bankruptcy court finding that the associations had impliedly consented to clambakes use and occupancy of the regatta club.see in re idc clambakes,cir.we also remanded on the issue of whether there was a corresponding implied obligation that clambakes pay the associations for its use and occupancy of the club.see id.at.
on remand,the bankruptcy court first found that there was no contract between the parties such that clambakes was contractually obligated to make rent payments to the associations.the bankruptcy court then considered whether the associations were nonetheless entitled to relief under a theory of unjust enrichment.the court answered that question in the negative,finding that the benefit that the associations conferred on clambakes was fully offset by the value that the associations themselves gained by being awarded ownership over the regatta club facility.see in re idc clambakes,clambakes,bankr.
the district court disagreed,finding clear error in the bankruptcy court characterization of the benefit conferred on clambakes as merely a ground lease,as well as in the bankruptcy court unjust enrichment analysis.central to the district court reasoning was its reading of the america opinions as to the ownership of the regatta club.the district court held that the findings in the america opinions must serve as established facts and bind a ny equitable analysis in this lawsuit.goat island condo.ass idc clambakes,goat island.ultimately,the district court concluded that clambakes owed the associations million for its use and occupancy of the regatta club during the claim period.id.at.
we affirm the bankruptcy court decision to award no equitable relief to the associations.no contract existed between the parties.as to unjust enrichment,we see nothing in the america opinions to suggest that their holding regarding the regatta club ownership should bear on,much less control,the question of whether principles of equity entitle the associations to even more relief than the rhode island supreme court already afforded them.having concluded that the america opinions did not bind the bankruptcy court equitable authority,we find no abuse of discretion in the bankruptcy court ultimate decision that the associations failed to meet their burden of showing that inequity would result if clambakes did not pay them for the use and occupancy of the regatta club during the claim period.equity does not bestow additional relief on the associations,which continue to benefit from the regatta club facility that they inherited without any investment of their own.
the saga of this litigation has been exhaustively documented by various state and federal courts.we recite only those facts relevant to this appeal.we rely principally on the bankruptcy court recounting of the facts,which the district court also adopted in full.see clambakes,at goat island,at.
in january,globe manufacturing globe recorded a declaration of condominium in the land evidence records of the city of newport.clambakes,at.that declaration,as amended and restated in march,reserved globe right to develop a parcel of land known as the reserved area,but the development rights would expire if not exercised by december.id.globe assigned its development rights to idc,and then to properties id.from april to december,properties introduced multiple amendments to the declaration seeking to extend the expiration date for the development rights and to exercise those rights.id.the associations questioned the validity of these amendments,and negotiations over the amendments carried on for years.id.
in late and early,while negotiations over properties development rights were ongoing,properties spent approximately million to construct the regatta club in the reserved area.id.despite the ongoing dispute over the development rights,the record reveals no evidence that the associations sought to halt the construction.id.as the bankruptcy court noted 
in an letter during this conflict,a representative of the america condominium association wrote to the newport building inspector on february,it our understanding that a permit application has been filed with your office for the purpose of constructing the regatta club while we do have a particular objection as to the land use with respect to the building itself,we do have a substantial problem with the parking requirements for that building 
id.alterations in original.
clambakes came into existence on april,as a corporate entity separate from the other idc entities.id.at.on march,clambakes and properties entered into a lease,under which clambakes would use the regatta club and surrounding land making up the reserved area to provide event hosting and catering services.id.clambakes would pay properties an annual rent equal to the higher of or six percent of clambakes annual gross revenues.id.clambakes began operating the club in late and began paying rent to properties in.id.until clambakes filed for bankruptcy on june,it ran a profitable business during the approximately seven years it operated the regatta club.id.
a.the america litigation 
on may,the associations sued roos,idc,and properties in state court.id.clambakes was not a party to that suit.the associations alleged that properties had failed to exercise its development rights with respect to the reserved area before the december,expiration date that the declaration amendments that had sought to extend the expiration date were invalid and that as a result,fee simple title to the reserved area had vested in the condominium unit owners on whose behalf the associations acted.id.
in america i,the rhode island supreme court ruled in favor of the associations.see at.it found that the amendments were invalid because they did not conform to the requirements of the rhode island condominium act.see laws to america i,at.accordingly,properties had failed to exercise its development rights before their expiration,and title to the disputed property had vested in the associations.id.at.in reaching this conclusion,the supreme court rejected the defendants argument that they had invested million in developing the regatta club and that this investment should weigh against the associations winning title to the club considering that the defendants developed the reserved area at a time when they were on notice that their right to do so was in dispute,we conclude that they constructed the parcel at their peril and can not now contend that equity should prevent plaintiffs from prevailing because of their expenditures.id.at.
nonetheless,the rhode island supreme court remanded for an accounting of the common expenses that properties had continued to pay for the reserved area after december,the date on which its development rights expired.id.t o permit the plaintiffs to enjoy the benefits of such expenditures would constitute an inequitable windfall.id.in remanding for this purpose,the court expressly stated that the accounting should not include any profits that properties may have earned from its operation of the newport regatta club.id.at.
on april,after hearing reargument,the rhode island supreme court reaffirmed its ruling that title to the reserved area,including the regatta club,rested with the associations.see america ii,at.
clambakes bankruptcy filing and first circuit decision 
after the america ii decision,the associations asked the state court to issue writs of execution for possession and ejectment of clambakes from the reserved area.clambakes,at.on june,clambakes voluntarily filed for bankruptcy under chapter of the bankruptcy code.see clambakes,at.in august,a bankruptcy court judge entered a consent order that allowed clambakes to operate the regatta club until november,after appropriately remunerating the associations.clambakes,at.clambakes complied and vacated the premises after hosting its final event on that date.id.
another order dated march,confirmed a plan of reorganization for clambakes,under which its creditors would be paid in full.funds to pay the associations were escrowed because of the dispute over the amount,if any,that clambakes owed the associations.id.the associations collectively asserted a claim for approximately million for clambakes alleged trespass on the reserved area from march,the date on which the lease for the regatta club began to april.id.clambakes objected to the associations proofs of claim,and the bankruptcy court granted summary judgment in clambakes favor.id.at.after much procedural history that we need not recount,the bankruptcy court held that the associations had impliedly consented to clambakes use and occupancy of the reserved area and thus that clambakes had not trespassed.id.the district court affirmed.
on appeal before this court,we first affirmed the bankruptcy court conclusion that clambakes had not trespassed because the associations had given implied consent to clambakes use and occupancy of the reserved area.see in re idc clambakes,at.next,we turned to the associations argument that implied consent necessarily gives rise to an implied obligation to pay.id.at.although the associations had properly preserved this argument,we found that it was insufficiently developed for proper adjudication on appeal,as the bankruptcy court had not addressed it.id.at.we thus remanded for determination of whether implied consent in this case also gives rise to an implied obligation to pay the fair value for use and occupancy of the property.id.
c.the bankruptcy and district courts decisions on remand 
on remand,the associations advanced three arguments before the bankruptcy court.first,they argued that in the context of a trespass action,implied consent includes a presumed obligation to pay fair value absent proof of contrary intent.clambakes,at.second,they argued that there was an contract between the parties such that clambakes was obligated to pay the associations.id.at.finally,they argued that they were entitled to relief under a theory of contract,also known as or unjust enrichment.id.at.
the bankruptcy court quickly rejected the associations first argument,noting that there was no rhode island case law to support the proposition that implied consent necessarily gives rise to a presumptive obligation to pay fair value absent a showing of contrary intent.id.at.the court also ruled that the associations had failed to show the existence of an contract because there was no evidence of a mutual intent between the parties to enter into an agreement for the use and occupancy of the reserved area.id.at.
likewise,the bankruptcy court found that the associations failed to prove their entitlement to equitable relief.recovery in requires a plaintiff to prove that the plaintiff conferred a benefit on the defendant,the defendant appreciated the benefit,and under the circumstances it would be inequitable for the defendant to retain such benefit without payment of the value thereof.id.quoting fondedile,maguire.while the associations had carried their burden of proof as to the first two elements,id.at,the bankruptcy court concluded that they had failed to do so as to the third element,id.at.
in arriving at this result,the bankruptcy court first relied on expert testimony from both parties to estimate that the benefit that the associations conferred on clambakes allowing it to use and occupy the reserved area land was worth between million and million.id.at.the unjust enrichment inquiry did not end there,however.the court observed that the associations had denied roos permission to remove the regatta club structure from the reserved area after the america ii decision,even though the owner of land is entitled to a mandatory injunction to require the removal of a structure that has been unlawfully placed upon his land.id.at quoting santilli morelli.accordingly,since the associations chose to retain and profit from the regatta club,the resulting benefit reaped by the associations must factor into the analysis.id.at.
from this perspective,the bankruptcy court considered the fact that properties had invested million to build the regatta club while the associations had not invested any amount that clambakes had spent more than to outfit and maintain the club,and that the associations had been able to rent the club building to another tenant within two weeks of the date when clambakes vacated the premises.id.at.of the minimum annual rent of that the new tenant pays the associations,was attributable to the regatta club structure,based on both parties expert testimony.id.at.taking all of these factors into account,the bankruptcy court concluded that clambakes is entitled to a credit for at least,equal to the high end of the value of a ground lease conferred on clambakes.id.at.
the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court conclusion that no contract existed,but it found reversible error in the bankruptcy court unjust enrichment analysis.see goat island,at.before delving into the particularities of the bankruptcy court alleged errors,the district court first noted that,notwithstanding the million that properties incurred to build the regatta club,the rhode island supreme court had ruled that the associations owned the club since its construction.id.at.these determinations are the established facts of this case,and this proceeding can not be a vehicle to revisit or temper the effects of those holdings,the district court said.id.at.
from that premise,the district court ruled that the bankruptcy court committed clear error on four fronts.first,the bankruptcy court should not have characterized the benefit conferred on clambakes as a ground lease but rather as a ground and building lease.properly characterized,according to the district court,the value of the benefit to clambakes was million.id.at.second,the bankruptcy court should not have considered the million that properties had incurred in constructing the regatta club.id.at.third,the bankruptcy court should not have considered the that clambakes had incurred in outfitting and maintaining the regatta club.id.finally,the bankruptcy court should not have deduct ed at least per year from the use and occupancy payment to account for goodwill and the value of the regatta club when there was insufficient particularized evidence on which to ground the quantification of that goodwill.id.at.the district court ordered clambakes to pay the associations million for its use and occupancy of the regatta club during the claim period id.
arguments on appeal 
each party appeals discrete aspects of the bankruptcy and district courts decisions.clambakes argues that the bankruptcy court should not have reached the associations arguments about contract and unjust enrichment.further,even assuming the unjust enrichment claim was properly heard,clambakes challenges the district court finding of clear error in the bankruptcy court equitable analysis.
the associations argue that the bankruptcy and district courts both erred in finding that no contract existed.they also argue that the bankruptcy court erred in awarding no restitutionary relief and that the district court er
