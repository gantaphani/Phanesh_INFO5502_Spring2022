plaintiff kathleen ah quin contends that her employer,defendant county of kauai department of transportation,discriminated against her because she is a woman.while pursuing this action,however,plaintiff filed for chapter bankruptcy protection and initially failed to list this action in her bankruptcy schedules.the district court held that judicial estoppel prohibits her from proceeding and,therefore,granted summary judgment to defendant.we hold that the district court applied the wrong legal standard in determining whether plaintiff bankruptcy omission was mistaken or inadvertent.accordingly,we vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings.
factual and procedural history 
plaintiff initiated this action on november.she alleges that,because of her gender,defendant reduced her work hours and denied her status,in violation of various discrimination statutes and under the common law.on december,the district court denied defendant motion for summary judgment on the merits.the court scheduled the case for a jury trial in april.
meanwhile,plaintiff had obtained bankruptcy protection.represented by a different lawyer than her lawyer in this case,plaintiff filed for chapter bankruptcy on april.a debtor must list all pending lawsuits in the bankruptcy schedules,but plaintiff checked the box none next to this line item list all suits and administrative proceedings to which the debtor is or was a party within one year immediately preceding the filing of this bankruptcy case.emphasis omitted.at a bankruptcy hearing,plaintiff testified that she had listed all of her assets and that the answers in her petition and schedules are true and correct.she did not mention this pending action.during a colloquy concerning her husband losing his job,plaintiff responded to a question about whether she had a claim by saying no.no.on september,the bankruptcy court issued an order of discharge and closed the case.
at some point,plaintiff lawyer in this case became aware of the potential effect of plaintiff bankruptcy proceeding.at a settlement conference on december,plaintiff lawyer informed defendant of plaintiff bankruptcy filing.
on december,defendant wrote a letter to the district court setting forth the position that it could move to dismiss the action under the doctrine of judicial estoppel.the next day,the district court vacated all dates and deadlines,and it scheduled a status conference for january.
on january,plaintiff moved to reopen her bankruptcy case and to set aside the discharge.the motion,accompanied by declarations from her bankruptcy lawyer staff and from plaintiff,explained that plaintiff had never disclosed the pending lawsuit to her bankruptcy lawyer or his staff and that plaintiff failure to list the lawsuit as an asset stemmed from plaintiff misunderstanding of what she was required to do.the bankruptcy court reopened the case the same day.plaintiff amended her bankruptcy schedules to list this pending claim as an asset.
on february,defendant filed a motion for summary judgment in the discrimination action,on the ground that judicial estoppel prohibits plaintiff from proceeding.the district court agreed and granted summary judgment in an order dated april.plaintiff timely appeals.
on june,the bankruptcy trustee filed a report that abandoned the trustee interest in the pending discrimination action.plaintiff unsecured creditors did not object to that action by the trustee.on july,the bankruptcy court closed the reopened case.

although judicial estoppel is probably not reducible to any general formulation of principle,several factors typically inform the decision whether to apply the doctrine in a particular case.id.at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.first,a party later position must be clearly inconsistent with its earlier position.id.second,courts regularly inquire whether the party has succeeded in persuading a court to accept that party earlier position,so that judicial acceptance of an inconsistent position in a later proceeding would create the perception that either the first or the second court was misled.id.internal quotation marks omitted.a third consideration is whether the party seeking to assert an inconsistent position would derive an unfair advantage or impose an unfair detriment on the opposing party if not estopped.id.at.in enumerating these factors,we do not establish inflexible prerequisites or an exhaustive formula for determining the applicability of judicial estoppel.additional considerations may inform the doctrine application in specific factual contexts.id.
in the bankruptcy context,the federal courts have developed a basic default rule if a omits a pending or lawsuit from the bankruptcy schedules and obtains a discharge or plan confirmation,judicial estoppel bars the action.see,payless wholesale,alberto culver,cir conceal your claims get rid of your creditors on the cheap,and start over with a bundle of rights.this is a palpable fraud that the court will not tolerate,even passively.hay first interstate bank of kalispell,cir holding that f ailure to give the required notice to the bankruptcy court estops the and justifies the grant of summary judgment to the defendants.the reason is that the represented in the bankruptcy case that no claim existed,so he or she is estopped from representing in the lawsuit that a claim does exist.that basic rule comports fully with the supreme court decision in new hampshire the positions are clearly inconsistent a claim does not exist a claim does exist the succeeded in getting the first court the bankruptcy court to accept the first position and the obtained an unfair advantage discharge or plan confirmation without allowing the creditors to learn of the pending lawsuit.the general rule also comports fully with the policy reasons underlying the doctrine of judicial estoppel to prevent litigants from playing fast and loose with the courts and to protect the integrity of the judicial system.new hampshire,at.
of particular relevance here,though,the supreme court held in new hampshire,that it may be appropriate to resist application of judicial estoppel when a party prior position was based on inadvertence or mistake.at internal quotation marks omitted.we have not addressed the effect of an inadvertent or mistaken omission from a bankruptcy filing,but several of our sister circuits have.eastman union pac,cir burnes pemco aeroplex,cir browning levy,cir browning mims in re coastal plains,cir.those courts generally have interpreted this factor narrowly.the courts have asked not whether the debtor omission of the pending claim from the bankruptcy schedules was inadvertent or mistaken instead,they have asked only whether the debtor knew about the claim when he or she filed the bankruptcy schedules and whether the debtor had a motive to conceal the claim.see,eastman,at where a debtor has both knowledge of the claims and a motive to conceal them,courts routinely,albeit at times sub silentio,infer deliberate manipulation.this interpretation of inadvertence is narrow in part because the motive to conceal claims from the bankruptcy court is,as several courts have explained,nearly always present.jethroe omnova solutions,cir coastal plains,at.
here,the district court applied that narrow interpretation.defendant argued repeatedly to the district court that,to overcome plaintiff inadvertence argument,all it had to show was that plaintiff knew of her claim and had a motive to conceal the claim from the bankruptcy court.defendant argued that the doctrine of judicial estoppel should be and must be applied to plaintiff circumstances.the district court appeared to adopt defendant argument.it reasoned i think the court is bound to apply that law to the circumstances we have here and accordingly,summary judgment will be entered in favor of the defense.emphasis added.the district court belief that it was bound to preclude plaintiff from bringing her discrimination claim is mistaken and fundamentally at odds with equitable principles.judicial estoppel is a discretionary doctrine,applied on a basis.see new hampshire,at refusing to establish inflexible prerequisites or an exhaustive formula for determining the applicability of judicial estoppel.a court is not bound to apply judicial estoppel,particularly when a party prior position was based on inadvertence or mistake.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
the court held that plaintiff bankruptcy filing was not inadvertent because,as plaintiff concedes,she knew about the existence of this action when she filed for bankruptcy and because,as is true in practically all bankruptcy cases,plaintiff had a motive to conceal the claim keeping any potential proceeds from creditors.
the parties dispute whether the district court applied the correct legal standard when it found that plaintiff omission was not a result of inadvertence or mistake.see,milton greene archives,marilyn monroe llc,cir holding that,when reviewing applications of judicial estoppel,we first must determine whether the trial court identified the correct legal rule.the starting point for our analysis is that our cases have not addressed the effect of an inadvertent or mistaken omission from a bankruptcy filing many of the dissent arguments hinge on its repeated assertions that our previous cases have already answered this question,dissent at,despite the fact that not one of our previous cases has even considered it.we are unwilling to glean the legal standard for what constitutes inadvertence or mistake in a bankruptcy filing from cases that plainly did not concern that factor.as explained below,we agree with plaintiff that the district court erred in applying the narrow interpretation of inadvertence because,in the circumstances,that interpretation is too stringent.
a key factor is that plaintiff reopened her bankruptcy proceedings and filed amended bankruptcy schedules that properly listed this claim as an asset.when a has not reopened bankruptcy proceedings,a narrow exception for good faith is consistent with new hampshire and with the policies animating the doctrine of judicial estoppel.the three primary new hampshire factors are still met inconsistency,bankruptcy court accepted the contrary position,to the debtor unfair advantage.and,as courts repeatedly stress,the importance of full disclosure in bankruptcy proceedings can not be overemphasized.coastal plains,at see also,ryan operations santiam midwest lumber,cir t he importance of full and honest disclosure can not be overstated.oneida motor freight,united jersey bank,cir holding that we can not overemphasize the debtor obligation to provide full disclosure.in sum,given the strong need for full disclosure in bankruptcy proceedings and the fact that the received an unfair advantage in the bankruptcy court,it makes sense to apply a presumption of deliberate manipulation.see eastman,at that he well knew of his pending lawsuit and simply did not disclose it to the bankruptcy court is the only reasonable inference to be drawn from the evidence.but where,as here,the reopens bankruptcy proceedings,corrects her initial error,and allows the bankruptcy court to the bankruptcy with the full and correct information,a presumption of deceit no longer comports with new hampshire.
along with most of our sister circuits,we have held that at least where the does not claim inadvertence or mistake the reopening of a bankruptcy case is generally irrelevant to the analysis of judicial estoppel.eastman,at barger city of cartersville,cir burnes,at hamilton,at oneida,at.that is,even if a corrects the initial mistake and no longer receives a benefit in bankruptcy court,judicial estoppel still applies wiping out a potentially meritorious action against an unrelated third party.courts have provided three primary justifications for the rule.
first,as noted above,supra,full disclosure in bankruptcy is essential to the functioning of the bankruptcy system,a fact that can not be overemphasized.coastal plains,f d at.second,the initial disclosures failed to tell the creditors about the lawsuit.see,hamilton,at holding that an initial discharge of debt by a bankruptcy court,under these circumstances,is sufficient acceptance to provide a basis for judicial estoppel,even if the discharge is later vacated oneida,at the original bankruptcy plan was informationally deficient,and not cured by the later modification.the original plan failed to alert the creditors to the possible financial benefits enuring to them upon the successful prosecution of the claim.footnote omitted.finally,and perhaps most importantly,courts have held that application of judicial estoppel is necessary in order to incentivize future debtors and their lawyers to provide full disclosure.in an passage,one court wrote 
the success of our bankruptcy laws requires a debtor full and honest disclosure.allowing the debtor to,the bankruptcy case,and amend his bankruptcy filings,only after his omission has been challenged by an adversary,suggests that a debtor should consider disclosing potential assets only if he is caught concealing them.this remedy would only diminish the necessary incentive to provide the bankruptcy court with a truthful disclosure of the debtors assets.
as the seventh circuit has recognized in unanimous opinions,biesek soo line,cir,and cannon stokes potter,cir,and as judge stapleton recognized in dissent in oneida,those justifications do not withstand scrutiny.first,and perhaps most importantly,once a has amended his or her bankruptcy schedules and the bankruptcy court has processed or the bankruptcy with full information,two of the three primary new hampshire factors are no longer met.although the initially took inconsistent positions,the bankruptcy court ultimately did not accept the initial position.the supreme court put it well absent success in a prior proceeding,a party later inconsistent position introduces no risk of inconsistent court determinations and thus poses little threat to judicial integrity.new hampshire,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
moreover,the did not obtain an unfair advantage indeed,the obtained no advantage at all,because he or she did not obtain any benefit whatsoever in the bankruptcy proceedings.see dunmore united states,cir holding that the district court allowing the to reopen his bankruptcy case,thereby preventing the from having his cake and eating it too,was a permissible alternative to judicial estoppel that prevented him from deriving an unfair advantage if not estopped.cases such as oneida,at,which justify the application of judicial estoppel because the creditors were not told initially of the pending action are wrong for two reasons the creditors are told eventually,and the doctrine of judicial estoppel is concerned with the integrity of the courts,not the effect on parties.see,ryan,f d at judicial estoppel is intended to protect the courts rather than the litigants.internal quotation marks omitted.
next,there is some intuitive appeal to the deterrence justification punishing wrongdoers will incentivize future debtors to list their assets exhaustively.but that justification is a very awkward fit for the doctrine of judicial estoppel.judicial estoppel typically operates to protect the integrity of the judicial system with respect to the particular litigant in front of the court.in the context of judicial estoppel,it is odd to punish a present litigant merely in order to discourage inconsistent positions by future litigants.moreover,the courts that have mentioned this justification phrase it in terms not of protecting the courts but of promoting the efficient operation of the bankruptcy system.that aim protecting the bankruptcy system differs from the goal of judicial estoppel protecting the integrity of the courts.to the extent that the bankruptcy system lacks adequate protections,that is a shortcoming not of the court system,but of the bankruptcy laws.
in any event,the bankruptcy system already provides plenty of protections.the bankruptcy court or trustee may reopen a case if it uncovers deception,as occurred in hamilton,at.here,plaintiff voluntarily initiated the reopening.a case may be reopened even if it has long been closed.b fed.a bankruptcy court or trustee can impose sanctions,including denial of a discharge.fed.and,of course,a case may be referred to the united states attorney office for criminal prosecution.see criminalizing the concealment of assets,false oaths,and claims.the availability of such a course of action would in most cases adequately deter nondisclosure.oneida,at stapleton,dissenting.
finally,the application of judicial estoppel in these circumstances operates to the detriment primarily of innocent creditors and to the benefit of only an alleged bad actor.when a amends his or her bankruptcy schedules to include the previously omitted lawsuit,the creditors may now stake a claim in that lawsuit.by not permitting the civil action to go forward,the creditors lose out on a potential recovery.see cannon stokes,at judicial estoppel is an equitable doctrine,and it is not equitable to employ it to injure creditors who are themselves victims of the debtor deceit.oneida,at stapleton,dissenting the bankruptcy code disclosure requirements are intended to protect those creditors whom a debtor failure to disclose hidden assets would prejudice.a fortiori,a court response to nondisclosure should do likewise.
perversely,the only winner in this scenario is the alleged bad actor in the estopped lawsuit.see oneida,at stapleton,dissenting the only real winner in the case as decided is the defendant,whom the court has relieved of the responsibility of justifying its allegedly improper behavior.if defendant here did,in fact,discriminate against plaintiff it will not have to pay the consequences of its actions,for the entirely unrelated reason that plaintiff happened to file for bankruptcy and,possibly due to inadvertence,happened to omit the claim from her initial schedules.further,because the application of judicial estoppel does not look to the nature of the underlying claim,the alleged bad actor could be someone who clearly does not warrant a windfall,someone who physically assaulted the plaintiff and badly injured him or her.it seems hard to justify a policy that takes money from innocent creditors and gives it,for example,to a violent criminal.see oneida,at stapleton,dissenting the debtor unsecured creditors should not be required to contribute towards a windfall for an alleged wrongdoer.
writing for a unanimous panel of the seventh circuit,judge easterbrook summarized 
judges understandably favor rules that encourage full disclosure in bankruptcy.yet pursuing that end by applying judicial estoppel to debtors would have adverse effects on third parties the creditors.the debtor nondisclosure in bankruptcy harmed his creditors by hiding assets from them.using this same nondisclosure to wipe out his statutory claim would complete the job by denying creditors even the right to seek some share of the recovery.yet the creditors have not contradicted themselves in court.they were not aware of what the debtor has been doing behind their backs.creditors gypped by the debtor maneuver are hurt a second time by the district judge decision.judicial estoppel is an equitable doctrine,and using it to land another blow on the victims of bankruptcy fraud is not an equitable application.instead of vaporizing assets that could be used for the creditors benefit,district judges should discourage bankruptcy fraud by revoking the debtors discharges and referring them to the united states attorney for potential criminal prosecution.
the analysis by the seventh circuit and judge stapleton supports our conclusion that,when the has reopened the bankruptcy proceedings and has corrected the initial filing error,the narrow interpretations of mistake and inadvertence do not apply.if plaintiff bankruptcy omission was mistaken,the application of judicial estoppel in this case would do nothing to protect the integrity of the courts,would enure to the benefit only of an alleged bad actor,and would eliminate any prospect that plaintiff unsecured creditors might have of recovering 
in these circumstances,rather than applying a presumption of deceit,judicial estoppel requires an inquiry into whether the plaintiff bankruptcy filing was,in fact,inadvertent or mistaken,as those terms are commonly understood.courts must determine whether the omission occurred by accident or was made without intent to conceal.the relevant inquiry is not limited to the plaintiff knowledge of the pending claim and the universal motive to conceal a potential asset though those are certainly factors.the relevant inquiry is,more broadly,the plaintiff subjective intent when filling out and signing the bankruptcy schedules.
we recognize that,by adopting the ordinary understanding of mistake and inadvertence in this context,we differ from the test articulated by most of our sister circuits whether the plaintiff knew of the claims and had a motive to conceal them.our review of our sister circuits case law,however,suggests that their application of the rule has not been as rigid as one would expect.we read many of those cases as implicitly recognizing the harsh results to which the narrow interpretation leads and avoiding that harsh result.
in browning,at,for instance,the chapter bankruptcy plan,ultimately confirmed by the bankruptcy court,conferred all benefits from the lawsuit to the creditors only.the sixth circuit held that,because all benefits would go to the creditors,the had lacked a motive to conceal the lawsuit.id.but one would expect the inquiry into motive to be focused on the time of omission,not viewed from the perspective of the conclusion of the bankruptcy proceedings.the almost certainly had a motive to conceal it just turned out that the bankruptcy court ultimate resolution of the case did not benefit the.see also eubanks cbsk fin,cir holding that judicial estoppel did not apply because the debtor attempted to disclose the claims to the bankruptcy court barger,at barkett,dissenting stating that judicial estoppel is not warranted because the debtor disclosed the claims to the bankruptcy court,albeit imperfectly ryan,at concluding that the debtor did not act in bad faith for several reasons,including that the confirmed bankruptcy plan conferred of the benefit to the creditors stallings hussmann,cir holding that judicial estoppel did not apply because the bankruptcy court dismissed the case on the trustee motion and therefore never discharged the debt.
the court in ryan,at,explained 
p olicy considerations militate against adopting a rule that the requisite intent for judicial estoppel can be inferred from the mere fact of nondisclosure in a bankruptcy proceeding.such a rule would unduly expand the reach of judicial estoppel in proceedings and would inevitably result in the preclusion of viable claims on the basis of inadvertent or inconsistencies.while we by no means denigrate the importance of full disclosure or condone nondisclosure in bankruptcy proceedings,we are unwilling to treat careless or inadvertent nondisclosures as equivalent to deliberate manipulation when administering the strong medicine of judicial estoppel.
we agree.but,rather than adopting a narrow interpretation of mistake and inadvertence and applying it broadly,we believe that an ordinary interpretation of those terms in these circumstances is more consistent with the supreme court decision in new hampshire,better reflects the equitable considerations underlying the doctrine,and will be less confusing for courts to apply.
turning to the evidence here,we find factual support for a conclusion either of mistake and inadvertence,or of deceit.on the one hand,plaintiff filed an affidavit in which she swore that,when she reviewed the bankruptcy schedules,she did not think that she had to disclose her pending lawsuit because the bankruptcy schedules were vague.also,in her bankruptcy schedules,she listed her lawyer as a creditor for she claims that,if she was truly seeking to hide the lawsuit from the bankruptcy court,she would not have listed that lawyer.indeed,it was that listing that ultimately caused the reopening of the bankruptcy case and defendant raising of judicial estoppel.contrary to defendant repeated assertion that plaintiff was caught,it was plaintiff counsel who first raised the bankruptcy to defendant attention at a settlement conference.on the other hand,plaintiff testimony at the bankruptcy hearing suggests that she should have been aware that a pending claim is relevant.similarly,the timing of the reopening of the bankruptcy case seems inculpatory she did not move to reopen the bankruptcy case until after defendant here raised the issue of judicial estoppel.but viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiff,and thus crediting her affidavit,pac.contractors ass n,cir,her bankruptcy filing was inadvertent.

we firmly disagree.because this case reaches us after the entry of summary judgment for defendant,we are required to interpret the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiff,at.the dissent has done an excellent job of marshaling the evidence that suggests that plaintiff was lying,including the colloquy with the bankruptcy court.but,in order to hold that plaintiff affidavit which concerns the quintessentially personal fact of state of mind is a sham,the content of the affidavit must be blatantly contradicted by the record.dissent at quoting scott harris.a full transcript of the colloquy,quoted by the dissent at,is nothing if not confusing.we agree that one could interpret the colloquy as having put plaintiff on notice that a lawsuit was relevant,id.at,but the colloquy is far from the smoking gun that the dissent portrays it to be.we easily conclude that the muddled colloquy is insufficient to hold,at this procedural stage,that plaintiff affidavit is a sham 
on remand,after such further factual development as may be appropriate,the district court might find that plaintiff affidavit is not trustworthy and that plaintiff omission was not mistaken or inadvertent.alternatively,the court might find that plaintiff omission was mistaken or inadvertent.we can not make that determination on this record.because the district court applied the wrong legal standard,we vacate the district court grant of summary judgment and remand for application of the correct legal standard.farris,at.

kathleen ah quin filed a discrimination lawsuit against the county of kauai department of transportation in which she sought approximately.she later claimed that her damages were,and in response to the county interrogatories she told the county she was entitled to.when ah quin filed for bankruptcy to get relief from less than in debt,she told the bankruptcy court there were no suits or administrative proceedings to which she is or was a party within the year preceding commencement of her bankruptcy,even though her discrimination suit was ongoing.that statement was obviously false.finding that ah quin failure to disclose this discrimination lawsuit during the bankruptcy proceedings was not based on mere inadvertence or mistake,and relying on our decision in hamilton state farm fire casualty,cir,the magistrate judge dismissed ah quin discrimination claim against the county on the basis of judicial estoppel.
the magistrate judge reliance on hamilton was understandable.in hamilton,we said all of the following 
we now hold that hamilton is precluded from pursuing claims about which he had knowledge,but did not disclose,during his bankruptcy proceedings.id.at.
judicial estoppel will be imposed when the debtor has knowledge of enough facts to know that a potential cause of action exists during the pendency of the bankruptcy,but fails to amend his schedules or disclosure statements to identify the cause of action as a contingent asset.id.
w e must invoke judicial estoppel to protect the integrity of the bankruptcy process.id.at.
d ischarge of debt by a bankruptcy court,under these circumstances,is sufficient acceptance to provide a basis for judicial estoppel,even if the discharge is later vacated.id.at.
in finding that the district court abused its discretion,the majority contravenes each of these clear declarations,inexplicably holding that the district court applied the wrong legal standard,op.at,and that the district court should have inquir ed into whether the plaintiff bankruptcy filing was,in fact,inadvertent or mistaken,op.at.with all due respect,that has never been the rule with regard to false statements that conceal assets from a bankruptcy court.the majority holding that the relevant inquiry when considering the inadvertence or mistake factor in determining whether to apply judicial estoppel in the bankruptcy context is not limited to the plaintiff knowledge of the pending claim and the universal motive to conceal a potential asset but rather examines more broadly,the plaintiff subjective intent,op.at is not only contrary to the law of our sister circuits,as the majority admits,see op.at but is also plainly at odds with our decision in hamilton and our earlier decision in hay first interstate bank of kalispell,cir failure to give the required notice in bankruptcy estops the bankruptcy petitioner.as evidenced by the quotations from hamilton provided above,the majority holding is not saved by the fact that it is limited to cases where the debtor has moved to reopen bankruptcy proceedings to vacate the inappropriate discharge,see op.at,and is made worse by the majority disparagement of applying judicial estoppel to protect the bankruptcy system,see op.at.the discord that the majority creates with hamilton and hay would be sufficient alone to prevent me from joining today opinion.
but even if i were to agree with the majority that we should adopt a broader understanding of the inadvertence or mistake factor in certain circumstances,the facts of this case can not support a finding of inadvertence or mistake even under such a broader understanding.taking the facts in the light most favorable to ah quin,the evidence can not support a finding that ah quin subjective intent was innocent.to the contrary,on this record,it is hard to see anything but a debtor who was caught in a lie and now seeks to avoid the consequences.worse still,unlike a typical case where the creditors would stand to benefit from allowing the lawsuit to proceed,here the trustee has abandoned the creditors interest in ah quin suit,so ah quin stands to benefit personally from her lie if her claim is not estopped.the facts of this case would not justify the remand ordered by the majority even under the broadened understanding of the inadvertence or mistake factor adopted by the majority.
finally,although there are reasons to believe that the majority broader understanding of the inadvertence or mistake factor might produce more equitable results in some cases,even if we were permitted to change our rule in the face of controlling precedent,the situation is not as as the majority suggests.the majority emphasizes the plight of creditors who lose recourse to claims that are dismissed on the basis of judicial estoppel,but the majority fails to sufficiently consider the other creditors and the debtors who will benefit from the better disclosure motivated by a strict estoppel rule.the majority concern for the plight of creditors also rings particularly hollow in this case,because the creditors interest has been abandoned here only ah quin stands to benefit from the generosity of the majority new rule.even writing on a blank slate,i would have significant concerns about the wisdom of the majority new rule,especially when applied in a situation like this one.
i must respectfully dissent.
hamilton involved a debtor,hamilton,who failed to list claims on his bankruptcy schedules before receiving a discharge.at.the bankruptcy court subsequently realized something untoward might be afoot,and when hamilton failed to cooperate with further inquiries,the bankruptcy court dismissed the bankruptcy and vacated the discharge.id.hamilton then pursued the insurancerelated claim,which the district court dismissed on the basis of judicial estoppel,granting summary judgment to the insurance company hamilton had sued.id.at.hamilton appealed to our court.
as we noted in our decision,the bankruptcy was dismissed and the discharge was vacated based on a trustee motion that cited hamilton bad faith,lack of truthfulness under oath,and failure to cooperate.id.at.as the majority notes,it was palpable from the record that hamilton bankruptcy omission was intentional in every sense of the term.op.at.but in upholding the district court dismissal based on judicial estoppel,we did not rely at all on hamilton intent.instead,we focused on his knowledge of the potential insurance claim.we said hamilton is precluded from pursuing claims about which he had knowledge,but did not disclose,during his bankruptcy proceedings.hamilton,at emphasis added.in discussing the extent to which hamilton had to have knowledge of the claim at the time of the bankruptcy filings,we added judicial estoppel will be imposed when the debtor has knowledge of enough facts to know that a potential cause of action exists during the pendency of the bankruptcy,but fails to amend his schedules or disclosure statements to identify the cause of action as a contingent asset.id.emphasis added.applying the rule to hamilton case,we noted that hamilton knew of all the material facts surrounding his insurance suit at the time he filed his bankruptcy schedules and for many months before pursuing legal action.id.at.we applied judicial estoppel and affirmed the district court.id.at.
the majority declines to engage with the language quoted above from hamilton.instead,the majority attempts to distinguish away hamilton by asserting that hamilton did not argue that his failure to disclose was based on inadvertence or mistake,and our opinion in hamilton did not mention,define,or consider the relevance of inadvertence or mistake.op.at see also op.at.though hamilton may not have argued that his failure to disclose the potential insurance suit was inadvertent the fact is that our stated test for the application of judicial estoppel in the bankruptcy context does not contemplate consideration of the debtor intent a debtor is precluded from pursuing claims about which he had knowledge,but did not disclose,during his bankruptcy proceedings,and j udicial estoppel will be imposed when the debtor has knowledge of enough facts to know that a potential cause of action exists during the pendency of the bankruptcy,but fails to amend his schedules or disclosure statements to identify the cause of action as a contingent asset.hamilton,at.
to be sure,the supreme court in new hampshire maine asserted that it may be appropriate to resist application of judicial estoppel when a party prior position was based on inadvertence or mistake,at internal quotation marks omitted,but that case involved a boundary dispute between two states,see id.at,a situation far removed from the bankruptcy context.the court discussion of judicial estoppel in new hampshire was offered at a very general level.see id.at.since new hampshire,as the majority notes,our sister circuits have interpreted this inadvertence or mistake factor narrowly in the bankruptcy context.op.at.in an opinion we endorsed repeatedly in hamilton,see at,the fifth circuit put the accepted rule plainly i n considering judicial estoppel for bankruptcy cases,the debtor failure to satisfy its statutory disclosure duty is inadvertent only when,in general,the debtor either lacks knowledge of the undisclosed claims or has no motive for their concealment.in re coastal plains,at emphases in original.
thus,hamilton is in no way inconsistent with new hampshire acknowledgment that judicial estoppel may be inappropriate where a party prior position was based on inadvertence or mistake.hamilton simply agrees with our sister circuits in reading this factor narrowly in the bankruptcy context in this context,accepting the normal assumption that there is always motive to conceal a claim from the bankruptcy court,op.at,there is only inadvertence or mistake where the debtor had no knowledge of the claim during bankruptcy proceedings and thus failed to disclose it.the majority concludes that our cases have not addressed the effect of an inadvertent or mistaken omission from a bankruptcy filing.op.at.i do not agree with this position.we have addressed the effect of an inadvertent or mistaken omission by providing a rule with limited exceptions,just as many of our sister circuits have.where we have stated a rule that does not allow for a specific exception,we are not free to read that exception into the rule just because we have not previously said that we would not do so.such judicial chiseling disrespects our precedent and deprives lower courts and litigants of any predictability as to the application of the rule 
hamilton also dictates that it is irrelevant to our analysis whether a bankruptcy proceeding has been reopened to correct an earlier error,or even whether a discharge has been vacated.under new hampshire,one of the factors that courts may consider in deciding whether to apply judicial estoppel is whether the party has succeeded in persuading a court to accept that party earlier position,so that judicial acceptance of an inconsistent position in a later proceeding would create the perception that either the first or the second court was misled.at internal quotation marks omitted.in hamilton,the bankruptcy court eventually dismissed hamilton bankruptcy,vacating the discharge of debt.at.we were not persuaded that this dismissal undermined the basis for applying estoppel d ischarge of debt by a bankruptcy court,under these circumstances,is sufficient acceptance to provide a basis for judicial estoppel,even if the discharge is later vacated.id.
the majority,nonetheless,concludes that a key factor is that plaintiff reopened her bankruptcy proceedings and filed amended bankruptcy schedules that properly listed this claim as an asset.op.at.the majority admits that we held in hamilton that the reopening of a bankruptcy case is generally irrelevant to the analysis of judicial estoppel,op.at,but feels comfortable casting aside hamilton because hamilton did not claim inadvertence or mistake,op.at.though hamilton limited its statement regarding the irrelevance of a reopening or vacatur of discharge to these circumstances,at see op.at,there is no indication that hamilton intent was in any way relevant to our conclusion that reopening or vacatur did not impact the estoppel analysis,see op.at noting that we did not mention,define,or consider the relevance of inadvertence or mistake in hamilton.
my reading of hamilton is supported by our earlier decision in hay first interstate bank of kalispell,cir.in hay,during the pendency of a debtor bankruptcy,the debtor became aware of information that prompted the debtor to file suit against certain creditors alleging bad faith,breach of contract,and civil conspiracy.id.at.though the debtor learned of the facts that led to the discovery of the debtor claims sometime during the month preceding the month in which the debtor reorganization plan was confirmed and four months prior to the close of the bankruptcy case,the debtor did not notify the bankruptcy court of the existence of the lawsuit as an asset prior to the closure of the bankruptcy.id.at.we said nothing of the debtor intent in failing to disclose the lawsuit to the bankruptcy court,and the facts of the case do not make it clear that the debtor had any ill intent.instead,we emphasized what the debtor knew we recognize that all facts were not known to the debtor at th e relevant time,but enough was known to require notification of the existence of the asset to the bankruptcy court.id.second and third emphases added.we concluded that f ailure to give the required notice estops the debtor and justifies the grant of summary judgment to the defendants.id.
neither hamilton nor hay considered the defendant intent in deciding that judicial estoppel should be applied where,as here,the defendant failed to disclose a suit in the bankruptcy context.the majority fails to adequately respect these precedents by holding that the district court abused its discretion by similarly failing to consider ah quin subjective intent.
the majority attempts to buoy its argument for a broad understanding of the inadvertence or mistake factor where the debtor has reopened bankruptcy proceedings by arguing that once a has amended his or her bankruptcy schedules and the bankruptcy court has processed or the bankruptcy with full information,two of the three primary new hampshire factors are no longer met.op.at.specifically,the majority argues that,on the basis of the reopening and reprocessing of ah quin bankruptcy,ah quin has not persuad ed a court to accept her earlier position,so that judicial acceptance of an inconsistent position in this proceeding would create the perception that either the first or this court was misled,and ah quin would not derive an unfair advantage or impose an unfair detriment on the opposing party if not estopped in this proceeding.new hampshire,at internal quotation marks omitted see op.at.this is a curious argument in light of hamilton.
in hamilton,we rejected the argument that the discharge must be permanent to satisfy the judicial acceptance requirement from new hampshire.hamilton,at.referencing the unfair advantage factor,we stated that hamilton did enjoy the benefit of both an automatic stay and a discharge of debt in his chapter proceeding.id.at see also id.the debtor,once he institutes the bankruptcy process,disrupts the flow of commerce and obtains a stay and the benefits derived by listing all his assets.the only regard in which the majority has attempted to distinguish ah quin case from hamilton is by arguing that ah quin incomplete disclosure may have been inadvertent while hamilton did not even argue inadvertence.see op.at.yet the majority arguments about the judicial acceptance and unfair advantage new hampshire factors are almost entirely unrelated to any potential inadvertence.see op.at.the majority does suggest that an inadvertent failure to disclose a suit in bankruptcy proceedings unlike the failure to disclose in hamilton might result in an advantage to the debtor that is not unfair,see op.at,but i fail to see how any discharge that is overly generous to the debtor due to the debtor incomplete disclosure is not unfair to the creditors.the majority is thus recycling arguments on these two factors that we explicitly rejected in hamilton,and is doing so without offering any satisfactory way of distinguishing this case from hamilton that is relevant to these arguments.worse,in defending these recycled arguments,the majority emphasizes a fact the impermanence of the initial discharge that we specifically dismissed as irrelevant in hamilton.the majority position with regard to these new hampshire factors is plainly foreclosed by hamilton 
the majority also attempts to support its broadening of the inadvertence or mistake factor by disputing one of the primary arguments in favor of a more narrow understanding that a strict rule is appropriate because it will deter debtors from failing to disclose claims in their bankruptcy filings.see op.at.the majority admits the intuitive appeal to th is deterrence justification,but calls it a very awkward fit for judicial estoppel,which typically operates to protect the integrity of the judicial system with respect to the particular litigant in front of the court.op.at.noting that the courts that have mentioned this justification phrase it in terms not of protecting the courts but of promoting the efficient operation of the bankruptcy system,the majority asserts that t hat aim protecting the bankruptcy system differs from the goal of judicial estoppel protecting the integrity of the courts.op.at.
even if there might be some truth in the majority point,it comes much too late.we have already approved of applying judicial estoppel for the very reason the majority condemns.in hamilton,we said w e must invoke judicial estoppel to protect the integrity of the bankruptcy process.at.moreover,setting hamilton aside,this position is perfectly consistent with the premise that judicial estoppel is generally intended to protect the integrity of the courts.the majority specifies that j udicial estoppel typically operates to protect the integrity of the judicial system with respect to the particular litigant in front of the court,op.at emphasis added but that is not how the supreme court has described it.the court said that judicial estoppel purpose is to protect the integrity of the judicial process by prohibiting parties from deliberately changing positions according to the exigencies of the moment.new hampshire,at internal citation and quotation marks omitted.judicial estoppel is concerned not with respecting the integrity of the system only insofar as it relates to the particular litigant rather,the concern is with protecting the system broadly by doing the only thing a court can legitimately do properly treating the case of the litigants before the court.as the court put it in new hampshire,judicial estoppel is intended to prevent improper use of judicial machinery.at.the bankruptcy system is quintessential judicial machinery,and protecting it is well within the ambit of judicial estoppel purposes.see united states kras,u nder our legal system debt is effective only because the judicial machinery is there to collect it.the bankrupt is bankrupt precisely for the reason that the state stands ready to exact all of his debts emphasis added.to the extent that judicial estoppel deters faulty disclosure and thus protects the bankruptcy system,addressed further infra in part iii,applying judicial estoppel to achieve such protection is consistent with both hamilton and the general purpose of judicial estoppel.
in sum,the majority refusal to apply judicial estoppel in this context is impossible to reconcile with the precedent.applying judicial estoppel is consistent both with our prior decisions and with the supreme court dictate in new hampshire.for that reason alone,i would be unable to join today opinion.
even if i were to accept the majority novel subjective intent test,i could not join the majority judgment.giving ah quin the benefit of the doubt,based on the record before us,i can only conclude that ah quin knowingly and intentionally avoided disclosing her discrimination suit in her bankruptcy proceedings and then tried to capitalize on that omission in her disclosure by subsequently pursuing the suit.the record fully supports the magistrate judge finding that this was not a case of inadvertence or mistake rather,it was a case of deceit.
the majority mentions that ah quin responded to a question about whether she had a claim by saying no.no,and asserts that the most plausible reading is that ah quin was referring to a claim for her husband loss of work,not to a claim in general.op.at.in summarizing the evidence relevant to ah quin subjective intent,the majority admits that the colloquy regarding her husband claim suggests that ah quin should have been aware that a pending claim is relevant.op.at.that is a bit of an understatement.the majority does not provide the full colloquy,so i do so here,emphasizing key phrases 
the court did you review the statement of financial affairs on file with the court 
ah quin yes.
the court are all of the answers in that true and correct 
ah quin yes.
the court what caused you to have to file this bankruptcy 
ah quin my husband lost his job due to workplace violence.it was his fault.
the court he lost his job and what 
ah quin due to workplace violence.it was his fault.we fighting it or trying to.
the court okay.are you did you file suit against the company for wrongful termination or something like that 
ah quin we still in the process.have got there yet.
the court okay.so you need to list that claim in the schedules,so 
attorney inaudible claim ah quin what 
attorney your your suit for your husband claim.
the court how is 
ah quin we have gone 
attorney oh,you 
ah quin and done anything legally yet.
the court do you have a claim,or does he have a claim 
attorney it the husband.
ah quin it on my husband.
attorney the husband claim,i think 
ah quin yea,but 
the court you do have a claim 
ah quin no.no.
attorney inaudible 
ah quin no,yeah.
the court so you do need to list the exclusions.
i agree with the majority that,charitably,ah quin did not generally deny having any claims in this colloquy.see op.at.more importantly,as the majority suggests but minimizes,at least after this colloquy,ah quin was on notice that a lawsuit was relevant.op.at.in the colloquy,in which ah quin was an active participant,before the court realized that the claim being discussed belonged to ah quin husband and not to her,the court said that ah quin need ed to list that claim in the bankruptcy schedules.ah quin knew she had already filed her discrimination claim,and the bankruptcy judge told her immediately upon learning of a different potential claim without any specific information about that claim that might require it,but not the discrimination claim,to be disclosed that the claim needed to be listed in ah quin bankruptcy schedules.the bankruptcy judge ultimately told ah quin that her husband claim need not be listed,but only because it was her husband claim and not hers.it is not a reasonable inference from the facts,even taken in the light most favorable to ah quin,that ah quin was not aware of her obligation to disclose the discrimination claim,at least from this point forward.
this is especially so given how valuable ah quin believed her discrimination claim to be as compared to the amount of debt she sought to discharge.in her pretrial statement,ah quin prayed for relief of approximately.by the time she filed for bankruptcy,she computed her damages in the discrimination case to be in excess of.in answering the county interrogatories,she later set the monetary value of the claim at million dollars for every discrimination act against me.she affirmed her belief that her claim was worth million dollars during her deposition.at the same time ah quin was telling the district court that she valued her discrimination suit at something between and,she was telling the bankruptcy court that she had debts of,and assets of only.had she received even a portion of the amount at which she valued her claim against the county,she could have covered her debts and had no need for bankruptcy.ah quin was not playing with the bankruptcy court.
it is simply not plausible that ah quin,at least once the colloquy with the bankruptcy judge put her on notice that lawsuits had to be disclosed,would inadvertently or mistakenly overlook a claim she deemed so valuable.see cannon stokes,at it is impossible to believe that such a sizeable claim one central to the debtor daily activities at work could have been overlooked when the debtor was filling in the bankruptcy schedules.in re cregar,wl,at cir,per curiam unpublished sometimes,the written record can fully resolve the issue of intent,and contrary statements of the witness are wholly not credible on their face.for instance,if a debtor neglected to list on her schedules a two million dollar house in which she lived,and later claimed she forgot she owned it,an evidentiary hearing to determine her credibility would not be necessary,absent some relevancy of mental defect.this is especially true given that her valuation of the discrimination claim was far in excess of her disclosed assets,and that receiving even a portion of that valuation would have made her solvent,alleviating the need to go through bankruptcy.see cannon stokes,at emphasizing,in applying judicial estoppel,that the suit the debtor failed to disclose was by the debtor reckoning three times the value of the debts the debtor had discharged.
even if ah quin did not know she had to disclose the discrimination claim when she originally completed her bankruptcy schedules,the fact that she was put on notice by the bankruptcy judge about the need to disclose lawsuits yet failed to amend her schedules justifies the application of judicial estoppel.hamilton,at judicial estoppel will be imposed when the debtor has knowledge of enough facts to know that a potential cause of action exists during the pendency of the bankruptcy,but fails to amend his schedules or disclosure statements to identify the cause of action as a contingent asset.emphasis added.under hamilton,judicial estoppel would apply even if no suit had been filed yet,as long as the debtor knew of the facts supporting the claim during the bankruptcy proceedings,here,where ah quin filed her suit months before she even filed for bankruptcy,see op.at,the case for applying judicial estoppel is even stronger.
the majority concludes that there is factual support for a conclusion either of mistake and inadvertence,or of deceit,and concludes that,taking the evidence in the light most favorable to ah quin,her failure to disclose the suit on her schedules was inadvertent.op.at.the majority cites three pieces of evidence in favor of a conclusion of inadvertence ah quin affidavit,in which she swore that,when she reviewed the bankruptcy schedules and up to the date of the affidavit itself,she did not think she had to disclose her discrimination suit because the bankruptcy schedule instructions were vague ah quin listing her discrimination lawyer as a creditor for in her initial bankruptcy schedules,which ah quin claimed supported a conclusion of inadvertence because she would not have listed the lawyer if she were seeking to hide her suit from the bankruptcy court and ah quin counsel bringing her bankruptcy to the county attention during a settlement conference.op.at.
with regard to the affidavit,ah quin can not create a genuine issue of material fact and thus avoid summary judgment simply by swearing to facts that are contradicted by the record.see ftc publishing clearing house,cir a conclusory,selfserving affidavit,lacking detailed facts and any supporting evidence,is insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact.scott harris,when opposing parties tell two different stories,one of which is blatantly contradicted by the record,so that no reasonable jury could believe it,a court should not adopt that version of the facts for purposes of ruling on a motion for summary judgment.in light of ah quin assessment of the value of her discrimination suit as compared to the amount of debts she sought discharged,and in light of her colloquy with the bankruptcy judge,ah quin sworn statement that her failure to disclose the claim up until the time of her first discharge was inadvertent is just not believable.
with regard to the listing of her discrimination lawyer as a creditor in her bankruptcy schedules,this evidence at most creates a genuine issue of material fact as to whether ah quin failure to disclose her claim was inadvertent prior to her colloquy with the bankruptcy judge.by the time of that colloquy,ah quin had already disclosed the debt owed to her discrimination lawyer.even assuming that ah quin in fact did not know about her obligation to disclose her discrimination claim in her bankruptcy schedules prior to the colloquy,her disclosure of the debt owed to her lawyer could not be taken back once the colloquy put her on notice of her obligation,so the disclosure offers no proof of inadvertence after the colloquy.moreover,ah quin disclosure was hardly designed to alert the bankruptcy judge of her discrimination suit.the disclosure in ah quin initial bankruptcy schedules gave no indication that the individual listed was a lawyer,and the description of the debt said only consultation fees.
finally,with regard to the fact that ah quin counsel raised the bankruptcy at a settlement conference,ah quin did not move to reopen bankruptcy proceedings at that point.rather,as the majority recognizes,ah quin did not move to reopen her bankruptcy proceedings until after the defendants in this case raised the possibility of dismissal based on judicial estoppel.see op.at.if ah quin had just made an honest mistake,she would have moved to reopen her bankruptcy proceedings without needing to be prompted by the defendants raising dismissal.see cannon stokes,at if the debtor were really making an honest attempt to pay her debts,then as soon as she realized that her claim had been omitted,she would have filed amended schedules and moved to reopen the bankruptcy,so that the creditors could benefit from any recovery.barger,at the debtor s attempt to reopen the bankruptcy estate to include her discrimination claim hardly casts her in the good light she would like.she only sought to reopen the bankruptcy estate after the defendants moved the district court to enter summary judgment against her on judicial estoppel grounds as such,the debtor disclosure upon the bankruptcy estate deserves no favor.burnes pemco aeroplex,cir allowing the debtor to,the bankruptcy case,and amend his bankruptcy filings,only after his omission has been challenged by an adversary,suggests that a debtor should consider disclosing potential assets only if he is caught concealing them.this remedy would only diminish the necessary incentive to provide the bankruptcy court with a truthful disclosure of the debtors assets.ah quin failure to move to reopen bankruptcy proceedings immediately after the settlement conference at which her attorney raised the bankruptcy suggests that ah quin did not merely inadvertently fail to disclose the suit in her bankruptcy filings.
the evidence cited by the majority as supporting inadvertence is thus unconvincing.
lastly,it is also worth emphasizing that it was only after the district court had dismissed the discrimination claim on judicial estoppel grounds that the trustee abandoned the discrimination claim and the bankruptcy court closed the reopened bankruptcy proceedings.to reverse that dismissal now would be to give ah quin an opportunity to pursue her discrimination claim for her own benefit not for the benefit of the creditors after the trustee and creditors,presumably relying on the dismissal of the discrimination claim,allowed the reopened bankruptcy proceedings to be closed without objection 
the majority attempts to minimize the significance of this point by asserting that,because plaintiff unsecured creditors did not object to the abandonment by the trustee,the creditors not receiv ing any benefit from this action if we reverse the district court was the choice of the creditors and the trustee.op.at.the important point,the majority says,is that the trustee and the creditors had a full opportunity to pursue relief.op.at.but this argument is entirely unsatisfying given that the trustee abandoned the claim only after the magistrate judge had dismissed ah quin discrimination claim.the record is silent as to the trustee thought process,but it seems likely that the trustee abandoned the claim because the district court had already dismissed it.the same rationale likely explains the creditors failure to object.the majority is essentially saying that the trustee abandonment of the claim and the creditors lack of objection are irrelevant to the equities.perhaps out of recognition that this can not be correct if the creditors have no recourse if we reverse,the majority adds that they are not aware of anything that would prevent plaintiff or her creditors from moving to reopen the bankruptcy proceedings to allow the creditors to benefit.op.at.reopening the bankruptcy,of course,has always been an alternative to applying judicial estoppel in this context,so hamilton reflects a tacit rejection of treating this option as a reason for eschewing judicial estoppel.moreover,as discussed in part iii infra,the existence of alternative solutions sometimes even more attractive solutions in the bankruptcy system itself does not mean there is no value to be gleaned from a strict estoppel doctrine in the bankruptcy context.
even the seventh circuit,cited extensively by the majority for support of its position,has indicated that judicial estoppel is particularly apt in the bankruptcy context when a trustee has abandoned claims and the fruit of allowing the suit to proceed will accrue to the party who has advocated inconsistent positions.in biesek soo line railroad,cited prominently by the majority,see op.at,judge easterbrook explained that the panel reticence to apply judicial estoppel in the bankruptcy context stemmed from the fact that the debtor was not really the party in interest in the suit in question rather,the claim belonged to the trustee,who was bound to act for the benefit of the creditors.see,cir.judge easterbook went on to explain that the situation might be different if the trustee had abandoned the claim,leaving the debtor to benefit from the suit if judicial estoppel were not applied 
a trustee in bankruptcy may abandon worthless or low value assets,including legal claims,and if the trustee had abandoned this claim then biesek could have prosecuted the suit in his own name.then it would have been necessary to consider judicial estoppel.but this claim is not worthless,and the trustee has not abandoned it a step that requires notice to the creditors,which has never been given,and the opportunity for a hearing.
id.internal citation omitted.biesek provides no support for the majority position given that the trustee here has abandoned ah quin suit.
in cannon stokes potter authored by judge easterbook a few months after biesek,and also highlighted by the majority,see op.at the seventh circuit followed through on its dicta in biesek about abandonment.at.the court was faced with a situation where the trustee abandoned any interest in th e litigation,so the creditors we re out of the picture and the court had to decide whether the debtor may pursue her claim for personal benefit.id.at.noting that a ll six appellate courts that have considered the issue hold that a debtor in a bankruptcy who denies owning an asset,including a chose in action or other legal claim,can not realize on that concealed asset after the bankruptcy ends,the court ruled that the debtor could not pursue her claim,asserting,as the other circuits ha d concluded,that j udicial estoppel blocks any attempt to realize on th e claim for the debtor personal benefit,id.at.even the seventh circuit,then,would disagree with the majority view in light of the fact that the trustee abandoned ah quin discrimination claim.
even accepting the majority broad reading of the inadvertence or mistake factor,ah quin should be estopped here.there are cases where there truly seems to be an honest mistake in failing to disclose a potential lawsuit in bankruptcy filings,see,whitten fred,cir but this is not one of them.ah quin concealed her claim and received a favorable discharge,then sought to pursue the claim without reopening her bankruptcy until the threat of judicial estoppel loomed.when judicial estoppel was applied,and the trustee abandoned the creditors interest in the claim,ah quin continued to pursue the claim for her own benefit.this is not behavior we should tolerate.see payless wholesale distrib.albert culver,cir conceal your claims,get rid of your creditors on the cheap,and start over with a bundle of rights.this is a palpable fraud that the court will not tolerate,even passively.
given that judicial estoppel is an equitable doctrine invoked by a court at its discretion,russell rolfs,cir quoting religious tech.ctr.scott,cir hall,dissenting,it is not surprising that the majority seems swayed by the equities more than by our prior case law.specifically,the majority is swayed by two points that the bankruptcy system offers sufficient protections against the failure to disclose assets,rendering any argument in support of judicial estoppel related to deterrence a nullity,see op.at and that the application of judicial estoppel in this context hurts primarily innocent creditors while providing alleged bad actors with windfalls,see op.at.
with regard to the first argument,the majority makes a valid point.as the majority explains,the bankruptcy system promotes accurate disclosure in various ways,and also offers various remedies where debtors fail to accurately disclose their assets.see op.at.the bankruptcy court may in fact often provide the better solution because it facilitates punishment of the dishonest debtor without also punishing innocent creditors by erasing potentially valuable suits.it does seem more effective for the bankruptcy system to exact punishment for this violation of its rules.the problem with the majority reasoning is that we have already decided that we have an obligation to deploy the equitable doctrine of judicial estoppel in the bankruptcy context,to protect the bankruptcy system,in spite of that system ability to protect itself.see hamilton,at.moreover,there is value in redundancy.the judge or judges charged with administering the underlying suit may at times be in a better position to understand the inconsistency of positions than a bankruptcy judge not intimately familiar with an undisclosed suit in another forum.the bankruptcy judge will of course also be in the better position in some cases,but that only highlights the benefit of redundancy.we should not ignore a litigant inconsistent position just because a bankruptcy court has done so.the redundancy created by applying judicial estoppel can only serve to amplify the deterrence of inaccurate disclosure already promoted by bankruptcy remedies.in light of the crucial importance of full disclosure to the bankruptcy system,see hamilton,at citing in re coastal plains,at,this added deterrence,even if somewhat marginal,should not be dismissed so lightly.
the majority second concern is of course intimately related to its first.as the seventh circuit has pointed out,see biesek,at,where a claim has not been abandoned,the creditors are the real party in interest and they stand to be hurt by dismissing a lawsuit that may be an asset of the bankruptcy petitioner.the defendants in the suit potentially bad actors will in fact receive a windfall when the case against them is dismissed.the picture is more complicated,however,if one accepts that applying judicial estoppel in this context has deterrent value.if applying judicial estoppel incrementally deters debtors from making inaccurate filings in the future,the inequitable result in the case at hand must be balanced against the positive impact on the system writ large.as judge easterbrook explained in cannon stokes 
by making litigants choose one position irrevocably,the doctrine of judicial estoppel raises the cost of lying.a doctrine that induces debtors to be truthful in their bankruptcy filings will assist creditors in the long run though it will do them no good in the particular case and it will assist most debtors too,for the few debtors who scam their creditors drive up interest rates and injure the more numerous honest borrowers.
at internal quotation marks,alteration,and citation omitted.
the majority raises reasonable concerns,but once we recognize that a strict judicial estoppel doctrine has incremental deterrent force,the rule we adopted in hamilton is a perfectly reasonable response.
hamilton dictates that we apply judicial estoppel where a debtor had knowledge of a claim during bankruptcy proceedings but failed to disclose the claim.the majority newly minted subjective intent test even if limited to situations where the debtor moved to reopen the bankruptcy proceedings to disclose the claim is flatly inconsistent with hamilton and every other circuit that has addressed judicial estoppel in this context.the magistrate judge was clearly correct to apply our precedent when he invoked judicial estoppel and dismissed ah quin discrimination claim without considering her subjective intent.
moreover,even under the majority new subjective intent test,judicial estoppel should be applied here,especially given that the claim was abandoned by the trustee and any benefit of allowing the claim to proceed will accrue to ah quin and not innocent creditors.the record can not support the majority position that ah quin failure to disclose her discrimination claim in her bankruptcy proceedings until the defendants raised the possibility of moving to dismiss the discrimination claim was just an honest mistake.the majority raises interesting points regarding the equity of a broader understanding of the inadvertence or mistake factor,but the equities are more complicated than the majority suggests.ultimately,when a lie is punished,and future lies are deterred especially in the context of a bankruptcy system so dependent on full and accurate disclosure equity will usually have been done.come what may,anything is better than lies and deception.leo tolstoy,anna karenina nathan haskell dole.
i respectfully dissent.
the parties dispute the significance of that colloquy.in our view,the most plausible reading is that plaintiff was referring to a claim for her husband loss of work,not to a claim in general.but we do not resolve that factual dispute.
whether the district court thought that it was bound by hamilton or by case law,it was mistaken.in hamilton,we were not presented with an opportunity to address inadvertence or mistake.see infra note.
consider,for example,a litigant who is not represented by counsel or who speaks english as a second language and fails to include a claim on her bankruptcy schedule because she does not understand that she was required to do so.the narrow rule applied by the district court would punish the litigant for making an honest mistake and would leave no room for equitable considerations.
the district court turned to tenth circuit authority to interpret the meaning of inadvertence or mistake.the district court thus seems to have recognized that our circuit had not defined these terms in the present context.
in hamilton,it was palpable from the record that the bankruptcy omission was intentional in every sense of the term.see at.hamilton sought recovery from an insurance company for water damage and loss of allegedly stolen property following a partial flood of his house.id.at.the insurance company,apparently suspicious of hamilton insurance claim,initiated an investigation into its validity.id.hamilton enlisted lawyers to pressure the insurance company to pay hamilton quickly,claiming that the insurer was acting in bad faith and threatening litigation.id.at.meanwhile,hamilton filed for bankruptcy.the insurer investigation revealed that hamilton was probably responsible for the damage and theft and that he had violated the insurance policy provision.less than two weeks after the denial,hamilton filed his bankruptcy schedules,listing a residential vandalism loss but not his bad faith claim against the insurer.the bankruptcy trustee requested information from hamilton regarding insurance recovery,but hamilton replied with a letter.the trustee successfully moved to reopen the bankruptcy case on the grounds of bad faith,lack of truthfulness under oath,and failure to cooperate.id.hamilton then filed a suit against his insurer,which was dismissed based on judicial estoppel we affirmed.critically,hamilton did not argue that his failure to disclose was based on inadvertence or mistake,and our opinion in hamilton did not mention,define,or consider the relevance of inadvertence or mistake.
labeling them recycled arguments,the dissent asserts that these positions are plainly foreclosed by hamilton.dissent at.we disagree.in determining whether to apply judicial estoppel,the district court must consider all factors including inadvertence or mistake.nothing in hamilton forecloses the possibility that a court could conclude that,whereas an intentional omission as in hamilton would result in an unfair advantage,an inadvertent or mistaken omission might not be unfair.similarly,nothing in hamilton forecloses the possibility that a court could reach a different conclusion about the effect of the bankruptcy court initial acceptance of the position
