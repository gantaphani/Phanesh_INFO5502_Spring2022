jafari continued to gamble,though.in,jafari met casino developer steve wynn,who personally approved a credit line at his las vegas,nevada casino for jafari.jafari traveled from his wisconsin residence to las vegas to gamble at wynn and elsewhere on numerous occasions during.as of september,jafari did not owe anything to wynn for credit extended to gamble.
on or about september,jafari executed a new credit agreement with wynn.the agreement established an initial credit line of.on september,september,and september,jafari executed credit line increase requests in which he obtained increases totaling,at one point,up to.the initial credit agreement and the increase requests contained nevada provisions.
caesar,based in las vegas,similarly extended credit,totaling,to jafari between september and september.each of caesar markers contained nevada provisions as well.
both wynn and caesar had performed credit checks on jafari and,in exchange for the credit,prepared markers that were executed by jafari and.jafari did not repay the credit advance by the,and the casinos submitted the markers for payment against jafari bank account.both the wynn and caesar markers were returned with payment denied,stamped refer to maker.
when jafari markers were returned unpaid,wynn and caesar sued jafari in federal district court in nevada.on february,two days before his deadline for filing an answer in nevada,jafari and his wife amanda filed an individual chapter bankruptcy proceeding in the united states bankruptcy court for the western district of wisconsin.the bankruptcy filing stayed the nevada lawsuit.
on august and,caesar and wynn filed timely proofs of claim in bankruptcy court for the amounts owing.wynn submitted a proof of claim for.caesar submitted a proof of claim for.the jafaris and the bankruptcy trustee,mark wittman,objected to the casinos claims,arguing that they were gambling debts unenforceable under the wisconsin statute.
the question whether to allow or disallow the claims was presented to the bankruptcy court.the bankruptcy court concluded that it was required to follow the rules of the forum state,wisconsin,rather than federal rules that a wisconsin court would apply wisconsin substantive law to the casinos claims and that the claims were not allowed because they were unenforceable under the wisconsin statute,which states 
gaming contracts void.all promises,agreements,notes,bills,bonds,or other contracts,mortgages,conveyances or other securities,where the whole or any part of the consideration of the promise,agreement,note,bill,bond,mortgage,conveyance or other security shall be for money or other valuable thing whatsoever won or lost,laid or staked,or betted at or upon any game of any kind or under any name whatsoever,or by any means,or upon any race,fight,sport or pastime,or any wager,or for the repayment of money or other thing of value,lent or advanced at the time and for the purpose,of any game,play,bet or wager,or of being laid,staked,betted or wagered thereon shall be void.
wynn and caesar appealed to the united states district court for the western district of wisconsin.the district court noted,as an initial matter,that much of the jafaris brief was devoted to policy arguments regarding the harmful nature of gambling to suggest that both equity and public policy required the court to invalidate the casinos claims.the district court declined to so rule,stating,i t is neither necessary or appropriate for this court to venture into that tangled thicket of moral judgment and public policy.the district court then reversed the bankruptcy court.notably,the district court declined to decide whether federal common law rules or wisconsin rules applied.rather,it determined that under either federal common law rules or wisconsin rules,nevada substantive law would apply in determining the enforceability of the contracts on which the claims were based.the court remanded the case to the bankruptcy court for further determination as to whether the claims were allowed under nevada law.upon remand,the bankruptcy court applied nevada substantive law,allowed the wynn claim in the amount of the amount filed plus legal fees,and allowed the caesar claim in the amount of the original amount claimed plus additional expenses and interest.debtors and their trustee then brought this appeal.
ii.analysis 
we review questions of de novo,tanner jupiter realty,cir,and we review the bankruptcy court findings of fact for clear error.in re,cir.
appellants argue that in the absence of a federal policy or interest compelling a different result,when a question of state law is presented in federal court,including federal bankruptcy court,the choice of which state law to apply should be governed by the forum state rules.they seek to demonstrate that there is no federal policy or interest favoring enforcing gambling debts in bankruptcy cases.therefore,they argue that we should apply wisconsin rules to this case.they continue that under wisconsin rules,wisconsin substantive law would apply in part because of wisconsin interest in enforcing its public policy.they conclude that the casinos claims are disallowed under wisconsin law.they add that to the extent there is any confusion over whether a wisconsin court would apply wisconsin substantive law to the facts presented,we should certify that question to the wisconsin supreme court.in connection with their appeal,appellants filed a motion for certification of question of state law.
appellees first argue that we should conclude that the bankruptcy court must apply federal common law rules because such an approach leads to uniformity in administering the bankruptcy code.they state that under federal common law rules,nevada substantive law would apply to this case,and their claims would be allowed under nevada law.they continue that even if we were to conclude that the bankruptcy court must follow the forum state rules,nevada law would apply because jafari contacts with nevada favor application of nevada law.thus,they argue that we should allow their claims whether we determine a that federal common law rules apply in a bankruptcy case b that the forum state rules apply in a bankruptcy case or c that we need not decide whether state or federal law supplies the rules in a bankruptcy case because federal and forum state principles would lead to the same outcome in this case.
