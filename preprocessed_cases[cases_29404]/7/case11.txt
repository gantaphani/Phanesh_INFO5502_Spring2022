chapter of the bankruptcy code uses a statutory formula known as the means test to help ensure that debtors who can pay creditors do pay them.the means test instructs a debtor to determine his disposable income the amount he has available to reimburse creditors by deducting from his current monthly income amounts reasonably necessary to be expended for,inter alia,maintenance or support.b a i.for a debtor whose income is above the median for his state,the means test indentifies which expenses qualify as amounts reasonably necessary to be expended.as relevant here,the statute provides that t he debtor monthly expenses shall be the debtor applicable monthly expense amounts specified under the national standards and local standards,and the debtor actual monthly expenses for the categories specified as other necessary expenses issued by the internal revenue service irs for the area in which the debtor resides.b a ii i.
the standards are tables listing standardized expense amounts for basic necessities,which the irs prepares to help calculate taxpayers ability to pay overdue taxes.the irs also creates supplemental guidelines known as the collection financial standards,which describe how to use the tables and what the amounts listed in them mean.the local standards include an allowance for transportation expenses,divided into vehicle ownership costs and vehicle operating costs.the collection financial standards explain that ownership costs cover monthly loan or lease payments on an automobile the expense amounts listed are based on nationwide car financing data.the collection financial standards further state that a taxpayer who has no car payment may not claim an allowance for ownership costs.
when petitioner ransom filed for chapter bankruptcy relief,he listed respondent fia as an unsecured creditor.among his assets,ransom reported a car that he owns free of any debt.in determining his monthly expenses,he nonetheless claimed a deduction of,the full amount specified in the ownership costs table,as well as a separate deduction for costs.based on his calculations,ransom proposed a bankruptcy plan that would result in repayment of approximately of his unsecured debt.fia objected on the ground that the plan did not direct all of ransom disposable income to unsecured creditors.fia contended that ransom should not have claimed the allowance because he does not make loan or lease payments on his car.agreeing,the bankruptcy court denied confirmation of the plan.the ninth circuit bankruptcy appellate panel and the ninth circuit affirmed.
held a debtor who does not make loan or lease payments may not take the deduction.
a this court interpretation begins with the language of the bankruptcy code,which provides that a debtor may claim only applicable expense amounts listed in the standards.because the code does not define the key word applicable,the term carries its ordinary meaning of appropriate,relevant,suitable,or fit.what makes an expense amount applicable in this sense is most naturally understood to be its correspondence to an individual debtor financial circumstances.congress established a filter,permitting a debtor to claim a deduction from a national or local standard table only if that deduction is appropriate for him.and a deduction is so appropriate only if the debtor will incur the kind of expense covered by the table during the life of the plan.had congress not wanted to separate debtors who qualify for an allowance from those who do not,it could have omitted the term applicable altogether.without that word,all debtors would be eligible to claim a deduction for each category listed in the standards.interpreting the statute to require a threshold eligibility determination thus ensures that applicable carries meaning,as each word in a statute should.
this reading draws support from the statute context and purpose.the code initially defines a debtor disposable income as his current monthly income less amounts reasonably necessary to be expended.b.it then instructs that such reasonably necessary amounts shall be determined in accordance with the means test.b.because congress intended the means test to approximate the debtor reasonable expenditures on essential items,a debtor should be required to qualify for a deduction by actually incurring an expense in the relevant category.further,the statute purpose to ensure that debtors pay creditors the maximum they can afford is best achieved by interpreting the means test,consistent with the statutory text,to reflect a debtor ability to afford repayment.
b the category covers only the costs of a car loan or lease.the expense amount listed is the average monthly payment for loans and leases nationwide it is not intended to estimate other conceivable expenses associated with maintaining a car.maintenance expenses are the province of the separate operating costs deduction.a person who owns a car free and clear is entitled to the operating costs deduction for all expenses.but such a person may not claim the ownership costs deduction,because that allowance is for the separate costs of a car loan or lease.the irs collection financial standards reinforce this conclusion by making clear that individuals who have a car but make no loan or lease payments may take only the deduction.because ransom owns his vehicle outright,he incurs no expense in the ownership costs category,and that expense amount is therefore not applicable to him.
c ransom arguments to the contrary an alternative interpretation of the key word applicable,an objection to the court view of the scope of the ownership costs category,and a criticism of the policy implications of the court approach are unpersuasive.

justice kagan delivered the opinion of the court.
chapter of the bankruptcy code enables an individual to obtain a discharge of his debts if he pays his creditors a portion of his monthly income in accordance with a plan.et.to determine how much income the debtor is capable of paying,chapter uses a statutory formula known as the means test.b ed.and supp.iii,b a ed.the means test instructs a debtor to deduct specified expenses from his current monthly income.the result is his disposable income the amount he has available to reimburse creditors.b.
this case concerns the specified expense for costs.we must determine whether a debtor like petitioner jason ransom who owns his car outright,and so does not make loan or lease payments,may claim an allowance for costs thereby reducing the amount he will repay creditors.we hold that the text,context,and purpose of the statutory provision at issue preclude this result.a debtor who does not make loan or lease payments may not take the deduction.
congress enacted the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of bapcpa or act to correct perceived abuses of the bankruptcy system.milavetz,gallop milavetz,united states,slip,at.in particular,congress adopted the means test t he heart of bapcpa consumer bankruptcy reforms,pt,hereinafter,and the home of the statutory language at issue here to help ensure that debtors who can pay creditors do pay them.see,ibid.under bapcpa,debtors will repay creditors the maximum they can afford 
in chapter proceedings,the means test provides a formula to calculate a debtor disposable income,which the debtor must devote to reimbursing creditors under a plan generally lasting from three to five years.b b and b the statute defines disposable income as current monthly income less amounts reasonably necessary to be expended for maintenance or support,business expenditures,and certain charitable contributions.b a i and ii.for a debtor whose income is above the median for his state,the means test identifies which expenses qualify as amounts reasonably necessary to be expended.the test supplants the practice of calculating debtors reasonable expenses on a basis,which led to varying and often inconsistent determinations.see,in re slusher,bkrtcy.
under the means test,a debtor calculating his reasonably necessary expenses is directed to claim allowances for defined living expenses,as well as for secured and priority debt.b a ii iv.as relevant here,the statute provides 
the debtor monthly expenses shall be the debtor applicable monthly expense amounts specified under the national standards and local standards,and the debtor actual monthly expenses for the categories specified as other necessary expenses issued by the internal revenue service irs for the area in which the debtor resides.b a ii i.
these are the principal amounts that the debtor can claim as his reasonable living expenses and thereby shield from creditors.
the national and local standards referenced in this provision are tables that the irs prepares listing standardized expense amounts for basic necessities the irs uses the standards to help calculate taxpayers ability to pay overdue taxes.see d.the irs also prepares supplemental guidelines known as the collection financial standards,which describe how to use the tables and what the amounts listed in them mean.
the local standards include an allowance for transportation expenses,divided into vehicle ownership costs and vehicle operating costs.at the time ransom filed for bankruptcy,the ownership costs table appeared as follows 
ownership costs 
second car 
app.to brief for respondent.the collection financial standards explain that these ownership costs represent nationwide figures for monthly loan or lease payments,at the numerical amounts listed are base d on the average of new and used car financing data compiled by the federal reserve board,at.the collection financial standards further instruct that,in the context,i f a taxpayer has no car payment,only the operating costs portion of the transportation standard is used to come up with the allowable transportation expense.ibid.

the bankruptcy court denied confirmation of ransom plan.app.to pet.for cert.the court held that ransom could deduct a expense only if he is currently making loan or lease payments on that vehicle.at.
ransom appealed to the ninth circuit bankruptcy appellate panel,which affirmed.in re ransom.the panel reasoned that an expense amount becomes relevant to the debtor,appropriate or applicable to the debtor when he or she in fact has such an expense.at.w hat is important,the panel noted,is the payments that debtors actually make,not how many cars they own,because those payments are what actually affect their ability to reimburse unsecured creditors.ibid.
the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit affirmed.in re ransom.the plain language of the statute,the court held,does not allow a debtor to deduct an ownership cost that the debtor does not have.at.the court observed that a n ownership cost is not an expense either actual or applicable if it does not exist,period.ibid.
we granted a writ of certiorari to resolve a split of authority over whether a debtor who does not make loan or lease payments on his car may claim the deduction for costs.we now affirm the ninth circuit judgment.
our interpretation of the bankruptcy code starts where all such inquiries must begin with the language of the statute itself.united states ron pair enterprises.as noted,the provision of the code central to the decision of this case states 
the debtor monthly expenses shall be the debtor applicable monthly expense amounts specified under the national standards and local standards,and the debtor actual monthly expenses for the categories specified as other necessary expenses issued by the irs for the area in which the debtor resides.b a ii i.
the key word in this provision is applicable a debtor may claim not all,but only applicable expense amounts listed in the standards.whether ransom may claim the deduction accordingly turns on whether that expense amount is applicable to him.
because the code does not define applicable,we look to the ordinary meaning of the term.see,hamilton lanning,slip,at.applicable means capable of being applied having relevance or fit,suitable,or right to be applied appropriate.webster third new international dictionary.see also new oxford american dictionary ed.relevant or appropriate oxford english dictionary ed.c apable of being applied or f it or suitable for its purpose,appropriate so an expense amount is applicable within the plain meaning of the statute when it is appropriate,relevant,suitable,or fit.
what makes an expense amount applicable in this sense appropriate,relevant,suitable,or fit is most naturally understood to be its correspondence to an individual debtor financial circumstances.rather than authorizing all debtors to take deductions in all listed categories,congress established a filter a debtor may claim a deduction from a national or local standard table like car ownership costs if but only if that deduction is appropriate for him.and a deduction is so appropriate only if the debtor has costs corresponding to the category covered by the table that is,only if the debtor will incur that kind of expense during the life of the plan.the statute underscores the necessity of making such an individualized determination by referring to the debtor applicable monthly expense amounts,b a ii i emphasis added in other words,the expense amounts applicable appropriate,to each particular debtor.identifying these amounts requires looking at the financial situation of the debtor and asking whether a national or local standard table is relevant to him.
if congress had not wanted to separate in this way debtors who qualify for an allowance from those who do not,it could have omitted the term applicable altogether.without that word,all debtors would be eligible to claim a deduction for each category listed in the standards.congress presumably included applicable to achieve a different result.see leocal ashcroft,w e must give effect to every word of a statute wherever possible interpreting the statute to require a threshold determination of eligibility ensures that the term applicable carries meaning,as each word in a statute should.
this reading of applicable also draws support from the statutory context.the code initially defines a debtor disposable income as his current monthly income less amounts reasonably necessary to be expended.b emphasis added.the statute then instructs that a mounts reasonably necessary to be expended shall be determined in accordance with the means test.b.because congress intended the means test to approximate the debtor reasonable expenditures on essential items,a debtor should be required to qualify for a deduction by actually incurring an expense in the relevant category.if a debtor will not have a particular kind of expense during his plan,an allowance to cover that cost is not reasonably necessary within the meaning of the statute 
finally,consideration of bapcpa purpose strengthens our reading of the term applicable.congress designed the means test to measure debtors disposable income and,in that way,to ensure that they repay creditors the maximum they can afford.at.this purpose is best achieved by interpreting the means test,consistent with the statutory text,to reflect a debtor ability to afford repayment.hamilton,at slip,at rejecting an interpretation of the bankruptcy code that would produce the senseless resul t of deny ing creditors payments that the debtor could easily make requiring a debtor to incur the kind of expenses for which he claims a deduction thus advances bapcpa objectives.
because we conclude that a person can not claim an allowance for costs unless he has some expense falling within that category,the question in this case becomes what expenses does the category cover if it covers loan and lease payments alone,ransom does not qualify,because he has no such expense.only if that category also covers other costs associated with having a car would ransom be entitled to this deduction.
the less inclusive understanding is the right one the ownership category encompasses the costs of a car loan or lease and nothing more.as noted earlier,the numerical amounts listed in the ownership costs table are base d on the average of new and used car financing data compiled by the federal reserve board.app.to brief for respondent.in other words,the sum is the average monthly payment for loans and leases nationwide it is not intended to estimate other conceivable expenses associated with maintaining a car.the standards do account for those additional expenses,but in a different way they are mainly the province of the separate deduction for vehicle operating costs,which include payments for v ehicle insurance,maintenance,fuel,state and local registration,required inspection,parking fees,tolls,and driver license.internal revenue manual and may,reprinted in app.to brief for respondent,see also irs,collection financial standards,a person who owns a car free and clear is entitled to claim the operating costs deduction for all these expenses of driving and ransom in fact did so,to the tune of.but such a person is not entitled to claim the ownership costs deduction,because that allowance is for the separate costs of a car loan or lease.
the collection financial standards the irs explanatory guidelines to the national and local standards explicitly recognize this distinction between ownership and operating costs,making clear that individuals who have a car but make no loan or lease payments may claim only the operating allowance.app.to brief for respondent see supra,at.although the statute does not incorporate the irs guidelines,courts may consult this material in interpreting the national and local standards after all,the irs uses those tables for a similar purpose to determine how much money a delinquent taxpayer can afford to pay the government.the guidelines of course can not control if they are at odds with the statutory language.but here,the collection financial standards treatment of the deduction reinforces our conclusion that,under the statute,a debtor seeking to claim this deduction must make some loan or lease payments 
because ransom owns his vehicle free and clear of any encumbrance,he incurs no expense in the ownership costs category of the local standards.accordingly,the expense amount is not applicable to him,and the ninth circuit correctly denied that deduction.
ransom argument to the contrary relies on a different interpretation of the key word applicable,an objection to our view of the scope of the ownership costs category,and a criticism of the policy implications of our approach.we do not think these claims persuasive.
ransom first offers another understanding of the term applicable.a debtor,he says,determines his applicable deductions by locating the box in each national or local standard table that corresponds to his geographic location,income,family size,or number of cars.under this approach,a debtor consult s the table s alone to determine his appropriate expense amounts.reply brief for petitioner.because he has one car,ransom argues that his applicable allowance is the sum listed in the first column of the ownership costs table if he had a second vehicle,the amount in the second column would also be applicable.on this approach,the word applicable serves a function wholly internal to the tables rather than filtering out debtors for whom a deduction is not at all suitable,the term merely directs each debtor to the correct box and associated dollar amount of deduction within every table.
this alternative reading of applicable fails to comport with the statute text,context,or purpose.as intimated earlier,supra,at,ransom interpretation would render the term applicable superfluous.assume congress had omitted that word and simply authorized a deduction of the debtor monthly expense amounts specified in the standards.that language,most naturally read,would direct each debtor to locate the box in every table corresponding to his location,income,family size,or number of cars and to deduct the amount stated.in other words,the language would instruct the debtor to use the exact approach ransom urges.the word applicable is not necessary to accomplish that result it is necessary only for the different purpose of dividing debtors eligible to make use of the tables from those who are not.further,ransom reading of applicable would sever the connection between the means test and the statutory provision it is meant to implement the authorization of an allowance for but only for reasonably necessary expenses.expenses that are wholly fictional are not easily thought of as reasonably necessary.and finally,ransom interpretation would run counter to the statute overall purpose of ensuring that debtors repay creditors to the extent they can here,by shielding some that he does not in fact need for loan or lease payments.
as against all this,ransom argues that his reading is necessary to account for the means test distinction between applicable and actual expenses more fully stated,between the phrase applicable monthly expense amounts specified in the standards and the phrase actual monthly expenses for other necessary expenses.b a ii i emphasis added.the latter phrase enables a debtor to deduct his actual expenses in particular categories that the irs designates relating mainly to taxpayers health and welfare.internal revenue manual.html.according to ransom,applicable can not mean the same thing as actual.brief for petitioner.he thus concludes that an applicable expense can be claimed under the means test even if no actual expense was incurred.ibid.
our interpretation of the statute,however,equally avoids conflating applicable with actual costs.although the expense amounts in the standards apply only if the debtor incurs the relevant expense,the debtor cost may well not control the amount of the deduction.if a debtor actual expenses exceed the amounts listed in the tables,for example,the debtor may claim an allowance only for the specified sum,rather than for his real expenditures for the other necessary expense categories,by contrast,the debtor may deduct his actual expenses,no matter how high they are our reading of the means test thus gives full effect to the distinction between applicable and actual without taking a further step to conclude that applicable means nonexistent.in re,bkrtcy.ed,rev.
finally,ransom reading of applicable may not even answer the essential question whether a debtor may claim a deduction.c onsult ing the table s alone to determine a debtor deduction,as ransom urges us to do,reply brief for petitioner,often will not be sufficient because the tables are not.this case provides a prime example.the ownership costs table features two columns labeled first car and second car.see supra,at.standing alone,the table does not specify whether it refers to the first and second cars owned as ransom avers,or the first and second cars for which the debtor incurs ownership costs as fia maintains and so the table does not resolve the issue in dispute see in re kimbro,bkrtcy.app.panel fulton,dissenting o ne can not really just look up dollar amounts in the tables without either referring to irs guidelines for using the tables or imposing assumptions about how they are to be navigated footnote omitted.some amount of interpretation is necessary to decide what the deduction is for and whether it is applicable to ransom and so we are brought back full circle to our prior analysis.
ransom next argues that viewing the deduction as covering no more than loan and lease payments is inconsistent with a separate sentence of the means test that provides notwithstanding any other provision of this clause,the monthly expenses of the debtor shall not include any payments for debts.b a ii i.the deduction can not comprise only loan and lease payments,ransom contends,because those payments are always debts.see brief for petitioner.
ransom ignores that the notwithstanding sentence governs the full panoply of deductions under the national and local standards and the other necessary expense categories.we hesitate to rely on that general provision to interpret the content of the deduction because congress did not draft the former with the latter specially in mind any friction between the two likely reflects only a lack of attention to how an exclusion of debt payments would correspond to a particular irs allowance further,the notwithstanding sentence by its terms functions only to exclude,and not to authorize,deductions.it can not establish an allowance for or lease ownership costs that no national or local standard covers.accordingly,the notwithstanding sentence does nothing to alter our conclusion that the ownership costs table does not apply to a debtor whose car is not encumbered.
ransom finally contends that his view of the means test is necessary to avoid senseless results not intended by congress.at the outset,we note that the policy concerns ransom emphasizes pale beside one his reading creates his interpretation,as we have explained,would frustrate bapcpa core purpose of ensuring that debtors devote their full disposable income to repaying creditors.see supra,at.we nonetheless address each of ransom policy arguments in turn.
ransom first points out a troubling anomaly under our interpretation,d ebtors can time their bankruptcy filing to take place while they still have a few car payments left,thus retaining an ownership deduction which they would lose if they filed just after making their last payment.brief for petitioner.indeed,a debtor with only a single car payment remaining,ransom notes,is eligible to claim a monthly ownership deduction,at.
but this kind of oddity is the inevitable result of a standardized formula like the means test,even more under ransom reading than under ours.such formulas are by their nature over and.in eliminating the adjudication of debtors expenses,on the ground that it leant itself to abuse,congress chose to tolerate the occasional peculiarity that a test produces.and ransom alternative reading of the statute would spawn its own anomalies even placing to one side the fundamental strangeness of giving a debtor an allowance for loan or lease payments when he has not a penny of loan or lease costs.on ransom view,for example,a debtor entering bankruptcy might purchase for a song a junkyard car an old,rusted pile of scrap metal that would si t on cinder blocks in his backyard,in re brown,bkrtcy.sd in order to deduct the expense and reduce his payment to creditors by that amount.we do not see why congress would have preferred that result to the one that worries ransom.that is especially so because creditors may well be able to remedy ransom one payment left problem.if car payments cease during the life of the plan,just as if other financial circumstances change,an unsecured creditor may move to modify the plan to increase the amount the debtor must repay.see a.
ransom next contends that denying the ownership allowance to debtors in his position sends entirely the wrong message,namely,that it is advantageous to be deeply in debt on motor vehicle loans,rather than to pay them off.brief for petitioner.but the choice here is not between thrifty savers and profligate borrowers,as ransom would have it.money is fungible the that ransom spent to purchase his camry outright was money he did not devote to paying down his credit card debt,and congress did not express a preference for one use of these funds over the other.further,ransom argument mistakes what the deductions in the means test are meant to accomplish.rather than effecting any broad federal policy as to saving or borrowing,the deductions serve merely to ensure that debtors in bankruptcy can afford essential items.the allowance thus safeguards a debtor ability to retain a car throughout the plan period.if the debtor already owns a car outright,he has no need for this protection.
ransom finally argues that a debtor who owns his car free and clear may need to replace it during the life of the plan g ranting the ownership cost deduction to a vehicle that is owned outright,he states,accords best with economic reality.at.in essence,ransom seeks an emergency cushion for car owners.but nothing in the statute authorizes such a cushion,which all debtors presumably would like in the event some unexpected need arises.and a person who enters bankruptcy without any car at all may also have to buy one during the plan period yet ransom concedes that a person in this position can not claim the ownership deduction.tr.of oral arg.the appropriate way to account for unanticipated expenses like a new vehicle purchase is not to distort the scope of a deduction,but to use the method that the code provides for all chapter debtors and their creditors modification of the plan in light of changed circumstances.see a see also supra,at.
based on bapcpa text,context,and purpose,we hold that the local standard expense amount for transportation ownership costs is not applicable to a debtor who will not incur any such costs during his bankruptcy plan.because the ownership costs category covers only loan and lease payments and because ransom owns his car free from any debt or obligation,he may not claim the allowance.in short,ransom may not deduct loan or lease expenses when he does not have any.we therefore affirm the judgment of the ninth circuit.
it is so ordered.

justice scalia,dissenting.
i would reverse the judgment of the ninth circuit.i agree with the conclusion of the three other courts of appeals to address the question that a debtor who owns a car free and clear is entitled to the allowance.see in re washburn,in re tate,in re.
the statutory text at issue is the phrase enacted in the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of bapcpa,applicable monthly expense amounts specified under the national standards and local standards,b a ii i.the court holds that the word applicable in this provision imports into the local standards a directive in the internal revenue service collection financial standards,which have as their stated purpose to help determine a taxpayer ability to pay a delinquent tax liability,app.to brief for respondent.that directive says that i f a taxpayer has no car payment,the ownership cost provisions of the local standards will not apply,at.
that directive forms no part of the local standards to which the statute refers and the fact that portions of the local standards are to be disregarded for purposes says nothing about whether they are to be disregarded for purposes of chapter of the bankruptcy code.the court believes,however,that unless the irs collection financial standards are imported into the local standards,the word applicable would do no work,violating the principle that we must give effect to every word of a statute wherever possible.ante,at quoting leocal ashcroft.i disagree.the canon against superfluity is not a canon against verbosity.when a thought could have been expressed more concisely,one does not always have to cast about for some additional meaning to the word or phrase that could have been dispensed with.this has always bee
