we hold today that in an adversary proceeding in bankruptcy court,a lawyer can be deemed to be the client implied agent to receive service of process when the lawyer repeatedly represented that client in the underlying bankruptcy case,and where the totality of the circumstances demonstrates the intent of the client to convey such authority.we also hold that grupo mexicano de desarrollo,alliance bond fund,d,does not bar the issuance of a preliminary injunction freezing assets where fraudulent conveyance or equitable causes of action are pleaded in the bankruptcy context.
on october,an involuntary bankruptcy case was filed against focus media,and john pringle was appointed trustee.on january,pringle brought an adversary proceeding against thomas rubin,the sole shareholder of focus media.the complaint alleged that focus media transferred approximately million to rubin in,and further that focus media granted millions of dollars in unpaid loans to rubin in and.pringle alleged that rubin had used these funds in part to pay his personal taxes.
on the same day that the complaint was filed,pringle also sought to freeze rubin assets by filing an ex parte motion for a temporary retraining order tro,a motion for a preliminary injunction,and a request for a writ of attachment.
the ex parte motion alleged pringle belief that rubin resided in france.bankruptcy judge kathleen march granted pringle motion and issued a tro against rubin,enjoining him from spending,transferring,concealing,dissipating,encumbering,assigning,hypothecating million in assets.the court additionally scheduled a hearing on pringle request for a preliminary injunction and ordered rubin served with the complaint,the summons,the ex parte motion,and the tro.
as ordered,pringle filed with the bankruptcy court proofs of service of the required documents.these proofs of service reflect that service on rubin was made geoffrey mousseau,wilshire,los angeles,ca.at the tro hearing,pringle attorney told the court that the only address i have for rubin at this time would be care of mousseau and associates.
on january,the court conducted a hearing on the preliminary injunction motion and rubin emergency motion for a stay pending appeal.rubin did not enter an appearance on the preliminary injunction motion however,yolanda orozco,counsel for rubin,was in attendance and argued the motion for stay on rubin behalf.the court indicated at the start of the hearing that its tentative ruling is to grant a preliminary injunction with the same terms as the tro if,and only if,the adversary summons and complaint were properly served on rubin.the court specified that the question here really comes down to whether mousseau was impliedly designated as an agent for service of process for rubin under the bankruptcy rules.
the bankruptcy court subsequently issued a preliminary injunction.the court found that mousseau,as counsel for rubin in the underlying bankruptcy case,was impliedly authorized to receive service of process on rubin behalf in the adversary case.as a consequence,the bankruptcy court had personal jurisdiction over rubin.the court issued the preliminary injunction based on a finding that pringle was likely to prevail on his claims against rubin for fraudulent conveyance under count one of the complaint,fraudulent conveyance under b count two,and turnover of property to the estate under count seven,and further that the bankruptcy estate would otherwise be irreparably injured.
rubin appealed the preliminary injunction to the district court,which affirmed the bankruptcy court.the district court found that service on mousseau was proper under federal rule of bankruptcy procedure b,noting that 
t here appears to be no precedent that bound the bankruptcy court or binds this court in determining whether an attorney has implied authority to accept service of process as a client agent under fed.b when the attorney has made appearances in court on the client behalf.
however,the court adopt ed the advisory precedent applied by the bankruptcy court,ruling that implied authority to accept service of process was proper under the bankruptcy rules.the district court summarized five instances of mousseau representation of rubin and involvement in the bankruptcy case,concluding the circumstances of appellant rubin involvement in the involuntary petition hearings,where appellant was represented by mousseau,indicate that mousseau did have implied authority to accept service of process in the subsequent adversary proceeding.having satisfied itself that it had jurisdiction,the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court issuance of a preliminary injunction.the district court found grupo mexicano de desarrollo,alliance bond fund,d,which held that injunctions are impermissible where a creditor seeking money damages lacks any interest in the debtor assets,inapplicable.

iii.discussion 
implied authorization to accept service is permitted under the bankruptcy rules where service is made in an adversary proceeding on a party attorney in the underlying bankruptcy case.
before a federal court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant,the procedural requirement of service of summons must be satisfied.omni capital int l,rudolf wolff,d.rubin contends that service of process on an agent impliedly authorized to accept service on a client behalf is impermissible,and,as a result,that the bankruptcy court lacked personal jurisdiction over him.we disagree.
it is undisputed that at the time mousseau was served on rubin behalf rubin resided in france.there is also no dispute that service was not attempted directly on rubin by the means authorized to serve individuals in foreign countries.see,fed.b adopting.f,which provides for service on individuals in foreign countries.instead,the basis for service here is federal rule of bankruptcy procedure b,which provides 
i n addition to the methods of service authorized by rule e j,service may be made within the united states by first class mail postage prepaid as follows 
upon any defendant,it is also sufficient if a copy of the summons and complaint is mailed to an agent of such defendant authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process,at the agent dwelling house or usual place of abode or at the place where the agent regularly carries on a business or profession and,if the authorization so requires,by mailing also a copy of the summons and complaint to the defendant as provided in this subdivision.
the question before us is whether an agent of a defendant authorized by appointment to receive service of process can include an agent impliedly authorized to accept service of process on a client behalf.
there appears to be only one circuit court case to address the issue of implied authority to accept service of process.in united states ziegler bolt parts,the federal circuit stated that a n agent authority to accept service may be implied in fact.id.at.in order to find implied authority to accept service of process,the ziegler court said,the record must show that the attorney exercised authority beyond the relationship,including the power to accept service.id.at.one additional circuit court has recognized that,at least in theory,implied authority to receive process may be allowed.see united states balanovski,cir the power of attorney granted to miss devine by balanovski at his departure was broad and sweeping in its terms,and an implied actual appointment to receive service of process may be readily spelled out therefrom.
despite the limited body of circuit court authority,numerous bankruptcy and district court cases have held that implied authority to accept service of process is permissible.see,interpret rawe in re interpret,if the purported agent activities in the forum are substantial and involve the significant exercise of independent judgment and discretion,service on the agent is valid even in the absence of express authorization to accept process.luedke delta air lines,an attorney activities on behalf of a client in proceedings in one court may indicate implied authority to receive service of process in integrally related litigation in another court.olympus dealer sales,the authority of an attorney to act as an agent for service of process need not be express and may be implied from surrounding circumstances indicating the intent of the principal client.
in sum,the basic concept that a party bankruptcy attorney can be authorized impliedly to accept service of process on the client behalf in a related adversary proceeding is neither novel nor inconsistent with general principles of agency law.see,restatement second of agency cmt.c noting that actual authority may be conferred either expressly or by implication stating that the nature and extent of authorization conveyed by principal to agent is interpreted in light of all accompanying circumstances.we find the reasoning of the decisions discussed above persuasive and adopt their conclusion,holding that in an adversary bankruptcy proceeding,rule b designation of an agent of a defendant authorized by appointment to receive service of process can include an agent impliedly authorized to accept service of process on a client behalf if the agent is the attorney representing the party in the related bankruptcy proceeding,and the totality of the surrounding circumstances demonstrates the intent of the client to convey such authority.
b.the bankruptcy judge did not err in ruling that mousseau was impliedly authorized to accept service on rubin behalf.
the critical inquiry in evaluating an attorney authority to receive process is,of course,whether the client acted in a manner that expressly or impliedly indicated the grant of such authority.olympus,at.if agency to accept service of process is to be implied,it must be implied from all the circumstances accompanying the attorney appointment which indicate the extent of authority the client intended to confer.nisselson roussopoulos in re roussopoulos,quoting united states bosurgi.
courts have taken different tacks in evaluating whether a lawyer is impliedly authorized to accept service of process on a client behalf.some courts focus on the scope of the attorney activities,and whether the attorney exercised independent judgment on the part of the client.see olympus,at.other courts look to the level of the attorney involvement in the related proceeding and the extent to which the two proceedings are intertwined.see reisman first new york bank for business in re reisman.
the two cases most often cited for the proposition that authorization to accept service of process can be implied focus primarily on the close relationship between the adversary proceeding and the underlying bankruptcy case and the fact that the attorney served in the adversary proceeding was counsel for the party in the bankruptcy case.in paddington press,hill samuel in re paddington press,the bankruptcy court held that where the law firm has appeared for the defendants in the bankruptcy case and where the instant adversary litigation is integrally related to the case,it necessarily appears that such counsel if not expressly,certainly impliedly,was authorized to receive service of process for the defendants.id.at.the bankruptcy court in in re reisman,first observed that a n agent authority to accept process on the corporation behalf may be implicit or explicit.at.after concluding that the defendant law firm in the adversary proceeding was not explicitly authorized to receive process on the defendant behalf,id.at,the court addressed whether the defendant law firm was implicitly authorized to accept service,id.at.when a defendant takes an active role in a bankruptcy case and appears through counsel in a proceeding integrally related to the case,such counsel is implicitly authorized to receive process for the defendants.id.at.see also bosurgi.at finding implied authority to accept service of process in a dispute over who had title to disputed funds,where the attorney for the party who was served had been hired to determine the party rights as to the money in question.
we agree with the bankruptcy court and the district court that service on mousseau constituted proper and effective service of process on rubin.first,as found by the bankruptcy court,mousseau was extensively involved in the underlying bankruptcy proceeding and on several occasions participated on rubin behalf.mousseau primarily appeared for focus media however,rubin was the sole shareholder of focus media,and mousseau repeatedly insisted to the bankruptcy judge and other parties to the action that he was also there on behalf of rubin as rubin personal lawyer.second,there is evidence that rubin previously had been served with papers in the bankruptcy proceeding in care of mousseau,and there is no record of rubin objecting.finally,and most importantly,rubin own declaration filed in a state court proceeding and signed shortly before the commencement of the adversary proceeding,states 
geoffrey mousseau,attorney at law has been general counsel for thomas rubin since september.in his capacity as my general counsel,geoffrey mousseau has been consulted on a variety of legal matters and has been made privy to confidential financial,tax and legal information related to myself,the dba and focus.mousseau has assisted me with respect to the pending focus bankruptcy,as well as the prior actions brought by sears and other media outlets in state court.
we recognize that an agent authority to act can not be established solely from the agent actions.rather,the authority must be established by an act of the principal.see,federal deposit ins.oaklawn apartments,cir.nonetheless,rubin own declaration both corroborates mousseau statements that he was rubin lawyer in the bankruptcy proceeding,and manifests the requisite evidence of authority conveyed by the principal.viewed in conjunction,these facts lead us to the conclusion that mousseau can properly be viewed as an agent impliedly authorized to accept service on rubin behalf in the related adversary proceeding.we therefore affirm the bankruptcy court ruling that service on mousseau constituted sufficient and effective service of process on rubin.
grupo mexicano does not bar the issuance of a preliminary injunction where,as here,the plaintiff in an adversary bankruptcy proceeding alleges fraudulent conveyance or other equitable causes of action.
