at issue in this case of first impression is whether the bankruptcy code protection of mortgage lenders against modification of claims secured by a principal residence applies when the residence in fact lies mostly on a lot abutting the mortgaged property.this case arises out of a bizarre set of facts.the debtor in this case and his mistakenly built a house on the property line between two lots owned by the debtor,a fact which was not discovered until after a mortgage on the lot believed to include the house had already been granted.compounding this problem is the fact that debtor,the bank,and the bankruptcy mistaken as to who owned what property when.despite this confusion,the bankruptcy court and the bankruptcy appellate panel thoroughly addressed the dispositive issues,and we affirm.
background 
the issues here center around two contiguous pieces of property jasper the jasper lot and enfield the enfield lot in methuen,massachusetts.vito anthony lafata the debtor resides in a house that straddles the property line between the jasper lot and the enfield lot,with the majority of the house on the enfield lot,but with a street address of jasper both properties were originally owned by a realty trust controlled by gail ness formerly the wife of the debtor.as part of an earlier divorce settlement,ness deeded the jasper lot to the debtor.importantly,both ness and the debtor had the mistaken belief at the time of the deed that the house lay entirely on the jasper lot.this erroneous belief was the first of two mistakes that resulted in this case being before us today.
in july,still with the mistaken belief that his house was entirely on the jasper lot,the debtor mortgaged the property to eastern savings bank,fsb eastern,the appellant here.eastern title work did not disclose that the majority of the debtor residence actually lay on the enfield lot in connection with the mortgage,the debtor executed a note for,secured solely by the jasper lot.it appears that he never made any of the payments due on the note.
following the grant of the mortgage to eastern,ness agreed to transfer the enfield lot to the debtor in exchange for money owed to ness by the debtor under their original divorce settlement,apparently unaware of the title issue.pursuant to this agreement,ness executed a deed,dated june,purporting to transfer the enfield lot to the debtor.however,because the payments were never made,the deed was never actually delivered to the debtor for recording purposes.instead it was held in escrow by ness attorney pending the payment of the additional funds owed by the debtor to ness.according to the record,because of nonpayment of the amount,ness remains the owner of the enfield lot today.hence the second mistake the debtor seemed to misunderstand this escrow arrangement,and during his bankruptcy proceedings operated with the mistaken belief that he was the fee simple owner of the enfield lot.
on august,the debtor filed for chapter bankruptcy protection,claiming as assets both the jasper lot and the enfield lot.at some point not clear from the record the debtor had become aware that his residence was not entirely on the jasper lot,but was instead mostly on the enfield lot this encroachment made the jasper lot noncompliant with zoning,which essentially destroyed its value.an appraisal commissioned by the debtor noted that,if compliant,the land would probably be worth around,but in its current state the property was worth only what the neighbor will pay for it a value the appraiser estimated at.
eastern filed a proof of claim for the full value of its mortgage,which it placed at,including delinquent interest and collection fees.on august,the debtor filed an objection to this proof of claim,as well as a motion for determination of secured status under and a proposed chapter plan.
as part of his proposed chapter plan,the debtor sought to bifurcate eastern bank claim into secured and unsecured portions,with the secured portion worth only,the appraised value of the collateral.that left,according to the debtor,in unsecured debt for which the debtor proposed to pay cents on the dollar.eastern thus stood to receive only on a claim that may have been worth as much as.eastern understandably objected to this.on august,it filed a response to the objection to the proof of claim,an objection to the motion for determination of secured status,and an objection to confirmation of the chapter plan.
further complicating matters,the city of methuen also filed an objection to the debtor motion for determination of secured status on or around august,in which it stated that,according to the registry of deeds,the enfield lot was actually owned by ness.the debtor responded on august by providing the court with a copy of the july,deed of the enfield lot from ness to the same deed that was subsequently discovered to be still in escrow.the bankruptcy court and eastern appeared to believe the debtor assurances that he owned the property and did not pursue the issue of ownership further 
the three objections raised by eastern each depend on whether b would allow eastern claim to be bifurcated as proposed by the debtor.the bankruptcy court ruled in favor of the debtor on december,and allowed the bifurcation of the claim into a secured claim of and an unsecured claim for the balance of the note.eastern appealed to the district court for the district of massachusetts,which affirmed the bankruptcy court on july,without opinion.eastern appeals from the district court decision,and that appeal is the first of the two appeals before us today.
following the bankruptcy court orders,eastern began an adversarial action against the debtor in bankruptcy court on january,seeking to reform the mortgage so as to include at least that portion of the enfield lot that included the debtor residence.during depositions for that proceeding,ness and the debtor both testified that the enfield lot was actually still owned by ness.at that point eastern moved for relief from judgment under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure eastern asked that the bankruptcy court vacate the three orders it had earlier decided in favor of the debtor,citing newly discovered evidence and fraud on the court.
the bankruptcy court held a show cause hearing on october,to confirm whether the deed was in fact in escrow and whether it could be delivered to the debtor.the court concluded that it could not be delivered.on october,the bankruptcy court denied the rule b motion,saying only that eastern failed to meet its burden.
eastern appealed the denial of the rule b motion to the bankruptcy appellate panel bap for the first circuit,which affirmed.eastern appealed to us,and that appeal makes up the second of the two appeals before us.
ii.discussion 
a.the bankruptcy court orders 
on appeal from a district court review of a bankruptcy court decision,we review the bankruptcy court legal conclusions de novo and its factual conclusions for clear error.brandt repco printers lithographics,in re healthco int l,cir.
eastern appeal from the bankruptcy court orders raises three issues whether the bankruptcy court correctly interpreted b of the bankruptcy code as allowing bifurcation here whether eastern was allowed a reasonable opportunity to object to the valuation of the jasper lot collateral and whether the bankruptcy court correctly applied the burden of proof 
section b of the bankruptcy code states that a chapter plan may 
modify the rights of holders of secured claims,other than a claim secured only by a security interest in real property that is the debtor principal residence,or of holders of unsecured claims,or leave unaffected the rights of holders of any class of claims.
b.prior to nobelman american savings bank,d,there was some disagreement among the circuits as to whether b allowed for bifurcation of undersecured homestead mortgages,such as the one at issue here.see,bellamy fed.home loan mortgage in re bellamy,cir holding that b only prohibits modification of the secured claim,but that the existence and size of the secured claim must be determined according to a.in nobelman,the supreme court held that b barred modification of the entire and unsecured the claim is secured by the debtor principal residence at.therefore,in the instant case,if eastern claim is secured by the debtor principal residence,then the claim can not be modified by bifurcating it into secured and unsecured claims,even though the value of the security is roughly the value of the claim.
despite mistakenly believing that the debtor owned the enfield lot,the bankruptcy court did still rule on this question under the correct set of facts.ironically,this confusing case is helped somewhat by confusion on a related issue should a court make the determination of what is the debtor primary residence for purposes of b at the time of the mortgage,the time of the petition for bankruptcy protection,or some other time compare in re smart,mortgage date,with in re wetherbee,petition date see also gmac mortgage marenaro in re marenaro,cir noting the uncertainty.because the issue is not settled,the bankruptcy court analyzed the applicability of b from both the mortgage date and the petition date 
the deed from ness to the debtor was dated after the debtor mortgaged the property to eastern.therefore,at the time of the mortgage,the debtor owned the jasper lot and did not claim to own the enfield lot.in analyzing the applicability of b at that point in time,the bankruptcy court said that 
the bank had and continues to have a mortgage on the jasper lot which is burdened with an encroachment.assuming without deciding that the physical presence of a significant amount of the residence on the jasper lot would be sufficient to bring the jasper lot within the rubric of primary residence,eastern has failed to prove that an eight to ten foot encroachment is the main part,the principal part,or even an important part of the debtor residence.indeed,from the pictures provided to the court by the debtor,it appears that the encroachment may only be an unenclosed deck.this is not a situation where a mortgagee has a lien on the primary residence that is comprised of two separately deeded parcels and the debtor is attempting to sell the unimproved lot.this is a case where the bank did not take a mortgage on the improved lot.to hold that the bank has a mortgage on the primary residence when admittedly it does not hold a mortgage on the enfield lot is akin to the tail wagging the dog.
eastern does not challenge the bankruptcy court finding that the encroachment is not the main part,the principal part,or even an important part of the residence.therefore,the question before us is whether even some nominal encroachment by a debtor principal residence on a mortgaged property will trigger the protections of b.we hold that it does not.
we begin with the language of the statute.see consumer prod.safety comm gte sylvania,d the starting point for interpreting a statute is the language of the statute itself.the key phrase in the statute is secured only by a security interest in real property that is the debtor principal residence.b.eastern argues that the statute is satisfied as long as the debtor resides on the mortgaged property.but that simply begs the question of what constitutes residing when a party actually resides mostly on the adjacent property the text of the statute provides little help in answering this question.see lomas mortgage,louis,cir finding the text of the statute ambiguous as to whether b bars modification of a mortgage secured by a dwelling.
in lomas,we also reviewed the legislative history of b,which we do not repeat here.see id.at.in that case,we noted that the most that could be said of the legislative history was that congress wanted to benefit the residential mortgage market as opposed to the entire real estate mortgage market.id.at.the concern was that without these protections,mortgage lenders would be too conservative in their lending.id.this dovetails with justice stevens concurrence in nobelman,where he notes that b was intended to encourage the flow of capital into the home lending market.at.stevens,concurring.
this policy of preferring mortgage lenders to other lenders in bankruptcy does not necessarily extend to those cases where the lender has failed to exercise reasonable due diligence,however.congress concern is with a home lending market,and that market depends in part on mortgage lenders working with due diligence to minimize risk for themselves,and the mortgage market in general.the problem eastern faces here is as a result of its own failure to properly examine the title to the jasper lot before taking the mortgage from the debtor had it done so,it would have found the cloud on the title and dealt with it accordingly.we see no reason why b should be used to correct this error.
we and other courts have interpreted b narrowly,even after the nobelman decision.see,scarborough chase manhattan mortgage in re scarborough,cir b does not bar modification where claim secured by multifamily dwelling,and noting policy of reading b literally and narrowly zimmer psb lending in re zimmer,cir b does not bar modification where claim is wholly unsecured because of prior lien on primary residence in re mann,cir same,and collecting cases lomas,at.the policy of encouraging mortgage lending does not require b to be interpreted expansively.indeed,if we were to allow eastern more expansive reading of b here,we could face cases in the future of lenders seeking its protection even when they had never intended to lend against a debtor principal residence.for example,suppose eastern and the debtor had a different mistaken belief at the time of the mortgage that the residence was entirely on the enfield lot,not the jasper lot.under such circumstances,where eastern intended to take a mortgage only on the undeveloped lot,should it be allowed then to claim the benefits of b upon discovering that the residence actually encroached on the mortgaged property the policy behind b would not be served,since eastern would not have taken the mortgage as a home lender.but the arguments that eastern has presented here would be equally as applicable in that situation the mortgaged property would be just as much the debtor principal residence as it is in the instant case.the only difference we can see is that the parties had intended the loan in this case to be a home mortgage loan when it was granted.but the statute is silent as to intent and as to type of mortgage it asks only the objective question of whether the mortgaged property is the debtor principal residence.furthermore,we are loath to create a rule that would require courts in the future to have to inquire into the parties subjective beliefs as to whether a particular mortgage of real property was intended to be a home mortgage or not,especially when the costs of an alternative rule are small and contained.
our ruling today does no more than say that the provisions of b will not apply if the debtor principal residence only encroaches on the mortgaged property lenders can easily avoid this if they do what they have always had the responsibility to do perform proper due diligence,title examination,and,if necessary,a land survey.the result of our holding is,of course,a windfall for the debtor.if the facts were as he believed them to be when he took the mortgage loan,he would not be able to strip the loan down by over.but if we held in eastern favor,there would instead be a windfall for the bank.this is not a case where a lender has watched the value of its collateral go down gradually until it is worth less than the loan.here,the property was never worth as much as eastern loan.if it had foreclosed the day after granting the loan,it would have received roughly the same as it receives now collateral worth and an unsecured claim for the balance of the loan.given its lack of due diligence,we see no reason why the result should be otherwise 
collateral valuation 
eastern also claims that it did not receive adequate notice of an intent to value the collateral.it raises this argument because it failed to object during the valuation hearing,and ordinarily that means that the debtor valuation is upheld by default.see enewally.mut.bank in re enewally,cir in re brown,see also,at issues raised f
