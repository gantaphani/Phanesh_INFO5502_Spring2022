the united states appeals the district court sentence of charly sion hagege for bankruptcy fraud and false representation of a social security number.the government argues that the district court committed error in refusing to increase hagege sentence on the basis of facts.hagege his conviction based on the following grounds the district court erred in denying hagege motion for an evidentiary hearing on the issue of whether the prosecutor intentionally provoked hagege into moving for a mistrial the district court erred in denying hagege motion to dismiss count one of the indictment based upon the statute of limitations the district court admission of foreign bank records violated the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment and the district court erred in denying hagege motion for a mistrial as to the second trial based upon the district court reference to a jury instruction relating to prior convictions.for the reasons given below,we will affirm the conviction,vacate the sentence,and remand the case for further proceedings in light of united states booker,d.
on september,hagege was named in a indictment charging him with making a false declaration in bankruptcy,in violation of count one,concealment of assets in bankruptcy,in violation of count two,and false representation of a social security number,in violation of a b counts three and four.count one of the indictment alleges that hagege made a false declaration in bankruptcy on or about january.absent any suspension period,the statute of limitations applicable to count one would have expired on january,approximately eight months before the indictment was filed.
on september,the government moved for a suspension of the statute of limitations,pursuant to,in order to obtain foreign evidence from israel.in the motion,the government requested that the suspension period begin on march,the date of its official request for assistance pursuant to the treaty of mutual legal assistance in criminal matters mlat to israel.in an order dated september,the district court granted the motion and suspended the statute of limitations from march,until final action is taken by israel on the government request for assistance,provided that this period of suspension may not exceed three years.aer at.
the mlat request sought production of records of bank accounts in israel in the name of hagege for the period from january,to the present.with regard to certification of the authenticity of the records,the mlat request provided,in relevant part,as follows 
in order to obtain the evidence sought as quickly as possible for use in the pending investigation,the united states will at this time accept the evidence sought without execution of the certifications enclosed at the end of this request the certifications are required for the use of the evidence at trial,but are not required for investigative purposes.thereafter,when the time for trial in the united states approaches,the united states requests that some or all of the evidence be resent to the united states in certified form as the evidence can not be admitted in court in the without these certifications.
on june,and june,the israeli government received two batches of uncertified bank records which it forwarded to the government in response to the mlat request.in a letter dated july,which identified mlat as the subject of the letter,the israeli government stated,t he above captioned request was executed.aer at.the july,letter also stated,in the future,should you need certified copies of the bank statements please let me know.aer at.
thrice between march and early december,the government requested the israeli government to produce a certificate of authenticity pertaining to the documents it had already sent,as well as additional documents responsive to the mlat request.on december,the israeli government produced the requested certificate of authenticity via facsimile.on or about the same date,the israeli government informed the government that bank hapoalim possessed additional documents relating to six accounts held by hagege,which had not been previously produced due to an oversight.on december,the government received the additional documents.
on december,hagege moved to dismiss the false declaration charge in count one of the indictment based on the statute of limitations.hagege argued that the israeli government took final action on the march,request when the israeli authorities first produced documents responsive to the request in june.hagege contended that the mlat request did not contain a request for certification.at most,hagege argued,the suspension period lasted six months pursuant to c.adding a suspension period to the statute of limitations,hagege contended that the statute of limitations expired,at the latest,on july.since the indictment was filed two months later on september,hagege argued that count one of the indictment was untimely.
in opposition to the motion,the government contended that final action was not taken by the israeli government on the mlat request until december,when the israeli government produced the certificate of authenticity and the additional responsive documents.the government argued that the statute of limitations was therefore suspended from march,until december.therefore,the government posited,the statute of limitations was suspended when count one of the indictment was filed on september.
the district court agreed with the government and denied the motion to dismiss.rejecting hagege reading of the mlat request as too narrow,the district court found that the mlat request included a request for certification.the district court found that the israeli government did not produce the certification or the requested documents until december,and,therefore,that final action did not occur until december.for these reasons,the district court concluded that count one of the indictment was not.
on december,prior to the start of trial,the government moved for an order ruling that foreign records obtained from banks in luxembourg and israel would be admitted pursuant to,based upon certificates of authenticity.hagege opposed the motion based upon several arguments,including the argument that the business records constituted inadmissible hearsay.hagege did not directly challenge the admission of the bank records based upon a violation of the confrontation clause.however,the government raised the issue of whether the admission of the records violated the confrontation clause in its reply memorandum.with the exception of some documents excluded as irrelevant,the district court permitted the admission of the foreign bank records under.
trial commenced on january.during trial,pursuant to the district court ruling under,the government introduced the foreign bank records into evidence,but not the certificates of authenticity.
on the third day of trial,the district court declared a mistrial after a government witness,anthony keats,testified that hagege was involved in a pornography business.the government had proffered that keats,a lawyer who had represented polo ralph lauren corporation polo in an unrelated civil action against hagege,would testify about hagege efforts in transferring assets in violation of a court order entered in the civil action.after keats took the stand,the government asked keats about the nature of the civil action and the judgment that was entered.keats testified that the civil action was based on hagege counterfeiting of polo trademark,and that the judgment included a million damage award.the government asked keats whether polo had ever collected the money.when keats testified that hagege had not paid the money,the government asked keats what steps polo had taken in order to collect the money.keats responded that polo had conducted an investigation to determine the whereabouts of the money that hagege had received from the counterfeiting activity.the government then prodded keats about the specifics of the investigation 
prosecutor what else did you do,keats,in order to try to collect your judgment 
witness in terms of the investigation or 
prosecutor was there more that you did in terms of the investigation 
witness well,the,in terms of depositions,we took a significant number of depositions of various parties who may have been involved in some of these transactions.i recall there was one gentleman who was a partner of hagege who had set up a pornography business with hagege 
aer at emphasis added.hagege counsel objected and requested a sidebar.the district court sustained the objection and at sidebar admonished the prosecutor,regarding keats testimony 
court did you talk to this witness before you put him on the stand what kind of nonsense is this 
prosecutor your honor,i did expect him to say that.
court shall i bring him over here and tell him we not trying to pillory this man.
prosecutor your honor,that was not the intent at all.i had no idea that that was going to come up.
court i inclined to grant a mistrial.
prosecutor your honor,the we could go was what other investigation did you do i had no idea that was going to come out.
court well,it not a punishment against the government.obviously,you did ask him to say that but the problem is that he said it.
prosecutor that was not the intent.it was one statement by a witness that was not anticipated by anybody,your honor and i believe it would be inappropriate to grant a mistrial at this time.
aer at.hagege counsel made an oral motion for a mistrial.the district court granted the motion and declared a mistrial,finding that the statement was so prejudicial the jury ca possibly forget it.aer at.
thereafter,hagege filed a motion for an evidentiary hearing to inquire into whether the prosecutor intentionally provoked the motion for a mistrial,in which case retrial would have been barred by the double jeopardy clause.the government opposed the motion.in an affidavit attached to the government opposition memorandum,the prosecutor stated that during the pretrial meetings,keats did not ever mention the word pornography or state that he had taken the deposition of a person who was in the pornography business with defendant.aer at.at oral argument,hagege counsel argued that the prosecutor declaration left open the question whether she had discussed the business with him,or some other euphemism for the word pornography.in response,the prosecutor represented to the district court at oral argument that we never discussed the adult entertainment business,the business,or any other way to describe the pornography business during the six hours that we met with keats.aer at.accepting the government representation,the district court denied the motion for an evidentiary hearing.citing to its earlier tentative ruling,the district court reasoned 
t here is no conceivable reason that the prosecutor would have wanted to trigger a mistrial motion by the defense.the government witnesses were ready and available evidence was being admitted as anticipated by the government.it is inconceivable to the court that the prosecutor decided,on the third day of trial,to sabotage her own trial and start over.
on the fifth day of retrial,the district court provided a copy of the jury instructions to the jury.the district court then proceeded to read the instructions to the jury.the following jury instruction was included in the packet of instructions 
you have heard evidence that defendant has previously been convicted of a crime.you may consider that evidence only as it may affect the defendant believability as a witness.you may not consider a prior conviction as evidence of guilt of the crime for which the defendant is now on trial.
aer at.upon reaching the foregoing instruction,the district court paused,did not read the instruction,and made the following remarks 
court i do believe this next instruction is properly in this packet,and i think it has been put in by mistake from another case.top of page.
prosecutor the first paragraph,i agree,your honor.that should not be in there.
defense yes,your honor.
court as you can imagine,we thought the trial might be going on longer than it did and so i have been scurrying back and forth to my secretary saying,prepare this pack of instructions.so please take your pen or pencil and whatever you got and cross out the instruction on the top of page because it is not from this trial.
hagege moved for a mistrial,arguing that the inclusion of the jury instruction in the packet of instructions gave the jury the impression that hagege had a prior conviction.the district court denied the motion,finding that there was no reason to believe that the jury would disbelieve his statement that the instruction was inadvertently pulled from another case and it ha d nothing to do with this case.ger at.
the jury returned a guilty verdict on all counts.thereafter,the district court held a sentencing hearing.citing to united states ameline,cir,superceded by cir en banc,which was controlling law at the time the district court stated that it would use and follow the federal sentencing g uidelines to determine the appropriate sentence but w ould not enhance unless the facts in support of the enhancement or adjustment were found by the jury.ger at.constrained by the facts found by the jury,the district court stated that it would calculate a guideline base offense level of six and apply a adjustment for concealing assets and a adjustment for an amount of loss in excess of.the district court related that these adjustments were supported by facts necessarily found by the jury.based upon a total offense level of eleven and a criminal history category of ii,the district court calculated a range of ten to fourteen months and stated that it would impose a twelve month sentence.
in addition,noting that the supreme court had granted certiorari in two cases involving the applicability of blakely washington,d,to the guidelines,the district court also arrived at two hypothetical sentences depending upon the outcome of those cases.the district court stated that if the supreme court were to determine that the guidelines were unaffected by blakely,it would enhance the sentence based upon facts.specifically,beginning with a base offense level of six,the district court would add ten levels for loss in the amount of,two levels for more than minimal planning,two levels for concealment of assets,and two levels for obstruction of justice,for a total offense level of.with a criminal history category of ii,the district court determined that it would impose a sentence of months.the district court related that,alternatively,if the supreme court were to determine that the guidelines were facially invalid,it would look at the factors set forth in and select a sentence.
the district court sentenced hagege to twelve months imprisonment,three years supervised release,restitution of,and a special assessment of.
hagege first contention on appeal is that the district court erred in denying his motion for an evidentiary hearing regarding whether the prosecutor intentionally provoked him into moving for a mistrial.we review the district court denial of the motion for an evidentiary hearing for an abuse of discretion.see united states hernandez,cir,overruled on other grounds by muscarello united states,d.
the double jeopardy clause provides criminal defendants the right to have their case heard and a verdict returned by the jury originally impaneled.greyson kellam,cir.here,we are concerned with the contours of that right when the defendant himself moves for,and is granted,a mistrial.when a mistrial is declared at the behest of the defendant,there is a narrow exception to the general rule that the double jeopardy clause is no bar to retrial.oregon kennedy,d.under that exception,a defendant who has moved for a mistrial may invoke the bar of double jeopardy where the conduct giving rise to the successful motion for a mistrial was intended to provoke the defendant into moving for a mistrial.id.at.at.prosecutorial misconduct alone,in the absence of such an intent,does not invoke the bar of double jeopardy.see id.at.at.for example,p rosecutorial conduct that might be viewed as harassment or overreaching,even if sufficient to justify a mistrial on defendant motion,does not bar retrial absent intent on the part of the prosecutor to subvert the protections afforded by the double jeopardy clause.id.thus,in determining whether the protection of the double jeopardy bar applies,the district court must examine the intent of the prosecutor.id.at.at.inference of the existence or nonexistence of intent should be based upon the objective facts and circumstances.id.
hagege asserts that the district court lacked a sufficient factual basis to determine that an evidentiary hearing regarding prosecutorial intent was unnecessary.hagege maintains that an evidentiary hearing was necessary to determine whether the prosecutor had discussed the issue of pornography with keats prior to trial.the government responds that the district court accepted the prosecutor representation at oral argument that keats and the government never discussed the adult entertainment business,the business,or any other way to describe the pornography business during the six hours that we met with keats.aer at.the government posits that an evidentiary hearing was unnecessary since the district court was familiar with the objective facts and circumstances of the case and found no evidence that the prosecutor intended to provoke the mistrial.
this court has not had the occasion to decide under what circumstances a district court,presented with a double jeopardy claim that the prosecutor intended to provoke a mistrial,must hold an evidentiary hearing.however,several other courts of appeals have addressed the issue,with varying approaches.see,united states curry,cir united states pavloyianis,cir united states oseni,cir united states white,cir united states wentz,cir.
adopting a methodical approach to the issue,the court of appeals for the seventh circuit has set forth a procedure to guide a court in determining whether an evidentiary hearing is necessary.see oseni,at.under that approach,the district court should,first,elicit an informal explanation from the prosecutor as to the reason for the misconduct,and,second,assess the progress of the trial.id.if the prosecutor explanation is reasonable and the trial was not going poorly for the government,the district court may accept the prosecutor explanation without the need for an evidentiary hearing.id.
taking a more flexible and seemingly more deferential approach,the courts of appeals for the fourth circuit and the sixth circuit have stated that a hearing is required only if there existed a genuine issue in the mind of the trial court concerning the prosecutor intent.white,at citing wentz,at.thus,for example,in wentz,the court found no reversible error in the district court failure to hold an evidentiary hearing before retrial.at.in deferring to the district court finding,the wentz court underscored that t he trial judge was quite familiar with the events surrounding defendant motion for a mistrial and was uniquely positioned to characterize the conduct of the government id.at.the court further reasoned that there was nothing in the record to indicate that the district court finding that no goading took place was incorrect.id.
the court of appeals for the eighth circuit has taken a similar approach.in curry,the court accepted t he district court conclu sion that because it had heard the trial and was familiar with the objective facts and circumstances of the case,a hearing was not necessary.at.
similarly,the court of appeals for the second circuit has stated that n o rule of law requires a hearing in this sort of case where the relevant facts can be ascertained from the record.pavloyianis,at.in pavloyianis,rejecting the defendant contention that an evidentiary hearing was necessary,the court reasoned that the district court had presided over all the proceedings and reviewed the affidavits,and had not found the slightest indication or evidence of prosecutorial misconduct in connection with the government witness perjury.id.
in this case,the government witness testified that hagege was involved in a pornography business.after the testimony,the district court asked the prosecutor at sidebar,what kind of nonsense is this aer at.in response,the prosecutor explained that she had not expected the witness to give that testimony and it had not been her intent for him to do so.the district court accepted the prosecutor explanation,stating o bviously,you did ask him to say that but the problem is that he said it.aer at.hagege contends that the prosecutor declaration in opposition to his motion did not address whether the prosecutor discussed the issue of pornography with keats under any euphemism.however,the district court elicited,and accepted,the prosecutor representation at oral argument that she did not discuss the issue of pornography or any euphemism thereof with keats during their pretrial meeting.having presided over the entire proceedings and reviewing the affidavits,the district court was uniquely positioned to evaluate the prosecutor conduct.there is nothing in the record that calls into question the veracity of the prosecutor representations.
furthermore,the district court observed that the case had been going well for the government witnesses were ready and available evidence was being admitted as anticipated by the government.ger at.based upon this assessment,the district court found that there wa s no conceivable reason that the prosecutor would have wanted to trigger a mistrial motion by the defense.ger at.hagege has not offered a single reason why the government would have wanted to sabotage a trial that was going well.
in summary,the district court elicited reasonable explanations from the prosecutor regarding the alleged misconduct and assessed that the trial was going favorably for the government.based upon all of the objective facts and circumstances,the district court concluded that there was no indication or evidence of prosecutorial misconduct intended to provoke a mistrial.under any of the approaches formulated by our sister courts,we find no error in the district court determination that an evidentiary hearing was unnecessary.accordingly,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for an evidentiary hearing.
hagege next challenges the district court denial of his motion to dismiss count one of the indictment based upon the statute of limitations.pursuant to,the government may seek the suspension of the running of a statute of limitations for an offense to obtain evidence of the offense in a foreign country.hagege argues that notwithstanding any allowable suspension period under,count one of the indictment was untimely.we review the district court denial of the motion to dismiss de novo and its factual findings underlying the legal ruling for clear error.united states degeorge,cir.
under,the period of suspension begin s on the date on which the official request is made and end s on the date on which the foreign court or authority takes final action on the request.b.the parties dispute the duration of the period of suspension.to determine the duration of the suspension period in this case,we address the following question what is the scope of the official request made on march,and when was final action taken on the official request.
the government made an official mlat request to israel on march.hagege contends that the mlat request contained only a request for documents and expressly disavowed any need for certification of the documents.the government maintains that the mlat request included a request for certification.the district court agreed with the government and read the mlat letter as encompassing both a request for documents and a request for a certificate of authenticity.based upon the relevant language in the mlat request,we can not say that the district court reading was clearly erroneous.
although the march,mlat request allowed for the initial production of uncertified documents,it also requested that the documents be resent in certified form.the mlat letter underscored the necessity of the certification i n order for the requested bank records to be received as evidence in courts of the united states,and stated when the time for trial in the united states approaches,the united states requests that some or all of the evidence be resent to the united states in certified form.aer at.throughout the mlat request,the government reiterated a need for certified documents.aer at.the procedures to be followed section of the mlat request contained specific instructions regarding completion of the certification form.aer at.furthermore,the special considerations regarding execution of this request section of the mlat request asked that particular care be taken to ensure that the forms are executed in precise accordance with their terms and the directions set forth in this request.aer at.thus,the language of the mlat request supports the district court reading.
hagege relies upon the israeli government july response to the mlat request in support of his argument that the request did not contain a certification request.in that letter,the israeli government stated,t he above captioned request was executed,and stated in the future,should you need certified copies of the bank statements please let me know.aer at.hagege posits that if the mlat request had included a certification request,then the israeli government would not have viewed its mere production of documents as execution of the request.
hagege reliance on a foreign sovereign response to determine the scope of the mlat request is flawed for two principal reasons.first,there are inherent practical difficulties in defining the scope of a request ex post facto by reference to its response.second,and more importantly,such a result would turn application of on the subjective opinion of foreign correct or than on an objective assessment of the scope of an official request.see united states torres,cir.these two considerations militate against reliance on israel response to determine whether the mlat request contained a certification request.
hagege also argues that accepting the government reading of the mlat request would permit the government extrajudicially to extend the suspension period,thereby encouraging delay and upsetting the separation of powers of government.hagege is correct,in part.by making an official request for certified documents with a future delivery provision,the government is able to extend the suspension period longer than had it insisted upon immediate delivery of the certified documents.however,does not prohibit this kind of conduct.generally speaking,the statute does not regulate the mechanics of how the government goes about obtaining foreign evidence.in particular,there is nothing in the statute which dictates when the government must demand delivery of a certificate of authenticity of the foreign documents it has requested.by implication,congress has left these matters to the discretion of the attorney for the united states.thus,contrary to hagege suggestion otherwise,reading the mlat request as encompassing a request for certification does not implicate separation of powers principles.
moreover,as we noted in united states bischel,cir,there is no requirement in that the government diligently seek evidence located in a foreign country since the statute has a time limitation on the suspension period.the statute provides that the total period of suspension shall in no event exceed three years.c.further,the total period of suspension can not exceed six months if final action is taken before the statute of limitations would have otherwise expired.c.in enacting these time limitations,congress took the potential for governmental delay into consideration.torres,at.the inclusion of these time limitations in the suspension statute attempts to create a balance between permitting the government to obtain foreign evidence and ensuring that the defendant is given the protections of predictability and promptness which underlie statutes of limitations.given these time limitations,we conclude that adopting the government construction of the mlat request would not result in unabashed delay.
for the foregoing reasons,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in construing the mlat request as containing both a request for documents and a request for certification.
the next issue is when the israeli government took final action on the mlat request as construed as a request for documents and certification.although final action is not defined in,in bischel,we held that final action for purposes of means a dispositive response by the foreign sovereign to both the request for records and for a certificate of authenticity of those records,when both a re identified in the official request.at.
in bischel,the government sent to the british government an official request seeking copies of certain bank records,copies of certain records of precious metals trading activity,and a certificate of authenticity of those records.id.at.by the time the indictment was returned,the british authorities had produced all of the documents requested,but not the certificate of authenticity.id.in bischel,we concluded that final action had not occurred by the time the indictment was returned because the british authorities had not decided whether they would comply with the request for certification.id.at.we reasoned that pegging final action to disposition,up or down,of each of the items in the official request provides a more certain benchmark by which to measure whether the action that has been taken is final or not.id.
under bischel,therefore,we must determine when the israeli government made a disposition,up or down,of each of the items in the official request,including the request for certification.id.the record indicates that in june,the israeli government produced documents responsive to the mlat request,but no certification.the israeli government july,letter,stating in the future,should you need certified copies of the bank statements please let me know,was not a disposition,up or down,of the certification request.id.at this point,the israeli government had not provided the certificate of authenticity,nor had it indicated it would not comply with the request for certification.the government continued to pursue the certificate of authenticity,making three requests between march and early december.finally,on december,the government received the certificate of authenticity via facsimile from israel.thus,under bischel,final action for purposes of could not have occurred before december,when the government received the requested certificate of authenticity.accordingly,the statute of limitations was suspended from march,until,at least,december.since the indictment was filed on september,we conclude that count one of the indictment was timely filed accordingly,we find no error in the district court decision to deny hagege motion to dismiss 
hagege next argues that the district court admission of foreign records under violated hagege right of confrontation.a district court evidentiary rulings are reviewed for an abuse of discretion.head glacier northwest,cir.we review de novo a district court admission of evidence in alleged violation of the confrontation clause.united states weiland,cir.if the defendant failed to object to the admission of evidence under the confrontation clause,we review for plain error.united states allen,cir.
pursuant to,i n a criminal proceeding in a court of the united states,a foreign record of regularly conducted activity,or a copy of such record,shall not be excluded as evidence by the hearsay rule if a foreign certification attests to the requirements specified in the statute under,a foreign certification serves to authenticate the foreign records,and thus dispenses with the necessity of calling a live witness to establish authenticity.united states sturman,cir a a foreign certification under this section shall authenticate such record or duplicate.in addition,when a foreign certification meets the requirements of a,the statute prevents the exclusion of the foreign records as hearsay.sturman,at.
hagege raises the argument that the district court admission of foreign records under violated his right of confrontation under crawford washington,d.in crawford,the supreme court considered whether a trial court admission of a statement made by a witness while in police custody,where the defendant had n
