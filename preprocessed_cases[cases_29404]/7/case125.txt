lernout hauspie speech products,l h was a belgian company,with its headquarters in massachusetts,engaged in developing and licensing speech recognition software.its first public stock offering occurred in.from to,it reported soaring revenues and profits and acquired other companies in march,it contracted to acquire two dictaphone and dragon systems,dragon and took on massive new debt in connection with these acquisitions.
in august,newspaper stories triggered investigations which concluded that the company had greatly overstated revenues and profits.in november,an audit ordered by the audit committee of the l h board found that revenues during the prior two and a half years had been overstated by over a quarter billion dollars.ultimately,certain top officers and directors were implicated in apparent fraud we refer to them as the implicated managers.
the accounting devices employed in overstating the revenues and profits included it appears recording revenue from contracts l h had yet to execute,booking revenue in a lump sum where the amount should have been amortized across several years,and recording revenue from clients who did not exist or who had not made payments or commitments that could properly be recorded.following the disclosures,the chairman,managing directors and ceo among others resigned,and shortly thereafter l h filed for chapter reorganization in delaware.et.
in may,the bankruptcy court approved a plan of liquidation.the plan gave authority to prosecute claims on behalf of l h to a litigation trustee appointed by a committee of unsecured creditors there is apparently no prospect of anything being left over for stockholders.after the plan became effective,the trustee brought the present action,in august,against l h former and belgian affiliates collectively kpmg.
the action,originally filed in the federal bankruptcy court in delaware,was transferred to the federal district court in massachusetts.the only claim pertinent to this appeal was brought under.laws ch.the complaint also charged,as tort violations,aiding and abetting the breach of a fiduciary duty and accounting malpractice,but the district court dismissed these two claims as barred by the statute of limitations and no appeal has been taken as to them.
chapter,so far as it applies to transactions,provides a civil cause of action,with the possibility of multiple damages and attorneys fees for willful violations,for unfair or deceptive trade practices.id.to apply at all,it requires a level of fault going beyond mere negligence,darviris petros,and also connections between the wrong and massachusetts that for present purposes the parties assume to be satisfied 
the complaint charged that kpmg had wide access to l h financial records and activities that despite discovering and in some cases warning managers of serious problems,kpmg failed to alert the independent directors of l h and instead issued unqualified opinions and certified balance sheets and operating statements of l h for fiscal years and and that these actions permitted l h to proceed with the dictaphone and dragon acquisitions,thereby incurring million in new debt which after the disclosures it could not repay.
the allegations include but go beyond claims of negligence by kpmg and in effect charge that the accounting firms knowingly tolerated patently improper accounting practices by l h in order to retain a lucrative client for kpmg.these are only allegations but,because the claim was disposed of on a motion to dismiss.b,we must assume the allegations to be true.rogan menino,cir,cert.denied,d.
in moving to dismiss the complaint,kpmg argued,so far as is pertinent to this appeal,that it was charged in substance only with negligence,which is not embraced by chapter that the chapter claim belonged to the creditors individually and not l h,for whom the trustee alone could sue and that such a claim in all events was barred by the doctrine of in pari delicto.
in a decision dated september,the district court agreed with kpmg that in pari delicto barred the trustee claim under chapter and dismissed the action.on this appeal,the trustee challenges the in pari delicto ruling.kpmg defends the ruling as correct,and as alternative grounds for affirming the dismissal says the trustee also lacks standing and that the allegations did not make out a claim under chapter 
objections based on standing must be addressed at the threshold if they implicate our authority to hear a case under article iii of the constitution.steel citizens for a better env t,d.at different times kpmg has made,and tangled together,two different standing arguments.on close scrutiny,neither one presents a serious standing objection under article iii.
a common formulation of article iii standing is that the plaintiff must allege injury,fairly traceable to the defendant conduct,that a court can redress.valley forge christian coll.americans united for separation of church and state,d becker fed.election comm n,cir,cert.denied,d.the statement simplicity is deceiving the requirements present endless complexities.see chemerinsky,federal jurisdiction,at ed.
in its appellate brief,kpmg argues principally that the trustee in this case is seeking redress for an injury to the creditors,that the creditors must present their own claims directly by suing as plaintiffs themselves,and that therefore this is a classic case of a plaintiff the trustee who is wrongly seeking to assert the claims of others the creditors who are not parties to this case.see,warth seldin,d.
courts often do use the term standing for cases in this category,one of the normally say that the question of who may assert an otherwise proper claim is an issue of prudential,rather than article iii,standing.valley forge,at.chemerinsky,supra,at.after all,courts can be empowered to hear claims of injury to others trustees,parents and guardians make such claims all the time.objections of this kind do not have to be resolved at the threshold under steel.see at.mcbee delica,cir.
in any event this objection is without merit.a creditor who relied on false earnings statements might under certain circumstances have a claim against a complicit accountant.see nycal kpmg peat marwick llp.but the trustee in this case does not even purport to be asserting such claims in the complaint the trustee advances only claims of l h,which under the plan of reorganization,he is entitled to do.see also,a.
that the creditors will benefit if such a suit is successful does not mean that their own claims against kpmg are at issue.see official comm.of unsecured creditors lafferty,cir.they will benefit because they have claims against l h,it is bankrupt,and under the plan they have access to the company residual assets among the assets are such claims as l h may have against kpmg.there is no threat that such a creditor or any other plaintiff will be allowed to recover twice for the same loss.see dobbs,law of remedies,at ed.
of more interest is a different standing objection that kpmg asserted in the district court whether kpmg is renewing the objection on this appeal is unclear,but if it were a valid article iii objection we would have to dismiss sua sponte.spenlinhauer,cir.this is the argument that inflating its earnings can not have injured l h itself at worst,this inflation led l h to borrow and expend money on the strength of its false for which l h received valuable assets in the acquisition of dictaphone and dragon.
the intuitive appeal of such arguments is that where a company inflates its earnings,the victims may appear to be only others who loan it money or buy its stock and the company may seem to be the culprit rather than an injured party.yet,if one looks at consequences,the company may suffer as well witness enron.federal courts have been unsympathetic to this kind of no harm argument,devising to answer it,schacht brown,cir.deepening insolvency,cert.denied,d.
how massachusetts would view the argument is unclear,but this no harm argument does not have the look and feel of an article iii objection.that l h in fact suffered harm from kpmg alleged wrongdoing is colorably asserted,the trustee has authority to act as plaintif
