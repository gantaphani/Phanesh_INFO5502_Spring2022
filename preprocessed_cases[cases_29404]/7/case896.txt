under the bankruptcy code,a chapter debtor may not receive a discharge of his debts if he received a discharge in a case filed under chapter of this title during the period preceding the filing of his chapter petition.f.jason sanders filed this chapter case more than four years after he filed an earlier chapter case but less than four years after the bankruptcy court issued his chapter discharge.the question is whether the clock runs from the date he filed the chapter petition or the date of the discharge.because we conclude that f sets a trigger and because sanders filed his chapter petition more than four years before initiating this chapter proceeding,the code permits the discharge.
the relevant facts are not in dispute.on july,sanders filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under chapter.the bankruptcy court granted him a discharge on february.
on january,sanders filed a second bankruptcy petition,this time under chapter,seeking confirmation of his plan and a second discharge.the chapter trustee,krispen carroll,objected to the confirmation and the discharge.the bankruptcy court confirmed sanders payment plan but denied his request for a discharge,explaining that the bankruptcy code barred it from granting a discharge to a debtor who had already received one under chapter within the preceding four years.see f.
the district court reversed.section f,it reasoned,does not bar sanders from obtaining a discharge,notwithstanding the date of the first discharge,because he filed the petition in that chapter case more than four years before initiating this chapter proceeding.carroll appealed.
because this case comes to us from the bankruptcy court by way of an appeal from a decision of a district court,we review directly the decision of the bankruptcy court.in re cook,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in doing so,we take a fresh look at its legal conclusions.
when congress overhauled the bankruptcy code in,it limited a debtor ability to obtain multiple discharges by filing one bankruptcy proceeding after another.see bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act bapcpa of,stat,codified as amended at f.to that end,it enacted f,which provides 
f notwithstanding chapter provisions authorizing discharges,the court shall not grant a discharge of all debts provided for in the plan if the debtor has received a discharge 
in a case filed under chapter,or of this title during the period preceding the date of the order for relief under chapter,or 
in a case filed under chapter of this title during the period preceding the date of such order.
f.in applying this bar on seeking a second discharge,as in applying all bars,a court must answer two questions when does the clock start running,and when does it stop the parties agree that the clock stops running upon the filing of the chapter petition,and so do we.by referring to the order for relief in the chapter case,subsection f makes clear that the time limit ends on the date the chapter petition was filed.as the code elsewhere explains,a voluntary bankruptcy case is commenced by filing a petition,id.a,and commencement of a voluntary case constitutes an order for relief,id.b.
what separates the parties is the other question when does the statute forbidden window begin the date of the filing of the chapter petition or the date of the chapter discharge sanders insists that the key date is when he filed his prior petition under chapter on july,while carroll claims that the clock did not start until sanders received the discharge in his first case on february,bringing his present petition barely within the ban.
as we see it,the prohibition began when sanders filed his first petition,not when he received his first discharge.in reaching this conclusion,we start with a point of w hen a word such as a pronoun points back to an antecedent or some other referent,the true referent should generally be the closest appropriate word,bryan garner,garner modern american usage see also norman singer shambie singer,sutherland statutes and statutory construction ed.consistent with this principle,the courts ordinarily assume that a limiting clause or phrase modif ies only the noun or phrase that it immediately follows.barnhart thomas,d.although not an absolute imperative,the rule of the last antecedent creates at least a rough presumption that such qualifying phrases attach only to the nearest available target.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
read with this rule in mind,f pieces fit sensibly together,each phrase modifying the one that comes before it and each phrase having an independent task to do.the in a case filed under phrase that begins subsection f modifies received a discharge,and the phrase that frames the window during the period preceding the second petition modifies the filed under fragment that comes immediately before it.f branigan bateman in re bateman,cir concluding that reading the nearly identical language of f the same way gives effect to the logical sequence of the language used,because under this reading a ll words are given effect and n o punctuation needs to be added or deleted to make sense of the statute internal quotation marks omitted.the upshot is this a debtor may not receive a discharge under chapter if he already received a discharge under chapter and the two cases were filed less than four years apart.
carroll contrary the window begins on the date of the first reading during the period as reaching back to the phrase received a discharge in subsection f opening clause.but she points to nothing in the statute to rebut the presumption.congress no doubt could have worked around this grammatical rule had it wished,see bateman,at,but we see nothing in the section to justify dispensing with this default rule of interpretation.
besides honoring the rule,this construction of the statute has another virtue it avoids reading the word filed out of the statute.had congress meant to adopt a rule,it could have satisfied that objective by omitting the word filed entirely from the provision.id.at.the clipped phrase a case under would perform the very function that carroll contends in a case filed under accomplishes denoting the chapter under which the debtor filed his petition.throughout the bankruptcy code,congress has deployed the a case under phrase to perform that same function.see,a k,d b,a,a,a d,d c,b,d.carroll offers no explanation why congress would have added the word filed to f when a more familiar phrase,which does not include the term,would have achieved the same objective.nor does carroll reading offer any role for filed to play in the statute,save for superfluity,a result we must resist where possible.see,mountain states.pueblo of santa ana,d.
we have some company in reaching this conclusion.although no other court of appeals has addressed this precise issue,the fourth circuit has held that f between obtaining discharges under chapter begins on the date the first petition is filed,not when the debtor receives the first discharge.see bateman,at accord gagne fessenden in re gagne,cir.bap in re myers,wl,at.june,in re ward,in re witherspoon,wl,at,in re graves,wl,at,in re west.a few courts,it is true,have suggested in dicta that f creates a time frame.see in re sidebottom,cir in re williams,in re perkins,in re lilly,in re selinsky.but to our knowledge every federal court to decide the question definitively has held that f embargo begins on the date of filing,not the date of discharge.see,in re ybarra,in re lewis,in re knighton,mcdow ratzlaff in re ratzlaff,in re mcghee,mcdow sours in re sours,accord collier on bankruptcy alan resnick henry sommer,ed william houston brown,taking exception to a debtor discharge the bankruptcy amendments make it easier,am.
in resisting this reading,carroll offers two reasons that the clock should not start running until the date of the first discharge.first,she points to two other provisions in chapter that predate f and that impose parallel time limits on debtors seeking discharges.section a of the code provides that,where a debtor files a petition for relief under chapter,the bankruptcy court shall grant a discharge,unless the debtor has been granted a di
