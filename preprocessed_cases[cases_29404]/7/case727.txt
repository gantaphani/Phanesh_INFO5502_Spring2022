these consolidated appeals concern the vitality of the lease of a nursing home facility,valley grand manor.the lessor,valley educational foundation vef,argues that it validly terminated the lease in june,before the lease primary term expired.it also argues that if the lease survived the attempted termination,the lessee,eldercare properties eldercare,failed effectively to exercise its option to renew the lease for an additional term and that the lease consequently expired in december.eldercare argues that vef never effectively terminated the lease.as to its failure strictly to comply with the lease renewal terms,eldercare contends that texas common law principles of equitable intervention render its renewal effective.
the dispute has unfolded in the course of eldercare chapter bankruptcy.the issue whether the lease was validly terminated arose when eldercare bankruptcy estate moved to assume the lease in order to reorganize for the sole purpose of continuing to operate the nursing home.the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of texas sided with eldercare and allowed it to assume the lease,concluding that the lease had not been terminated.the court also ordered the parties to mediate certain ongoing lease terms.while the mediation process unfolded,eldercare failed to provide timely notice of its intent to renew the lease,and vef later sought to evict eldercare,arguing that the lease had expired while the parties were pursuing mediation.again the bankruptcy court sided with eldercare,invoking texas common law principles of equitable intervention to excuse eldercare technical omission.the united states district court for the southern district of texas affirmed the former conclusion,but reversed the latter.it held i the lease was not terminated in june and was thus properly assumed and ii texas principles of equity could not excuse eldercare failure to provide timely notice and as a result the lease expired in december.
we agree with the bankruptcy court on both questions.we conclude that vef failed to terminate the lease and that the lease was properly assumed by eldercare bankruptcy estate.we further conclude that principles of equitable intervention under texas law are properly applied in the unique circumstances of this case in order to render effective eldercare renewal.
pertinent facts and procedural 
background.
vef is a organization owned by the seventh day adventist church.when it ran into difficulty operating two nursing homes and a retirement facility that it owned,it asked glen hamel,a member of the church and the owner of eldercare,to join vef board and to offer help.with hamel assistance,vef sold one of the nursing homes and the retirement facility.this dispute involves the remaining nursing home,valley grand manor.under a management contract,eldercare took control of that facility operations.in,the parties went a step farther,consummating a lease of the facility to eldercare.in light of the church policy that its members should not litigate against one another,the lease agreement included several uncommon provisions requiring good faith negotiations and mediation in certain contexts.
maintenance of minimum insurance coverage.
in two provisions,the lease obliged eldercare to maintain minimum insurance coverage.section set minimum coverage levels for claims for personal injury or property damage under a policy of general public liability insurance.section did so for claims arising out of malpractice.section of the lease also provided for renegotiation of the coverage minimums as follows 
in the event that either party shall at any time deem the limits of the personal injury or property damage public liability insurance then carried to be either excessive or insufficient,the parties shall endeavor to agree on the proper and reasonable limits for such insurance if the parties shall be unable to agree thereon,the proper and reasonable limits for such insurance to be carried shall be determined by a mediator jointly selected,provided however that the terms of the underlying base lease shall control the minimum insurance requirements which eldercare is required to provide hereunder.
renegotiation of rent terms.
because the nursing home derived a substantial portion of its revenue from reimbursements more than before,the parties,in sections and of the lease,provided for the renegotiation of the rent terms in the event of substantial changes in those programs 
vef recognizes that the primary source of revenue for the facility is derived from residents from whom the payer source is either medicaid or medicare.thus,should there be substantive changes reductions in the way that medicaid or medicare their successor programs reimburse the facility for providing care,vef at eldercare request will enter into good faith negotiations with respect to the amount of basic rent additional rent that is due and payable under the terms of this lease agreement.
vef and eldercare agree that should there be significant changes in the medicare medicaid reimbursement methodology,they will proceed in good faith to amend the terms of this agreement in a manner that represents a reasonable accommodation of the interests of each party.
default by eldercare and vef right to terminate.
article of the lease addressed default and termination.section b provided that it would be deemed an even t of default by eldercare if eldercare fail ed to comply with any term,provision,or covenant of th e lease and d id not cure the failure within thirty days after written notice.section a gave vef the option to terminate the lease upon the occurrence of any default.
term of the lease.
article of the lease set december,as the lease expiration date.it also granted eldercare an option to extend the lease for an additional term.in order to exercise that option,eldercare was obliged to provide vef written notice of its intention to do so not later than days prior to the expiration of the lease term,on or before december.
vef appeal.
eldercare failure to maintain the minimum insurance coverage and vef purported termination of the lease.
in,medical malpractice rates for texas nursing homes started to climb dramatically.the business landscape was further complicated by a series of major changes to texas program that began in.that year,eldercare made several presentations to the vef board to explain these program changes and their purportedly adverse implications for eldercare business.the parties subsequently had several discussions on this issue.in august,eldercare sought to initiate a renegotiation of the rent terms pursuant to and of the lease,first at a meeting and then in writing.vef responded with a demand that eldercare agree to a host of substantive changes to the lease beyond the scope of rent terms before vef would commence renegotiations.vef preconditional amendments were memorialized in a vef board resolution and a letter to eldercare.eldercare refused to agree to the amendments,and a stalemate ensued.
facing mounting rates,at the end of eldercare reduced its insurance coverage below the lease minimums.vef did not object to eldercare coverage levels for policy years,or.in,eldercare was unable to obtain malpractice insurance.to shield itself from liability,it subleased valley grand manor to a corporation.the arrangement mirrored one vef had used before leasing the facility to eldercare.with this sublease in place,eldercare terminated its general liability coverage,believing it no longer faced general liability.eldercare never sought vef consent and vef never objected to the sublease arrangement.from to,while the sublease was in effect,more than of nursing homes in texas carried no malpractice coverage.
in the summer of,eldercare made a series of presentations to vef board and the parties held several other meetings.eldercare endeavored to explain its difficulty securing insurance coverage and sought to renegotiate the lease minimums.vef refused to negotiate to this end and notified eldercare of its position that eldercare was in default.nevertheless,the parties continued to discuss the issue vef made no effort to terminate the lease and it extended the time for eldercare to comply.at these meetings,eldercare also raised again the challenges it faced in light of the changes being made to the texas program.eldercare sought renegotiation of the rent and retroactive adjustments for overpayment without success.again vef insisted upon extensive amendments to the lease as a precondition to renegotiation and again the issue went nowhere.
on january,eldercare notified vef of its general liability coverage and it failed to furnish proof of malpractice coverage for.vef sent a purported notice of default on january,january letter.in pertinent part,the letter stated 
we received the information you sent to us on january.thank you for responding by the deadline,but we have several concerns about it.the amount of coverage for the general liability does not meet the requirements of the lease and there was not any coverage for medical malpractice insurance that is also required by the lease.these are defaults according to the lease.if you want to ask the board for a possible reconsideration of the lease insurance requirements,eldercare,will need to submit letters of denial of coverage and copies of quotes on insurance that make it cost prohibitive,on or before january.the valley educational board will consider information you supply and then will give you a response.eldercare,will need to respond to this letter by blank.
eldercare responded orally and by scheduling a meeting,which took place on january.at the meeting,hamel and errol eder,vef vice president,discussed an extension of the time in which eldercare could respond with more information and the possibility of a renegotiation of the insurance minimums.eldercare later sent to vef emails memorializing its understanding that it had been granted additional time to respond.vef did not dispute eldercare characterization of the meeting.subsequent communications supported eldercare understanding that it faced no immediate deadline by which to secure insurance coverage.
on march,eldercare provided an extensive report to vef lawyer,which it understood to satisfy the informational requirement of the january letter.vef board never received the report,and eldercare never received a response.
in may,vef board voted to terminate the lease.on june,vef sent eldercare a purported termination letter,which identified eldercare failure to secure malpractice insurance as the triggering breach.eldercare continued to search for insurance and obtained a new malpractice policy on june.
vef brought a forcible entry action in county court,and a jury returned a verdict in its favor.on october,while that judgment was on appeal,eldercare filed a chapter bankruptcy petition.
bankruptcy court proceedings.
once eldercare entered bankruptcy,vef filed a claim against the bankruptcy estate seeking damages resulting from eldercare purported breach of the lease minimum insurance coverage provisions.eldercare as debtor in possession countered with a motion to assume the lease in bankruptcy under and with objections to vef claim,demanding offsets and recoupment in light of vef alleged breach of its obligations to renegotiate the rent and coverage limits.vef opposed the motion to assume,arguing that the lease was validly terminated on june and thus not assumable.the bankruptcy court held a trial,during which more than witnesses testified and dozens of exhibits were introduced.
a the bankruptcy court granted eldercare motion to assume the lease.it held that vef failed effectively to terminate the lease for three reasons.
first,the court concluded that after sending the january letter,vef agreed to an indefinite extension of time for eldercare to respond,and it never revoked that agreement.the court found that at the january meeting,hamel and eder discussed eldercare request for more time and to deal with and document the changing insurance market and as well as changing the insurance requirements under the lease and that errol eder on behalf of vef agreed to indefinitely extend the deadline for eldercare to obtain malpractice insurance.the court further found that this grant of an indefinite extension was confirmed by the subsequent email exchanges between the parties and by eldercare ongoing efforts to provide the requested information,without objection or clarification from vef.vef did not respond to eldercare,the court found,but allowed eldercare to continue to believe that vef was working with them on the insurance issue which is what eldercare continued to believe.
second,the court held that vef january letter was not sufficient under texas common law to trigger vef right to terminate the lease with eldercare.the court based this conclusion on its finding that the january letter did not make a demand for performance upon eldercare and did not inform eldercare that the lease could be terminated unless eldercare took action to obtain insurance as called for by the lease.
lastly,the bankruptcy court concluded that vef conduct excused eldercare failure to perform its minimum insurance coverage obligations.the court held that vef breached its obligation under to negotiate and potentially mediate a reduction in the malpractice insurance limits for policy year.the court further held that this breach excused eldercare failure to secure malpractice coverage in policy years and.similarly,the court held that vef failure to object to eldercare coverage levels in policy years,and constituted a waiver of any breach by eldercare in those years.
the court also concluded that eldercare satisfied conditions for assumption.see b if there has been a default,the lease can not be assumed unless the debtor a cures,or provides adequate assurance that the trustee will promptly cure,such default b compensates,or provides adequate assurance that it will promptly compensate,for any actual pecuniary loss and c provides adequate assurance of future performance.
b the court dispensed with vef bankruptcy claim and eldercare objections and demand for by concluding that b oth eldercare and vef breached the lease,but failed to prove damages or at best were entitled only to nominal damages for their mutual breaches.
district court proceedings.
in a brief,oral ruling,the district court adopted the reasoning of the bankruptcy court and affirmed its judgment.
eldercare appeal.
the negotiation of the terms of the mediation and eldercare failure to provide timely notice of its intent to renew the lease.
the bankruptcy court october,opinion also held that eldercare had a right to mediate new insurance coverage minimums with vef.to that end,the court november judgment ordered that eldercare and vef were to promptly arrange and participate in this mediation.the judgment also referenced a plan of reorganization that contemplated eldercare continued operation of the valley grand manor nursing home pursuant to its lease with vef.six days after the bankruptcy court issued its opinion,on october,eldercare wrote to vef.the letter proposed new insurance coverage minimums and,in the event they were unacceptable to vef,requested mediation and proposed a mediator.
despite eldercare diligence,the process did not proceed smoothly.vef responded over a month later,on december.it asserted that the appointment of eldercare suggested mediator would not be appropriate,but did not propose an alternative candidate.in other respects,vef response fell short of willing cooperation.for example,vef insisted that there was a need to develop procedures which would allow discovery and other traditional litigation steps to be implemented as a predicate to the mediation.and vef required eldercare to provide extensive information before vef would even discuss the procedures and timetable for mediation.three days after it received this response,eldercare indicated that it would file an emergency motion to compel mediation and for sanctions if vef continued not to cooperate.
in the following days,extensive negotiations proceeded unsuccessfully.vef capitulated to a discussion of the substance of a mediation plan,dropping its demand for the development of procedures which would allow discovery and other traditional litigation steps and for the provision by eldercare of extensive information.however,vef proposed mediation terms were aggressive at best.for example,vef proposed to empower the mediator to revisit certain of the bankruptcy court critical factual findings and legal conclusions.and it sought to delay the implementation of mediated coverage minimums until the resolution of its appeal of the court assumption decision.eldercare ultimately filed an emergency motion to compel mediation,as promised.the bankruptcy court set that motion for hearing on december.on december,the day before that hearing was to occur,vef agreed to the process for mediation and eldercare withdrew its motion.under the terms of that agreement,the mediation was to take place on february.
that plan was short lived.just over two weeks after the agreement was reached,on january,vef informed eldercare that the lease had expired on january because eldercare had failed to provide written notice of its intent to renew by december,as required by the lease.vef then filed a motion to compel eldercare to vacate the premises.
bankruptcy court proceedings.
the bankruptcy court denied vef motion.it construed texas law to provide for equitable intervention to excuse a technical failure in the exercise of an option when the delay in fulfilling the condition precedent in a lease has been slight,the loss to the lessor small,and the failure to grant the relief to the lessee would resul t in such hardship as to make it unconscionable to enforce literally the condition precedent of the lease.renewal order,citing jones gibbs.the court concluded that all three factors were met,and it intervened to excuse eldercare technical omission under this equitable doctrine.
reviewing the evidence presented,the court found that a lthough it was not sent written notification,vef was notified on many occasions of eldercare intent to exercise its option to extend the lease,and it found nothing that indicated that vef considered the lease terminated or that it did not believe eldercare intended to exercise its option to renew the lease.in reaching this conclusion,the court noted that it had ordered the debtor and vef to enter into binding mediation for insurance rates and to renegotiate the lease rate.and it stressed that the n egotiations between eldercare and vef regarding the terms and conditions of mediation,discovery disputes,and related procedures continued past the renewal notice deadline.during these negotiations,vef insisted on terms,provisions,and procedures for mediation and rent renegotiation without ever mentioning that vef considered the lease terminated vef communications,agreements,court pleadings,and representations to the court failed to indicat e that vef considered the lease terminated or that it did not believe eldercare intended to exercise its option to renew the lease.in particular,vef entered into an agreement to mediate the insurance issue days after the deadline for renewal notice had passed,scheduling the mediation to take place approximately six weeks after the renewal term was to commence.
the court held that the delay in providing renewal notice was slight because eldercare gave written notice immediately one day after discovering the oversight and the delay was only days after the deadline that is,eldercare gave written notice days after the december renewal deadline and a mere three days after the lease december expiration.it also found that vef failed to demonstrate that it would be harmed by allowing equity to intervene.vef loss was small,considering it was actively negotiating terms of the lease,pursuing its appeal of the court prior order allowing assumption of the lease,and behaving in every aspect as if it knew that eldercare intended to exercise the extension.
lastly,the court held that f ailure to extend the lease would creat e such a hardship to eldercare that it would be unconscionable to enforce the term literally.eldercare invested over in fees and costs alone in proving that vef did not terminate the lease.this effort was for the sole purpose of assuming the lease and reorganizing the business which necessarily depended on the option being exercised and the lease extended because the lease was the only basis for eldercare continu ation as a viable business.in short,the court explained that t he entire chapter case involved and required preservation of the lease option period.
weighing the equities,the court reasoned that a t best vef asserted its termination argument only after it realized there was no written notice sent to it.and a t worst,vef laid behind the log in this case,continuing to negotiate with eldercare regarding lease terms and appearing in court,all the while not pointing out that the lease was terminated under its theory.under these circumstances,the court concluded that equitable intervention was warranted.
remarking that what sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander,the bankruptcy court also found that the notice provision of the lease was incapable of performance because it require d notice to be sent to an address not provided.finally,as a third basis for denying vef motion,the court held that it could order the cure of eldercare failure to provide renewal notice pursuant to its authority to enforce its automatic bankruptcy stay.
district court proceedings.
on appeal,the district court reversed the judgment of the bankruptcy court.its opinion was rendered in a brief,telephonic hearing.as a result,the court reasoning is less than clear.the court did not think that it as a court could rewrite the lease under equitable principles.and it held that the equitable principles here d id not,as a matter of law,allow the court to excuse the of a very important part of th e lease agreement,which was the renewal notice.the court assume d these were conclusions of law it did not call into question any of the bankruptcy court factual findings.

vef appeal.
vef challenges the bankruptcy court grant of eldercare motion to assume the lease,arguing that the lease was effectively terminated and thus not assumable.vef also argues that the bankruptcy court exceeded its authority by foreclosing vef right to assert in the future claims it was not obliged to join in the underlying bankruptcy litigation.we reject both arguments.
eldercare assumption of the lease.
under a,a debtor in bankruptcy,subject to the court approval,may assume any executory contract or unexpired lease.however,the debtor may not assume a lease if it is of nonresidential real property and has been terminated under applicable nonbankruptcy law prior to bankruptcy.c emphasis added.as vef brief recognizes,t he cardinal issue in this matter has always been whether the lease was terminated prior to eldercare petition for bankruptcy.the bankruptcy court concluded that vef failed effectively to terminate the lease for three reasons first,it concluded that after the january letter,vef agreed to an indefinite extension of time for eldercare to respond,and vef never revoked that agreement.second,the bankruptcy court held that the january letter was insufficient under texas common law to provide notice of termination.third,the court held that eldercare failure to perform its insurance coverage obligations was excused by vef breach of its promise to renegotiate the coverage minimums in good faith.we affirm on the first basis,and we thus do not reach the other two.
as the bankruptcy court stressed,the january letter set forth the information eldercare would need to provide in order to ask vef for a possible reconsideration of the lease insurance requirements.the letter further provided that vef w ould consider the information suppl ied and then w ould give eldercare a response.in response to this letter,hamel promptly scheduled a meeting with eder,which took place on january.having heard testimony from both hamel and eder,the bankruptcy court found that at their meeting they discussed eldercare request for more time to deal with and document the changing insurance market and as well as changing the insurance requirements under the lease.and eder on behalf of vef agreed to indefinitely extend the deadline for eldercare to obtain malpractice insurance.
in support of this finding,the bankruptcy court discussed hamel shortly after the meeting and vef response.on january,hamel sent eder an email that stated 
it was a pleasure having lunch with you last wednesday.
as we discussed there has been a sea of changes in the liability insurance markets over the last few years.as i promised at our meeting,i have asked our insurance carrier to provide an outline of these changes and how it has effected valley grande manor.also,i am seeking a way by which valley grande manor can procure professional liability in accordance to the spirit of the lease between vef and vgm.
you indicated a willingness to allow some additional time to accomplish this beyond the date noted in the letter from john page which was dated january.i would anticipate being back in touch with you regarding this matter no later than mid next week and would probably like to schedule a brief meeting with you at that time.
thank you for the meeting and i appreciate the spirit of cooperation that was exhibited in our discussions.
eder responded to the email,thanx for the update.neither he,nor anyone from vef,responded with any objection,clarification,or denial,as to the contents of the email or provide d any notice that the lease would terminate in approximately days.assumption order.on february,eldercare again wrote eder at vef that our insurance broker is working diligently on our professional liability coverage.eder again responded thanx for the update,and he promised to forward the correspondence to john page,the author of the january letter.
the bankruptcy court also stressed that hamel began to provide the information requested.in march he provided eder with the reports on progress in obtaining information by furnishing copies of two letters that he received from his insurance agents reflecting the work his agents were doing in attempting to find professional liability coverage.id.the letters hamel provided documented over a dozen insurance companies that were being contacted to provide the malpractice insurance and contained the information that eldercare understood was to be furnished to vef during this search period.id.in june hamel continued to furnish information about medicaid reimbursement problems.the bankruptcy court found that no response was ever given by vef to the information and communications of eldercare to vef concerning insurance and no notice was given that the agreed extension of time to communicate and negotiate had expired.id.
in sum,the bankruptcy court found with its january letter,vef explicitly invited eldercare to pursue renegotiation and to provide information to that end.vef also agreed to respond to the information provided.in response,eldercare promptly arranged a meeting,during which vef agreed indefinitely to extend the time for eldercare to provide the requisite information.eldercare actively and diligently,id,worked to secure the necessary information,and it provided information as it was obtained.eldercare communications reflected the parties agreement indefinitely to extend any deadlines,and vef never made any objections or suggestions to the contrary.vef also failed to provide the promised response to the information submitted by eldercare.
these factual findings amply support the bankruptcy court conclusion that vef indefinitely extended the time for eldercare to respond to vef january letter and that vef did not revoke that extension before purporting to terminate the lease five months after it sent the january letter.that conclusion,in turn,is fatal to vef contention that it effectively terminated the lease before eldercare entered bankruptcy,smith hues,dist,writ ref e ven where time is of the essence,a stipulated time limit may be extended by agreement.
we are not persuaded by vef contention that the bankruptcy court factual findings were clearly erroneous.vef makes two arguments to this effect.first,it argues that there was no evidence at the trial that vef ever agreed to indefinitely extend the deadline for eldercare to obtain malpractice insurance.this argument is at best without merit.it ignores the entirety of the bankruptcy court analysis.as described above,the bankruptcy court explicitly referenced testimony and exhibits that directly supported its factual findings.
second,vef argues that eldercare admit ted that no indefinite extension was granted.vef premises this purported concession on short excerpts of hamel trial testimony and his january email.vef cites the following exchange during hamel testimony 
q d id you discuss whether or not the deadline in the january letter was important to eder to enforce,or anything to that effect 
a i do believe it was discussed in those terms,but i 
q how was it discussed 
a i indicated that i would like to sit down,where we had the decision makers present,get whatever documents we need,that they need,the financial information.he asked me,will you bring your financial information i said,yes.i said,let schedule a meeting and get this taken care of.and as we left the meeting,i remember shaking his hand,and said,errol,you know my number.give me a call.let get a meeting set up.
q now,with respect to the time within which to do this,what was the agreement that was reached 
a there was no specific time.
q all right.was it some sort of 
a i did not believe it was.it was my hope and impression that this would happen sooner rather than later.emphasis in brief.
as to the january email,vef harps on hamel statement that he would anticipate being back in touch regarding th e matter no later than mid next week and would probably like to schedule a brief meeting at that time.
vef reliance on these excerpts is misplaced.we think the trial testimony undermines its position.it reflects that hamel and eder did not discuss whether or not the deadline in the january letter was important to eder to enforce,or anything to that effect.to the contrary,the parties discussed that hamel would g et whatever documents they need ed and then they would schedule a meeting and get the issue taken care of.despite this testimony,vef understands hamel statements that he did not believe the extension of time was and that it was his hope and impression that this would happen sooner rather than later,as a concession that there was no agreement to extend discussions.this understanding strains credulity.it is clear that hamel meant only to acknowledge that vef willingness to continue discussions would expire at some point and his related hope that the matter would be resolved expeditiously,in the spirit of cooperation.he recognized that the extension was not,but did not suggest that a deadline was ever established.this is consistent with the bankruptcy court finding that the parties agreed indefinitely to extend eldercare deadline,especially when the testimony is considered in light of the substantial evidence described above.certainly,we can not conclude that the bankruptcy court clearly erred by declining to adopt vef understanding of hamel testimony.
the excerpt from hamel january email is similarly unavailing.hamel wrote that he anticipate d being back in touch regarding this matter no later than a week after sending the email.vef insists that this anticipation amounted to a concession that there was no indefinite extension of time.we fail to see how hamel estimation of the time required to compile certain information could reflect a belief that he would not be accorded that time.and we find significantly more illuminating the facts that hamel corrected his optimistic anticipation by writing to eder within a week to inform eder that hamel team was working diligently to respond that eder did not object to hamel tardiness and that hamel ultimately provided the information approximately one month late.if anything,the parties behavior,despite hamel anticipation,bolsters the bankruptcy court conclusion that the parties agreed to an indefinite extension of time,especially when considered in light of the substantial evidence described above.we can not conclude that the bankruptcy court clearly erred by declining to adopt vef understanding of hamel email.
we find no error in the bankruptcy court conclusion that vef granted eldercare an indefinite extension of time in which to respond to vef january letter and that vef never revoked that extension.on this basis,we affirm the decision of the district court sustaining the bankruptcy court judgment of november,allowing eldercare to assume the lease.
the scope of the bankruptcy court judgment.
vef also challenges the scope of the bankruptcy court judgment,arguing that it erroneously prohibited vef from bringing against eldercare any permissive counterclaims or any unrelated claims it might have but which were not then before the court.we find it difficult to conceive a claim vef might assert in the future that would not qualify as a mandatory counterclaim aris ing out of the transaction or occurrence that was the subject matter before the bankruptcy court.a a see,incas monterey printing packaging,sang jin,cir under the broad test for rule a adopted by this circuit,a counterclaim is compulsory when there is any logical relationship between the claim and the counterclaim.citation omitted.certainly,vef fails to describe such a claim.we thus consider vef argument largely theoretical.
nonetheless,we reject it.vef construction of the judgment is flawed.the judgment provides all relief requested in the motion or relief that could or should have been requested,and not herein granted,is denied.we understand the phrase relief that could or should have been requested to refer to the relief related to the claims the parties actually asserted,as evidenced by the court reference to relief requested in the motion.that is,the bankruptcy court did not deny relief stemming from claims that could have been asserted.rather,it denied the relief that could have been requested in the dispute presented.properly construed,the judgment reflects no error.
eldercare appeal.
as described supra,the bankruptcy court concluded that eldercare failure strictly to comply with the renewal provisions of the lease should be excused under texas common law principles of equitable intervention.the district court reversed that judgment,concluding that equitable intervention is not available under texas law.eldercare challenges this conclusion.we hold that the district court legal determination was erroneous,and we agree with the bankruptcy court that equitable intervention is appropriate in this exceptional case.
equitable intervention under texas law.
texas law generally gives effect to a party exercise of an option only if the exercise is unqualified,unambiguous,and strictly in accordance with the terms of agreement.atterbury brison,writ denied see casa el,fontenot,dist,writ dism t o extend the power to exercise an option for a day is to compel the giving of something for nothing.citation omitted see also jones gibbs.there is no question that eldercare failed to meet this exacting standard.because eldercare did not provide timely notice of its intent to extend the lease,as required by the contract,it did not exercise its option strictly in accordance with the terms of agreement.
however,in jones,the texas supreme court explained that the rule of strict compliance in the exercise of an option is not an absolutely inflexible one and it described the narrow circumstances in which the failure of the optionee to comply strictly with the terms or conditions of the option will be excused.jones,at.jones concerned the grant of a deed to gibbs brothers company to cut and remove pine timber on a parcel of land owned by helen jones.the deed was for ten years,with a extension period at gibbs brothers company option,exercisable by the company payment of an additional fee.after the deed was executed,jones obtained a loan from wynne that was secured by the property.under the terms of that loan,when jones fell behind on her tax liability for the property,wynne paid the taxes and accordingly adjusted the amount owed by jones.jones then died,and the property entered her probate estate.later,in an effort to exercise its option to extend its timber deed,gibbs brothers company paid the required renewal fee directly to wynne.jones estate subsequently sought to have the timber deed declared inoperative,arguing that gibbs brothers company failed strictly to comply with the deed requirement that payment of the renewal fee be made directly to jones or her heirs.
rejecting that argument,the jones court adopted the test set forth by the connecticut supreme court in fountain stein.like this case,fountain concerned a requirement of a lease that the lessee give notice thirty days before the expiration of the term of its desire to extend the lease.jones,at.the fountain court recognized that the notice requirement was a condition precedent which had to be performed before the extended or renewed term could begin and held that the lessee,not having given the notice within the stipulated time,had no right to relief unless it could establish such facts as would bring it within the power of equity to relieve.id.as the jones court wrote 
in prescribing the conditions for the granting of relief upon equitable grounds,the fountain court said in substance that,while relief can not be afforded if the failure to give notice has been due to willful or gross neglect,equity will relieve,in the absence of such neglect,when the failure results from fraud,surprise,accident or mistake.it said further in cases of mere neglect in fulfilling a condition precedent of a lease,which do not fall within accident or mistake,equity will relieve when the delay has been slight,the loss to the lessor small,and when not to grant relief would result in such hardship to the tenant as to make it unconscionable to enforce literally the condition precedent of the lease.id.quoting fountain,at emphasis added.
see also id.discussing with approval xanthakey hayes,another case of equitable intervention to excuse the failure to provide notice of a lease extension,where t he gist of the decision was that it would be unconscionable to enforce literally the condition for the extension when to do so would cause the lessee,who had not been grossly negligent,to lose the value of improvements and the good will of its established business.applying the rule of fountain and similar precedents from other states,the jones court concluded that overruling equitable rules excused gibbs brothers company failure to adhere to the deed strict requirements for extension.id.at.
vef presents a very different view of texas common law.it advances two arguments,both of which we reject.first,vef suggests that texas law does not recognize any equitable exception to the requirement of strict compliance with the terms of an option contract.but our discussion of jones makes clear that the contention is without merit in certain circumstances,the failure of the optionee to comply strictly with the terms or conditions of the option will be excused.id.at.
vef second argument is more nuanced and worthy of greater attention.whatever the contours of equitable intervention under texas law,vef asserts,the state has not recognized an exception to the rule of strict compliance in cases of mere neglect.id.quotation omitted.the discussion in jones of the test for the intervention of equity in cases of mere neglect,vef asserts,was dicta,and it has not been subsequently adopted.vef relies on hexter lobello,writ dism for this contention.the majority read jones to conclude that gibbs brothers company payment to wynne was authorized by jones estate and
