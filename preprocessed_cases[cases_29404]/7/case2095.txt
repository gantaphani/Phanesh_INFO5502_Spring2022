after a master tenant rejects a nonresidential real estate lease in bankruptcy,does a subtenant who is an intended beneficiary of the lease have a right to remain in possession of the property the trial court in this case decided the answer is no.accordingly,the court granted a nonsuit and dismissed all claims by syufy enterprises,syufy against the city of oakland arising from syufy eviction from a property near the oakland airport,where syufy had operated a movie theater.the court found syufy lost its right to possession of the property,which syufy occupied under a sublease,after the primary lease was deemed rejected by the sublessor tenant in the sublessor bankruptcy proceedings.in a companion unlawful detainer action,an appellate division of the superior court had previously decided the legal issue concerning the effect of a deemed rejection in syufy favor therefore,syufy contends the trial court erred in failing to give this decision preclusive effect.syufy also claims the court decision was substantively wrong because syufy was entitled to possession as a beneficiary of the primary lease.we conclude the litigation was not procedurally barred and the trial court correctly resolved the substantive legal issue.therefore,we affirm.
background 
in,the port of oakland port leased a parcel of land to transwestern hotels for the construction of a hotel.they signed a lease which the parties call the master lease with a term,commencing in and ending in.the port later agreed to several assignments of the lease.
in,the port and the current lessee,security savings and loan association,executed an amendment to the master lease titled the fifth supplemental agreement.in this document,the port agreed to lease the tenant an adjoining parcel of land for the immediate construction of a motion picture theater.two provisions are of particular significance to this appeal.in paragraph three of the fifth supplemental agreement,the parties agreed that the master lease would be amended to include,among other things,the statement it is understood and agreed by the parties hereto that lessee intends to cause said improvements to be constructed by its sublessee,syufy enterprises,inc the parties amended another section of the master lease to state notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph concerning requirements for subleases and assignments,it is understood and agreed that lessee may sublease parcel two to syufy enterprises,inc the fifth supplemental agreement again specified a term ending in june.in august,the port passed a resolution expressly consenting to syufy tenancy on the property.
syufy subleased the theater parcel from security savings and loan association in june,for a term of years with an option to extend the sublease until june.in the sublease agreement,syufy agreed to assume,perform and be bound by all covenants in the master lease except those concerning operation of the hotel.syufy then built and operated a theater on the site and timely exercised its option to extend the sublease through.by the early,syufy had divided its single theater into four auditoriums,and in syufy added more auditoriums and substantially remodeled the facility.the port consulted with syufy and approved all of these expansions.
during syufy tenancy,the master lease was assigned to several different hotel lessees,with the port expressly consenting to the assignment each time.in november,the current lessee assigned its rights under the master lease to the oakland airport hotel corporation oahc.disputes soon arose between the port and oahc about how the hotel was operated.beginning in,the port served oahc several notices of default under the master lease,referencing oahc alleged failure to operate a first class hotel on the site.syufy received copies of two such notices and contacted the port,but a representative of the port assured syufy no action was necessary and the port did not intend to disturb syufy tenancy.the port never directed a notice of default against syufy or alleged any default by syufy.
in january,the port filed an unlawful detainer action against oahc.the complaint did not name syufy,nor was it served on syufy.oahc failed to answer the complaint and,after the port obtained a default judgment against it,oahc filed a petition under chapter of the bankruptcy code.the oahc trustee filed a motion to assume the master lease,but the bankruptcy court denied this motion oahc motion for reconsideration was denied,and its appeal from the ruling was dismissed.on july,the bankruptcy court ordered oahc to vacate the premises it had leased from the port.the order did not mention syufy,and syufy received no notice of the order.
syufy remained unaware of the oahc bankruptcy proceedings until august,when the port sent syufy a letter explaining that a united states bankruptcy court had ordered oahc to vacate the hotel property.the port stated as a result of the court orders,the lease between the port and the hotel has been terminated.in addition,as syufy is a subtenant under the hotel lease,the court orders effectively terminates sic syufy enterprises sublease with the hotel.however,the port went on to assure syufy that on august,the board of port commissioners had approved a resolution to allow syufy to continue its occupancy of the premises on a basis upon the same terms and conditions of the sublease between syufy enterprises and the hotel,after syufy provided proof of insurance and a plan for making security patrols of the property.the port letter concluded by requesting that syufy sign the letter to indicate its desire to enter a agreement with the port on the stated terms.when it received this letter,syufy contacted the port and was told the port did not intend to disturb syufy tenancy.the port explained it wanted to formalize a new lease with syufy to avoid any possible claim by the oahc bankruptcy trustee that syufy rent payments to the port were assets of the bankruptcy estate.the port director of commercial real estate told syufy the port wished to enter a direct lease with syufy through june or longer.after these discussions,syufy president signed the port letter.
syufy continued to operate the theater,although the port did not prepare a new lease for syufy and the parties signed no new agreements.the port operated the hotel itself,through a management company,until.in late or early,the port decided to market the site for a new commercial development and so demolished the hotel.in may,syufy notified the port of its desire to extend the lease through june.but on october,the port sent syufy a notice of termination of tenancy,ordering syufy to vacate the theater premises within days.the port had made no effort to evict syufy before this october notice.
in response to the notice of termination,on december,syufy sued the port in the alameda county superior court for declaratory relief and damages.the following month,the port filed an unlawful detainer action against syufy in the alameda county municipal court.the parties stipulated to consolidate the two actions for discovery and case management purposes.they further agreed to stay all discovery regarding damages pending resolution of the unlawful detainer case.the port then filed a motion in the unlawful detainer action for summary adjudication of syufy thirteenth affirmative defense,which alleged that oahc deemed rejection of the master lease in the bankruptcy proceedings did not terminate syufy rights under the sublease or the master lease as a matter of law.the parties understood resolution of this issue could effectively determine the outcome of the unlawful detainer case because the port stipulated that syufy had committed no breach of its sublease agreement,and the port eviction of syufy was based solely on its position that the deemed rejection of oahc master lease in bankruptcy terminated syufy rights under the sublease,resulting in a tenancy.the municipal court agreed with the port position and granted the motion.the parties filed competing motions for summary judgment and,based on its earlier ruling,the court granted the port motion,concluding the port was entitled to regain possession of the premises from syufy.
syufy filed a notice of appeal from the unlawful detainer judgment in the appellate division of the alameda county superior court appellate division,and the parties agreed to stay proceedings in syufy superior court action against the port pending resolution of the appeal.syufy also sought a stay of execution of the unlawful detainer judgment,but this request was denied and syufy surrendered possession of the theater on april.syufy did not petition the appellate division for writ review of the denial of its motion for a stay,nor did syufy amend its previously filed appeal to address this issue.in august or september of,while syufy appeal was pending,the port demolished the theater building.months later,on december,a panel of the appellate division reversed the entry of summary judgment the appellate division found syufy raised a triable issue of material fact as to whether contractual privity created a mutuality of obligations between the port and syufy and concluded this factual issue was not extinguished by oahc deemed rejection of the master lease in the bankruptcy court.upon remand,the port voluntarily dismissed the case.
the parties then began litigating syufy superior court action.syufy third amended complaint alleged causes of action for restitution and accounting,inverse condemnation,and breach of contract,based on syufy claim that it was a third party beneficiary of the master lease as amended by the fifth supplemental agreement.pursuant to code of civil procedure sections and,the port filed a pretrial motion seeking adjudication of the threshold legal issue of whether syufy right to possession of the theater parcel terminated as a matter of law upon the deemed rejection in bankruptcy of oahc master lease.the trial court decided this issue in the port favor and,following syufy submission of a written opening statement,granted the port motion for nonsuit and dismissed the complaint.
discussion 
a defendant is entitled to a nonsuit if the trial court determines that,as a matter of law,the evidence presented by plaintiff is insufficient to permit a jury to find in his favor.citation.in determining whether plaintiff evidence is sufficient,the court may not weigh the evidence or consider the credibility of witnesses.instead,the evidence most favorable to plaintiff must be accepted as true and conflicting evidence must be disregarded citation.nally grace community church cal d.an appellate court reviewing a judgment of nonsuit is guided by this same rule.we will not sustain the judgment unless interpreting the evidence most favorably to plaintiff case and most strongly against the defendant and resolving all presumptions,inferences and doubts in favor of the plaintiff a judgment for the defendant is required as a matter of law.citation.ibid.
where a nonsuit is granted after opening argument,the reviewing court accepts as true the facts asserted in the opening statement and indulges every legitimate inference those facts support.citation.lombardo huysentruyt th,d.
litigation of deemed rejection issue was not procedurally barred 
syufy initially argues we should not reach the substantive merits of the port nonsuit motion because the legal issue of the effect of oahc deemed rejection of the master lease was previously decided by the appellate division in the unlawful detainer case.thus,syufy maintains,the trial court erred in allowing the port to relitigate this issue and in failing to defer to the appellate division earlier decision.in its opening brief on appeal,syufy did not rely on any particular doctrine of preclusion,but urged us to reverse based on the concept of judicial finality.lombardo huysentruyt,supra,th at,d conc.opn.of haerle.syufy reply brief discusses the issue as one of res judicata or collateral estoppel.
collateral estoppel is one aspect of the broader doctrine of res judicata.lockwood superior court d.where res judicata operates to prevent relitigation of a cause of action once adjudicated,collateral estoppel operates in the second of two actions which do not involve identical causes of action to obviate the need to relitigate issues already adjudicated in the first action.citation.the purposes of the doctrine are said to be to promote judicial economy by minimizing repetitive litigation,to prevent inconsistent judgments which undermine the integrity of the judicial system,and to protect against vexatious litigation.citation.ibid.because syufy does not assert the same cause of action adjudicated in the unlawful detainer suit,we are concerned here with collateral estoppel,also referred to as issue preclusion.
the requirements for invoking collateral estoppel are the following the issue necessarily decided in the previous proceeding is identical to the one that is sought to be relitigated the previous proceeding terminated with a final judgment on the merits and the party against whom collateral estoppel is asserted was a party to or in privity with a party in the previous proceeding.citation.coscia mckenna cuneo cal th,fn,d.the first and third requirements,identity of parties and issues,are satisfied beyond any serious dispute.in deciding whether summary judgment for the port was proper in the unlawful detainer case,the appellate division considered the same legal question presented to the trial judge in the present,whether the deemed rejection of the master lease that resulted from oahc bankruptcy extinguished syufy right to possession of the theater parcel the sticking point,for syufy,is whether the previous proceeding terminated with a final judgment on the merits ibid.
after the appellate division remanded the unlawful detainer case,the port voluntarily dismissed the entire action without prejudice.by definition,a voluntary dismissal without prejudice is not a final judgment on the merits.associated convalescent enterprises carl marks d.torrey pines bank superior court d.therefore,we may not accord the appellate division ruling collateral estoppel effect.perhaps attempting to avoid this result,or to bind the port to the ruling by the doctrine of retraxit see torrey pines bank superior court,supra,at,syufy filed a motion to convert the port dismissal into a dismissal with prejudice.the trial court denied syufy motion,and the appellate division denied syufy petition for review.although syufy makes the argument again in this appeal,we agree it has no merit.the port had a right to dismiss its case without prejudice at any time before the actual commencement of trial code civ,subd.b see also code civ,subd.c.the voluntary dismissal statute defines commencement of trial as the beginning of opening statement or,absent an opening statement,the administration of an oath or affirmation to the first witness,or the first introduction of evidence.code civ,subd.a.clearly,given this statutory definition,trial had not yet commenced.though the consequences proved unfortunate for syufy,the port had a right to dismiss its unlawful detainer action without prejudice.
nor,as syufy apparently recognizes,was litigation of the issue precluded under the law of the case doctrine.under this doctrine,the decision of an appellate court,stating a rule of law necessary to the decision of the case,conclusively establishes that rule and makes it determinative of the rights of the same parties in any subsequent retrial or appeal in the same case.citation.nally grace community church,supra,cal d at.syufy breach of contract action is obviously not the same case as the unlawful detainer action prosecuted by the port.thus,the appellate division unpublished opinion in the port case did not establish the law of the case for the matter now under review.nelson justice court d.
finally,syufy urges us to reverse the judgment of nonsuit based on the nebulous concept of judicial finality.we decline to do so.although syufy quotes justice haerle impassioned discussion of this concept in his concurring opinion in lombardo huysentruyt,supra,th at,d conc.opn.of haerle,syufy refers us to no appellate decision that actually finds a claim or issue precluded on such grounds when the requirements of res judicata or the law of the case doctrine are not met.moreover,while justice haerle criticized the trial court in lombardo for judging provisions of an earlier probate court order unreasonable,justice haerle did not say this insult to the spirit,if not the letter,of the concept of judicial finality ibid.provided an independent basis for reversing the trial court judgment.
ii.rejection of the master lease terminates subtenant right of possession 
turning now to the substantive issue upon which the trial court granted the port motion for nonsuit,we must decide whether subtenant syufy had a right to remain on the premises despite oahc deemed rejection of the master lease in bankruptcy proceedings.resolution of this issue depends upon principles of federal bankruptcy law as well as california law.
federal law regarding debtor rejection of a lease 
section of the united states bankruptcy code enables the bankruptcy trustee in chapter proceedings to assume or reject any executory contract or unexpired lease held by the debtor.however,if the trustee does not assume or reject an unexpired lease of nonresidential real property under which the debtor is lessee within days after the date of the order for relief,then such lease is deemed rejected,and the trustee shall immediately surrender such nonresidential real property to the lessor.d.the parties do not dispute that the oahc trustee failure to assume the master lease resulted in its deemed rejection.unquestionably,this event terminated oahc right to possession of the property.in re elm inn,cir,by operation of law,the debtor possessory interest in the lease terminated on the date of rejection,and the lessor right to immediate surrender of the property simultaneously accrued.at issue is the effect of a deemed rejection on third parties with rights derived from or dependent upon a rejected lease.
federal courts have reached different conclusions on this subject.observing that section d requires a debtor to surrender leased premises to the lessor immediately upon a deemed rejection,some bankruptcy courts have concluded rejection results in a complete termination of the lease,in re realty associates.by extension,these courts have reasoned that rejection of a master lease effectively terminates an attached sublease as well,thus extinguishing the subtenant right to possession of the premises.see,in re child world,noting the rejection of the prime lease also results in the rejection of the sublease chatlos systems,kaplan,holding when a lease is deemed rejected pursuant to d,any subleases under the primary lease must also be deemed rejected since the sublessee rights in the property extinguish with those of the sublessor in re stalter company,concluding,after a sublessor deemed rejection of the master lease,there is no real property to which the subleasehold attaches as soon as the primary lease is terminated italics in original.under this view,that a deemed rejection terminates the master lease and all derivative interests in the property,sublessees would have no right to possession as a matter of federal bankruptcy law.
however,other federal courts treat a lease rejection as a breach of the lease which does not adjudicate rights of third parties.matter of austin development cir,in re modern textile,cir,leasing serv.first.bank nat.ass cir.george county of san luis obispo th,d.since,under this view,the master lease is not automatically terminated,third parties may retain right to assert subservient interests in the lease.see matter of austin development,supra,at holder of security interest in lease could assert its rights as a beneficiary of the lease despite its deemed rejection.the extent to which a third party rights in a lease remain intact after the debtor breach,however,is an issue of state law.id.at.
the parties have directed us to no cases from the ninth circuit considering the effect of a deemed rejection of a master lease on attached subleases.in re elm inn,supra,at page,and sea harvest riviera land cir,both reach the unremarkable conclusion that a deemed rejection terminates the right to possession,but neither of these cases addressed subleases or other interests.though arguably at odds with some termination language in these ninth circuit court of appeals cases,lower federal courts in california and alaska have begun to adopt the emerging rule see vallely investments bancamerica commercial th,d that a debtor deemed rejection of a lease constitutes a breach and not a complete termination.in re bergt,in re locke,in re picnic n chicken.once again,however,these cases do not consider the rights of sublessees to continued possession of property after a master lease has been deemed rejected.indeed,only locke squarely addresses the effect on third parties of a deemed rejection 
in locke,the lessee of a property assigned percent of its interest to one of the property tenants and the remaining percent to the lockes.in re locke,supra,at.a judgment creditor filed a lien against the lockes interest in the lease shortly before the lockes filed for bankruptcy.ibid.thus,the bankruptcy court had to decide whether a deemed rejection of a lease extinguishes a third party lien against the debtor interest.after an exhaustive review of federal case law and commentary on the subject,the court concluded the rejection was properly construed as a breach of the lease,not a termination,such that the judgment lien was not automatically extinguished.id.at.in reaching this holding,the court distinguished two cases decided by the bankruptcy appellate panel of the ninth circuit because the crux of the disputes concerned the right to possession of the subject termination or extinguishment of each and every covenant,remedy and right in or appurtenant to the subject lease.id.at see also id.at again distinguishing between the debtor right to possession and covenants,rights and remedies related to a lease.
the current trend in ninth circuit bankruptcy cases is apparently to treat a debtor rejection of a lease as a breach,rather than a termination.see vallely investments bancamerica commercial,supra,th at,d.under this emerging view id.at,d,the master lease was not terminated as a matter of law for all purposes as a result of oahc deemed rejection.thus,the continuing viability of syufy sublease is a question of california law.in re stalter company,supra,at in re.this result is consistent with another relevant bankruptcy provision,which provides that when a lease is rejected by a,the lessee may retain its rights under such lease to the extent that such rights are enforceable under applicable nonbankruptcy law.h a ii see also in re,supra,at noting the anomalous result produced by sections d and h that a must surrender the premises but its sublessee does not necessarily have to.
california law regarding subtenant right to possession 
under california law,a subtenant rights are dependent upon and subject to the sublessor rights r ights under the sublease stand or fall with those of the sublessor fifth broadway partnership kimny,d.superior motels,rinn motor hotels,d.the rights of a subtenant are terminated,and the master landlord is entitled to possession,when the master lease is terminated because of the tenant default in the performance of his or her obligations.miller starr,cal.real estate ed.only when a tenant voluntarily surrenders its estate to the landlord can a subtenant maintain possession.id.at northridge hospital foundation pic n save,d.thus,if the original tenant has incurred a forfeiture of his lease,and for that reason the landlord annuls the lease,the landlord is entitled to the possession as against the sublessee.herman campbell d.
in ilkhchooyi best th,d,division three of the fourth district court of appeal addressed the same question we now face regarding the rights of a subtenant following the sublessor deemed rejection of a lease.westar management westar leased a commercial space to two couples both named rosenblatt who opened a drycleaning business.id.at,d.the rosenblatts later subleased the premises to ilkhchooyi and his partner.the sublease,which was approved by lessor westar,stated it would terminate if the lease terminated for any reason.ibid.one of the rosenblatt couples later filed a bankruptcy petition ibid,and the lease with westar was deemed rejected pursuant to section d.id.at,d.relying on the traditional view of federal bankruptcy cases chatlos systems,kaplan,supra,and in re stalter company,supra,the court stated once the lease is rejected in bankruptcy,it is terminated as to all parties,including those with an interest derived from the bankrupt.citations.ilkhchooyi best,supra,at,d see also geary,superior court d.holding a security interest in a lease was extinguished when the lease was rejected in bankruptcy.thus,the court concluded the lease and ilkhchooyi sublease were terminated by operation of law due to the bankruptcy of the rosenblatts.ilkhchooyi best,supra,at,d.
syufy attempts to distinguish this holding,and the general principle that forfeiture of the master estate terminates the derivative interest of a sublessee see superior motels,rinn motor hotels,supra,d at,by arguing it was more than an ordinary sublessee.based on two mentions of syufy in the fifth supplemental agreement to the master lease and syufy promise,in the sublease,to assume the obligations of the master lease,syufy contends it was a beneficiary of the master lease.because,as a beneficiary,syufy enjoyed direct contractual privity with the port,syufy insists its rights were not merely derivative of the rights of its sublessor,oahc,but were directly connected to the port reversionary estate.thus,syufy concludes the severing of contractual privity between the port and oahc did not impair syufy beneficiary rights under the fifth supplemental agreement to the master lease.
syufy argument relies heavily on vallely investments bancamerica commercial,supra,th,d.this case arose from a complicated series of transactions.the lessor,vallely investments,vallely,leased a parcel of land to balboa landing,balboa.id.at,d.balboa mortgaged the property,with a loan secured by a deed of trust on the lease,and later defaulted.balboa then filed for bankruptcy protection.id.at,d.as an alternative to a traditional foreclosure,balboa agreed to assign its lease to bacc,a wholly owned subsidiary of the lender bank.in the assignment,bacc agreed to assume all covenants and obligations of the lease.ibid.the bank then obtained the lease at a foreclosure sale and eventually sold it to edgewater place,edgewater.ibid.after edgewater failed to pay rent and vallely sued,edgewater filed chapter bankruptcy and rejected the lease.id.at,d.vallely,having only recently learned of the assignment from balboa to bacc,sued bacc for the past due rent.ibid.among other arguments,bacc asserted edgewater rejection of the lease in bankruptcy terminated the lease as to all parties.id.at,d.the appellate court rejected this argument,and distinguished california cases holding certain lease interests terminated due to the tenant bankruptcy,because it concluded vallely contract rights did not depend upon the validity of the lease.id.at,d.because bacc specifically assumed the lease obligations in its assignment agreement,vallely contract rights against bacc were not derivative of or dependent upon the ground lease,and therefore rejection of the lease by a subsequent lessee in bankruptcy did not exonerate the surety bacc of its contractual obligations.id.at,d.
syufy likens itself to vallely,insisting they are both beneficiaries whose rights can not be extinguished by termination of a lease.yet this argument begs the question beneficiaries of what as lessor,vallely was an intended beneficiary of the assignment contract in which bacc agreed to assume all contractual obligations of a lease,even though it appears bacc never actually took possession of the property as lessee.vallely investments bancamerica commercial,supra,th at,d.the vallely court concluded bacc in a separate contract from the the lessor contract rights that did not depend upon the validity of the lease.id.at,d.thus,the court expressly distinguished ilkhchooyi best and geary,superior court because vallely is not claiming any rights under the lease that was rejected.id.at,d.in contrast,syufy asserted right to possession is based entirely on the master lease and its derivative sublease.there is no separate contract for syufy to enforce.although syufy stresses the importance of its mention,by name,in the fifth supplemental agreement,by its own terms this agreement was merely an amendment to the master lease.
vallely is distinguishable for another reason.the beneficiary vallely sought to enforce a contractual right to rent due under a lease.vallely investments bancamerica commercial,supra,th at,d.there was no dispute about a party right to possession of the leased premises.this distinction is important.a lease of real property is both a conveyance of an estate in land a leasehold and a contract.it gives rise to two sets of rights and arising by virtue of the transfer of an estate in land to the tenant privity of estate,and those existing by virtue of the parties express agreements in the lease privity of contract.citation.id.at,d.a subtenant generally has neither privity of estate nor privity of contract with the original lessor.see id.at,d.although a subtenant who expressly assumes obligations of the primary lease may come into privity of contract with the landlord see ibid.dictum marchese standard realty dev.d,the privity of estate remains between the landlord and the.miller starr,cal.real estate,supra,see also id.at,since no tenancy relationship exists between a master landlord and subtenant,there is no privity of estate between them.
because rejection of a lease in bankruptcy terminates a right to possession of the property d bankruptcy trustee must immediately surrender leased property to the lessor,this event also terminates the privity of estate between the landlord and tenant.in this case,when the master lease was deemed rejected,privity of estate between the port and oahc ended and the port had an unconditional right under section d to regain possession of the entire leased included syufy theater parcel as provided in the fifth supplemental agreement.it is difficult to reconcile the port clear right to surrender of the premises with syufy claim to continued possession as a beneficiary of a defunct lease.syufy has not cited,nor have we found,any published case holding a subtenant retains a right of possession in these circumstances.
in the trial court,syufy relied on chumash hill properties,peram th,d.chumash,however,does not help syufy.in chumash,the primary lease specified that in the event of a bankruptcy by the lessee,a subtenant use and possession of the property would not be disturbed so long as the subtenant complied with all sublease provisions.id.at,d.because the court found subtenant chumash was a beneficiary of this nondisturbance agreement,it concluded chumash right to possession under the sublease was not terminated by the bankruptcy.ibid.the master lease in this case included no such nondisturbance provision.nowhere in the master lease or the fifth supplemental agreement did the port promise to allow syufy,or any sublessee,to remain in possession of the leased premises even after defaults by the lessee resulted in termination of the primary lease.nor did syufy agree to accept the port as its new landlord in case of a default by the sublessor.a nondisturbance agreement ordinarily will require performance of obligations by both parties.the prime lessor will be required to recognize the sublease and to accept the sublessee as the tenant of the prime lessor,and the sublessee will be required to attorn to the prime lessor citation.id.at,d.
because this case primarily concerns syufy right to possession of the leased premises,george county of san luis obispo,supra,th,d is instructive.in george,lessees of a property filed for bankruptcy and their lease was deemed rejected under section d.id.at,d.the bankruptcy court issued an order requiring the debtors and anyone claiming possession under or through them who had notice of these proceedings to surrender the property immediately to the city of morro bay presumably the landlord.id.at,d.three individuals,who were not the debtors but were in possession of
