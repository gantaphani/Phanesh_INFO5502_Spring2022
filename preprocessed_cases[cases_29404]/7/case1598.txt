cheryl lee craig took out student loans beginning in to attend pima community college and the university of arizona.she obtained an aa in paralegal studies in,and a ba in sociology in.in,she consolidated her student loans through a consolidation loan with educational credit management corporation ecmc.it is this consolidated loan that is at issue in these proceedings.
craig obtained various deferments and forbearances on her student loans,both before and after consolidation.as a result,she has never made a payment on the loans.in october,she petitioned for chapter bankruptcy relief and initiated this adversary proceeding against ecmc,seeking to have her student loan debt discharged under a based on undue hardship.as of april,she owed on the consolidated student loan.
a one day trial was held on april.at the time of trial,craig was years old.she worked as a customer service representative for anderson financial network,afn she earned per hour,and typically worked approximately fifty to hours each two week pay period.afn also provided craig with certain benefits,including health insurance.
craig employment at afn was protected under the family medical leave act,which permits craig to miss up to hours of work per year as a result of doctor certified medical issues and still keep her employment status.this is significant because craig suffers from numerous serious medical problems,including asthma,diabetes,chronic bronchitis,heart problems she had a heart attack in,acid reflux,irritable bowel syndrome,and chronic back problems.these medical problems require the monthly intervention of,and monitoring by,several physicians,and a daily regime of prescription drugs.even with the benefit of health insurance,craig medical costs were approximately per month in.
craig income in was.the bankruptcy court found it unlikely that craig would be able to materially change her employment status in the future,and thus used the income figure in determining whether craig demonstrated that she would suffer undue hardship if required to repay her student loan.
craig claimed monthly expenses totaling,which included a monthly mortgage payment on craig mobile home and a monthly contribution to her employer k plan.these monthly expenses also included for an automobile payment and miscellaneous automobile expenses.the bankruptcy court noted that,at the time of trial,craig did not own a vehicle but that this was a temporary condition and that craig intended to acquire a vehicle and would thus incur automobile expenses.
after considering the evidence,the bankruptcy court found a more realistic total monthly expense budget for craig to be.the court reached this budget by adjusting craig claimed monthly expenses as follows a reduction for food a increase added by the court as a contingency fund for things such as home repairs,occasional clothing,gifts,and unforeseeable emergencies and a reduction in the payment on an automobile the bankruptcy court recognized,however,that when craig obtained a vehicle,her total budget would exceed her total monthly income by.
the bankruptcy court then found that,other than the monthly k plan contribution,the items included in craig adjusted monthly budget were reasonably necessary to maintain a minimal standard of living and that craig should be required to pay on her student loan debt the per month that she had been contributing to the k plan.the bankruptcy court further found that because craig mobile home mortgage payment of would end in december,beginning in january,craig should be required to pay on her student loan debt the per month that she had been paying on her mortgage.the bankruptcy court thus declared craig student loan debt discharged,except that her debt was not discharged as to per month from may,forward,plus an additional per month from january,forward.
craig requested clarification of the bankruptcy court ruling,pointing out that the bankruptcy court had not indicated what portion of the total student loan debt was discharged the number of payments craig would be required to make and whether interest was to continue to accrue and,if so,the portion of the student loan on which interest would accrue.in response,the bankruptcy court clarified that interest was to continue to accrue on the entire student loan debt.
the district court,although unable clearly to rationalize the bankruptcy court analysis,affirmed the bankruptcy court on the obligation of craig to pay per month from may,forward,and on the accrual of interest on the entire student loan debt,but reversed the bankruptcy court on craig obligation to pay per month from january,forward.craig timely appeals.we vacate and remand for reconsideration.
