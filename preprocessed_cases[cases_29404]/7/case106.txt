this appeal raises an important issue about the notice requirements of due process in a chapter bankruptcy proceeding.the appellant,arch wireless,arch,is a corporation that received a discharge pursuant to a chapter reorganization plan.it now seeks to enforce that discharge against the appellee,nationwide paging,nationwide.nationwide is pursuing claims against arch in state court,arguing that it did not receive proper notice of the bankruptcy proceedings and thus due process prevents the discharge injunction from barring its claims.in support of its motion to hold nationwide in contempt for pursuing its claims,arch contends that nationwide was not a known creditor at the time arch filed for bankruptcy and,accordingly,was entitled only to publication notice of arch bankruptcy proceedings.in the alternative,arch claims that nationwide actual knowledge that arch had filed for bankruptcy was sufficient to satisfy the requirements of due process.for the reasons set forth below,we reject both of arch arguments and affirm the district court denial of arch motion for contempt.
arch,a supplier of paging network airtime and pagers,and its former subsidiary pagenet sold airtime and a large number of pagers to nationwide.nationwide,in turn,used these pagers to supply paging services to its customers,including at t.in,at t claimed that a large number of pagers it received were defective or defectively programmed.nationwide turned to arch to correct the problem.at around the same time,nationwide began to allege billing errors on invoices from arch,including multiple bills for the defective pagers that had been replaced or were in need of replacement.
in a series of letters and emails from september through september,nationwide identified and tried to resolve the billing errors.as discussed in greater detail below,the correspondence also described the defective pagers as a problem that may need to be resolved separately from the billing dispute.
arch filed a chapter bankruptcy petition on december.arch did not list nationwide as a creditor on its bankruptcy schedules,and nationwide never received any notices from arch or the court regarding the proceedings.nationwide did not file an appearance in the bankruptcy proceedings.
the bankruptcy court issued an order on february,setting march,as the bar date,the date by which all creditors should file proofs of claims in arch bankruptcy case,and ordering arch to notify its creditors of the bar date.notification was to be accomplished in two ways known creditors were to be mailed notices and notices would be published in the usa today and the wall street journal.
arch reorganization plan was confirmed on may.the confirmation order included a discharge injunction precluding all persons from asserting claims against arch based on any act,omission,transaction or other activity that occurred prior to the confirmation date.
in june,arch began terminating nationwide airtime services for nonpayment.this led nationwide to file suit in massachusetts superior court,seeking a temporary restraining order preventing arch from terminating its service,a declaratory judgment ascertaining how much nationwide owed to arch for prior bills,and damages under massachusetts unfair business practices statute.laws ch.chapter,for harm caused by arch and defective pagers.
nearly two years later,arch realized that nationwide chapter claim amounted to a claim for million in damages.at that point,arch sent nationwide a copy of the confirmation order discharging arch debts and demanded that nationwide withdraw its claims based on any events prior to the confirmation date.nationwide refused.
arch filed a motion for contempt in the bankruptcy court.the superior court stayed the proceedings,pending resolution of the contempt motion.the bankruptcy court denied arch motion,holding that nationwide was a known creditor without sufficient notice and that,accordingly,due process concerns prevented the discharge injunction from operating to extinguish nationwide claims.the district court affirmed.this appeal followed.

known creditor 
the bankruptcy rules require a debtor to list all of its creditors and requires that creditors be notified of key events in the bankruptcy proceeding.fed.bankr a.the bankruptcy code broadly defines creditors to include all those who hold claims against the debtor.a.a claim is broadly defined to include a right to payment,whether or not such right is reduced to judgment,liquidated,unliquidated,fixed,contingent,matured,unmatured,disputed,undisputed,legal,equitable,secured,or unsecured.id.a.
for notice purposes,bankruptcy law distinguishes between known creditors,who are entitled to receive direct notice of each stage in the reorganization proceedings,and unknown creditors,for whom publication notice is sufficient.see city of new york new york.see also chemetron jones,cir.arch argues that nationwide was an unknown creditor,and thus publication of notice of the key dates in arch bankruptcy in the usa today and wall street journal was sufficient to permit the discharge injunction to extinguish nationwide claims without offending nationwide right to procedural due process.
an unknown creditor is one whose interests are either conjectural or future or,although they could be discovered upon investigation,do not in due course of business come to knowledge of the debtor.mullane cent.hanover bank trust.see also in re xo commc ns,describing an unknown creditor as one whose claims are merely conceivable,conjectural or speculative internal quotation marks omitted.a known creditor,by contrast,is one whose claims and identity are actually known or reasonably ascertainable by the debtor.tulsa prof l collection servs.pope,d.a creditor is reasonably ascertainable if its claim can be discovered through reasonably diligent efforts.mennonite bd.of missions adams,d.these efforts generally include a careful search of the debtor own records.in re crystal oil,cir.thus,in order for a claim to be reasonably ascertainable,the debtor must have in his possession some specific information that reasonably suggests both the claim for which the debtor may be liable and the entity to whom he would be liable.id.on the other hand,there is no requirement that the debtor have information suggesting the financial magnitude of the claim.see a defining claim to include both liquidated and unliquidated liabilities.
the bankruptcy court rejected arch contention that nationwide claim was unknown.the court found that nationwide was a known creditor because its claim against arch was reasonably ascertainable from the correspondence between the two companies.for example,in a september email,nationwide offered to arrive at a fixed dollar solution to the billing dispute,but warned that the fixed dollar amount does not take into consideration any issues of pagers not working.after describing the billing issues,the email went on 
finally,there is the need to address the problem of the lost business we suffered because of pagenet i do know what to say pagenet owes us for that,but i do know that pagenet cost itself a substantial piece of business,and set back nationwide growth an untold amount.frankly,it may not be possible to resolve this issue at the same time as we resolve all of the billing issues,but i wanted you to at least be aware of these concerns.
another email,sent by nationwide to pagenet in november,expresses similar concerns 
virtually all of the equipment that pagenet has sold to us has arrived at our office with superfluous programming that detracts from the pager performance it has now cost us a substantial customer.the at t project manager for paging has taken our company out of their automated ordering process.she told me that she was doing this as a result of the faulty equipment,and the paging just not working.these were pagenet pagers.we need to address this problem,and our loss caused by pagenet.
the bankruptcy court characterized this correspondence as clearly articulating nationwide belief that arch was liable to nationwide for affirmative compensation and offsets on its accounts.because these writings were contained within arch records at the time of the bankruptcy filing,the bankruptcy court reasoned that it would have required no herculean efforts,but merely a reasonable inquiry into those records to ascertain nationwide claim and hence its status as a creditor.accordingly,the court concluded that nationwide was a known creditor at the time the chapter petition was filed and was entitled to more than mere publication notice.
arch argues that any purported claims against it by nationwide were speculative and conjectural,at best.arch characterizes its correspondence with nationwide as documenting merely an billing dispute with a customer with more than in unpaid invoices.arch notes that its own books carried an account receivable owed to it by nationwide and that nationwide books did not carry a claim against arch as an asset.arch characterizes the bankruptcy court as having ignored these facts and asserts that the court mistook arch familiarity with nationwide for familiarity with a claim purportedly held by nationwide.
we disagree.the known creditor determination made by the bankruptcy court is subject only to clear error review the bankruptcy court relied,not on arch familiarity with nationwide,but rather on nationwide specific and repeated written assertion of claims for lost business,harm to reputation,and damages caused by the defective pagers,as well as the billing errors.the amount of money nationwide would claim was certainly unknown,but nationwide emails could reasonably be understood to assert an entitlement to affirmative compensation for the defective pagers.therefore,we see no error in the bankruptcy court determination that the correspondence asserted a claim under the bankruptcy code and made nationwide status as a creditor reasonably ascertainable by arch.accordingly,we affirm the determination that nationwide was a known creditor.
due process 
we next turn to arch argument that,even if nationwide was a known creditor,the discharge injunction should nonetheless bar nationwide claim because nationwide had actual knowledge of arch bankruptcy proceedings.the bankruptcy court,in considering this argument,assumed that nationwide president,peter brown,was generally aware of the bankruptcy filing in december.his awareness apparently came from media reports and brown familiarity with arch as one of his company two suppliers.however,the bankruptcy court found no evidence that nationwide had any actual knowledge of the bar date,the confirmation hearing,or the contents of the confirmation plan.
the bankruptcy rules specify that known creditors must receive notice of deadlines for filing proofs of claims bar date,fed.bankr a a copy of the reorganization plan,fed.bankr d notice of the confirmation hearing,fed.bankr d and the confirmation order,fed.bankr f.arch did not provide and nationwide did not receive any of these notices.
the discharge injunction provisions in the code are written unequivocally and encompass all claims,known or unknown,without reference to the notice provided to the claimants,see,d,and neither the bankruptcy code nor the rules specify any consequence for failure to comply with the notice rules.however,the discharge injunction could not abolish the property rights of creditors in their claims,regardless of notice,without running afoul of creditors due process rights.see chemetron,at characterizing inadequate notice as a defect which precludes discharge of a claim because of due process concerns.thus,because the code and rules themselves do not provide an exception to the discharge injunction when notice rules are violated,we must look to due process principles to evaluate the claim of a creditor that the discharge injunction does not bar the creditor claims.
the general rule is that due process requires 
notice reasonably calculated,under all the circumstances,to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.the notice must be of such nature as reasonably to convey the required information,and it must afford a reasonable time for those interested to make their appearance.
mullane,at.citations omitted.therefore,as we conduct our analysis,we are chiefly concerned with determining what constitutes the required information that must be reasonably conveyed to the creditor against whom the debtor wishes to enforce the discharge injunction.
arch urges us to adopt a rule that the required information includes only actual,timely knowledge,however acquired,that a corporation has filed for bankruptcy under chapter.thus,arch argues that nationwide actual and timely knowledge that arch had filed for bankruptcy was sufficient to satisfy due process requirements and permit nationwide to be bound by the discharge injunction because such actual knowledge of the proceedings put nationwide on inquiry notice of the bar date.in other words,arch argues that nationwide bore the burden of investigating arch proceedings to determine whether and when it had to present its claim to the bankruptcy court.nationwide could not,arch argues,intentionally,strategically sit on its rights.
arch argument is directly at odds with the view we adopted in in re intaco puerto rico,cir,as well as the view of at least five of our sister circuits,fogel zell,cir in re maya constr,cir in re unioil,cir in re spring valley farms,cir in re harbor tank storage,cir.but see in re christopher,cir.the majority rule set forth in these cases is that the fact that the creditor may be generally aware of the pending reorganization,does not of itself impose upon him an affirmative burden to intervene in that matter and present his claim t he creditor has a right to assume that proper and adequate notice will be provided before his claims are forever barred.intaco,at.
this rule,in turn,is based upon the supreme court holding in city of new york.at.in that case,the court determined that,as to a known creditor,publication notice fell short of the requirement in c of the former bankruptcy act,that t he judge shall cause reasonable notice of the period in which claims may be filed,by publication or otherwise.at.quoting former c.the court added that c was designed to enable the court to serve personal notices on creditors by providing that t he judge shall require proper persons to file in the court a list of all known creditors,the amount and character of their claims and their last known postoffice addresses.id.as a known creditor,new york city should have been included on such a list and mailed the pertinent notices,but that did not happen.id.the court held that the consequence of this failure of notice was that the discharge injunction was inapplicable to the unnotified creditor,despite the creditor general knowledge that the debtor had filed for reorganization.id.at.the court explained 
nor can the bar order against new york be sustained because of the city knowledge that reorganization of the railroad was taking place in the court.the argument is that such knowledge puts a duty on creditors to inquire for themselves about possible court orders limiting the time for filing claims.but even creditors who have knowledge of a reorganization have a right to assume that the statutory reasonable notice will be given them before their claims are forever barred 
the statutory command for notice embodies a basic principle of a reasonable opportunity to be heard must precede judicial denial of a party claimed rights.
id.in intaco,we held that the same logic applied when the debtor failed to comply with the notice requirements set forth in chapter x of the former bankruptcy act.at.
arch resists the logic of city of new york and intaco on a number of grounds.first,arch argues that the cases were decided on statutory rather than constitutional grounds and that the statutes under which they were decided are no longer in force.however,the statutory provisions in those cases closely parallel
