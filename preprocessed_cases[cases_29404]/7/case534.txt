overview of affected parties 
the underlying matter in this appeal is an accounting malpractice action.louis binder,the trustee for the resorts international.litigation trust,brought a claim in excess of against accounting firm price waterhouse for professional malpractice and breach of contract in connection with accounting services performed for the litigation trust.the trustee principal allegation is that price waterhouse erroneously reported in its audit that accrued interest on litigation trust accounts belonged to the debtor rather than to the litigation trust.underlying this claim was a suit between the litigation trust and the debtor,resorts international,over entitlement to the accrued interest.according to the trustee,price waterhouse erroneous reports were relied on by the bankruptcy court to the litigation trust detriment.
the debtor,resorts international,is not a party to the malpractice action.the debtor assigned to the litigation trustee all its rights,title,and interest in the litigation trust primary asset,its claim against donald trump and affiliated entities.because the bankruptcy court confirmed the reorganization plan,the debtor estate no longer exists.
nonetheless,the trustee alleges the debtor estate would still be affected by the malpractice suit because the litigation trust is effectively a continuation of the bankruptcy estate.furthermore,contends the trustee,any recovery obtained in this action would necessarily become trust assets,available to cover any liability that might arise in the accrued interest lawsuit or available for possible distribution to the beneficiaries of the litigation trust,who were former creditors of the debtor estate.
price waterhouse responds that the litigation trust,a legally distinct entity,is not a continuation of the bankruptcy estate for jurisdictional purposes.moreover,price waterhouse contends the debtor is only tangentially affected by this malpractice action after it assigned away its interests in the litigation claims,and the litigation trust beneficiaries traded their creditor status to attain rights to the trust assets.
on november,creditors of resorts international,and resorts international financing,filed against them chapter involuntary reorganization petitions in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of new jersey.on december,griffin resorts and griffin resorts holding,affiliates of resorts international,filed separate voluntary petitions under chapter.all of the cases were consolidated.
on august,the bankruptcy court issued an order confirming the second amended joint plan of reorganization.on september,the parties entered into a final plan and litigation trust agreement.the final plan created a litigation trust for the benefit of certain creditors.section a of the plan provided litigation trustee shall retain and preserve the litigation claims for enforcement,as representative of and successor to the reorganizing entities in accordance with bankruptcy code b b and a.the beneficial interests in the litigation trust were divided into ten million litigation trust units and allocated to certain creditors,the unitholders under a formula set forth in section b of the plan.under section d,each unitholder was entitled to a pro rata share of any distribution from the litigation trust.
the assets assigned to the litigation trust were claims originally held by the debtor,resorts international,against donald trump and affiliated entities,arising from trump leveraged buyout of the taj mahal resort.upon formation of the litigation trust,the litigation claims were assigned to the trustee.the plan authorized the trustee to prosecute the claims against the trump entities.the plan and litigation trust agreement also required the debtor to provide an irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of to the litigation trust to enable it to pursue the litigation claims.
on may,the trustee entered into an agreement with trump and his affiliates and the debtor settling the litigation claims on behalf of the trust unitholders in the amount of,subject to approval by the unitholders.approval was solicited and received by july.the settlement agreement proceeds became assets of the litigation trust.
the litigation trust agreement contained several provisions affecting price waterhouse,though it was never named in the document.section of the litigation trust agreement provided that t he trustee shall retain an independent public accounting firm to audit the financial books and records of the trust and to perform such other reviews or audits as may be appropriate in the trustee sole discretion,and that the trustee shall pay such accounting firm reasonable compensation from the trust assets for its services.section of the litigation trust agreement required the trustee to report to all unitholders the details of the trust transactions and disbursements at least annually and to have these reports audited by the independent accounting firm retained by the trustee not less frequently than annually.
on april,representatives of the litigation trust unitholders elected kenneth feinberg as litigation trustee.on november,after confirmation of the plan,the trustee retained price waterhouse to provide auditing and services to the litigation trust.subsequently,under an order dated august,louis binder replaced feinberg as trustee.shortly thereafter,the trustee terminated the services of price waterhouse.on april,the trustee filed this adversary proceeding against price waterhouse alleging professional negligence and breach of contract.
the trustee alleged price waterhouse committed professional malpractice by making several errors in its accounting and tax advice.his principal allegation is that price waterhouse erroneously reported in its audit reports that certain accrued interest on the litigation trust accounts belonged to the debtor rather than to the trust.the accrued interest was the subject of a dispute between the debtor and the litigation dispute the bankruptcy court decided in part in favor of the debtor and in part in favor of the trust.see in re resorts int l,at the trustee alleged that to the extent the bankruptcy court approved the debtor claim to the interest,it relied on price waterhouse audit reports,so that its errors injured the litigation trust.the trustee alleged that even though the trust partially prevailed in the interest dispute,price waterhouse erroneous characterization caused the trust to incur unnecessary litigation costs in defending its entitlement.the trustee also alleged certain errors in tax advice and auditing provided to the trustee and faulted price waterhouse for failing to review and interpret certain litigation trust documents.the trustee sought damages and disgorgement of fees in excess of.
procedural history 
on april,almost seven years after reorganization plan confirmation,the trustee filed the underlying professional malpractice action against price waterhouse in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of new jersey.on january,the bankruptcy court granted price waterhouse motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction finding there was no related to or core jurisdiction.binder price waterhouse in re resorts int l,slip op.at.disagreeing with the trustee that this was a core proceeding,the bankruptcy court characterized the matter as a dispute between two involving state law claims that did not affect the administration of the estate,property of the estate,or liquidation of assets of the estate.id.at.although finding its jurisdiction to be extremely limited,the bankruptcy court recognized that it retained jurisdiction over disputes that potentially affect the successful implementation and consummation of the plan.id.at internal quotations omitted.but the bankruptcy court rejected related to jurisdiction because the claims could not have had any conceivable effect on the administration of the estate,and because the dispute would not significantly affect consummation of the reorganization plan.see id.at.it also found that none of the plan retention provisions were intended to serve as a basis for jurisdiction over the litigation trust and accountants nor could the plan language create jurisdiction greater than that granted by congress.id.at.
the trustee appealed to the district court,which reversed and remanded.binder price waterhouse in re resorts int l,slip op.at.the district court held the terms on which the litigation trust was created and its practical role in the plan lead to the conclusion that claims arising from professional misconduct in the trust affairs are sufficiently related to the bankruptcy case to be within the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court.id.at.the court explained 
c onfirmation did not terminate the estate with respect to the property vested in the litigation trust and the trust represented a partial continuation of the estate.consequently,the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court over proceedings arising from the affairs of the litigation trust is not substantially different from its jurisdiction over similar matters,and it should have the power to hear claims of professional malpractice in the administration of the trust.
id.at.but in light of the uncertainties surrounding the exercise of bankruptcy court jurisdiction,the district court certified its ruling for immediate appeal under b.id.at.price waterhouse petitioned for leave to appeal.the trustee chose not to contest the petition.we granted leave to appeal.
price waterhouse claims the district court erred in upholding related to bankruptcy jurisdiction because there can be no conceivable effect on the administration of the estate.furthermore,it contends,the district court judgment,if permitted to stand,threatens unending jurisdiction in the bankruptcy court well after dissolution of the debtor estate.the trustee counters that this professional malpractice cause of action involves parties,assets,and issues central to the reorganization plan and is related to the bankruptcy,especially given the sweeping jurisdictional retention provisions in the plan and litigation trust agreement.

both the reorganization plan and litigation trust agreement contain retention of jurisdiction provisions.article xi of the plan provides in part 
the bankruptcy court will retain jurisdiction of the reorganizing cases for the following purposes c to ensure that the distribution of holders of claims and interests are sic accomplished as provided herein h to hear and determine disputes arising in connection with the plan or its implementation including disputes arising under agreements,documents or instrument executed in connection with this plan i to construe and to take any action to enforce the plan and issue such orders as may be necessary for the implementation,execution,and consummation of the plan o to hear and determine any other matters not inconsistent with chapter of the bankruptcy code.
article viii of the litigation trust agreement provides 
the bankruptcy court shall retain exclusive jurisdiction over the litigation claims and counterclaims,the trust,the trustee,and the trust assets,as provided for in the plan,including,without limitation,the determination of all controversies and disputes arising under or in connection with this trust agreement.
the trustee contends these provisions confer bankruptcy court jurisdiction over this dispute because the litigation trust agreement falls within the definition of agreements,documents,or instruments executed in connection with the plan.furthermore,the trustee contends the dispute involves the performance of professionals whose retention was mandated and whose duties were specified by the litigation trust agreement.the trustee stresses that,under the agreement,the bankruptcy court retention over any dispute according to the agreement was not only comprehensive it was exclusive.appellee br.at emphasis in original.
retention of jurisdiction provisions will be given effect,assuming there is bankruptcy court jurisdiction.but neither the bankruptcy court nor the parties can write their own jurisdictional ticket.subject matter jurisdiction can not be conferred by consent of the parties.coffin malvern fed.sav.bank,cir.where a court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over a dispute,the parties can not create it by agreement even in a plan of reorganization.in re continental airlines,aff,wl.september,aff,cir.similarly,if a court lacks jurisdiction over a dispute,it can not create that jurisdiction by simply stating it has jurisdiction in a confirmation or other order.accord united states trustee gryphon at the stone mansion,a retention of jurisdiction provision within a confirmed plan does not grant a bankruptcy court jurisdiction,aff,cir.bankruptcy courts can only act in proceedings within their jurisdiction.donaldson bernstein,cir.if there is no jurisdiction under or,retention of jurisdiction provisions in a plan of reorganization or trust agreement are fundamentally irrelevant.but if there is jurisdiction,we will give effect to retention of jurisdiction provisions.consequently,we will examine whether this dispute falls within the bankruptcy court subject matter jurisdiction.

bankruptcy court jurisdiction potentially extends to four types of title matters,pending referral from the district court cases under title,proceeding arising under title,proceedings arising in a case under title,and proceedings related to a case under title.in re guild gallery plus,at quoting in re marcus hook dev.park,cir.cases under title,proceedings arising under title,and proceedings arising in a case under title are referred to as core proceedings whereas proceedings related to a case under title are referred to as proceedings.see collier on bankruptcy,at ed.congress vested the bankruptcy courts with full adjudicative power with regard to core proceedings,subject to appellate review by the district courts.b,a,c.at the same time,it provided that,for proceedings that are otherwise related to a case under title,the bankruptcy court shall submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to the district court subject to de novo review by that court.c.
core proceedings 
b provides that b ankruptcy judges may hear and determine all cases under title and all core proceedings arising under title,or arising in a case under title,referred under subsection a of this section,and may enter appropriate orders and judgments,subject to review under section of this title.id.b provides a list of examples of core proceedings such as matters concerning the administration of the estate,orders to turn over property of the estate,or other proceedings affecting the liquidation of the assets of the estate or the adjustment of the or the equity security holder relationship,except personal injury tort or wrongful death claims.id we have held that a core proceeding under section is one that invokes a substantive right provided by title or one that by its nature,could arise only in the context of a bankruptcy case.in re guild gallery plus,at quoting in re marcus hook,at.
the trustee argues this matter qualifies as a core proceeding,relying on southmark coopers lybrand in re southmark,cir.in southmark,the court concluded that a debtor suit against an accounting firm was a core proceeding in bankruptcy,observing that the bankruptcy court must be able to ensure that managers of the debtor estate are performing their work conscientiously,and.id.at.the court also noted that supervising professionals bears directly on the distribution of the debtor estate.if the estate is not marshaled and liquidated or reorganized expeditiously,there will be far less money available to pay creditors claims.id.
notwithstanding the trustee arguments,it is difficult to see how this malpractice matter could be considered a core proceeding.it is not a proceeding that invokes a substantive right provided by title or a proceeding that,by its nature,could arise only in the context of a bankruptcy case.in re guild and gallery plus,at.
unlike in southmark,this claim arose confirmation.it does not directly affect the debtor or the liquidation of the estate assets.furthermore,the accounting firm alleged malpractice in southmark implicated the integrity of the entire bankruptcy process.southmark bankruptcy arose out of its involvement in drexel burnham lambert,junk bond investments.southmark,at.southmark sought the appointment of an accounting firm to provide an objective,independent assessment of potential legal claims against.id.unbeknownst to southmark,drexel was one of the accounting firm largest clients.id.at.according to southmark,the accounting firm committed malpractice by failing to satisfactorily investigate potential claims against drexel.id.southmark alleged the accounting firm breach of its fiduciary duty prevented the estate from recovering from drexel.id.at.the accounting firms failure to investigate drexel implicated the core of the bankruptcy process.its alleged malpractice was inseparable from the bankruptcy context.here,price waterhouse alleged malpractice,erroneously reporting that certain accrued interest belonged to one entity rather than to another and committing other errors in auditing and tax advice,even if true,is not a proceeding that could arise only in the bankruptcy context.
regardless,we need not resolve whether this is a core proceeding for subject matter jurisdictional purposes because w hether a particular proceeding is core represents a question wholly separate from that of jurisdiction.in re marcus hook,at.under,a bankruptcy court might have jurisdiction over a proceeding but still might not be able to enter final judgments and orders.id.related to jurisdiction is the broadest of the potential paths to bankruptcy jurisdiction,so we need only determine whether a matter is at least related to the bankruptcy.donaldson,at.
related to proceedings 
the pacor test 
with related to jurisdiction,congress intended to grant bankruptcy courts comprehensive jurisdiction so that they could deal efficiently and expeditiously with matters connected with the bankruptcy estate.celotex edwards,d quoting pacor,higgins,cir.nonetheless,a bankruptcy court related to jurisdiction can not be limitless.id.we set forth the seminal test for determining the boundaries of related to jurisdiction in pacor,at 
under pacor,bankruptcy courts have jurisdiction to hear a proceeding if the outcome of that proceeding could conceivably have any effect on the estate being administered in bankruptcy.id.in in re marcus hook,we emphasized that a key word in this test is conceivable and that c ertainty,or even likelihood,is not a requirement.id.at.in pacor,we observed t he proceeding need not necessarily be against the debtor or against the debtor property.an action is related to bankruptcy if the outcome could alter the debtor rights,liabilities,options,or freedom of action either positively or negatively and which in any way impacts upon the handling and administration of the bankrupt estate.at.the supreme court has explained that the critical component of the pacor test is that bankruptcy courts have no jurisdiction over proceedings that have no effect on the estate of the debtor.celotex,at.
the context of the related to inquiry 
as noted,pacor and its progeny provide the analytical framework for determining related to jurisdiction.but most of the cases decided under pacor do not arise or even after the creation of a litigation trust.litigation trusts,which serve a valid purpose in the bankruptcy process,may continue long after a reorganization plan has been confirmed and the debtor has emerged from bankruptcy.and yet bankruptcy jurisdiction may still obtain if there is sufficient connection to the bankruptcy.
the context of this dispute affects our related to inquiry because bankruptcy court jurisdiction must be confined within appropriate limits and does not extend indefinitely,particularly after the confirmation of a plan and the closing of a case.donaldson,at after confirmation of a reorganization plan,retention of bankruptcy jurisdiction may be problematic.see bank of craig stores of,in re craig stores of,cir in re fairfield,cir.this is so because,under traditional pacor analysis,bankruptcy jurisdiction will not extend to a dispute between unless the dispute creates the logical possibility that the estate will be affected.in re global,cir internal quotations omitted,cert.denied,d.at the most literal level,it is impossible for the bankrupt debtor estate to be affected by a dispute because the debtor estate ceases to exist once confirmation has occurred.see in re fairfield,at holding that once a bankrupt debtor plan has been confirmed the debtor estate ceases to exist.unless otherwise provided by the plan or order confirming the plan,the confirmation of a plan vests all of the property of the estate in the reorganized debtor.b.see also nvf new castle county,holding that the confirmation of a plan revests the estate property in the reorganized debtor,and accordingly,the bankruptcy estate no longer existed,aff.cir.
but courts do not usually apply pacor s effect on the bankruptcy estate test so literally as to entirely bar bankruptcy jurisdiction.as the district court correctly noted,though the scope of bankruptcy court jurisdiction diminishes with plan confirmation,bankruptcy court jurisdiction does not disappear entirely.binder,slip op.at.jurisdiction is assumed by statute and rule b authorizes the bankruptcy court to direct the debtor and any other necessary party to perform any other act that is necessary for the consummation of the plan,and fed.d provides that n otwithstanding the entry of the order of confirmation,the court may issue any other order necessary to administer the estate.id.although b assumes that jurisdiction exists for disputes concerning the consummation of a confirmed plan,remains the source of this jurisdiction.in re united states brass,at.
moreover,several courts have preserved jurisdiction in the bankruptcy court.see gryphon,at holding that the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction because a trustee action to enforce a fee provision was related to and arising in the bankruptcy donaldson,at upholding bankruptcy court jurisdiction where the debtors failed to fund the reorganization plan and failed to pay unsecured creditors as required by the plan.and courts have upheld jurisdiction in situations involving trusts and similar entities.see bergstrom dalkon shield claimants trust in re robins,cir upholding bankruptcy jurisdiction over a professional fees dispute between a claimants trust and attorneys representing claimants on the trust 
courts have applied varying standards to determine whether related to jurisdiction should be upheld.we noted in donaldson,that some courts have held that the act of plan confirmation changes the pacor test from whether the outcome of the proceeding could conceivably have any effect on the estate being administered to whether the outcome could significantly affect consummation of the plan as confirmed.id.at quoting grimes graue in re haws,in donaldson,we declined to determine the precise standard to apply.first sblc.subsequently,in gryphon,we applied the pacor test to resolve a claim for fees brought by a united states trustee,querying whether the dispute could conceivably have any effect on the estate being administered in bankruptcy and holding that the matter satisfies the pacor test because it directly relates to the debtor fact it creates a could impact the handling and administration of the estate.id.at.and in gryphon,we held that though provides that the bankruptcy court may take action to ensure the consummation of a confirmed plan,the bankruptcy court may entertain other actions as well.at.
though courts have varied the standard they apply,the essential inquiry appears to be whether there is a close nexus to the bankruptcy plan or proceeding sufficient to uphold bankruptcy court jurisdiction over the matter.for example,in donaldson,we upheld bankruptcy court jurisdiction because the trustee through the lawsuit was basically seeking to carry out the intent of the reorganization plan.id.at.we distinguished the matter from other cases denying jurisdiction because it had a much closer nexus to the bankruptcy case.id.in upholding jurisdiction,we found significant the fact that the case did not involve a dispute essentially collateral to the bankruptcy case.id.rather,the action implicat ed the integrity of the bankruptcy process because one party actions impaired the other party ability to act in accordance with the plan.id.the fee dispute in gryphon,also had a close nexus to the bankruptcy proceeding because it involved a trustee action to enforce a fee provision and created a liability for the debtor.id.at.at the stage,the claim must affect an integral aspect of the bankruptcy must be a close nexus to the bankruptcy plan or proceeding.
whether a matter has a close nexus to a bankruptcy plan or proceeding is particularly relevant to situations involving continuing trusts,like litigation trusts,where the plan has been confirmed,but former creditors are relegated to the trust res for payment on account of their claims.to a certain extent,litigation trusts by their nature maintain a connection to the bankruptcy even after the plan has been confirmed.the question is how close a connection warrants bankruptcy jurisdiction.matters that affect the interpretation,implementation,consummation,execution,or administration of the confirmed plan will typically have the requisite close nexus.under those circumstances,bankruptcy court jurisdiction would not raise the specter of unending jurisdiction over continuing trusts.
an example of a dispute in which there was a sufficiently close nexus to the plan or proceeding to uphold bankruptcy court jurisdiction was an earlier proceeding involving the resorts international,bankruptcy.see in re resorts int l.there,unlike here,the bankruptcy court was required to construe and enforce provisions of the plan to resolve a dispute over whether the litigation trust or the debtor was entitled to accrued interest.id.at.the court correctly held that it retained jurisdiction to enter appropriate orders to enforce the intent and specific provisions of the plan.id.at.
bergstrom,and falise am.tobacco,are useful for illustrating when there is a sufficiently close nexus to the bankruptcy plan or proceeding to uphold bankruptcy jurisdiction in situations involving continuing trusts.in bergstrom,the dispute implicated an integral aspect of the bankruptcy process.the trust intended to distribute surplus funds to tort claimants on a pro rata basis.id.at.but certain attorneys claimed entitlement to contingent fees.id.the district court,sitting in bankruptcy,limited attorneys fees to ten percent of the amounts distributed.id.to resolve the dispute,it was necessary to interpret the plan accompanying documents to determine whether it was unreasonable to charge standard attorneys fees out of the pro rata distribution.see id.at.in upholding related to jurisdiction,the court explained why the dispute was central to the bankruptcy proceeding the trust was created to protect and pay those persons who had been damaged by use of the dalkon shield.the efforts of the trust to settle the remaining claims could easily be affected if the remaining claimants are aware that any attorneys fees out of the pro rata distribution will be limited to ten percent.id.at.accordingly,the dispute integrally affected the bankruptcy plan and proceeding,and it was appropriate for the district court,sitting in bankruptcy,to exercise jurisdiction over that proceeding.
in contrast,this kind of close nexus to the bankruptcy plan or proceeding was absent in falise.falise involved a dispute between tobacco manufacturers and a trust created as a result of the bankruptcy of an asbestos products producer.id.at.the trust sought to recover from the tobacco companies for their role in contributing to illnesses.id.noting that the resolution of the dispute would require more than merely interpreting the plan terms,the court held that bankruptcy court jurisdiction does not extend to a major suit brought by the trust against to the bankruptcy or to any closely related proceeding.id.at.in falise,the resolution of the dispute would have had no impact on any integral aspect of the bankruptcy plan or proceeding.accordingly,it was appropriate to find no bankruptcy jurisdiction over that collateral matter.
in re haws,similarly illustrates when a proceeding lacks a sufficiently close nexus to the bankruptcy plan or proceeding to uphold jurisdiction.there,the action was brought by a trustee for a liquidating trust against a partner of the debtor for breach of fiduciary duty.id.at.in holding the matter to be outside bankruptcy court jurisdiction,the court noted the plaintiff had failed to demonstrate how any damages recovered from the defendant were necessary to effectuate the terms of the plan.id.at.the court recognized that n owhere in the lawsuit is the bankruptcy court being asked to construe or interpret the confirmed plan or to see that federal bankruptcy laws are complied with in the face of violations.id.it concluded the only nexus to this bankruptcy case is that the plaintiff in this matter is a liquidating trustee representing a group of creditors appointed pursuant to the confirmed plan of reorganization.id.
montana goldin in re pegasus gold,is also instructive.a reclamation services corporation rsc was created under a reorganization plan for the purpose of performing reclamation work in order to benefit the overall plan goal of preserving the jobs of debtors employees to thereby maximize the possibility of creditor recovery.id.at.the trustee and rsc contended the state of montana had represented that rsc would be given preference in the bidding for reclamation work.id.at.they brought suit,alleging montana breached the agreement by hiring a competitor to perform the reclamation work.id.the court upheld bankruptcy court jurisdiction because rsc failure,and its inability to retain the debtors employees on account of montana breach,undermine d the plan objectives for reorganization and the payment of creditors.id.at.the court held that the facts demonstrate the necessary close nexus between appellees tort and contract c
