these companion cases concern the undercapitalization and eventual insolvency of a federally insured bank,southern pacific bank spb,and its holding company,imperial credit industries imperial.in february,the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic notified spb that it was and required it to submit a capital restoration plan.spb submitted a capital plan as well as a guaranty from imperial that spb would perform under the plan.spb failed to implement its capital plan,and the fdic demanded that imperial pay its obligation under the guaranty.imperial,by that point in chapter,asserted a number of defenses to its obligation under the performance guaranty.the district court rejected all of these defenses and granted partial summary judgment in favor of the fdic,ruling that section o of the bankruptcy code required imperial to cure its deficit to the fdic as a condition of remaining in chapter.on appeal from that order,imperial trustee,edward wolkowitz wolkowitz or the trustee,challenges not only whether the performance guaranty binds imperial with respect to spb capital plan,but also whether imperial liability under the guaranty was properly calculated and whether the performance guaranty may be avoided as a fraudulent conveyance.we affirm the district court conclusion that imperial is bound by the performance guaranty and its calculation of imperial liability,but reverse and remand the fraudulent conveyance claim for further proceedings.
while the above appeal was pending,imperial converted to chapter to avoid the district court order that it immediately cure its deficit pursuant to o.the fdic filed a counterclaim for declaratory relief in the district court,seeking a determination of the priority of imperial obligation under the performance guaranty.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the fdic,holding that the fdic claim was entitled to administrative priority status under a.the trustee appeals that decision as well,arguing that the fdic claim is entitled only to ninth priority under a.we agree and,therefore,reverse the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the fdic on this issue.
facts and procedural history 
in february,the fdic issued a prompt corrective action notice informing spb that it was undercapitalized and requiring spb to submit a capital restoration plan by march,to avoid further restrictions on its activities on march,spb filed a capital restoration plan the march capital plan or march plan,which called for it to raise approximately million in new capital through the sale of common equity by june.pursuant to federal law,on february,spb holding company,imperial,executed a corresponding guaranty that spb would perform under the plan the performance guaranty was attached as an exhibit to spb march capital restoration plan.
the text of the performance guaranty begins with several recitals,including the following 
on february,spb board of directors received a prompt corrective action notification letter from the fdic which,among other things,requires spb to file a written capital restoration plan the capital plan with the regional office of the fdic by march,
the guaranty set forth below has been duly adopted at the regular meeting of the board of directors of imperial held on february,and is intended to comply fully with section of the federal deposit insurance act and the implementing regulations thereto.
after these recitals,the document sets forth the substantive terms of the performance guaranty,by which imperial commits itself to 
absolutely,unconditionally and irrevocably guarantee the performance of spb under the terms of the capital plan and pay the sum demanded to spb or as directed by the fdic in immediately available funds promptly after receipt by imperial of such demand provided,that the aggregate liability of imperial under this guaranty shall be the lesser of an amount equal to five percent of spb total assets as of december,or the amount which is necessary or would have been necessary to restore the relevant capital measures of spb to the levels required to be adequately capitalized,as those measures and levels are defined at the time that spb initially fails to comply with its approved capital plan 
the fdic did not approve the march plan.spb submitted revised capital restoration plans on april,and may,which the fdic rejected as well.on may,spb submitted an amendment to the may plan the may capital plan or may plan,which proposed a capital infusion of approximately million by july,this time through private placement the sale of assets.unlike the march plan,the plans submitted on april,may,and may did not include as an attachment any performance guaranty by imperial.nonetheless,the fdic approved the may plan.
spb failed to implement its capital restoration plan by the july,deadline.on july,the fdic issued a second prompt corrective action notice,informing spb that it would be subject to the restrictions imposed on a significantly undercapitalized institution under f.both imperial and spb attempted to achieve a recapitalization of imperial transferring million in cash to spb on march,and july,on february,the california department of financial institutions declared spb insolvent and appointed the fdic as receiver.on july,imperial filed a voluntary petition under chapter of the bankruptcy code,seeking to liquidate its assets.
on september,the fdic notified imperial that it had failed to comply with its performance guaranty and demanded under the contract.on november,imperial filed an adversary action against the fdic in the bankruptcy court for the central district of california,seeking to avoid the alleged obligation.the case was transferred to the district court for the central district of california,and on march,imperial filed its second amended complaint,asserting eight causes of action against the fdic.the fdic moved to dismiss all the claims except the claims for declaratory relief and judgment.the district court denied the fdic motion with respect to imperial equitable subordination claim and allowed imperial to replead its fraudulent inducement and conveyance claims,but otherwise granted the fdic motion imperial amended its complaint and repled its fraudulent conveyance claim on november,but the district court once again granted the fdic motion to dismiss that claim,ruling that imperial had failed to plead actual fraud.
on december,the fdic moved for an order requiring imperial to pay its obligation under the performance guaranty pursuant to o,which provides that chapter debtors must immediately cure any deficit owed to a federal depository institutions regulatory agency under a capital maintenance commitment.the court ruled on the fdic motion on february.it held that if imperial had guaranteed spb capital restoration plan,it was required to cure any capital deficit of spb as a condition of remaining in chapter.however,the court delayed a final ruling on the fdic motion because imperial was entitled to present obligor defenses to the contractual obligation,which had not been fully briefed.the court found that five of imperial claims from its second amended complaint were obligor defenses,and granted it leave to present those.two of imperial equitable subordination and fraudulent conveyance trustee defenses the court held that imperial could not bring those claims until it obtained chapter trustee status by curing its deficit.imperial fraudulent conveyance claim was moot regardless of its status as a trustee defense,though,because that claim had been dismissed on separate grounds.
on april,the fdic moved for partial summary judgment to enforce imperial deficit.on june,the district court granted the motion,rejecting all five of imperial obligor defenses.the court then entered an appealable final partial judgment for the fdic pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b on july,ordering imperial to pay the sum of to the fdic within days.the court stated that if imperial converted to chapter,imperial would be relieved of its obligation to immediately pay to the fdic,and that its unsatisfied immediate cure obligation shall have the status and priority in the chapter case which it is accorded under applicable bankruptcy law.
imperial filed a notice of appeal from the district court summary judgment on july,and unsuccessfully sought a stay from the district court and this court.less than a month later,imperial converted its case to chapter,thereby avoiding its obligation to pay the immediately.
in the chapter case,the fdic moved for a declaration that imperial cure obligation was entitled to priority administrative expense status under a.the district court granted partial summary judgment in favor of the fdic on this issue on october.the parties stipulated to the dismissal of all remaining claims in the action,and judgment was entered in favor of the fdic on november.imperial timely appeal followed.

imperial guaranteed spb may capital plan 
in its partial summary judgment ruling in favor of the fdic,the district court held that the performance guaranty signed by imperial on february,applied to the may capital plan approved by the fdic.on appeal,the trustee reiterates its argument that imperial guaranteed only the march capital plan.
the parties agree that the ordinary rules of contract interpretation apply to the performance guaranty under california law.see cent,llc cooper,th,d,cal.as with any contract,our goal is to give effect to the mutual intent of the parties.county of san diego ace prop.cas.ins,cal th,d,citing bank of the superior court,cal th,d.mutual intent is determined by the words used in the agreement,as well as extrinsic evidence of such objective matters as the surrounding circumstances under which the parties negotiated or entered into the contract the object,nature and subject matter of the contract and the subsequent conduct of the parties.wolf superior court,th,d,internal quotation mark omitted citing cal,see also bank of am.trust sav.ass waters,d.
based on our examination of the language of the contract,the circumstances surrounding its negotiation and execution,and the subsequent conduct of the parties,we hold that the performance guaranty is valid and enforceable with respect to spb may capital plan.the guaranty must be read in conjunction with the statute and regulations that required its execution in the first place,and such a reading necessarily leads to the conclusion that the parties intended it to apply to the capital plan ultimately approved by the fdic.
the statutes governing the undercapitalization of federally insured depository institutions directed the course of events in this case.spb received a prompt corrective action notice from the fdic,and was required under e to submit a capital restoration plan to the fdic in order to avoid restrictions on its activities.e f.section e c ii required imperial,as spb holding company,to guaranty spb performance under the capital plan.imperial submitted a performance guaranty with spb march capital plan to comply with the statute.the guaranty explicitly recognized its role in spb recapitalization process,stating that section of the federal deposit insurance act and the act implementing regulations require a company that controls an undercapitalized bank to issue a performance guaranty with respect to the company capital restoration plan.see e c ii.the performance guaranty also stated that it intended to comply fully with section of the federal deposit insurance act and the implementing regulations thereto.
after the fdic failed to accept spb march capital plan,spb submitted three other versions of capital restoration plans to the fdic over the course of a few months in an effort to regain adequately capitalized status and avoid restrictions on its activities.according to imperial,during this time it worked diligently with spb to comply with all fdic directives in an effort to achieve recapitalization.the fdic finally approved the fourth version of spb capital plan,which was submitted on may,with no objection from spb or imperial.
the trustee now contends that imperial never intended its previously offered guaranty to apply to the may version of the capital plan.this argument not only belies the guaranty promise to comply with the statutes and regulations directing the treatment of undercapitalized banks,but also is inconsistent with imperial subsequent efforts to achieve spb recapitalization.the language of the performance guaranty clearly demonstrates that imperial intended to comply with the statutory framework governing undercapitalized institutions.imperial was fully aware that an enforceable performance guarantee was required in order for the fdic to approve spb capital plan,and it worked with the fdic and spb in an effort to achieve spb recapitalization.
moreover,imperial implicitly recognized that its guaranty would extend to a later version of spb capital plan.the performance guaranty defined imperial liability with reference to the approved capital plan,rather than the march capital plan,and it fixed a maximum amount of liability at of spb assets on december,regardless of the form the approved plan ultimately took.thus,the trustee can not successfully argue that imperial never intended to guaranty the may plan.
the trustee arguments to the contrary fail to persuade us.for example,wolkowitz argues that a plain reading of the performance guaranty demands the result that the guaranty only applied to the march plan because the words march,appear after the term capital plan in the guaranty.however,the words march,are part of an earlier descriptive sentence,and not part of the substantive terms of the guaranty itself.the substantive terms of the guaranty apply to the approved capital plan without limitation.
wolkowitz also contends that the guaranty never became an operative contract because it was submitted to the fdic only as part of the march capital plan,which the fdic did not accept.this argument also fails.the rejection of the march capital plan by the fdic did not apply to the performance guaranty,which explicitly extended to the approved capital plan and not the march plan specifically.moreover,absolute guaranties are binding without notice of acceptance in california see cal.kierulff ravenscroft koping,section of the civil code,changes the rule announced in many cases,and provides that an absolute guaranty is binding upon the guarantor without notice of acceptance.the trustee remaining arguments,which focus on two pieces of extrinsic evidence in the record,also fail to convince us that the parties did not intend the guaranty to apply to the may capital plan 
in sum,we hold that the performance guaranty applies to the may capital plan and affirm the district court grant of summary judgment on this issue.
b.the district court properly calculated the amount of the performance guaranty 
the district court adopted the fdic calculation of imperial deficit under the performance guaranty at.the trustee argues that the district court erred in relying on spb june,call report data,because the guaranty required any liability be calculated as of july,and that a million payment it made to spb on july,should reduce any liability under the guaranty.
use of june,call report data 
the trustee contests the district court calculation as improperly relying on spb june call report data.he argues that the plain language of the guaranty required the fdic to calculate the amount of the obligation as of july.the fdic counters that neither the performance guaranty nor the regulation it recites dictates the source from which the fdic must draw its data,and therefore the district court properly held that the fdic use of the june,data was entitled to administrative deference.
the performance guaranty,in language nearly identical to the fdic regulation,h i b,limited imperial liability to the lesser of of spb assets as of december,or the amount necessary to restore spb relevant capital measures to the levels required for spb to be adequately capitalized,as those capital measures and levels are defined at the time that spb initially fails to comply with its approved capital plan.it is undisputed that spb initially failed to comply with the may plan on july,the deadline by which it was to have raised million.accordingly,wolkowitz argues that any liability on imperial part should have been calculated as of july,
as the fdic argues,the trustee conflates the words defined and calculated.the performance guaranty and the regulation in question simply state that the definitions of the capital measures and levels based upon which the fdic measures a bank liability must be those in place at the time of the bank failure.neither the performance guaranty nor the regulation says anything about how imperial liability should be calculated,nor states that the calculation must occur as of the date spb fails to comply with the plan.
as a result,the district court correctly held that the performance guaranty and the corresponding regulation failed to clearly define how imperial obligation should be calculated.finding the contract and the identical regulation ambiguous,the district court granted deference to the fdic reasonable interpretation of its own regulation as authorizing it to calculate imperial obligation based on spb june,call latest data in its possession.see chevron,natural res.def.council,d.
the trustee attacks the district court deference to the fdic interpretation on a number of fronts,but we find his arguments unpersuasive.for example,the trustee argues that because the performance guaranty was a contract,and not a regulation,agency deference was inappropriate.though we have held that deference is not appropriate solely because the contract signed by the parties contains the same language as a statute,clay tower apts.kemp,cir,we agree with the district court that deference is proper here,because the agreement in question stemmed from and was designed to resolve an ongoing proceeding and included intrinsically regulatory terms of a type that the agency frequently employs its expertise in reviewing,mci telecomms,
wolkowitz next contends that deference is inappropriate because the fdic stands to benefit from its own interpretation.see creek native ass norton,cir.however,the fdic does not necessarily stand to gain if deficits are calculated by reference to banks call reports,even if it did so here.in fact,it is unclear whether imperial obligation would increase or decrease if the calculation date were changed to july.
the trustee last argument is that even if the fdic had nothing to gain from its interpretation of the regulation,its position in litigation is still not entitled to deference because it is unsupported by a regulation,ruling,or established administrative practice.however,smiley citibank,d,only forbids deference to agency litigating positions that are wholly unsupported by regulations,rulings,or administrative practice.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.the fdic is certainly not litigating a wholly unsupported position here.the fdic reliance on quarterly bank call reports is established in its regulations and its administrative practice.several federal regulations require federally insured banks to file quarterly call reports to the federal banking agencies,see,a,a,and those agencies,including the fdic,consistently rely on that data for a variety of regulatory purposes,see,a iii c,c.for example,the fdic relies on call reports in determining the capital level of a bank,j bank total assets defined by information in call report,in determining the date of a bank effective capital category,and in approving or disapproving capital restoration plans,b capital restoration plans must be prepared in accordance with instructions on the call report.thus,the fdic calculation of imperial liability as of spb latest call report data is supported by its general practice of relying on call reports for regulatory purposes 
in light of the above,we affirm the district court calculation of imperial liability under performance guaranty using spb june,call report data.
credit for million payment 
the district court held that a million transfer imperial made to spb on july,could not reduce imperial liability under the performance guaranty because the contract stated that imperial liability could not be released,discharged,or in any way affected by any circumstance,condition,or matter including v any counterclaim,deduction or defense imperial may have against spb.the trustee contends that the million payment was not a or deduction but a partial payment towards its liability.he also argues that if the million payment to spb is a barred deduction,then no payment could ever reduce imperial liability under the guaranty.
we disagree.the million payment to spb clearly meets the definition of a deduction,which the trustee himself defines as an act of taking away or something that can be subtracted.webster third new international dictionary.moreover,just because this million transfer to spb does not reduce imperial liability does not mean that no payment could reduce its liability.had imperial made a payment to spb upon demand by the fdic or as directed by the agency,as required by the language of the guaranty,the payment should have been properly credited toward its liability however,it is entirely implausible that imperial intended a million payment made to spb in july of to reduce its obligation to the fdic when the fdic did not demand payment until september,and imperial was allegedly unaware of any obligation until the fdic demand.therefore,we affirm the district court calculation of imperial deficit at.
c.the district court erred in dismissing the fraudulent conveyance claim 
in the district court,imperial sought to avoid any obligation created by the performance guaranty as a constructive fraudulent conveyance under.the district court dismissed this claim as barred by u unless imperial could plead actual fraud,which it was unable to do.imperial argues that this decision was based on an erroneous interpretation of u and asks the panel to reinstate its fraudulent conveyance claim.the fdic requests the panel affirm the district court because the fraudulent conveyance claim was a trustee defense,and so was barred by o.in the alternative,the fdic argues that the district court properly interpreted u 
the fraudulent conveyance claim status as a trustee defense 
in its february,order,the district court held that imperial could not exercise its powers as a trustee without first curing its deficit to the fdic under o.the district court held that imperial fraudulent conveyance claim was a trustee defense made on behalf of its creditors,and that imperial,therefore,could not litigate that defense until it cured its obligation to the fdic.however,the court did not dismiss the fraudulent conveyance claim for that reason,as it had already dismissed the claim as barred by u.the fdic urges the panel to affirm the district court dismissal of the fraudulent conveyance claim because imperial was barred from bringing it in the first place as a trustee defense.
we decline to affirm on that basis.section o requires immediate cure of a deficit to a federal depository institution under a performance guaranty only when the debtor is in chapter.a chapter debtor is under no obligation to immediately cure such a deficit.accordingly,the district court holding that imperial could not bring trustee defenses until it cured its deficit under o necessarily applies only to debtors in chapter,not debtors in chapter like imperial.although the district court need not have reached the question whether the fraudulent conveyance claim survived dismissal in the chapter proceeding,it did in fact dismiss the claim as barred by u.now that imperial is in chapter,we can not affirm its dismissal of the fraudulent conveyance claim on the separate ground that it was a barred trustee defense in chapter.that question is moot,and imperial fraudulent conveyance defense is viable now,unless precluded by u.
section u and the fraudulent conveyance claim 
because we can not affirm the dismissal of the fraudulent conveyance claim as a barred trustee defense,we address the trustee argument that the district court erroneously dismissed its fraudulent conveyance claim as barred by u.wolkowitz argues that the statute prohibits persons from bringing only fraudulent conveyance claims regarding a transfer of assets and thus does not bar imperial claim requesting the voiding of an obligation under a performance guaranty.the district court rejected this argument below,holding that imperial argument was based on an unsupported distinction between assets and obligations.to the contrary,we find that the distinction between assets and obligations is supported by the plain language of the statute and the legislative history.on its face,u prohibits persons from bringing fraudulent conveyance claims against federal banking agencies only for the return of assets transferred to a federally insured bank or for monetary damages or other legal or equitable relief in connection with such transfer,if the transfer was made when the insured bank was undercapitalized.the statute makes no mention of obligations,which is what imperial is attempting to avoid as a fraudulent conveyance 
moreover,the house conference report reveals that the purpose of u is to protect the federal deposit insurance funds from claims brought by the bankruptcy trustee of a depository institution holding company for the return of capital infusions,not for the avoidance of obligations,at,reprinted in.and related statutes addressing fraudulent conveyances recognize the distinction between avoiding an obligation and recovering a transfer,suggesting that congress intentionally omitted obligations from u.compare d a the corporation may avoid a transfer of any interest of an party or any obligation incurred by such party or person with u only barring claims based on transfers of assets see barnhart sigmon coal,d w hen congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.quotation source omitted.academic articles also have clarified that a guaranty is not equivalent to a transfer.see phillip blumberg,intragroup guaranties under the uniform fraudulent transfer act,cardozo,with the issuance of a guaranty,the guarantor incurs an obligation,but no transfer takes place.a transfer takes place only when the guarantor or some other party makes a payment in reduction of the indebtedness that has been guaranteed.thus,it is clear that the issuance of a guaranty is not included in a statute barring transfers although payments pursuant to the guaranty are,of course,included.footnote omitted.
the fdic is unable to effectively rebut our reading of u as barring only claims based on transfers of assets.it attempts to argue that the term asset in u should be defined broadly as something of value,but fails to support its interpretation with any statutory text,legislative history or case law.the fdic also puts forth a policy argument,contending that if u is limited to transfers of assets,then it will render performance guaranties effectively unenforceable against insolvent parent companies of federally insured banks.this argument is flawed,though,because it assumes that if the trustee fraudulent conveyance claim survived dismissal,it would necessarily prevail on the merits,when the next step would be for a court to determine whether the performance guaranty represented a fraudulent conveyance that could be avoided under.
in light of the above,we reverse the district court dismissal of the fraudulent conveyance claim as barred by u,and remand for further proceedings.
d.the fdic claim is entitled to only ninth priority in the chapter proceeding 
the district court held that imperial owed the fdic based on its obligation under the performance guaranty.per o,which mandates immediate payment of deficits to federal depository institutions,the court ordered imperial to cure its deficit as a condition of remaining in chapter.alternatively,the court noted that imperial could convert to chapter,in which case its unsatisfied cure obligation would have the status and priority in the chapter case which it is accorded under applicable bankruptcy law.imperial converted to chapter,and litigation over the status of the fdic claim ensued.the district court determined that the fdic claim was entitled to administrative priority in the chapter case under a.the trustee argues that o and of the bankruptcy code relegate the fdic claim to ninth priority.the fdic argues that the district court correctly accorded its claim administrative priority.the priority of a claim arising from an uncured deficit under o is an issue of first impression.
section o was enacted as part of the comprehensive thrift and bank fraud prosecution and taxpayer recovery act of,which constitutes title xxv of the crime control act of,stat.as part of its response to the savings and loan crisis,congress sought to prevent parties affiliated with federal depository institutions from using bankruptcy to evade commitments to maintain capital reserve requirements of a federally insured depository institution.i,at,reprinted in,resolution trust,in re firstcorp,cir.section o accomplished this goal by taking away a trustee ordinary power to avoid a debtor executory contracts under a id.at,reprinted in.the statute provides that i n a case under chapter of this title,the trustee shall be deemed to have assumed consistent with the debtor other obligations under section,and shall immediately cure any deficit under,any commitment by the debtor to a federal depository institutions regulatory agency.o.this assumption and cure mechanism has been interpreted to require a trustee to immediately pay any deficit to a federal depository institution as a condition of remaining in chapter.firstcorp,at.if a debtor can not immediately cure a deficit under a capital maintenance commitment that exists at the time of a bankruptcy filing,then o requires that debtor to proceed not under chapter but under chapter,to which o does not apply.id.
in addition to its assumption and immediate cure requirement,o addresses the priority of a claim arising from an obligation under a capital maintenance commitment.the second portion of the statute provides that any claim for a subsequent breach of obligations under a commitment to maintain the capital of a federally insured depository institution shall be entitled to priority under section.the reference to in o directs the reader to a.that provision,also enacted as part of the comprehensive thrift and bank fraud prosecution and taxpayer recovery act of,places unsecured claims based on any commitment by the debtor to a federal depository institutions regulatory agency to maintain the capital of an insured depository institution in ninth priority in a bankruptcy case the plain language of o and a suggests that the fdic claim under the performance result of a subsequent breach of an obligation under a capital maintenance entitled to ninth priority.
the district court instead held that the fdic claim was entitled to administrative priority under a,which allows second priority to administrative expenses including the actual,necessary costs and expenses of preserving the estate.a,b it found that imperial failure to cure its deficit to the fdic was equivalent to an obligation arising from an executory contract,defined in the bankruptcy context as a contract in which the obligations of both the bankrupt and the other party to the contract are so far unperformed that the failure of either to complete performance would constitute a material breach.fenix cattle silver in re,cir per curiam internal quotation mark omitted.reasoning that obligations arising from executory contracts are generally accorded administrative priority in the bankruptcy context,c
