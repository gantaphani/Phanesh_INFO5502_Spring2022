factual proceedings 
a.the parties 
the debtor,village at lakeridge,llc lakeridge,has only one member mbp equity partners,llc mbp.mbp is managed by a board of five members,one of whom is kathie bartlett bartlett shares a close business and personal relationship with rabkin,which is unrelated to bartlett position with mbp.
bank national association is successor trustee to greenwich financial products,the company through which lakeridge financed a property purchase.at the time lakeridge filed for bankruptcy,bank was one of two creditors holding a claim on lakeridge assets.bank held a fully secured claim worth about million,and mbp held an unsecured claim worth million.
bankruptcy court proceedings 
lakeridge filed for chapter relief on june.on september,lakeridge filed a disclosure statement and an initial plan of reorganization.shortly thereafter,mbp board decided to sell mbp unsecured claim bartlett,on behalf of mbp board,approached rabkin with an offer to sell the claim.on october,rabkin purchased the claim for.in its disclosure statement,lakeridge classified rabkin claim as a class general unsecured claim.
on june,bank deposed rabkin,questioning him about his relationship with lakeridge,mbp,and bartlett.in his testimony,rabkin indicated he had little knowledge of,and no relationship with,lakeridge or mbp before he acquired mbp claim.however,rabkin testified that he had a close relationship with bartlett,that he saw her regularly,including the day of the deposition,and that he had attended a meeting with his counsel and lakeridge counsel one hour before the deposition.rabkin testified that he purchased mbp unsecured claim as a business investment,that he had not known how much his claim was worth before the deposition,and that he knew the claim was a risky investment.rabkin further testified that,prior to the deposition,he had not known his distribution under the proposed reorganization plan was.rabkin claimed to have no interest in lakeridge other than receiving a return on his investment.
bank,through counsel,offered to purchase rabkin claim for at the deposition.rabkin said he would consider the offer.bank,in an attempt to compel an immediate answer,increased its offer to.rabkin again agreed to consider the offer,refusing to provide an answer on the spot.after rabkin consulted with counsel,he did not respond to the offer.the offer lapsed.at a hearing on august,rabkin stated he had felt pressured to accept bank cash offer while he was under oath,without having time to review it first 
on july,bank moved to designate rabkin claim and disallow it for plan voting purposes designation motion.bank contended rabkin was both a statutory and insider,and that the assignment to rabkin was made in bad faith.the bankruptcy court held an evidentiary hearing on the designation motion on august.in its subsequent order designation order,the court held rabkin was not a insider,because 
a rabkin does not exercise control over lakeridge b rabkin does not cohabitate with bartlett,and does not pay her bills or living expenses c rabkin has never purchased expensive gifts for bartlett d bartlett does not exercise control over rabkin e bartlett does not pay rabkin bills or living expenses and f bartlett has never purchased expensive gifts for rabkin.
the court also held that rabkin did not purchase mbp claim in bad faith.however,the court designated rabkin claim and disallowed it for plan voting,because it determined rabkin had become a statutory insider by acquiring a claim from mbp.in other words,the bankruptcy court determined that,when a statutory insider sells or assigns a claim to a,the becomes a statutory insider as a matter of law.
lakeridge and rabkin both timely appealed the designation order,challenging the court finding that rabkin was a statutory insider for purposes of plan voting.bank,challenging the findings that rabkin was not a insider and had not purchased mbp claim in bad faith.
bankruptcy appellate panel 
the united states bankruptcy appellate panel for the ninth circuit bap affirmed in part,reversed in part,and vacated in part the designation order.the bap reversed the finding that rabkin had become a statutory insider as a matter of law by acquiring mbp claim and affirmed the findings that rabkin was not a insider and that the claim assignment was not made in bad faith the bap held that insider status can not be assigned and must be determined for each individual on a basis,after the consideration of various factors.finally,the bap held rabkin could vote to accept the lakeridge plan under a,because he was an impaired creditor who was not an insider.bank appealed.we have jurisdiction under d and we affirm.
ii.standard of review 
we review the bankruptcy court decision independent of the bap decision.see boyajian new falls in re boyajian,cir.whether an insider status transfers when he sells or assigns the claim to a third party presents a question of law.miller prof l promotional,brady in re enter.acquisition partners,cir.establishing the definition of insider status is likewise a purely legal inquiry.we review questions of law de novo.stahl simon in re adamson apparel,cir.
whether a specific person qualifies as a insider is a question of fact.friedman sheila plotsky brokers,in re friedman,cir,overruled on other grounds by zachary cal.bank.lexis cir.we review factual findings for clear error.in re adamson apparel,at.
iii.discussion 
an insider is one who has a sufficiently close relationship with the debtor that his conduct is made subject to closer scrutiny than those dealing at arms sic length with the debtor,at,as reprinted in,at,as reprinted in.we recognize two types of insiders statutory insiders and insiders.statutory insiders,also known as per se insiders,are persons explicitly described in,such as person s in control of the debtor.as a matter of law,a statutory insider has a sufficiently close relationship with a debtor to warrant special treatment.in re enter.acquisition partners,at.no one suggests rabkin qualifies as a statutory insider in his own right.
a insider is a person who is not explicitly listed in,but who has a sufficiently close relationship with the debtor to fall within the definition.see schubert lucent techs.in re winstar commc ns,cir i n light of congress use of the term includes in,courts have identified a category of creditors,sometimes called insiders,who fall within the definition but outside of any of the enumerated categories.see also stating that t he term insider includes the listed categories emphasis added explaining that includes is not limiting.
statutory insider status 
bank asserts that rabkin became a statutory insider when he acquired a claim from mbp.we disagree.a person does not become a statutory insider solely by acquiring a claim from a statutory insider for two reasons.first,bankruptcy law distinguishes between the status of a claim and that of a claimant.insider status pertains only to the claimant it is not a property of a claim.because insider status is not a property of a claim,general assignment law in which an assignee takes a claim subject to any benefits and defects of the claim does not apply.second,a person insider status is a question of fact that must be determined after the claim transfer occurs.see concord square apartments of wood,ottawa,in re concord square apartments.this determination does not ignore the public policy behind protecting secured creditors interests in bankruptcy cases,as explained below.
the term insider,as used in the bankruptcy code,is a noun,referring to a person as defined at.see,defining insider as a person with a particular relationship with the debtor see also a explaining that a court can cram down a reorganization plan when at least one class of impaired claims has voted to accept the plan,not including any acceptance of the plan by an insider.the term insider is not,as bank argues,an adjective used to describe the property of a claim 
whether a creditor is an insider is a factual inquiry that must be conducted on a basis.see,in re friedman,at,describing in detail the alleged insiders relationships with the debtor miller schuman in re schuman,cir per curiam analyzing facts to determine whether the debtor and alleged insider had a sufficiently close relationship to warrant finding insider status.courts may not bypass this intensive factual analysis by finding that a third party became an insider as a matter of law when he acquired a claim from an insider.if so,a assignee could be foreclosed from voting a claim acquired from an insider,even if the entire transaction was conducted at arm length.the bankruptcy code did not intend this result.
further,if a third party could become an insider as a matter of law by acquiring a claim from an insider,bankruptcy law would contain a procedural inconsistency wherein a claim would retain its insider status when assigned from an insider to a,but would drop its status when assigned from a to an insider.see in re applegate,holding that an insider of a chapter debtor may never vote a claim toward plan confirmation,even if the insider acquired the claim from a in re holly knoll,same.
section of title contains a number of safeguards for secured creditors who could be negatively impacted by a debtor reorganization plan.a court may confirm a plan only if,among other requirements the plan and plan proponent comply with the bankruptcy code the plan is proposed in good faith the plan proponent has disclosed the identity of all insiders and potential insiders at least one class of impaired claims has accepted the plan and no insider can vote and the plan is fair and equitable,with respect to each class of claims or interests that is impaired under,and has not accepted,the plan.in addition,a court may designate any entity whose acceptance or rejection of a plan was not in good faith,or was not solicited or procured in good faith.e.therefore,bank overstates its argument that,unless we reverse the bap,debtors will begin assigning their claims to third parties in return for votes in favor of plan confirmation we fail to see how establishing a rule that insider status transfers as a matter of law would better protect the creditors rights than the current factual inquiry 
in conducting a factual inquiry for insider status,courts should begin with the statute.if the assignee fits within a statutory insider classification on his own,the court review ends it need not examine the nature of the statutory insider relationship to the debtor.see in re enter.acquisition partners,at.because rabkin did not become a statutory insider by way of assignment and was not a statutory insider in his own capacity,we must determine whether the bankruptcy court erred in finding that rabkin was not a insider.
non statutory insider status 
insiders are the functional equivalent of statutory insiders and,therefore,must fall within the ambit of.see in re winstar commc ns,at.a creditor is not a insider unless the closeness of its relationship with the debtor is comparable to that of the enumerated insider classifications in,and the relevant transaction is negotiated at less than arm length see anstine carl zeiss meditec ag in re,cir.a court can not assign insider status to a creditor simply because it finds the creditor and debtor share a close relationship.see id.at.
a court must conduct a analysis to determine if a creditor and debtor shared a close relationship and negotiated at less than arm length.having or being subject to some degree of control is one of many indications that a creditor may be a insider,but actual control is not required to find insider status see id.at.likewise,access to the debtor inside information may but not shall warrant a finding of insider status.see id.at.
bank asserts the bankruptcy court erred in holding rabkin was not a insider.we review the bankruptcy court factual finding for clear error in re friedman,at.a.a finding is clearly erroneous when,although there is evidence to support it,the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.united states u.gypsum.we apply this highly deferential standard to findings of fact,because f indings of fact are made on the basis of evidentiary hearings and usually involve credibility determinations.rand rowland,cir en banc see also.a t he reviewing court must give due regard to the trial court opportunity to judge the witnesses credibility.therefore,so long as the bankruptcy court findings are plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety,we can not reverse even if we would have weighed the evidence differently.anderson city of bessemer.
the bankruptcy court finding that rabkin does not qualify as a insider is not clearly erroneous bank presents no evidence that rabkin had a relationship with lakeridge comparable to those listed in.rather,the evidence shows rabkin had little knowledge of lakeridge or its sole member mbp prior to acquiring mbp unsecured claim,much less access to inside information.rabkin does not control mbp or lakeridge,nor does lakeridge or mbp have any control over rabkin.bank has shown that rabkin had a close personal and business relationship with bartlett,and that bartlett approached rabkin,and only rabkin,with an offer to sell mbp claim.however,bartlett does not control mbp or lakeridge.rather,bartlett was one of mbp five managing members,all of whom discussed potential buyers and agreed to offer the claim to rabkin.rabkin did not know,and had no relationship with,the remaining four managing members of mbp.
bank has not shown that rabkin relationship with bartlett who is indisputably a statutory insider of mbp and lakeridge is sufficiently close to compare with any category listed in.rabkin had no control over bartlett,and bartlett had no control over rabkin.rabkin and bartlett kept separate finances,lived separately,and conducted business separately.the bankruptcy court properly evaluated these factors to determine whether rabkin relationship with bartlett was close enough to make him an insider who was conducting business at less than arm length with mbp nothing in or case law indicates it would be improper for a debtor to sell,or even give,a claim to a friend if the friend is acting of his own volition and neither party is engaged in bad faith.see in re friedman,at the case law that has developed indicates that not every relationship attended by a degree of personal interaction between the parties rises to the level of an insider relationship.
both rabkin and bartlett testified that,although rabkin knew lakeridge was in bankruptcy and that purchasing the claim was a risky investment,when rabkin purchased the claim he did not know about lakeridge plan of reorganization or that his vote would be required to confirm it.although rabkin did not conduct an extensive inquiry into the claim value prior to purchasing it,rabkin explained that it was a small investment upon which bartlett had indicated he could make a profit and due diligence would have been very expensive.although rabkin allowed bank offer to purchase the claim for to lapse and subsequently voted in favor of lakeridge reorganization plan,he did so on the understanding that lakeridge would amend the reorganization plan to increase his payout to an amount comparable to that offered by bank.
these facts do not leave us with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.see gypsum,u.at.rather,the bankruptcy court finding that,on the record presented,rabkin was not a insider is entirely plausible,and we can not reverse even if we may have weighed the evidence differently.see anderson,at.
iv.conclusion 
the bap properly reversed the bankruptcy court holding as to rabkin statutory insider status and affirmed the bankruptcy court holding as to rabkin insider status.because rabkin is neither a statutory nor insider,the bap properly reversed the portion of the bankruptcy court order that excluded rabkin vote for plan confirmation purposes.therefore,the judgment of the bap is affirmed.
i agree with the legal conclusion that a person does not necessarily become a statutory insider solely by acquiring a claim from a statutory insider,as discussed in section of the majority opinion.as long as the interest previously owned by a statutory insider was acquired by an independent party,for bona fide reasons,uninfected with the unique motivations of the insider,there is no reason that the insider taint should always be unshakeable.the consideration of whether the insider status should stick to the interest properly depends on the particular circumstances and is appropriately treated as something to be determined based on the facts of the situation.but it is clear to me,based on the facts of this case,that robert rabkin should be viewed as a insider,and the bankruptcy court should treat his claim as such.i respectfully dissent as to section.
the majority opinion,at,defines a creditor as a insider when the closeness of its relationship with the debtor is comparable to that of the enumerated insider classifications in,and the relevant transaction is negotiated at less than arm length.i agree.
the facts make it clear that this transaction was negotiated at less than arm length.rabkin paid to mbp the sole member of the debtor,lakeridge,for an unsecured claim against lakeridge nominally worth million.mbp did not offer the interest to anyone else.the purchase was not solicited by rabkin.it was proposed to rabkin by kathie bartlett,a member of the mbp board.there was no evidence of any negotiation over price rabkin did offer less,and mbp did ask for more.rabkin knew little if anything about lakeridge or,for that matter,mbp before he bought the claim,nor did he conduct any investigation to ascertain the current value of that unsecured claim.even after he purchased the claim,he did not bother to find out more about what it might be worth.prior to his deposition rabkin did not even know what the proposed plan of reorganization would pay him for the claim.after he learned that the payment under the plan would be,he was offered as much as for his interest,but he declined that offer 
the motives of mbp and bartlett are clear and not denied.mbp is the sole member of lakeridge.the lakeridge reorganization plan can not be approved unless there is a class of creditors willing to vote to approve it.without the sale of this claim to rabkin and his anticipated vote to approve the plan,that plan is dead in the water,lakeridge will be liquidated,and there will be no hope for mbp to obtain anything for either the unsecured claim or,more importantly,its ownership of lakeridge.it may have wanted to recover something from its unsecured claim,but it did not look for the best possible price because its lakeridge ownership was far more important.mbp was primarily motivated to place the unsecured claim in the hands of a friendly creditor who could be counted on to vote in favor of the reorganization plan,opening the door to the possibility of obtaining approval of the proposed plan of reorganization.
rabkin motivation is a bit murkier,but it is clear that the transaction can not be understood as a primarily economic proposition on his part.there was no evidence that he had a habit of making blind bets,say by helping out nigerian princes or buying the brooklyn bridge.there is an alternative explanation that makes a lot more sense.as the majority opinion acknowledges,at,rabkin had a close business and personal relationship with bartlett,the person who proposed this transaction to him.i do have to know the precise details of the relationship between rabkin and bartlett to conclude that it offers the only logical explanation for rabkin actions here.he did a favor for a friend,and if it made some money for himself,so much the better.
rabkin may not have been setting out to lose money or planning simply to give to bartlett,but that is not the standard.black law dictionary ed defines arm length transaction as follows 
a transaction between two unrelated and unaffiliated parties.a transaction between two parties,however closely related they may be,conducted as if the parties were strangers,so that no conflict of interest arises.
rabkin and bartlett were not unrelated and unaffiliated parties.the transaction was not conducted as if the parties were strangers.it was not an arm length transaction.as a result,under the definition recognized by the majority,rabkin was a insider because the relevant transaction was negotiated at less than arm length.
rabkin at no point attempted to negotiate the price of his purchase,research the value of the claim that was offered to him,or otherwise behave in a manner that suggests that he took his acquisition seriously as an economic investment.this compels the conclusion that rabkin and bartlett relationship was close enough to gain an advantage attributable simply to affinity rather than to the course of dealings between the parties.in re kunz,cir quoting in re enter.acquisition partners,cir see also,matter of holloway,cir.
moreover,though the majority opinion treats the bankruptcy court determination that rabkin was not a insider as a factual finding subject to review only for clear error,i do not think that reflects a correct understanding of what the bankruptcy court decided.the specific facts of the episode were not seriously contested.rather,the majority simply accedes to the adjudication that,based on those facts,rabkin was not an insider.
but that finding turns at least as much on the legal standard that defines a insider as it does on the facts.look at what the bankruptcy court said in explaining its conclusion that rabkin was not a insider,quoted by the majority opinion,at 
a rabkin does not exercise control over lakeridge b rabkin does not cohabitate with bartlett,and does not pay her bills or living expenses c rabkin has never purchased expensive gifts for bartlett d bartlett does not exercise control over rabkin e bartlett does not pay rabkin bills or living expenses and f bartlett has never purchased expensive gifts for rabkin.
this list of facts would support a finding that rabkin and bartlett are separate financial entities,but it does not show that this transaction was conducted as if they were strangers.at no point does the bankruptcy court mention or refer to an arm length transaction at all,let alone provide a sufficient basis for a finding that rabkin and bartlett were unrelated or dealt with each other as strangers.that is the standard the majority opinion and i both agree should apply,but it was not the standard actually applied by the bankruptcy court.the majority disagrees,stating,at,that the bankruptcy court order is a description of why the transaction was conducted at arm length,but the majority opinion is conspicuously silent in explaining how the facts actually justify any such finding.
that tells me that the problem here is not with the facts as found by the bankruptcy court but with the legal test that the bankruptcy court applied.what standard did the bankruptcy court apply to determine whether this transaction was conducted at arm length,by parties acting like they were strangers we do know,because the bankruptcy court order never discussed the concept.at a minimum,this makes rabkin status a mixed question of law and fact,subject to de novo review.see in re bammer,cir mixed questions presumptively are reviewed by us de novo because they require consideration of legal concepts and the exercise of judgment about the values that animate legal principles.
i do not need to pursue that question further here,though,because even if the clear error standard applies,the finding that rabkin was not a insider can not survive scrutiny.the majority opinion states three separate times,at,that we can not reverse under the clear error standard simply because we would have decided the case differently,a telling
