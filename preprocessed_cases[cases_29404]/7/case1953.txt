in this consolidated appeal,neil gordon,the chapter trustee of the bankruptcy estates of tracy and theresa hedrick and santosh and som sharma,appeals the bankruptcy courts grants of summary judgment to novastar mortgage,and abn amro mortgage group,respectively.the trustee brought the adversary proceedings that gave rise to this appeal to avoid the transfer of security in the debtors properties under b amended by the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of,stat.that subsection of the bankruptcy code permits trustees to avoid certain preferential transfers of interests in a debtor property that occur within ninety days before the filing of a bankruptcy petition.the effect of doing so is to convert a creditor claim secured by property of the debtor to an unsecured one against the estate.
the bankruptcy courts granted summary judgment to the defendant companies after concluding that under georgia law of equitable subrogation the transfers of the security deeds were made for b purposes on the date the loans closed instead of on the later date when the security deeds were recorded.that meant in the hedricks case that the transfer to novastar occurred before the b preference avoidance period began and,as a result,the trustee could not avoid the transfer of the security deed.it meant in the sharmas case that the transfer qualified for the c contemporaneous exchange exception and,as a result,the trustee could not avoid the security deed.
the trustee appeals of the bankruptcy court judgment in each case were heard by the same district court judge in a joint hearing.the court issued identical orders stating that it found the bankruptcy courts orders to be,and it affirmed their judgments.this is the trustee appeal of the bankruptcy courts grants of summary judgment to the defendant in each of the cases,which we have consolidated.
the undisputed,material facts of both cases are similar.the debtors refinanced debts secured by property interests in their homes,paying off the earlier creditors with loans from the new creditors.the new loans were secured by first priority security deeds on the homes.the cancellations of the earlier deeds to secure debt were not recorded until after the new security deeds had been recorded,and that recording of the new security deeds took place within the period preceding the filing of the chapter petitions.the trustee for the bankruptcy estates initiated adversary proceedings to avoid the new security deeds under b,which provides for avoiding some preferential transfers that occur in the period preceding the filing of a bankruptcy petition.
the significant difference between the two sets of debtors is that the creditors who originally held the security deeds on the hedricks home were paid off more than ninety days before the hedricks filed their joint bankruptcy petition,while the creditors who originally held the security deeds on the sharmas home were paid off fewer than ninety days before the sharmas filed their joint bankruptcy petition.the details and our analysis follow,beginning with the hedricks case.
astoria federal savings and countrywide home loans,each held a security deed on the hedricks home.on december,the hedricks refinanced the debts secured by those deeds,paying off astoria and countrywide with borrowed from novastar.the hedricks loan from novastar was secured by a first priority security deed on their home.
the federally mandated three business day rescission period on the refinancing loan expired on december.on december novastar delivered checks to astoria and countrywide,paying off the hedricks debts to them in full.that same day novastar sent its new security deed to the county clerk to be recorded,but the document was not actually recorded until january.the cancellations of the old security deeds to astoria and countrywide were recorded on january.
on april,the hedricks filed a joint petition for chapter bankruptcy.thereafter the trustee asked the bankruptcy court to avoid novastar security deed on the hedricks property under b a.in order to rule on that request the court had to determine when the transfer of the security deed was made.
section e a,the provision,states that a transfer is made at the time of the exchange if the interest received is perfected within ten days.the bankruptcy court applied georgia doctrine of equitable subrogation to find that the transfer of the security deed from the hedricks to novastar was made when novastar paid off astoria and countrywide,which was on december.that date was within ten days of the exchange at the refinance loan closing.as a result,under e a the transfer was made at the time of the exchange,which was more than ninety days before the hedricks filed their joint bankruptcy petition.because the date of the exchange was more than ninety days before the bankruptcy petition was filed,the bankruptcy court held that the trustee was not entitled to avoid the transfer under b a.
the court also held that,in any event,the trustee had failed to introduce sufficient evidence to survive summary judgment on one of the other elements of the avoidance provision the requirement that the party seeking to avoid the transfer prove that the transferee received more from the transfer than it would have from chapter proceedings.see b a.on both of those grounds the bankruptcy court granted summary judgment to novastar.the district court did,too,and for the same reasons.
whether the grant of summary judgment to novastar was correct depends on whether the transfer of interest in the hedricks property was made outside the preference avoidance period under b a,which in turn depends on when novastar security deed was perfected.see b a conditioning the trustee ability to avoid the transfer on it having been made on or within days before the date of the filing of the petition.
when a transfer is made for b a purposes depends on when it is perfected.if the transfer is perfected within ten days of the exchange,it is considered to have been made when it occurred.e a.if the transfer is perfected more than ten days after the exchange,it is considered to have been made at the time it is perfected,which will be after the transfer occurred.id.e b.a transfer is perfected when a bona fide purchaser of such property from the debtor against whom applicable law permits such transfer to be perfected can not acquire an interest that is superior to the interest of the transferee.id.e a.
the bankruptcy code does not define the term bona fide purchaser.straight first interstate bank of commerce in re straight,cir.bap.however,that term in the federal statute takes its common,ordinary meaning.see id.applying the definition of bona fide purchaser in black law dictionary to the term in of the bankruptcy code see also united states watkins,cir using the term bona fide purchasers,as that term is commonly defined,in applying a federal civil forfeiture statute united states hunter in re walter,cir where a statutory lien is created by federal law the characteristics of a bona fide purchaser will be determined by federal law.see generally griffith united states in re griffith,cir en banc in interpreting the language of a statute,we generally give the words used their ordinary meaning.quoting moskal united states,d internal quotation marks omitted.the common,ordinary meaning of a bona fide purchaser is o ne who buys something for value without notice of another claim to the property and without actual or constructive notice of any defects in or infirmities,claims,or equities against the seller title one who has in good faith paid valuable consideration for property without notice of prior adverse claims.black law dictionary ed.
whether an event is enough to put a purchaser on notice so that a bona fide purchaser can not acquire an interest that is superior to the interest of the transferee is determined,the statute tells us by applicable law,e a,which is to say the law of the state where the property is located.see motors acceptance busenlehner in re busenlehner,cir holding that state law determines when perfection occurs for purposes of the preference avoidance provision of the bankruptcy code,overruled on other grounds by fid.fin,fink,d see also corn exch.trust klauder in re corn exch.trust.holding that state law determines when an interest is perfected when interpreting the preference avoidance provision of the bankruptcy act.the hedricks home is in georgia,so the law of that state determines when novastar interest was perfected.
novastar interest was perfected under georgia law at the time a bona fide purchaser could no longer have obtained an interest from the hedricks in their home that was superior to novastar.under georgia recording statute,ann,the world was on notice of novastar security deed once it was recorded.because of that,no one who purchased an interest after the recording of that security deed could have been a bona fide purchaser of an interest superior to novastar.the dispute is whether a bona fide purchaser could have acquired an interest superior to novastar during the period between the time novastar paid off the earlier creditors,thereby extinguishing their security deeds,and the time novastar own security deed was recorded.
that determination turns on georgia doctrine of equitable subrogation and how it fits into the bankruptcy code.equitable subrogation may benefit a party who advances money to pay off an earlier encumbrance on realty either at the instance of the owner of the property or the holder of the encumbrance and the new security is for any reason not a first lien on the property.see bankers trust hardy,quoting davis johnson.in those circumstances if the new creditor is not chargeable with culpable or inexcusable neglect,it will be subrogated to the rights of the prior encumbrancer under the security held by it,unless the superior or equal equity of others would be prejudiced thereby.id.emphasis omitted.novastar contends that no one could have obtained a superior interest to its security deed because it acquired a first priority interest in the hedricks home through equitable subrogation once it paid the earlier creditors.the trustee contends that equitable subrogation does not benefit novastar for two reasons.
first,he argues that as a general matter equitable subrogation can not perfect an interest under the bankruptcy code.it can not,the trustee argues,because equitable subrogation operates through the creation of an equitable lien and equitable liens are not recognized under the bankruptcy code.but equitable subrogation does not create an equitable lien instead,it is an equitable doctrine which affects the priority of property interests that exist apart from equity.id.at.in any event,even if equitable subrogation is seen as creating an equitable lien,the code still incorporates applicable law into the b preference avoidance provision,meaning that georgia law controls.see in re busenlehner,at see also in re corn exch.trust,at.at.and the doctrine of equitable subrogation is alive and well in georgia.see bankers trust,at.therefore,if the requirements of equitable subrogation are met in this case,novastar security deed enjoys the same priority as the earlier security deeds that novastar paid off.
the trustee second argument is that,even if equitable subrogation can operate to perfect the transfer of a property interest for bankruptcy code purposes,it did not do so here.his position is that the words can not acquire in the e a definition of perfection of a transfer when a bona fide purchaser of such property from the debtor against whom applicable law permits such transfer to be perfected can not acquire an interest that is superior to the interest of the transferee requires us to determine if,under some hypothetical set of circumstances,someone might have been able to prevent equitable subrogation and get an interest superior to novastar.if that could have happened,the trustee argues,then the interest was not perfected until it was recorded.
even if the trustee is right about that,it does not carry the day for him because no intervening buyer could,under any set of hypothetical facts,have been a bona fide purchaser in this case.and only a bona fide purchaser would have the superior or equal equity necessary to prevent the operation of equitable subrogation.a bona fide purchaser is,as we have said,one who has in good faith paid valuable consideration for property without notice of prior adverse claims.black law dictionary at.what constitutes notice to the hypothetical purchaser is determined by state law.see in re busenlehner,at.any purchaser who acquired an interest in the hedricks property during the period between the time novastar paid off the earlier debts and the time it recorded its own security deed could not be a bona fide purchaser under georgia law,because the security deeds from the earlier debt remained on the record books and appeared to be in effect at all times during that period.
georgia recognizes inquiry notice,which imputes knowledge of an earlier interest to a later purchaser of an interest in land whenever there is a ny circumstance which would place a man of ordinary prudence fully upon his guard,and induce serious inquiry.see page will mcknight,internal quotation marks and citation omitted.under rossville federal savings loan ass chase manhattan bank,a purchaser of an interest in property has inquiry notice,and thus can not be a bona fide purchaser,if he acquires his interest before earlier creditors security deeds are cancelled.id.at.
in that case,rossville federal savings held a security deed on a residential property.id.at.in exchange for receiving a new security deed,first trust company sent a check to rossville federal to pay off the debt owed it.id.after receiving that check,rossville federal sent its cancelled security deed to be recorded.id.before the check from first trust cleared,first trust,through an intermediary,sold the security deed to chase manhattan bank.id.only after that happened was rossville federal cancellation recorded.id.the check from first trust was returned for insufficient funds,and first trust turned out to be insolvent.id.the georgia supreme court held that rossville federal could set aside its cancellation of its security deed in the property,reasoning that chase manhattan had inquiry notice,and so was not a bona fide purchaser,because the first trust deed was still recorded at the time chase manhattan took its interest.id.at 
in the present case no bona fide purchaser could acquire an interest superior to novastar because the earlier security deeds were not cancelled until after the novastar security deed was recorded.before novastar recorded its security deed,a hypothetical intervening purchaser would have inquiry notice of it under rossville.after novastar recorded its security deed,a hypothetical intervening purchaser would have constructive notice of that deed under the recording statute.see ann.thus,anyone who might have acquired an interest in the hedricks property would have had notice of one kind or another and could not have been a bona fide purchaser.the novastar security deed was therefore perfected under georgia doctrine of equitable subrogation as soon as astoria and countrywide received the checks paying off the hedricks debts to them.see bankers trust,at for equitable subrogation to apply a party must advance money to pay off an encumbrance baker hous.auth.of waynesboro,defining paid to mean discharge of a debt or liability,by the delivery of money or other value by a debtor to a creditor emphasis added,citation omitted.if novastar security deed had not been properly recorded before the other security deeds were cancelled,it would not have been perfected until it was recorded or the world was put on notice by some other means.that,however,is not what happened.
novastar checks to astoria and countrywide were sent on december,and cleared novastar escrow account on december.therefore,the latest that novastar perfected its interest under the doctrine of equitable subrogation was december.novastar loan to the hedricks closed on december.because the delivery and the closing occurred within ten days of each other,the transfer was made at the closing for purposes of e a provision.the avoidance period,which was the ninety days preceding the hedricks filing their joint chapter petition,did not begin until january.therefore,the december,transfer at the closing was made outside the ninety day avoidance period,and the trustee may not avoid the security deed.
because this is the case,we need not address the bankruptcy court other ground for affirming the bankruptcy court grant of summary judgment to novastar.we do,however,need to turn to the other case in this consolidated appeal.
santosh sharma and sanjiv gupta,a,jointly owned a home.each had taken loans and given liens on his share of the property.on may,the two of them refinanced their debts by obtaining a loan from abn.abn secured the loan with a first priority security deed on the home.the bulk of the new loan,was to be paid to union planters bank to fully satisfy the outstanding balance on sharma debt.the remainder,was to be paid to atlantic states bank to fully satisfy gupta debt.
the federally mandated rescission period on the refinancing ended on may.on the next business day,which,due to the memorial day holiday,was may,abn sent disbursements by federal express to union planters and atlantic.the parties agree that the checks could not have arrived before the following day,may.also on may,abn sent its security deed to the county clerk to be recorded,but it was not actually recorded until june.
on june,santosh sharma and her husband,som sharma,filed their joint petition for chapter bankruptcy.the county clerk recorded the cancellation of the union planters and atlantic deeds to secure debt on the sharma home on june and,respectively.
in the bankruptcy court proceedings,abn and the trustee both agreed that the transfer of the security deed to abn was made within the ninety days preceding the filing of the sharmas bankruptcy petition.ninety days before the petition was filed was march,two months before abn loan to the sharmas closed.although a trustee generally can avoid a transfer occurring within the ninety days before a debtor files a chapter bankruptcy petition if the transfer meets the other requirements of the preference avoidance provision,b,there are exceptions.one of them is the contemporaneous exchange exception,id.c,which exempts from avoidance transfers that are intended to be contemporaneous and are in fact at least substantially contemporaneous.the bankruptcy court granted summary judgment for abn because,applying the doctrine of equitable subrogation,it found that the contemporaneous exchange exception applied.the district court agreed.
we have already discussed in some detail the doctrine of equitable subrogation in connection with the preference avoidance issue in the hedricks case.in the present case,abn security deed in the sharma home acquired the priority of the earlier interests under the doctrine of equitable subrogation on may,when the checks from abn arrived at union planters and atlantic to pay off the sharmas debts to those two creditors.at that time,the exchange between abn and the sharmas was had given union planters and atlantic the money necessary to satisfy the sharmas debts,and abn had received a security deed in the sharmas home,which was immediately perfected through equitable subrogation.
because may,is fewer than ninety days before the sharmas filed for bankruptcy on june,the question is whether abn qualifies for an exception to the b preference avoidance provision.abn contends that the eight days between the time the loan closed and the time it received a perfected interest in the sharma home is close enough to be substantially contemporaneous for purposes of the c exception.if so,then the transfer of the security deed to abn can not be avoided by the trustee.
the exception applies when the transfer was a intended by the debtor and the creditor to or for whose benefit such transfer was made to be a contemporaneous exchange for new value given to the debtor and b was in fact a substantially contemporaneous exchange.c.the trustee does not dispute that the security deeds were intended to be contemporaneous exchanges for new value given to the debtor,so the subparagraph a condition is met.the trustee does,however,contend that the exchange was not in fact substantially contemporaneous,as required by the subparagraph b condition.
we have not yet had the opportunity to define the term substantially contemporaneous in c b outside the context of enabling loans other circuits have,and they have split over whether to transport the period specified in the provision,id.e a,into substantially contemporaneous,or instead define the term in a way that requires a consideration of all the facts in order to decide if a given transfer was substantially contemporaneous.compare collins greater atl.mortg.in re lazarus,cir interpreting substantially contemporaneous as requiring the exchange to occur within the ten day period under e a,and ray sec.mut.fin.in re arnett,cir same,with lindquist dorholt,in re dorholt,cir holding that whether an exchange is substantially contemporaneous must be determined on a basis,and dye rivera in re marino,cir.bap same,aff,cir see also pine top ins.bank of am.trust sav.ass n,cir interpreting substantially contemporaneous in c b to require a flexible inquiry in a state insurance law case.
we are unconvinced by the reasons that the first and sixth circuits have given for writing into c b substantially contemporaneous term the rule contained in e a.see in re lazarus,at in re arnett,at.the result in those circuits is a bright line rule that is drawn at the expense of adherence to the statutory language.section c b does not set out a bright line rule.it does not refer in any way to the period contained in e a or to any other provision time standard.congress chose,for whatever reason,not to make ten days the time measure for c b it chose instead to make substantially contemporaneous the standard.
we have no license to assume that congress did not mean what it said in c b,but we are instead bound to assume that it meant exactly what it said.see hartford underwriters ins.union planters bank,d w e begin with the understanding that congress says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there w hen the statute language is plain,the sole function of the least where the disposition required by the text is not to enforce it according to its terms.citations and internal quotation marks omitted united states labonte,d we do not start from the premise that this language is imprecise.instead,we assume that in drafting this legislation,congress said what it meant.see also united states fisher,cir the plain language is presumed to express congressional intent and will control a court interpretation.what congress said in c b is not within ten days but substantially contemporaneous.the plain meaning of that term conveys opposite of a hard and fast,bright line requires a approach focused on the facts and circumstances.see pine top,at.
the existence of a precise,bright line time measure in e a and in other parts of the code,see,c b rule in the enabling loans exception,does not weigh in favor of courts substituting one for the substantially contemporaneous measure specified in c b.instead,it weighs heavily against doing so because it shows that congress knew how to write specific deadlines and precise time measures into the code and did so when it believed use of one to be the best policy choice.the presence of specified time measures elsewhere in the act makes the absence of one in c b all the more telling.see duncan walker,d it is well settled that where congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.internal quotation marks omitted delgado united states att y,cir w here congress knows how to say something but chooses not to,its silence is controlling.internal quotation marks and citation omitted directv,brown,cir as we have previously stated,when congress uses different language in similar sections,it intends different meanings.internal quotation marks omitted.
we might believe,as the first and sixth circuits apparently do,that congress chose poorly in deciding not to use a more precise,easier to apply,bright line standard in c b.it may be that revising the provision by importing a different standard from another part of the statute would improve would certainly make it easier for courts to apply the provision.in re lazarus,at in re arnett,at.we are not,however,authorized to revise statutory provisions in the guise of interpreting them.see artuz bennett,d whatever merits these and other policy arguments may have,it is not the province of this court to rewrite the statute to accommodate them.badaracco comm r,d courts are not authorized to rewrite a statute because they might deem its effects susceptible of improvement.albritton cagle,cir we are not empowered to rewrite statutes.united states griffith,cir the legislative branch does not require the help of the judicial branch for simple drafting task s.harris garner,cir en banc we will not do to the statutory language what congress did not do with it,because the role of the judicial branch is to apply statutory language,not rewrite it.
we disagree with the premise of the first and sixth circuits that a court is authorized to interpret a statute contrary to the plain meaning of its words if doing so would,in the court view,better further the purpose it thinks congress had in mind.see in re lazarus,at stating that not interpreting substantially contemporaneous to mean within ten days would specifically undercut congress purpose in re arnett,at.as the supreme court recently reminded us,law depends on respect for language.watson united states,d.we interpret and apply statutes,not congressional purposes.oncale sundowner offshore,d i t is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed.united states maung,cir w e are governed by the language congress enacts,not by purported designs or intentions that conflict with that language.cbs,primetime joint venture,cir.in any event,t he best evidence of that legislative purpose is the statutory text adopted by both houses of congress and submitted to the president,casey,d,superceded by statute,civil rights act of,stat,see aldridge williams,how.the law as it is passed is the will of the majority of both houses,and the only mode in which that will is spoken is in the act itself.
nor do we agree with the first and sixth circuits that copying the rule from e a and pasting it over the substantially contemporaneous rule in c b is necessary to avoid negating e.in re lazarus,at in re arnett,at.the sixth circuit thought it necessary because otherwise section c effectively negates section e,and s uch hopeless conflict can not have been intended by congress.in re arnett,at.we disagree with the central premise.reading the two provisions to mean exactly what they say does not negate either one of them,and there is no hopeless conflict,intended or otherwise.
section of the bankruptcy code deals with preferences.the general rule,set out in subsection b of that section,is that a transfer of interests made within the ninety days before a debtor files a petition for chapter bankruptcy can be avoided by the bankruptcy trustee if it meets the other requirements in that subsection.there are exceptions to that general rule.one of those exceptions,which is set out in paragraph c of,provides that a transfer within ninety days may not be avoided by the trustee if two conditions are met.one condition is that the transfer was intended by both the debtor and the creditor to be a contemporaneous exchange for new value given,c a the other condition is that the transfer was in fact a substantially contemporaneous exchange,id.c b.that exception depends solely on those two conditions having been met.it does not require that the transfer have been perfected in ten days or any specified number of days.
section e,by contrast,is not an exception to the general rule about avoiding transfers made within ninety days of the filing of a bankruptcy petition.it has a different purpose and field of operation than an exception.it is,instead,a provision that has to do with calculating the time of transfers for purposes of the preference provisions contained in other parts of.section e a and b divide transfers into two categories those that were perfected within ten days,which are to be considered as made when the transfer occurred and those that were not perfected within ten days,which are to be considered as made when they were perfected.
section e a purpose is to move some transfers that occur within the preference avoidance period and would otherwise be avoidable outside of that period.the transfers it applies to are those that take place within eighty to ninety days before the petition is filed,provided that they are perfected within ten days.there is no substantially contemporaneous requirement or inquiry under e a all that counts is whether the time between the date the transfer occurred and the date it was perfected was ten days or less.if so,the provision operates to move the date the transfer was made to the date of the exchange instead of the date of perfection.if not,the creditor is stuck with the date of perfection.
by contrast,c does not fix or move the date the transfer of an interest was made.it does not contain a rule.instead,it asks only whether the transfer was meant to be a contemporaneous exchange for new value and,if so,whether it was in fact a substantially contemporaneous exchange.if both of these conditions are met,the trustee may not avoid the transfer even if it was perfected more than ten days after the exchange and even if it occurred within ninety days,or nine days,or one day,of the filing of the bankruptcy petition.
both c and e a have separate fields of operation,unless substantially contemporaneous is interpreted to mean within ten days.if that interpretation is forced on the term substantially contemporaneous,then e a will not have a field of operation.every transfer for new value that would fit within the rule of that provision will automatically fit within the substantially contemporaneous standard of c b and be saved by c,because the two time periods for preventing perfection to avoid avoidance will be the same.the irony of the first and sixth circuits interpretation is that it brings about the very result it seeks to avoid.it renders one provision superfluous,which is an interpretative.see.bank germain,d c ourts should disfavor interpretations of statutes that render language superfluous united states menasche.the cardinal principle of statutory construction is to save and not to destroy.it is our duty to give effect,if possible,to every clause and word of a statute internal quotation marks and citations omitted platt union pacific.a legislature is presumed to have used no superfluous words.
nor can the rewriting of the plain meaning of the words substantially contemporaneous in c b be justified on the basis of intent revealed in the legislative history of the provision.the primary reason is that courts must not resort to legislative history to cloud the meaning of statutory text that is plain.ratzlaf united states,d see darby cisneros,d recourse to the legislative history of the statute at issue is unnecessary in light of the plain meaning of the statutory text.ins.ritchie,wall,w hen terms are unambiguous we may not speculate on probabilities of intention.harris,at when the import of the words congress has used is clear we need not resort to legislative history,and we certainly should not do so to undermine the plain meaning of the statutory language.
in addition,even if we could resort to legislative history in construing the meaning of substantially contemporaneous in c b,it would only reinforce the plain meaning of that term.the house committee report contained this commentary on the provision at issue 
the first exception c is for a transfer that was intended by all parties to be a contemporaneous exchange for new value,and was in fact substantially contemporaneous.normally,a check is a credit transaction.however,for the purposes of this paragraph,a transfer involving a check
