this case presents a narrow but important question of statutory interpretation under the bankruptcy code whether b d permits the to assume an unexpired lease without first curing defaults.the ninth circuit,in the only court of appeals opinion to address this question,held that defaults must be cured before assumption.in re claremont acquisition,cir.in the proceedings below,the bankruptcy court and the bankruptcy appellate panel bap reached the opposite conclusion.we disagree with the ninth circuit and affirm.
for purposes of this appeal,we accept the facts as alleged by appellants bankvest capital corporation,the debtor and appellee in this action,was in the business of originating,securitizing,selling,and servicing equipment leases.on may,appellants eagle insurance company and newark insurance company entered into separate but substantially similar lease agreements with bankvest bankvest agreed to lease specified items of computer equipment to each of the appellants for a term of months.under the leases,eagle and newark were obligated to make monthly rental payments of and,respectively.bankvest agreed to arrange for delivery of the equipment directly from nortel,the manufacturer.
eagle and newark were aware,however,that nortel would not complete production of twenty of the items until several months after the start of the lease term.those twenty items,eagle and newark say,collectively accounted for of the entire value of the leased goods and constituted the most critical pieces of equipment.accordingly,it was agreed that nortel would provide appellants with substitute loaner equipment until those twenty items were completed and delivered nortel delivered the leased equipment,including the substitute items,in august.on august,eagle and newark executed certificates of acceptance acknowledging their receipt of the leased equipment in operating condition 
on december,before the loaner equipment could be replaced,an involuntary chapter petition was filed against bankvest in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of massachusetts.bankvest did not contest the petition,and the bankruptcy court entered an order for relief on january.once in bankruptcy,bankvest proposed a plan of reorganization that contemplated a gradual liquidation of its assets.after several revisions,the bankruptcy court confirmed the plan on may.meanwhile,eagle and newark continued to use the leased computer equipment but paid no rent to bankvest,accumulating a collective arrears of approximately million.that debt remains unpaid.
this appeal arises out of the provisions in bankvest confirmed chapter plan that govern the assumption of bankvest unexpired equipment leases.the plan provides that every equipment lease in which bankvest is the lessor shall be deemed assumed by the estate under unless the lease is specifically rejected or any party to the lease files a claim for cure costs.in the event a claim for cure costs is made,the plan permits bankvest to defer its decision whether to assume or reject the lease until the bankruptcy court determines the amount of the cure costs,if any,that the estate would be obligated to pay upon assumption see b.
on june,newark and eagle filed timely claims for cure costs under this procedure.they charged that bankvest had defaulted on the leases by failing to replace the loaner equipment with the final twenty items from nortel further,they contended that this default was an historical fact not susceptible to cure,nothing bankvest could do would remedy its historical failure to deliver the equipment on time.in the alternative,newark and eagle argued that if the estate were allowed to cure,they would each be entitled to damages in excess of,as well as reductions in the rent payments owed to bankvest.finova loan administration,filed an objection to appellants cure claims on behalf of the estate on august,
treating finova objection as a motion to dismiss,the bankruptcy court held a hearing on november.on december,the court dismissed appellants cure claims on a ground not raised by either party that b d permits the to assume an executory contract or unexpired lease without first curing defaults.in re bankvest capital.because bankvest was not in default on any monetary,all of the payments under the leases flowed to bankvest,not from court held that there were no cure claims that had to be satisfied before assumption.id.at.the bap affirmed on the same ground.in re bankvest capital,cir.eagle and newark timely appealed.
this court has jurisdiction over appeals from the bap under d.we review the bankruptcy court conclusions of law de novo,with the benefit of the bap bankruptcy expertise but without deference to its conclusions.fed.in re werthen,cir.
legal background 
the dispute in this case concerns what is,in effect,an exception to an exception to the usual rule under.section generally allows the trustee in,as in this case,the assume or reject any executory contract or unexpired lease,subject to the approval of the bankruptcy court.a in re fbi distrib,cir.this is one of the basic reorganizational tools available to debtors under the bankruptcy code.t he authority to reject an executory contract is vital to the basic purpose of a chapter reorganization,because it can release the debtor estate from burdensome obligations that can impede a successful reorganization.nlrb bildisco bildisco,d.under the code,a rejected contract is considered to have been in breach prior to the bankruptcy petition,leaving the nondebtor party to the contract with a general unsecured claim for contract damages.g,g fbi,at.if the debtor assumes a contract,however,it accepts both the burdens and the benefits of the bargain,and any liabilities incurred in the contract postpetition performance will be treated as administrative expenses with priority status.see a priority for administrative expenses fbi,at.by permitting debtors to shed disadvantageous contracts but keep beneficial ones,advances one of the core purposes of the bankruptcy code to give worthy debtors a fresh start.in re carp,cir.
there are,however,a variety of restrictions on the debtor power to assume executory contracts and unexpired leases.most relevant to this case is b,which provides that if the debtor has defaulted on a contract prior to assumption,the debtor can not assume that contract unless it cures the default compensates the nondebtor party for any actual pecuniary losses resulting from the default and provides adequate assurance of future performance under the contract b.like the bankruptcy court,we will assume arguendo that bankvest failure to replace the loaner equipment constituted such a default.
yet the requirement in b that the debtor cure defaults prior to assumption itself has exceptions.section b provides 
paragraph of this subsection does not apply to a default that is a breach of a provision relating to 
d the satisfaction of any penalty rate or provision relating to a default arising from any failure by the debtor to perform nonmonetary obligations under the executory contract or unexpired lease.
the bankruptcy court held,and the parties do not dispute,that bankvest failure to deliver certain equipment is a quintessential example of a nonmonetary default within the meaning of subparagraph d.at.the question on appeal is whether subparagraph d excuses bankvest from the obligation that it otherwise bears under paragraph to cure that default before assumption.
interpretation of b d 
plain text 
as in any statutory interpretation case,we start with the text of the statute.in re hart,cir.the language of b d can plausibly be interpreted in at least two ways.eagle and newark argue that the word penalty in subparagraph d describes both rate and provision.on their reading,congress intended that subparagraph to read like this 
d the satisfaction of any penalty rate,or any penalty provision relating to a default arising from any failure by the debtor to perform nonmonetary obligations under the executory contract or unexpired lease.
this is essentially the interpretation that the ninth circuit endorsed in in re claremont acquisition,supra,and a number of bankruptcy courts have since followed suit,see,in re williams,in re new breed realty,in re vitanza,wl,at,
bankvest,on the other hand,argues that the word penalty describes only the term rate,and that the second half of subparagraph d creates a distinct exception for defaults.on this view,the statute is best interpreted like this 
d the satisfaction of any penalty rate,or any provision relating to a default arising from any failure by the debtor to perform nonmonetary obligations under the executory contract or unexpired lease.
this is the interpretation favored by the bankruptcy court and the bap below,as well as by the district court in the claremont case.see in re claremont acquisition,see also in re walden ridge,llc,in re pac.airlines,rev on other grounds,in re gp express airlines.
if the plain language of the bankruptcy code required either of these interpretations,that would end the matter.lamie united states trustee,d.but we see no textual basis for preferring appellants interpretation to the one adopted by the bankruptcy court,which strikes us as equally consistent with the text.nothing in the language or syntax of b d unambiguously requires either outcome.indeed,we are to endorse any plain meaning argument where,as here,other federal courts have reached conflicting answers to the same question based on the same plain language.compare claremont,at,and williams,at,with bankvest,at,and claremont,at 
with a simple comma or two,congress could have made its preferred interpretation clear.but the code as written is ambiguous,so we must divine congress intent from other sources.see in re weinstein,cir where the bankruptcy code is ambiguous,courts look to its historical context,its legislative history,and the underlying policies that animate its provisions in re christo,cir.
legislative history 
the legislative history of b d is not instructive.congress inserted subparagraph d as part of the bankruptcy reform act of,stat.eagle and newark place great weight on the single sentence in the legislative history of that act that pertains to b d 
finally,section b is clarified to provide that when sought by a debtor,a lease can be cured at a nondefault rate,it would not need to pay penalty rates.
parenthetical in original,reprinted in.from this,appellants conclude that congress must have intended subparagraph d to address penalty provisions only.the claremont decision likewise points to this legislative history as evidence that congress intended only to relieve debtors of the obligation to pay penalties.at.
we disagree.at best,the legislative history indicates that congress intended b d to free debtors from lease provisions requiring the payment of penalty that both parties here agree that it does but subparagraph d also refers to defaults,and the legislative history does not indicate what congress intended by that reference.to interpret the house report explanation of one clause of subparagraph d as a limitation on the scope of a different,unmentioned clause would overstate the inferences that can be drawn from an ambiguous act of legislative drafting.martin hadix,d refusing to limit the scope of a statute by negative implication from the legislative history.like the statutory text,the legislative history simply offers no guidance on the question that divides the parties.
eagle and newark also point to pending bankruptcy reform legislation that,they say,would codify their interpretation of subparagraph b.that is both untrue and unhelpful.for several years congress has debated versions of the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act.none has yet passed.the most recent version of which we are aware,introduced in february by representative sensenbrenner,would strike the phrase penalty rate or provision in b d and replace it with penalty rate or penalty provision.see,cong.a b.but the same bill would also amend b to relax the cure requirement for certain defaults.see id.a a.the most that can be gleaned from this unenacted legislation is that at least some members of congress are aware that b d is a problem.it does not tell us how congress in intended the present version of subparagraph d to operate in cases like the one at bar.
practical implications 
the best approach to interpreting b d focuses on practical considerations of bankruptcy policy and congress overarching purposes in the bankruptcy code.the claremont decision has drawn sharp criticism from bankruptcy commentators,who nearly unanimously regard that case as an obstacle to the successful reorganization of many debtors in bankruptcy.see,collier on bankruptcy ed.suggesting that claremont reflects a questionable reading of subparagraph d that is inconsistent with congress likely intent weintraub,historical defaults and here a default,there a default,everywhere a default,default,default,cal,claremont imposes a considerable roadblock to the assumption and assignment of valuable contracts and can have a potentially devastating effect on the ability of certain debtors to reorganize stang,assumption of contracts and leases the obstacle of the historical default,cal,in restricting a debtor ability to assume contracts and leases,the claremont court undermined an important bankruptcy tool in contravention of fundamental bankruptcy precepts.
the reasons for this criticism are evident.many defaults are historical facts that are impossible to cure after the example,a debtor failure to maintain leased property in a certain condition,to use leased equipment only for approved purposes,or to meet certain standards of quality or performance see vitanza,wl,at most defaults involve unalterable historical facts.requiring a debtor to cure such incurable defaults is tantamount to barring the debtor from assuming any lease or contract in which such a default has matter how essential that contract might be to the debtor reorganization in bankruptcy.indeed,that is exactly what happened in several cases following the claremont rule.for example,in in re williams,supra,the debtor was a professional truck driver who defaulted on his truck lease,which provided that he could only use his truck in the service of his employer.at.the bankruptcy court ruled that the debtor violation of that provision was an incurable historical default,then citing claremont barred assumption of the lease under,lifted the automatic stay,and allowed repossession of the debtor truck.see id.at see also in re beckett,no,wl,at,permitting the debtor eviction because the debtor could not cure her historical default on a lease provision requiring her to maintain her apartment in a clean,orderly,and safe condition.
this can not,in our view,be what congress intended.to prevent a debtor from assuming a contract based on historical events that it can not remedy undermines congress basic purpose in to promote the successful rehabilitation of the business for the benefit of both the debtor and all its creditors.fbi,at.this case well illustrates the force of that concern.eagle and newark together owe bankvest approximately million in unpaid rent.yet they argued to the bankruptcy court that bankvest failure to complete delivery of the leased equipment is an historical fact not susceptible to cure.at.so rather than simply seek an offset for any pecuniary harm they may have suffered,eagle and newark would deny the estate all million in unpaid rent by compelling bankvest to cure what they allege is incurable that is plainly inconsistent with congress purpose in the bankruptcy code to maximize the value of the estate for all creditors.toibb radloff,d in re summit,cir see also united states shadduck,cir all creditors are injured by the efforts of a single creditor to keep property out of the estate.
all of this suggests that congress meant b d to excuse debtors from the obligation to cure defaults as a condition of assumption.the text,as we have said,readily bears that interpretation.it is not inconsistent with the meager legislative history.and developments in the bankruptcy courts prior to the amendments put congress on notice of the problem of irremediable defaults.see,in re toyota of yonkers,failure to operate car dealership for seven consecutive days would constitute incurable h
