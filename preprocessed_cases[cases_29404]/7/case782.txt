appellants leidenheimer baking company,leidenheimer and patton sausage company patton bring this consolidated appeal,challenging the lower courts treatment of preference payments each received from a grocery store chain before it filed bankruptcy.see b.because none of the payments at issue qualified for the ordinary course of business defense and the subsequent advance defense was properly applied to both appellants,we affirm as to patton and affirm as modified with respect to leidenheimer.
background 
debtor sgsm,which operated a chain of grocery stores,continued to pay many suppliers during the preference period prior to its filing for chapter bankruptcy relief.leidenheimer and patton,in turn,continued to supply sgsm stores with bakery goods and meats and were paid accordingly.the preference period lasted from december,to march.at issue in this appeal are two suppliers defenses based upon c ordinary course of business and c subsequent advances.absent such defenses,the payments are voidable as preferences under b.
sgsm made six payments totaling to leidenheimer during the preference period.in an adversary proceeding brought by sgsm liquidation agent,leidenheimer asserted that the payments were subject to both the subsequent advance and ordinary course of business defenses.the bankruptcy court allowed only the subsequent advance defense as to all six payments.after deducting subsequent new value from each sgsm payment,remained avoidable by the trustee as a preference 
patton received eight payments for a total of during the preference period.the bankruptcy court,in another adversary proceeding,accorded these payments the same legal status as those to leidenheimer.after the court allowed only a subsequent advance defense as to all eight payments,patton was ordered to return as a preference.
the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court in both cases,rejecting the ordinary course defense as to all payments and further holding that leidenheimer and patton were prohibited by law from applying two preference defenses in tandem to the same payment.the parties appealed pursuant to d.
ii.discussion 
the preference provision of the bankruptcy code furthers the purpose of equitable distribution among creditors by authorizing the trustee or to recover most payments made by the debtor on account of antecedent debt within ninety days before bankruptcy.the theory is that when the preferential payments are returned,all creditors can share ratably in the debtors assets,and the race to the courthouse,or the race to receive payment from a dwindling prebankruptcy estate,will be averted.because some creditors,however,receive payments for shipping supplies that enable the debtor to continue doing business,to that extent they act to forestall an ultimate bankruptcy filing.congress enacted several affirmative defenses against preference recovery in order to balance the competing interests.two of the most important defenses are at issue in the case that for payments in the ordinary course of business and that for subsequent advances given the debtor.
the lower courts treatment of these defenses will be reviewed by our standard criteria.in bankruptcy cases,this court perform s the same function,as did the district court fact findings of the bankruptcy court are reviewed under a clearly erroneous standard and issues of law are reviewed de novo.nationwide mut.ins.berryman prods.in re berryman,cir.a finding of fact is not clearly erroneous if it is plausible in the light of the record read as a whole.baker hughes oilfield operations,cage in re ramba,cir.
evidentiary rulings are reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard.pipitone biomatrix,cir.a trial court abuses its discretion when its ruling is based on an erroneous view of the law or a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.bocanegra vicmar,cir.we first address the ordinary course of business defense asserted by both appellants.
ordinary course of business defense 
the bankruptcy code states that a payment made during the preference period need not be returned to the debtor estate 
to the extent such transfer was 
a in payment of a debt incurred by the debtor in the ordinary course of business or financial affairs of the debtor and transferee 
b made in the ordinary course of business or financial affairs of the debtor and the transferee and 
c made according to ordinary business terms.
c.a creditor asserting an ordinary course of business defense must prove all three statutory elements by a preponderance of the evidence.gulf city seafoods,ludwig shrimp in re gulf city seafoods,cir.the first element is not at issue here,as the debts incurred by sgsm to the appellants arose out of ordinary transactions to keep its grocery stores supplied.section c b,which asks whether the transfer was made according to the ordinary business affairs of the parties,is the subjective prong of the ordinary course defense.finally,in examining industry practice under c c,the relevant inquiry is objective that is to say,we compare the credit arrangements between other similarly situated debtors and creditors in the industry.id.at.some latitude exists under the objective prong,as the court should not impose a single norm for credit transactions within an industry the inquiry is whether a particular arrangement is so out of line with what others do that it can not be said to have been made in the ordinary course.id.at.as to what constitutes the relevant industry,gulf city held that the term ordinarily encompasses suppliers to whom the debtor might reasonably turn for similar supplies and firms with whom the debtor competes for customers.id.at.each appellant challenges the court application of the subjective and objective elements of the defense.
there were no unusual features of sgsm payments,no extra charges or penalties,within the preference period other than their being somewhat delayed.the dispute over the subjective prong thus dealt with a comparison of the average intervals before and during the preference period.
leidenheimer asserted an ordinary course of business defense to all six payments made by sgsm the bankruptcy court conducted its analysis according to gulf city and determined that the average time between invoice and payment during the period was days and the median was seventeen days.in the preference period,however,the average jumped to days,with a median of.leidenheimer makes much out of the fact that the bankruptcy court averaged all payments,neglecting to examine each payment individually,but this is not the case.indeed,the court examined each set of invoices and payments individually and concluded that only the payment made on february,discharging invoices an average of days old,was made in the parties ordinary course of business.on appeal,while still contending that all sgsm payments were made in the ordinary course,leidenheimer emphasizes the payments made on february and.the february payment is difficult to fit within the subjective prong leidenheimer itself states that this payment discharged invoices days old on average.both payments were made significantly later than those during the period.based on these facts,it was not clearly erroneous for the bankruptcy court to conclude that only the february,payment satisfied the subjective prong of ordinary course analysis.
patton fares better on the subjective prong analysis.we need not recount the evidence in detail to conclude that the lower courts correctly found at least three payments to patton,made on february,march,and march,satisfied the subjective prong.
the larger issue for both suppliers,however,is the objective prong of ordinary course analysis whether a creditor has met its burden in proving this prong belongs with the bankruptcy judge.we only say that the judge must satisfy himself or herself that there exists some basis in the practices of the industry to authenticate the credit arrangement at issue.gulf city,at.the parties agreed that the relevant industry is grocery dsd direct store delivery.to prove that the sgsm payments were made in the ordinary course for the industry,leidenheimer offered testimony from two experts nicholas pyle and
