john hoover,iii,hoover appeals an order of the united states district court for the district of massachusetts affirming the united states bankruptcy court conversion of hoover chapter bankruptcy case to a case under chapter.hoover harrington,wl.for the reasons expressed below,we reject this appeal,which probably should not have been brought 
background 
as an individual and doing business as halloween costume world,hoover filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code.the united states trustee the trustee filed a motion pursuant to b section to dismiss or convert the case to a liquidation proceeding under chapter of the bankruptcy code.
hoover was the sole witness at the july,evidentiary hearing.after direct and about his business,his finances,and the prospects for rehabilitation and reorganization,the bankruptcy court granted the trustee motion,finding that cause existed to convert the case to chapter under three separate provisions of section b substantial or continuing loss to or diminution of the estate and the absence of a reasonable likelihood of rehabilitation under b a unauthorized use of cash collateral substantially harmful to or more creditors under b d and unexcused failure to satisfy timely any pertinent filing or reporting requirement under b f.the district court affirmed,concluding that cause to convert existed under b a and without discussing the alternative grounds for cause found by the bankruptcy court under b d and b f.hoover,wl,at.
ii.standard of review 
we review the bankruptcy court legal conclusions de novo,its findings of fact for clear error,and its discretionary rulings for abuse of discretion.in re gonic realty,cir.we may also affirm on any ground supported by the record even if the issue was not pleaded,tried,or otherwise referred to in the proceedings below.doe anrig,cir.quoting brown louis police dep t,cir.
iii.discussion 
when an interested party files a motion to convert or dismiss a chapter case,the bankruptcy court inquires as follows does cause exist to convert or dismiss the case and,if so,is conversion or dismissal in the best interests of creditors and the estate see b 
hoover argues that the bankruptcy court erred both in finding that cause to convert existed and in finding that conversion was in the best interests of the creditors.we address each argument in turn.
as noted above,the bankruptcy court found at least three separate causes for conversion.we begin and,because one cause is enough,see anrig,at,we end by explaining why the bankruptcy court did not err in finding cause under section b a.
cause exists under section b a if there has been a substantial or continuing loss to or diminution of the estate and the absence of a reasonable likelihood of rehabilitation.b a.the bankruptcy court finding of diminution in this case was simple and straightforward hoover conceded that he was selling inventory without replacing it,and his monthly operating reports mors showed insufficient profit to account for or replace the sold inventory.in short,the estate was diminishing.as for the likelihood of rehabilitation,the court again pointed to the mors,showing insufficient cash flow to pay costs and debts.the court concluded this debtor barely makes it.that what the numbers tell me and barely makes it only by not paying people and that no recipe for a reorganization.
hoover first response to the foregoing is procedural.he argues that he had no adequate notice that the trustee would rely on section b a.his premise that he was entitled to reasonable notice is correct.in contested matters such as motions to dismiss or convert a case under section b,federal rule of bankruptcy procedure applies.see fed.bankr.a r elief shall be requested by motion,and reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing shall be afforded the party against whom relief is sought.see also id.f rule governs a proceeding to dismiss or suspend a case,or to convert a case to another chapter,except under certain provisions not relevant here.so the question is,did hoover receive reasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing 
clearly,he did.the trustee motion expressly stated that the trustee sought conversion based on a showing of cause under section b a.when it then became clear at the hearing begun on may,that the trustee relied in great part on the mors,the court continued the hearing to july,so as to allow hoover and his counsel to present evidence and prepare to address the mors,which were central to determining whether hoover estate was being diminished and whether there was a reasonable likelihood of rehabilitation.in re pe√±a,wl,at bankr,mors demonstrated that a plan of reorganization was simply not feasible for the d ebtors.in so doing,the court explicitly stated that we talking about a question and the bank is pointing out that on the debtor own cash,monthly operating reports it losing money.the court later granted hoover motion to continue the hearing until july.the court also ordered the parties to file any mors and legal memoranda relevant to the trustee motion,including materials relevant to hoover ability to propose a feasible chapter plan.all of this was more than reasonable under the circumstances to inform hoover that the likelihood of rehabilitation was at issue and to provide him with a meaningful opportunity to prepare and be heard on the issue.see mullane cent.hanover bank tr,due process requires that notice be reasonably calculated,under all the circumstances,to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.
moving from the question of notice to the merits of the cause determination,hoover baldly asserts that there was no evidence of diminution other than possibly the fact that hoover was continuing to conduct business.but as hoover own records unmistakably reveal,he was conducting business by selling inventory without replacing it with new inventory or retaining cash sufficient to offset the diminution.
hoover next argues that his proposed plan of reorganization was not patently unconfirmable,that the state tax authorities would hopefully write off much of his debt,and that it was too early to tell whether a zero dividend was ineluctable.the issue before us,though,is whether the bankruptcy court abused its discretion in determining that there did not exist a reasonable likelihood of rehabilitation.b a.
we see no such abuse.the profit and loss statement revealed that in,hoover business lost over,and the mors showed that,since filing for bankruptcy,the business had generated only minimal profits despite selling off its inventory and not paying anything to secured creditors the court described,in detail,its view of the evidence regarding whether there was a reasonable likelihood of rehabilitation,noting a lack of sufficient funds and income to pay monthly expenses under a chapter plan.the court,in its broad discretion,supportably declined to credit hoover testimony that he had plans for generating more income,finding those plans both speculative and optimistic see palmacci umpierrez,cir.p articular deference is due to bankruptcy court findings that depend on witness credibility see also in re carp,cir.appellate courts are not free to make independent judgments about the credibility of witnesses.
although the question of rehabilitation under section b a is not synonymous with reorganization,the debtor need not have a confirmed reorganization plan in place to avoid conversion,the debtor still must have sufficient business prospects,in re landmark atl.hess farm,llc,bankr,to justify continuance of a reorganization effort,in re lg motors,bankr.quoting in re rey,wl,at bankr.upon review of the evidence and the bankruptcy court detailed reasoning,we,like the district court,are not left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.hoover,wl at quoting in re watman,cir.
given this conclusion,we have no need to consider hoover challenges to the other causes for conversion found by the bankruptcy court.as the trustee points out,and hoover does not contest,one cause is enough.
