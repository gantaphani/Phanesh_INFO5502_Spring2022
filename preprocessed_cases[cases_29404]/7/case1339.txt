michael grassmueck,a bankruptcy trustee,appeals from a grant of summary judgment in favor of the american shorthorn association asa and roger hunsley,the asa executive secretary and treasurer.grassmueck is the bankruptcy trustee for the estate of hoyt sons management,hoyt sons ranches,mlp,and numerous related entities.he brought this negligence action against the asa and hunsley.the district court ruled that the trustee claims were barred by the equitable doctrine of in pari delicto and by the statute of limitations.we affirm on the first ground,and need not address the second.
this lawsuit arises out of a complex scheme of investments that are alleged to have been administered in a fraudulent manner.walter hoyt iii hoyt was the primary figure in a partnership with his brothers called hoyt sons ranches.the family partnership raised cattle located for the most part in nevada,oregon,and california.it also actively sought investors in its operations until its dissolution in the late,when it was succeeded in relevant part by two other entities,hoyt sons management,and hoyt sons ranches,mlp together with hoyt sons ranches,the hoyt entities.
the investments marketed by the hoyt entities were structured so that investors would become partners in one or more investment partnerships.these partnerships purchased cattle from the hoyt entities.the investment partnerships paid for the cattle by assuming notes owed to the hoyt entities in a face value amount equal to the price of the cattle.investors became partners by assuming portions of these notes.investors were to pay only interest on the investment partnership notes for five years,while claiming depreciation deductions on the cattle for tax purposes.the hoyt entities represented that the cattle sold in this manner to the investment partnerships were purebred shorthorn cattle.the hoyt entities attracted large amounts of investment,allegedly in excess of,from thousands of investors over a decade.
there were several problems with the investments represented by the partnerships.the irs did not agree that the cattle depreciation deductions claimed by investors were valid.see bales comm r,cch.the hoyt entities did not own as many cattle as they sold,and the cattle were not worth as much as the investors paid for them.
the hoyt entities entered chapter bankruptcy proceedings on february.the trustee filed a complaint for substantive consolidation against the investment partnerships in september,and the bankruptcy court granted the consolidation in november.the bases alleged for consolidation were that the investment partnership assets and funds were intermingled with those of the hoyt entities,and that the investment partnerships and the hoyt entities were dominated by the same management.at.the investment partnerships,moreover,shared locations and employees with the hoyt entities and suffered from inadequate.id.at.
according to the trustee,the investment partnerships lacked independent substance partners were moved repeatedly from one partnership to another without the partner knowledge,sometimes even into partnerships that had previously been terminated.id.at.investors who purchased cattle in an individual capacity were erroneously placed into investment partnerships.id.as a result of inadequate documentation,ownership of the notes assumed by the investment partnerships was u ncertain.id.at.
the trustee sued the asa and hunsley on november,alleging that they had breached their duties of care to the investment partnerships.the asa,according to the trustee,disregarded its protocols for certifying and registering shorthorn cattle as purebred,thus resulting in the certification and registration of cattle that were not purebred.hunsley,as an officer of the asa,was involved in the alleged negligent certification and registration procedures.he also acted as an expert witness for the hoyt entities in tax court proceedings.the trustee alleges that the asa involvement gave an aura of legitimacy to the entire hoyt scheme,and that the asa aided the hoyts by failing to exercise reasonable care in the performance of their registration and certification obligations to the detriment of the p artnerships.id.at.
a chapter bankruptcy trustee is required to collect and reduce to money the property of the estate for which the trustee serves.the property of the estate created by the commencement of chapter proceedings consists of the items delineated in,which include all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case not expressly excluded.a.the estate,therefore,encompasses causes of action belonging to the debtor at the time the case is commenced.collier on bankruptcy,at ed.
a trustee ability to assert causes of action on behalf of the bankrupt estate is subject to any equitable or legal defenses that could have been raised against the debtor.collier on bankrutpcy,supra,at.in particular,the equitable defense of in pari delicto is available in an action by a bankruptcy trustee against another party if the defense could have been raised against the debtor.see official comm.of unsecured creditors lafferty,cir collier on bankruptcy,supra,at.the doctrine of in pari delicto is the principle that a plaintiff who has participated in wrongdoing may not recover damages resulting from the wrongdoing.black law dictionary ed.
whether in pari delicto may be asserted by a third party against a wrongdoer partner turns on the relationship between the partners,which is a question of state law.in re newman,cir.the district court deemed it unnecessary to resolve which state law applies to this dispute,and we observe that all states whose laws might govern this action have adopted the uniform partnership act upa in relevant part.cal.there are no court decisions in these states dealing directly with the doctrine of in pari delicto and the imputation of wrongdoing by a general partner to a partnership under facts similar to this case,but the parties do not contend that any variation among the laws of the various states would affect our analysis.the case is governed by a uniform statute and principles of common law that are likely to be uniform in each of the jurisdictions.
summary judgment is appropriate if,viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the party,there is no genuine issue of material fact to be resolved.e.we review a grant of summary judgment de novo.dillon brown county,cir.the parties agree that if hoyt fraud can be charged to the cattle partnerships,the doctrine of in pari delicto will bar this negligence action against the asa and hunsley.the material facts underlying this issue are undisputed,so the case may be resolved by summary judgment.see zurad lehman.kuhn loeb,cir describing the applicability of in pari delicto as a legal question.
the district court held that hoyt fraud was chargeable to the investment partnerships.the court acknowledged that,under the upa,the normal rule imputing knowledge from one partner to the partnership does not apply when the partner in question is acting fraudulently.this is known as the adverse interest exception to the imputation rules.the refusal to impute knowledge to the principal of an agent who is acting adversely to the principal is an acknowledgment that the usual legal fiction of complete communication is unjustified where the agent is acting adversely.martin marietta gould,cir.section f of the upa,which expresses this adverse interest exception,reads as follows 
a partner knowledge,notice,or receipt of notification of a fact relating to the partnership is effective immediately as knowledge by,notice to,or receipt of a notification by the partnership,except in the case of a fraud on the partnership committed by or with the consent of that partner.
id.emphasis added.
the district court concluded that the adverse interest exception was qualified in these circumstances by the sole actor doctrine the sole actor doctrine provides that where the principal and agent are one and the same,the agent knowledge is imputed to the principal despite the fact that the agent is acting adversely to the principal.mediators,manney in re mediators,cir.where
