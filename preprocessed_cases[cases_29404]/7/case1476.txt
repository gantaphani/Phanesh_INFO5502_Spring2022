circuit judge 
we must decide whether a labor union decision to distribute the proceeds of a bankruptcy settlement to all of its members unevenly violates its duty of fair representation.
american airlines,and american eagle airlines,collectively american filed for chapter bankruptcy in november of.as part of its reorganization process,american sought to reject and to renegotiate its collective bargaining agreements.the transport workers union of america,twu represented mechanics,fleet service workers,and other laborers at american.american presented twu with a new,proposed labor agreement on february.
after a series of negotiations,twu agreed to new collective bargaining agreements that drastically cut pension and medical benefits for its members.specifically,twu made concessions to american regarding outsourcing and gave up pension benefits gave up certain life insurance benefits and access to medical trust accounts agreed to release various claims and grievances against american in exchange for a stake in the equity that eventually would be granted to unsecured creditors as part of american bankruptcy such equity would also represent compensation for the scope and pension concessions won by american and agreed to release two grievances referred to by the parties as the d grievances as part of the consideration for the equity.in addition to surrendering the share in the equity,american agreed to raises in for twu members as well as to a k program incorporating employer contributions.
twu and american also entered into a me too agreement wherein american pledged to seek similar concessions from other labor groups.american also pledged to discuss and agree upon a proportionate reduction in projected labor cost savings with twu if it failed to achieve similar concessions from other labor groups.this agreement eventually resulted in american awarding twu an additional of the equity given to unsecured creditors,bringing twu total stake to.
in order to prevent mandatory layoffs for twu members,twu and american also negotiated an early separation program whereby more senior twu members could choose voluntarily to leave american in exchange for cash payments.depending on seniority and contractual protections,twu members who chose to participate in early separation could leave with between and in addition to regular severance pay,unused vacation pay,and an additional compensation.
the bankruptcy court approved the new collective bargaining agreements negotiated by american and twu,which went into effect in september.members could opt for early separation in september and october of but not thereafter.
twu formed a committee and retained a financial and economic advisor to determine the best method of distributing the equity in april of,two months after american agreed to merge with us airways group,and the value of the equity became more discernable.the committee circulated its proposed distribution plan to twu members in june and july of.
the draft plan awarded a share of equity to members employed at american during a period beginning on november,and ending on july.other than equity set aside to settle the d grievances,the plan excluded all members who took advantage of the early separation program from receiving any substantial portion of the equity.after receiving feedback from members,the committee voted to adopt the proposed plan on july.twu governing president council then approved the plan,and it became final and binding after twu president refused to exercise veto power.equity distributions began in december.
before us are two consolidated,putative in which twu members who took advantage of the early separation program allege that twu breached its duty of fair representation by excluding them from the bulk of the equity distribution.all of the named plaintiffs in these consolidated appeals allege that they were employed by american and represented by twu during american bankruptcy,and all of the named plaintiffs took advantage of early separation.collectively,these are referred to as retirees.because all of the retirees opted for early separation,none received a share of the equity other than the portion set aside to compensate members for the settling of the d grievances.
in appeal,daniel demetris and other retirees had filed a duty of fair representation claim against twu in the northern district of california in december of.a related case was filed the following month in the northern district of texas,but such action was dismissed and the lead plaintiff joined to the first action by the consent of the parties.in appeal,mark letbetter and other retirees had filed a similar action in oklahoma state court against local,transport workers union of america and transport workers union of america,local,but the case was removed to federal court before being transferred to the northern district of california in september of.both cases were assigned to the same district court judge and are now consolidated before us.
on february,the district court dismissed the demetris duty of fair representation claims,finding such allegations implausible.the district court then dismissed the similar letbetter claims in a order on february,noting that letbetter and other retirees agreed that the rationale employed by the court in the demetris case applied with equal force to their own duty of fair representation claims.this timely appeal followed 
on appeal,retirees argue that the district court erred in dismissing their duty of fair representation claims because twu equity distribution scheme was arbitrary,discriminatory,and made in bad faith.
a union duty of fair representation grows from its statutory right to exclusive representation.because a union has exclusive statutory authority to represent its members,it has a corresponding legal obligation to serve the interests of all members without hostility or discrimination toward any,to exercise its discretion with complete good faith and honesty,and to avoid arbitrary conduct.vaca sipes.this duty adheres to unions governed by the railway labor act no less than to unions governed by the national labor relations act.see also steele louisville.

we address in turn each of the retirees arguments that twu engaged in such arbitrary,discriminatory,and bad faith conduct 
was the union action arbitrary retirees contend that twu made a wholly irrational decision when it withheld the bulk of the equity from any member who participated in early separation.they claim that the union decision was wholly irrational because the contractual concessions exchanged for the equity affected their rights just as much,if not more,than members who chose to stay on at american.the distribution p
