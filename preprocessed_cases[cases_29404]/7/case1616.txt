jerry mcguire is an experienced farmer with a degree in agronomy and agricultural economics from the university of arizona.in,mcguire entered into a lease with the colorado river indian tribe the tribe for acres of farmland leased property on the tribe reservation near parker,arizona.the lease was for a period commencing on january,and expiring on december.mcguire was required to pay the tribe per year,subject to an appraisal for the years through.because the leased property was land held in trust for the tribe by the united states,the lease required the approval of the united states bureau of indian affairs bia.allen anspach,superintendent of the colorado river agency of the bia,approved the lease on june.
a bia canal running east to west bisected the leased property,dividing the property into a northern half and southern half.at the time the lease was executed,a bridge crossed the bia canal providing access to the north portion of the property from mohave road,the main road that runs from parker,arizona to interstate highway.the bridge was constructed by a former tenant sometime in the and was made of wood with round concrete piers or bulkheads underneath.the bridge provided the most common and easiest access to the northern portion.
mcguire planted and maintained alfalfa on most of the leased property.mcguire made substantial investments towards harvesting the alfalfa crop,purchasing tractors,other farming equipment,trucks,seed,labor,laser leveling,tillage,herbicides and fertilizer.in total,mcguire invested roughly at the outset of the lease.mcguire acquired a and loan to finance his investments.from through,mcguire timely paid his lease payment and water bills every year.
in summer,anspach verbally informed mcguire that the bia was going to remove the bridge because it was unsafe.on december,after meeting with mcguire,the tribe sent a letter to the bia stating that removal of the bridge would severely limit access to farming lands and decrease the value of the land.the tribe asked for time to work out a solution.the tribe sent a second letter on december,asking the bia to explore alternatives to removing the bridge because the tenants needed the bridge to access the farm land.
anspach replied to the tribe on december.anspach stated that the bridge would be removed in early because the bridge was not legally authorized under and because the bia believed the bridge was unsafe.anspach recommended that the farmers either reroute access or develop a new bridge approved by the bia.on february,anspach sent the first of three letters to mcguire giving him written notice that the bridge would be removed in january because it was deemed to be unsafe and unauthorized.the letter stated 
if you should decide that you need to bridge the canal in order to operate your farm you may submit to the agency superintendent plans,with specifications,for a new bridge and apply for a crossing permit.see attached reference to cfr,ch.structures.
a copy of the regulations was included with the letter.anspach directed mcguire to contact ted henry,irrigation systems manager,if he had any questions.
during,mcguire contacted henry and jeff hinkins,supervisory general engineer,and discussed the bridge with them on several occasions.at trial,mcguire recounted one instance in which he drew a sketch of a design for a new bridge with hinkins,and hinkins said he was going to discuss it with anspach.mcguire was told on several occasions by bia staff that any decision concerning the bridge could only be made by anspach.mcguire called anspach throughout the year,but never spoke with anspach or received a return phone call from him.during this time,bia staff never provided mcguire with a permit form or formal application for a bridge permit.
in october,mcguire retained local counsel and filed a complaint in tribal court against bia for the impending removal of the bridge.the complaint alleged that removal of the bridge would be illegal,would breach the lease between mcguire and the tribe and would take his leasehold.the bia declined to appear in tribal court.mcguire also appealed anspach decision within the bia to the western regional office,which upheld anspach decision.mcguire did not take the appeal any higher within the bia.
anspach sent mcguire two additional letters on august,and november,stating that the bridge would be removed in january and that mcguire could apply for a permit for a new bridge in accordance with.on november,same date as anspach last letter to bia blocked the bridge.the bridge was dismantled and removed in january.
although the northern portion of the leased property could be reached by a few other routes,none were reasonable means of access for mcguire farming equipment.mcguire and his haulers attempted to access the northern portion in a variety of ways,but none proved successful.mcguire subsequently tried to renegotiate the lease with the tribe,but the tribe was unwilling to lower the lease payment or decrease the amount of leased property to only include the southern portion.mcguire could not generate enough revenue to make the lease payment from the income from the southern portion alone,and defaulted on his lease in.
mcguire filed for chapter bankruptcy relief on june.on november,he filed this inverse condemnation action against the united states in bankruptcy court,seeking million in compensation the united states moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction on sovereign immunity grounds.on december,the bankruptcy court issued findings and recommendations.the court held that the tucker act,waived the government immunity to suit in district court,relying on the federal circuit decision in quality tooling united states.the court found that it should maintain jurisdiction over the action in the interests of judicial economy and not unduly burdening mcguire.finally,the court held that the proceeding was not a core proceeding and therefore it should report its findings and recommendations to the district court for action under c.on july,the district court adopted the bankruptcy court findings and recommendations and denied the united states motion to dismiss.
the district court remanded the case to bankruptcy court for trial,which was conducted on april and.following trial,the bankruptcy court issued proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law,in which the court found that the united states had committed a regulatory taking of mcguire leasehold interest and recommended an award of in fair market value of the lease on the entire property for the remaining five years of the lease.
the district court rejected the bankruptcy court recommendations.the court agreed with the bankruptcy court that the government actions could qualify as a regulatory taking,but held that mcguire claim was not ripe for review because the government never denied an application for a permit to construct a new bridge.this timely appeal followed.

the district court erred in holding that mcguire takings claim was not ripe for review because he never applied for a permit to develop a new bridge.the supreme court has held that a claim that the application of government regulations effects a taking of a property interest is not ripe until the government entity charged with implementing the regulations has reached a final decision regarding the application of the regulations to the property at issue.williamson planning comm hamilton bank,d.a court must know the nature and extent of permitted development before adjudicating the constitutionality of the regulations that purport to limit it.macdonald county of yolo,d.until a property owner obtains a final decision from the government,it is impossible to tell whether the land retains any reasonable beneficial use or whether existing expectation interests have been destroyed.macdonald,at.quoting williamson planning comm n,at.additionally,because the very existence of a permit system implies that permission may be granted,o nly when a permit is denied and the effect of the denial is to prevent economically viable use of the land in question can it be said that a taking has occurred.united states riverside bayview homes,d.
to the extent that the ripeness requirements developed in these land use development cases apply to the case at bar we hold that mcguire takings claim is ripe because he sufficiently complied with the permitting system as practiced by the bia.bia regulations in effect at the time permitted a private party to apply for a permit to build a bridge or crossing for private use at the party own expense by obtaining the approval of the.c.the bia sent three letters to mcguire prior to the removal of the bridge,all of which informed mcguire that he could apply for a permit by submitting plans,with specifications,for a new bridge and apply for a crossing permit to anspach.however,in practice,the colorado river agency of the bia did not follow a formal permitting process.at trial,anspach explained that a property owner who wants to put in a bridge typically approaches the bia and says 
we like to put a bridge here.and can you help us come up with some plans and specs or here are my proposed plans and specs.what do you think and then we have our engineers and staff look at it and go from there.
anspach testified that he had never personally received a written proposal during his tenure at the bia.
mcguire followed the prevailing practice by contacting the bia on a number of occasions during.following the instructions in the bia letters,mcguire discussed the bridge removal and plans for a new bridge several times with henry and hinkins.mcguire testified that on one occasion he drew a sketch of a design for a new bridge with hinkins.mcguire repeatedly attempted to reach anspach by phone,but never received a call back.
during this time,mcguire tried a variety of additional strategies to maintain access to the leased property he enlisted the help of the tribe,who sent two letters to the bia on mcguire behalf requesting that the bia not remove the bridge and try to work out an alternative solution he retained local counsel and filed suit against the bia in tribal court,but the bia declined to appear and he appealed anspach decision to the western regional office of the bia,which upheld anspach decision.in short,mcguire did everything reasonably within his power to prevent removal of the bridge and,when those efforts proved ineffective,to build a new one.
the government position thus amounts to the claim that the mere fact mcguire did not submit a formal application for a bridge permit renders his takings claim unripe.however,r ipeness doctrine does not require a landowner to submit applications for their own sake.palazzolo rhode island,d.here,mcguire took reasonable and necessary steps to allow the bia to exercise its full discretion in considering development plans for the property.id.at.no further purpose would have been served by filing a formal application for a bridge permit.accordingly,mcguire takings claim is ripe for review 
although mcguire suit is ripe for adjudication,the doctrine of sovereign immunity bars the district court and bankruptcy courts from hearing the merits of his takings claim.
it is well settled that the united states is a sovereign,and,as such,is immune from suit unless it has expressly waived such immunity and consented to be sued.such waiver can not be implied,but must be unequivocally expressed.where a suit has not been consented to by the united states,dismissal of the action is required because the existence of such consent is a prerequisite for jurisdiction.gilbert da grossa,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.unless mcguire satisfies the burden of establishing that its action falls within an unequivocally expressed waiver of sovereign immunity by congress,it must be dismissed.dunn black united states,cir.
whether the district court had jurisdiction over mcguire takings claim requires us to consider the two principal federal statutes authorizing suit against the united states the tucker act and the little tucker act.the tucker act provides a waiver of sovereign immunity and for jurisdiction in the court of federal claims for certain claims brought against the united states 
the united states court of federal claims shall have jurisdiction to render judgment upon any claim against the united states founded either upon the constitution,or any act of congress or any regulation of an executive department,or upon any express or implied contract with the united states,or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort.
a.the little tucker act provides a waiver of sovereign immunity and for concurrent district court jurisdiction over 
a ny civil action or claim against the united states,not exceeding in amount,founded either upon the constitution,or any act of congress,or any regulation of an executive department,or upon any express or implied contract with the united states,or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort.
a.read together,these statutes provide for jurisdiction solely in the court of federal claims for tucker act claims seeking more than in damages,and concurrent district court jurisdiction over claims seeking or less.united states hohri,d.the legislative intent in granting concurrent district court jurisdiction over claims of less than was to relieve small claimants of the expense of traveling to washington,to litigate before the court of federal claims,while large claims remained centralized at the seat of the government so that department heads would be better able to protect the government interests.moore federal practice a shaw gwatney,cir.
mcguire takings claim falls within the scope of the tucker act.a takings claim is the type of claim founded on the constitution for which the tucker act grants jurisdiction in the court of federal claims.eastern enters.apfel,d a claim for just compensation under the takings clause must be brought to the court of federal claims in the first instance,unless congress has withdrawn the tucker act grant of jurisdiction in the relevant statute.reg l rail reorganization act cases,d united states causby.if there is a taking,the claim is founded upon the constitution and within the jurisdiction of the court of claims to hear and determine.mcguire claimed in damages,well in excess of the jurisdictional amount.thus mcguire could have brought his takings claim in the court of federal claims.
but that is not the end of our inquiry,as a claim that falls under the tucker act does not necessarily have to be brought in the court of federal claims.the tucker act grant of jurisdiction to the court of federal claims is frequently referred to as exclusive,but that court jurisdiction is exclusive only to the extent that congress has not granted any other court authority to hear the claims that may be decided by the claims court.bowen massachusetts,d.c ourts have referred to the tucker act grant of exclusive jurisdiction as a shorthand way of recognizing that congress has waived sovereign immunity for authorized claims only for actions brought in the court of federal claims.doe tenet,cir,rev on other grounds,d.j urisdiction under the tucker act is not exclusive where other statutes independently confer jurisdiction and waive sovereign immunity.in re liberty,cir quoting pacificorp federal energy regulatory comm n,cir wallace,concurring.
thus,the tucker act does not preclude district court jurisdiction over mcguire takings claim,so long as there is an independent waiver of sovereign immunity and grant of federal district court jurisdiction.the statutory basis for federal district court jurisdiction in this case i
