appellant mano y m,mano appeals from the judgment of the district court holding that under mano was the initial transferee of paid by the debtor,the mortgage store,in connection with the sale of a shopping plaza.we affirm.
mano owned the raymondville plaza,a shopping plaza in raymondville,texas.in,mano was approached by representatives of george lindell lindell who offered,on lindell behalf,to buy the plaza.in,mano and lindell entered into a contract for mano to sell the plaza to lindell for million.lindell was to pay cash the remainder of the purchase price was to be covered by a mortgage.the contract obligated both parties to pay fees associated with closing.additionally,lindell was to pay of the purchase price immediately as earnest money.the contract was signed by lindell and paulrajan manoharan on behalf of mano.
the contract also assigned responsibilities to two.first,sierra title company sierra,listed as the title company in the contract,was to take possession of the earnest money after the contract was signed and distribute it to the appropriate party upon closing or cancellation of the contract.second,attorney mark freeland freeland was assigned responsibilities related to the closing.freeland was to receive the purchase money,distribute that money according to the contract,record the deed and closing documents,and distribute documents and copies according to the parties instructions.prior to and after the execution of the contract,freeland apparently served as mano attorney on other matters.however,under the contract freeland was entitled to payment from both mano and lindell.
the contract provided for a day inspection period following its effective date,defined as the date of the last of the signatures by seller and buyer and title company.during this period,lindell had the right to terminate the contract for any reason,but after the day period expired,lindell was contractually obligated to purchase the property from mano.the contract itself was not dated,but the district court concluded that the contract effective date was no later than december,because that was the date on which freeland sent the signed contract and the earnest money to sierra.in re the mortg.store,civ.jms,wl,at.thus,based on the contract and its effective date,the inspection period was to end no later than january.
lindell did not terminate the contract during the inspection period.on january,a few days after the end of the inspection period,mano,lindell,and freeland executed a settlement statement to close the contract.several other documents were also executed on january.paulrajan manoharan,on behalf of mano,signed a special warranty deed granting the property to lindell.lindell executed an assignment of rents and a promissory note for million to mano,and a deed of trust to freeland as trustee.additionally,yalini manoharan,paulrajan manoharan wife,signed the deed on behalf of mano the following day.
on january,the mortgage store wired to freeland in satisfaction of lindell obligations under the contract.freeland deposited the money in a trust account he held with compass bank.the parties dispute who was entitled to receive this money under the settlement agreement.mano contends that of the transfer was intended to cover closing costs lindell owed to entities other than mano,including the mosley insurance agency,sierra,and freeland.appellees contend that because lindell owed mano under the contract at the time of the transfer,and the transfer was for,the maximum amount of the transfer that could have been intended for recipients other than mano was.on january,freeland disbursed the money paid by the mortgage store pursuant to the contract.
lindell had a longstanding relationship with the mortgage store.lindell was the sole shareholder and president of the mortgage store from to.in,lindell transferred ownership and management to his daughter,but he retained control over the mortgage store finances.on the other hand,mano contends that it had no contact with the mortgage store before december.
in november,the mortgage store filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter.after an audit,it became clear that the mortgage store was operating a ponzi scheme.the trustee,dane field,commenced this action in december,alleging that the mortgage store transfer in connection with the plaza transaction was fraudulent under b,a,and.a,and seeking to avoid the transfer and recoup the funds from mano.on the trustee motion for summary judgment,the bankruptcy court held that the transfer was fraudulent it later determined that mano was the initial transferee,rather than a subsequent transferee.mano appealed to the district court for the district of hawaii,which affirmed that mano was an initial transferee,and refused to consider mano alternative argument that it should not be held responsible for the entire amount because mano waived the argument by not raising it in the bankruptcy court.in re the mortg.store,wl at.mano now appeals the district court judgment to this court.
we review the district court decision on an appeal from the bankruptcy court de novo.feder lazar in re lazar,cir.we apply the same standard of review to the bankruptcy court findings as did the district court.id.findings of fact are reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard of review and legal conclusions are reviewed de novo.id.because this dispute was decided on summary judgment,we must determine whether viewing all evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.whitman mineta,cir.
we first address mano argument that it was not the initial transferee under.pursuant to a,the trustee of an entity in bankruptcy may avoid certain transfers made by the debtor from the initial transferee of such transfer or the entity for whose benefit such transfer was made.under a,t he trustee right to recover from an initial transferee is absolute.schafer las vegas hilton in re video depot,cir.a trustee may recover from a subsequent transferee that is,any transferee not an initial transferee but the subsequent transferee will be allowed to assert affirmative defenses that,if successful,will prevent recovery.b see danning miller in re bullion reserve of am,cir.whether the transfer was avoidable and whether mano affirmative defenses would succeed are not at issue in this appeal.rather,we must determine only whether mano was the initial or a subsequent transferee of the funds remitted by the mortgage store as partial payment for the plaza sale.
section a does not define the term initial transferee.in the absence of a statutory definition,we apply the dominion test to determine whether a party is the initial transferee.universal serv.admin.post confirmation comm.of unsecured creditors of incomnet commc in re incomnet,cir.under the dominion test,a transferee is one who has dominion over the money or other asset,the right to put the money to one own purposes.id.at cir quoting abele modern fin.plans,in re cohen,cir internal quotation marks omitted.key in the dominion test is whether the recipient of funds has legal title to them and whether the recipient has the ability to use the funds as he sees fit.id.at.as the seventh circuit explained in the case bonded financial services,european american bank,an individual will have dominion over a transfer if,for example,he is free to invest the whole amount in lottery tickets or uranium stocks,cir see in re incomnet,at characterizing bonded fin.serv.as the leading case in this area.the first party to establish dominion over the funds after they leave the transferor is the initial transferee other transferees are subsequent transferees.see in re cohen,at in re bullion reserve,at.
mano does not dispute that the dominion test is the proper method for determining the initial transferee,but,relying on mccarty richard james,in re presidential,cir,it argues that a party should be deemed the initial transferee when another party receives and distributes funds on its behalf.
