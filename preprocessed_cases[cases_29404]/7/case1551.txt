david and sharon welsh filed a chapter bankruptcy petition in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of montana.the trustee objected to the welshes proposed plan on the ground that it was not proposed in good faith.the bankruptcy court overruled the objection,and the trustee appealed to the bankruptcy appellate panel for the ninth circuit bap.a divided panel of the bap affirmed the decision of the bankruptcy court.again the trustee appealed,and we now affirm.
background 
the welshes filed a voluntary chapter petition on may.their required schedules revealed the following assets a home in missoula,montana,valued at,encumbered by a secured claim of a ford f valued at,encumbered by a secured claim of a subaru outback valued at of,encumbered by a secured claim of a toyota matrix valued at,encumbered by a secured claim of a airstream trailer valued at,encumbered by a secured claim of and two honda atvs each valued at,encumbered by secured claims of and.in addition to their secured debts,the schedules revealed unsecured claims totaling approximately,the largest of which were their daughter student loan debt in the amount of and a joint debt owed to bank of america on a line of credit in the amount of.
welsh is employed as a nurse and reported on schedule i a monthly income of.she also draws a pension of per month.welsh is retired,but listed a monthly income of from wages,salary and commissions,as well as social security income in the amount of l.
because their income exceeds the median for the state of montana,the debtors calculated their disposable income according to the means test.on form they listed their current monthly income as their current monthly income did not include welsh social security income of because social security income is excluded from the current monthly income calculation after deducting future payments on secured claims,the debtors were left with a disposable income of per month 
the welshes proposed a plan that provided for payments of per month to unsecured creditors for the first thirty months of the plan.after their vehicle loans were paid,the payments would increase to per month for the last thirty months of the plan.the proposed plan would pay off approximately of the debtors unsecured debt.
the trustee objected on the ground that the debtors had not proposed their plan in good faith,a requirement for confirming the plan under a,because of the minuscule payments to unsecured claims while they were living in a home,making payments on various luxury and unnecessary items and failing to commit one hundred percent of their disposable income to the plan 
in its decision,the bankruptcy court noted that it reviews the totality of the circumstances to determine whether a plan has been proposed in good faith.the bankruptcy court observed that,in leavitt soto in re leavitt,cir,we had looked to four factors to determine whether a plan had been proposed in good faith whether debtors misrepresented facts in their plan or unfairly manipulated the bankruptcy code,the debtors history of filings and dismissals,whether the debtors intended to defeat state court litigation,and whether egregious behavior is present.the bankruptcy court observed that there was no evidence of the first three factors and that the case before it was distinguishable from those in which it had found egregious behavior.
egregious behavior supporting a finding of bad faith in in re opper,consisted of debtors proposing to unsecured creditors while making payments to secured creditors to retain luxury items such as a boat and snowmobile,repaying a loan to a k plan,and failure to list assets.opper.at.
the facts shown by the record in the instant case are not comparable to opper.debtors plan proposes in payments to unsecured creditors.their atv sic are not a luxury,since at least one is required for sharon to plow her driveway in the winter in order to reach her home.david is the owner of the toyota,on which they make payments but let their daughter use,and the secured creditor filed a claim in this case which has been allowed without objection showing david is the borrower.their retention of the airstream,by itself,is not enough to find egregious conduct.
the court also believed that the trustee good faith objection ignore d the fact that payments to secured claims are authorized in the means test at b a i and iii.payments to secured creditors,the bankruptcy court continued,would run afoul of precedent which held that where a debtor is current on a secured obligation that is provided for in form,the court refrains from determining whether the expense is reasonable.
the bankruptcy court also rejected the trustee argument that the plan was not proposed in good faith because it failed to utilize any of welsh social security income.the bankruptcy court observed that a protects social security income from the operation of any bankruptcy or insolvency law according to the bankruptcy court,considering social security income in the good faith analysis would water down this protection.moreover,the fact that social security income was excluded from the definition of current monthly income under the means test reinforced this conclusion.therefore,the welshes ha d satisfied their burden of proof to show that they proposed their plan in good faith.
a divided panel of the bap affirmed the bankruptcy court judgment.the bap framed the issue accordingly 
the issue is whether,in determining whether a debtor has filed a chapter plan in good faith,the court may take into consideration the debtors failure to include income for plan payments that the code specifically excludes from current monthly income,and the debtors deduction of expenses that are expressly allowed by the code in calculating disposable income.in other words,if the debtor has properly calculated projected disposable income and so meets the minimum payment amount under b b,can items used in that calculation be the basis for a finding that the plan was not proposed in good faith.
in answering this question,the bap noted that t he bankruptcy code does not define good faith.the bap further observed,however,that,in goeb heid in re goeb,cir,we had determined that t he good faith inquiry was dependent on whether the debtors had acted equitably in proposing their chapter plan,which,in turn,depended on whether the debtor has misrepresented facts in his plan,unfairly manipulated the bankruptcy code,or otherwise proposed his chapter plan in an inequitable manner.although the substantiality of the proposed repayment was one consideration,ultimately the good faith determination must take into account all militating factors.
the bap noted that amendments to the bankruptcy code in and had not changed the requirement that a plan be proposed in good faith.nevertheless,congress had enacted specific substantive requirements for plan confirmation that addressed considerations which previously had been encompassed by the good faith inquiry.therefore,in the bap view,courts no longer needed to consider whether particular types of income were available to pay creditors and whether proposed payments to creditors were sufficient because congress explicitly had defined disposable income and required that disposable income be used for the satisfaction of creditors.therefore,according to the bap 
t aking advantage of a provision of the code,such as calculating disposable income under the test explicitly set out in the code,is not an indication of lack of good faith.thus,we reject those cases that allow a court to take into consideration an debtor exclusion of income or deduction of expenses that are allowed by the means test formula in determining whether a debtor has proposed the plan in good faith.
section a still plays a role,and the court must take into consideration the totality of the circumstances,based on the factors the ninth circuit has articulated for determining good faith.if,in proposing a plan,the debtor has misrepresented facts,unfairly manipulated the code,or engaged in egregious behavior,a court may find that the plan was not proposed in good faith.that finding may not,however,be based on the mere fact that the debtor has excluded income or deducted expenses that the code allows.
the bap then observed that t he same analysis applie d to consideration of a debtor exclusion of social security income in calculating disposable income.the bap observed that,not only is social security income specifically excluded from the disposable income calculation for chapter debtors,but also contains an explicit prohibition that social security income not be subject to the operation of any bankruptcy or insolvency law.the bap concluded that the debtors exclusion of social security income from the disposable income calculation,therefore,is not,by itself,probative of a lack of good faith,and it 
reject ed the reasoning of the cases that say that,because social security payments are intended to provide for a recipient basic needs,a debtor must use the benefit payments to provide for those basic needs,thereby freeing up other,income,for plan payments,in re hall.this approach simply does by indirection what the code says can not be done,which is to include social security benefit payments in a debtor disposable income calculation.
the bap therefore affirmed the bankruptcy court order confirming the welshes plan.
judge pappas dissented.he believed that the bankruptcy court did not engage in the sort of unfettered totality of the circumstances review mandated by in re goeb.instead,the bankruptcy court applied a totality of the circumstances test,and decided it should not consider two highly relevant factors about debtors plan.that was error.judge pappas first opined that it was not violative of the social security prohibition to consider those payments in the good faith analysis.he observed that 
the fact that a debtor receives social security income is considered all the time,for many different purposes,in chapter cases.for example,a debtor monthly social security payments can provide the basis for a bankruptcy court to find that a debtor has regular income to be eligible for chapter relief in the first place.
moreover,w hile a debtor projected disposable income as calculated under b sets a floor for chapter plan payments,these calculations do not constitute a safe harbor,nor dictate whether a debtor could comfortably be paying more to creditors in a particular case.judge pappas therefore concluded 
like the many other bankruptcy courts that have done so,this panel should hold that social security income is a relevant factor for the bankruptcy court to consider in evaluating a debtor good faith under a sic a.if congress wanted bankruptcy courts to exclude consideration of social security benefits under a,it could have easily done so expressly,as it did in.it did not,and we should not strain to imply that restriction in reading other,inapplicable statutes.in this case,when the bankruptcy court held that it was constrained from considering debtor social security payments,it erred.
judge pappas also took issue with the bankruptcy court conclusion that it could not consider payments made to secured creditors in the good faith calculus.according to judge pappas,that current payments to secured creditors are deducted in a b b means test analysis is not reason enough for the bankruptcy court to decline to exercise its conscience in deciding whether,in proposing large plan payments on unnecessary secured debts,the plan treats debtors other creditors equitably.here,explained judge pappas,
debtors should reasonably be expected to propose a chapter plan that retains,and pays the debts secured by,their home and necessary vehicles.but there is nothing in the record to demonstrate that debtors needed,or that they should pay the debts for,a car their nonresident,drives,two atvs,or an airstream travel trailer.
judge pappas concluded 
while it may be an amorphous,somewhat subjective standard,at bottom,a is designed to prevent confirmation of inequitable plans.a bankruptcy court simply can not decide if a plan is proposed in good faith if it declines to consider either that a debtor receives social security income,or the nature,amount and reasonableness of the debtor proposed payments to secured creditors through a plan.because the bankruptcy court refused to consider such highly relevant facts as part of the totality of the circumstances in debtors case,it applied an incorrect legal analysis in examining debtors good faith,and abused its discretion in confirming debtors plan.the principles of fairness embodied in a require that we vacate the order confirming the plan and remand to the bankruptcy court to perform a proper good faith analysis of debtors plan.
discussion 
in this appeal,the trustee renews the arguments made to the bankruptcy court and to the bap.specifically,he maintains that,in determining whether the welshes proposed their chapter plan in good faith,the bankruptcy court should have considered the amount that the welshes were paying to secured creditors for luxury items and also should have considered welsh social security income whether the bap applied the correct legal standard in determining good faith is a question of law that we review de novo 
a.the history of the good faith requirement 
we begin our consideration of the good faith requirement with the statutory language and the interpretation of that language over the years.the good faith requirement of,which has been a part of the bankruptcy code since its enactment in,provides 
confirmation of plan 
a except as provided in subsection b,the court shall confirm a plan if 
the plan complies with the provisions of this chapter and with the other applicable provisions of this title 
any fee,charge,or amount required under chapter of title,or by the plan,to be paid before confirmation,has been paid 
the plan has been proposed in good faith and not by any means forbidden by law 
the value,as of the effective date of the plan,of property to be distributed under the plan on account of each allowed unsecured claim is not less than the amount that would be paid on such claim if the estate of the debtor were liquidated under chapter of this title on such date 
a emphasis added.shortly after its enactment,we considered the meaning of the good faith requirement in in re goeb.in that case,the debtors had proposed a plan that provided payments to unsecured creditors at a rate of one cent on the dollar.the bankruptcy court found that the debtors had not intend ed to substantially repay their unsecured debts,and,therefore,the plan was not proposed in good faith on appeal,we observed that congress had not defined good faith,and,a bsent some compelling reason for doing so,we were hesitant to infer an inflexible,blanket rule that required substantial repayment to unsecured creditors in all cases congress,we noted,had set forth a minimum repayment level and t he presence of an explicit statutory standard strongly suggests that congress did not intend to substitute a more rigorous standard when it imposed a general requirement.moreover,congress was aware that courts had come to different conclusions on the question whether substantial repayment was required.we therefore 
decline d to impose a requirement because it is contrary to the language of the statute,whether it would best further the purposes of the bankruptcy code is uncertain,and congress is aware of the perceived deficiency in a.rather than set a rigid standard under the guise of interpreting good faith,we deem ed it advisable to apply the law as written and wait for congress to create,if it chooses,further conditions for the confirmation of chapter plans.
we then focused on the task of defining good faith.in doing so,we were impeded not only by it s being an ambiguous term that resists precise definition in any case,but also by the lack of authoritative guidance on its meaning in a.we f ou nd instructive the supreme court discussion of good faith in american united mutual life insurance city of avon park,in which the court had focused on e quity and good conscience in finding that the acceptance of a bankruptcy plan had not been made in good faith.following that lead,we concluded that the proper inquiry is whether the goebs acted equitably in proposing their chapter plan
