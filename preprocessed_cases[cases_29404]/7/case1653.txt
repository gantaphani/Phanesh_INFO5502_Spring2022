introduction 
sigma micro corporation sigma appeals from a grant of summary judgment in favor of the responsible individual for a group of consolidated debtors avoiding several payments made to sigma.sigma asserts that the bankruptcy court who issued the summary judgment lacked the jurisdiction to do so and even if jurisdiction was proper,summary judgment should not have been granted.we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand.
background 
on january,sigma entered into a binding license agreement the agreement with l h vitamins,l h.the basic terms of the agreement called for sigma to provide l h with critical hardware and software,as well as routine maintenance and support services.in turn,the agreement obligated l h to pay sigma a set fee for the hardware and software,as well as ongoing fees for its maintenance and support services.sigma was to bill l h by invoice and l h was to pay sigma as soon as the relevant invoice was received,otherwise an interest charge would apply.
in addition to these basic terms,sigma and l h also agreed all rights and obligations under the agreement would be binding not only on l h,but also on each of its affiliates.at the time of the agreement,l h was part of a vast network of companies who together provided online and content to consumers the network.the network was managed by the healthcentral,and further included,llc,j m direct corporation,hcen acquisition,healthcentral enterprise web services,and.
once their agreement was in place,sigma and l h maintained an ordinary relationship for the next several years.sigma would send l h invoices for its maintenance and support services.and healthcentral would send sigma a payment on l h behalf,anywhere from to days after the invoice was received.according to the evidence,this pattern was completely ordinary for the industry at the time.
starting in however,l h,as well as the other network companies,started to experience financial problems.in particular,problems arose over the network available and ability to secure additional funding.as such,by,healthcentral instituted an old school management system,whereby core staff would meet in person on a weekly basis to discuss which creditors were to be paid.the meetings were attended by healthcentral controller,or assistant controller,accounts payable team,vice president of finance,and vice president of merchandising.from these meetings a list of preferred creditors was produced and given to healthcentral president,who ultimately decided which creditors to pay.
one of the creditors who continued to be paid during this period was sigma.healthcentral core staff determined sigma maintenance and support services were critical to keeping l h software running,and l h software was essential to its business.accordingly,despite a serious period of financial difficulty,healthcentral still made three payments to sigma,including an august,payment in the amount of for invoices dated may,an august,payment in the amount of for invoices dated may and june,and a september,payment in the amount of for invoices dated july,july,august,and august.
less than a month after the last payment,however,l h,as well each of the other network companies,filed voluntary petitions for chapter bankruptcy in the bankruptcy court for the northern district of california.the network companies submitted a proposed plan for reorganization and liquidation,which was ultimately approved by the court on june.pursuant to the plan,l h was substantively consolidated with all other network companies into a single liquidating debtor the debtor,and all the debtor available funds were then transferred into a single claims account.john barnard barnard was appointed responsible individual for the debtor and instructed to pursue any and all actions on behalf of the debtor.
proceedings below 
on february,barnard brought an action to avoid and recover certain payments made to sigma as preferences under b.barnard brought his action in the bankruptcy court for the northern district of california,as all civil actions arising under title were automatically referred there by the district court.local fed.a see b stating bankruptcy courts possess jurisdiction over all cases arising under title which were referred by the district court.in his action barnard sought to avoid and recover the august,august,and september payments,claiming each was preferentially made to sigma during a period of severe financial distress.b.the total amount of these payments,barnard alleged,was.the action against sigma was only one of approximately preference actions brought by barnard under b against various creditors.
in response to the action,sigma filed an answer and demand for a jury trial.sigma answered that none of the debtor payments constituted preferences under b,and furthermore,the payments were made in the ordinary course of business and thus not recoverable under c.as to the jury trial,sigma stated it would not consent to a trial in the bankruptcy court,and therefore jurisdiction was no longer proper there.instead,sigma demanded the action be transferred to the district court for further proceedings.
thereafter,on august,sigma filed a motion for certification to the district court.in this motion sigma argued once more the bankruptcy court was not permitted to maintain jurisdiction over the action and it needed to be certified to the district court.sigma rationale was twofold.
first,sigma pointed to local rule b,which states 
if the bankruptcy judge determines that a demand was timely made and the party has a right to a jury trial,and if all parties have not filed written consent to a jury trial before the bankruptcy judge,the bankruptcy judge shall certify to the district court that the proceeding is to be tried by a jury and that the parties have not consented to a jury trial in the bankruptcy court.upon such certification,the jurisdictional reference of the proceeding shall be automatically withdrawn,and the proceeding assigned to a judge of the district 
according to sigma,all of the requirements of local rule b had been satisfied,and thus the jurisdictional reference to the bankruptcy court,local rule a,had to be withdrawn and the action transferred to the district court.
second,aside from local rule b,sigma pointed to its valid right to a seventh amendment jury trial in the district court.according to sigma,it had been held that once a valid jury trial right was found,the bankruptcy court could no longer maintain jurisdiction and the entire action needed to be instantly transferred to the district court.in support of its position sigma cited in re granfinanciera,nordberg,d.
following sigma motion for certification the debtor filed an opposition arguing jurisdiction was proper in the bankruptcy court and that a transfer was not required.the debtor conceded jurisdiction was exclusively vested in the district court for trial,but that did not mean the bankruptcy court could not retain jurisdiction.instead,the debtor explained,foregoing jurisdiction and transferring the action to district court was a matter of discretion to be guided by judicial economy.under this standard,it was often the case,as it was here,that a bankruptcy court familiarity with the present action,as well as related cases,presented real economic reasons to retain the action.accordingly,sigma motion for certification could and should be denied.
on july,the bankruptcy court issued an order on the motion for certification to the district court.the court order struck a balance between the positions of sigma and the debtor.on one hand,the court certified the action to district court,finding that sigma had satisfied all of the requirements of local rule b.on the other hand,the court stayed the effective date of the certification so that the court could retain jurisdiction over all proceedings.accordingly,the action stayed in the bankruptcy court.
with the proper court determined,the debtor turned to filing a motion for summary judgment.the motion was based on two arguments.
first,the debtor asserted there was no genuine dispute that three preference payments had been made to sigma under b.on august,august,and september,the debtor issued payments from its own accounts to sigma,a creditor,to account for previously rendered maintenance and support services.b.the payments were sent to sigma within days of the debtor filing for chapter bankruptcy,a period of severe financial distress.b,a.and the payments,which paid percent of the submitted invoices,allowed sigma to recover more than it would have had the payments been made in a chapter liquidation.b.
second,the debtor asserted that sigma had not shown it possessed an ordinary course of business defense under c.in light of its and funding problems the debtor instituted an unusual cash management system,whereby the debtor core staff met weekly to determine which creditors would be paid.that sigma was preferred over other creditors and paid as a result of this unusual management system was anything but ordinary for the debtor or the debtor industry.c b,c.
to support its motion the debtor offered three pieces of evidence,including duplicate copies of the august,august,and september payments,as well as the relevant invoices a full and complete copy of the agreement and a declaration by rita schilling schilling,healthcentral controller,who provided all of the background surrounding the august,august and september payments.
a month later sigma filed an opposition to the motion for summary judgment.sigma opposition was also based on two arguments.
first,sigma asserted the debtor had not met its burden of showing preference payments under b.according to sigma,the schilling declaration,which provided all of the facts used by the debtor to prove its b action,was riddled with evidentiary problems and thus could not be considered.without this declaration the debtor had clearly not shown that the august,august,and september payments were preferences.
second,sigma asserted that it had shown that it possessed an ordinary course of business defense under c.the debtor payments accounted for past maintenance and support services provided by sigma in the ordinary course of business.c a.and the payments were made within an ordinary time frame,and in an ordinary manner,even if they came out of an cash management system.c b,c.
to support its opposition,sigma offered a single piece of evidence a declaration by theresa backof backof,a credit executive certified by the national association of credit management nacm with years of credit and payment experience.after reviewing all the evidence,including nacm data,backof made findings,which included that in her opinion the payment in the ordinary course of business between the debtor and sigma,as established by their course of dealings over a period,was a range of to days that i nformation obtained from nacm show ed that,on an basis,payments of invoices,for the period june of through october of,ranged from to days from the billing date.and that t his data reflect ed the payment history of all customers of all reporting companies,t hus making payment in the ordinary course of business in the industry as a range of to days that the august,august,and september payments paid invoices anywhere from to days after the billing date and that the debtor a ccounts payable meetings were somewhat old school as businesses now move forward with the use of software for cash management but that the concept was the same.
on november,after considering all the evidence and holding a hearing,the court granted summary judgment in favor of the debtor.first,the court held the debtor had shown through the schilling declaration that the august,august,and september payments constituted preferences under b.furthermore,none of the evidentiary objections lodged against the schilling declaration had any merit.second,the court held sigma had not shown through the backof declaration that the august,august,or september payments were made in the ordinary course of business under c.the backof declaration had not established that the debtor old school management system for paying creditors was ordinary for the parties or for the industry.as such,judgment was entered as a matter of law in favor of the debtor in the amount of.
from there sigma filed a timely appeal,which was heard by the united states bankruptcy appellate panel of the ninth circuit bap.sigma appeal raised two issues whether the bankruptcy court erred in retaining jurisdiction over the action in light of local rule b and sigma valid right to a seventh amendment jury trial in the district court and whether the bankruptcy court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the debtor on its preference action under b and sigma ordinary course of business defense under c.the bap affirmed.
thereafter,on october,sigma filed a timely notice of appeal to this court.

discussion 
jurisdiction 
at the outset we address sigma argument concerning the bankruptcy court jurisdiction.sigma concedes jurisdiction was initially proper in the bankruptcy court,pursuant to b and local rule a,but claims the court was not permitted to retain jurisdiction over the action for pretrial proceedings.to support its argument sigma yet again points to local rule b and its valid right to a seventh amendment jury trial.we address each below and hold the bankruptcy court did not err in retaining jurisdiction over the action for proceedings.
local rule b 
as noted above sigma first finds support for its jurisdictional argument in local rule b.according to sigma,under local rule b if a party has a right to a jury trial in the district court,makes a timely demand for jury trial in the district court,and has not consent ed to a jury trial elsewhere,the bankruptcy court must automatically withdraw the district court jurisdictional reference.see dunmore united states,cir.
under sigma construction of local rule b we are confronted with an issue of first impression in this circuit,that is,the validity of local rule b.
the rules associated with local bankruptcy rules are clear.as part of the bankruptcy code congress delegated to the supreme court the power to make and enforce general bankruptcy rules.pursuant to this authority,the supreme court promulgated federal rule of bankruptcy procedure rule,which grants district courts the power to adopt their own local rules.brown smith in re poole,cir.under rule,however,this power is strictly limited.collier on bankruptcy,ed.rule states a local bankruptcy rule must be consistent with the acts of congress and federal rules of bankruptcy procedure not be duplicative of the acts of congress or federal rules of bankruptcy procedure and not limit the use of official bankruptcy forms.steinacher rojas in re steinacher,if any of these limits are not observed,the local bankruptcy rule must be held invalid.
considering these rules we hold local rule b to be invalid as it establishes a procedure for withdrawing the district court jurisdictional reference inconsistent with the acts of congress and federal rules of bankruptcy procedure.coffey marina management servs.in re kool,mann,coffee,cir finding local rule invalid because of inconsistency with bankruptcy code in re morrissey,cir same.
congress set forth the procedure for withdrawing a jurisdictional reference under the bankruptcy code in d.this act states 
a district court may withdraw,in whole or in part,any case or proceeding referred under this section,on its own motion or on timely motion of any party,for cause shown.the district court shall,on timely motion of a party,so withdraw a proceeding if the court determines that resolution of the proceeding requires consideration of both title and other laws of the united states regulating organizations or activities affecting interstate commerce.
id.d emphasis added accord collier on bankruptcy,ed.d provides the authority to withdraw the reference of the case or proceeding.
in keeping with this procedure,the supreme court promulgated federal rule of bankruptcy procedure a,which states in its entirety 
a motion for withdrawal of a case or proceeding shall be heard by a district judge.
id.emphasis added see also id.advisory committee note a makes it clear that the bankruptcy judge will not conduct hearings on a withdrawal motion.the withdrawal decision is committed exclusively to the district court.
by contrast,local rule b establishes a very different procedure for withdrawing the district court jurisdictional reference.under this rule 
if a bankruptcy judge determines that a demand was timely made and the party has a right to a jury trial,and if all parties have not filed written consent to a jury trial before the bankruptcy judge,the bankruptcy judge shall certify to the district court that the proceeding is to be tried by a jury and that the parties have not consented to a jury trial in the bankruptcy court.upon such certification,the reference of the proceeding shall be automatically withdrawn,and the proceeding assigned to a judge of the district court 
local fed.b emphasis added.
after careful review we find the procedure established by local rule b can not be squared with the procedure established by d,an act of congress,and rule a,a federal rule of bankruptcy procedure.fed.at least two inconsistencies bear mentioning.first,local rule b allows for the bankruptcy court to withdraw the jurisdictional reference,whereas d and rule a make it explicit that only a district court may withdraw the jurisdictional reference.see ftc first alliance mortg.in re first alliance mortg,holding that a motion to withdrawal is heard by the district court emphasis added.second,local rule b permits a party to obtain a withdrawal of the reference upon a motion for certification,while d and rule a make it clear that a party may only obtain a withdrawal of the reference upon a motion for withdrawal.see hawaiian airlines,mesa air group,holding that a litigant who believes that a certain action or portion of a action pending in the bankruptcy court should be litigated in the district court may make a motion to withdraw the reference emphasis added.
we find no error then in the bankruptcy court decision not to adhere to this invalid rule and withdraw the reference,but instead to retain jurisdiction over the debtor action for all proceedings 
moreover,sigma citation notwithstanding,we can discern nothing in dunmore united states,the only other case to address local rule b,which requires a different result.at.dunmore was limited to discussing the basic procedure established by rule b.see id.in other words,in that case we merely stated that if a party has a right to a jury trial in the district court,makes a timely demand for a jury trial in the district court,and refuses to consent to a jury trial elsewhere,local rule b requires the bankruptcy court to automatic ally certif y the withdrawal of the district court reference for cause shown and sen d the case back to the district court.id.
dunmore,however,is simply unavailing to the issue we confront here whether the procedure set forth in local rule b is valid.this issue has never been addressed.see dunmore,at.accordingly,while dunmore may be relevant for determining what procedure local rule b sets forth,it is irrelevant for determining whether local rule b procedure is valid.
seventh amendment jury trial right 
in addition to local rule b sigma also seeks support for its jurisdictional argument by pointing to its right to a seventh amendment jury trial in the district court.sigma argues it is has been held that once a jury right is found,the bankruptcy court may no longer maintain jurisdiction and the action must be instantly transferred to an article iii court.sigma specifically claims this was the holding of granfinanciera,nordberg,d,one of the court preeminent bankruptcy cases.
we agree with sigma that it is entitled to a seventh amendment jury trial in the district court.growe bilodard.we disagree,however,that granfinanciera holds that in light of this jury trial right the bankruptcy court may no longer retain jurisdiction,and the action must be instantly transferred to an article iii court.see at.
granfinanciera involved a debtor action under of the bankruptcy code to recover certain allegedly fraudulent transfers made to two creditors.at.in response to the action the creditors requested a trial by jury.id.at.the bankruptcy court,however,denied the creditors request and held a bench trial,which resulted in a judgment for the debtor.id.the creditors filed an appeal and the supreme court granted certiorari sole ly to decide whether the creditors had been entitled to a jury trial under the seventh amendment.id.at.after a lengthy discussion,the court held,these creditors,who had filed no claim of their own,had been entitled to a seventh amendment jury trial.id.at.we hold the seventh amendment entitles petitioners to the jury trial they requested.
that the creditors had been entitl ed to a jury trial under the seventh amendment,however,was the exclusive holding of granfinanciera.id.at.in fact,the granfinanciera court explicitly stated it would hold no more.id.at.we are not obliged to decide today anything more than whether the seventh amendment confers on petitioners a right to a jury trial.granfinanciera does not support sigma argument that once a jury right is found the bankruptcy court must instantly give up jurisdiction and the case must be transferred to an article iii court.see id.at.stating no view as to whether action may remain in bankruptcy in light of seventh amendment right to a jury trial.
instead,we find sigma argument to this effect is an open issue,and one of novel impression in this circuit,city fire equip,ansul fire prot.wormald,en banc finding that granfinanciera did not settle whether a bankruptcy court could retain jurisdiction if there was a jury right and thus it was a novel issue.
for guidance on how to address sigma argument we have canvassed the numerous courts outside this circuit who have already addressed the issue.see,in re stansbury poplar place,cir orion pictures showtime networks in re orion pictures,cir king fidelity bank,cir growe bilodard,plan adm r lone star rv sales,in re conseco fin,travelers cas.sur.skinner engine in re am.capital,llc,hayes royala,wittes interco,in re douglas.
universally these courts have all reached the same holding,that is,a seventh amendment jury trial right does not mean the bankruptcy court must instantly give up jurisdiction and that the case must be transferred to the district court,city fire equip,at.instead,the bankruptcy court is permitted to retain jurisdiction over the action for matters,in re stansbury place,at.as these courts have explained,two rationales justify this holding.
first,allowing the bankruptcy court to retain jurisdiction over matters,does not abridge a party seventh amendment right to a jury trial.see city fire equip,at accord jobin kloepfer in re m l bus.mach,stein miller.a bankruptcy court management will likely include matters of discovery,conferences,and routine motions,which obviously do not diminish a party right to a jury trial.see in re m l bus.mach,at.moreover,even if a bankruptcy court were to rule on a dispositive motion,it would not affect a party seventh amendment right to a jury trial,as these motions merely address whether trial is necessary at all.see diamond door lumber,cir s ummary judgment is granted as a matter of law where there is no genuine issue of material fact,and,therefore,the province of the jury,fact finding,is not invaded.emphasis in original city fire.equip,at while motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment may be dispositive,they do not impact on the right to a jury trial.they merely involve legal issues as to wheth
