opinion of the court 
this appeal by howard allen feldman turns on the meaning of loss under the united states sentencing guidelines and the victim witness protection act as amended by the mandatory victims restitution act.feldman filed a bankruptcy petition in which he vastly understated the amount of property he owned.indicted for concealing assets and making false declarations in bankruptcy,he pled guilty and was sentenced to fifteen months imprisonment and ordered to pay restitution to his creditors.feldman contests the district court determination of the amount of loss,which affected both the prison sentence he received under the sentencing guidelines a defendant base offense level will be increased incrementally for the loss cause by his crime and the amount of restitution he was ordered to pay to his creditors.
feldman contends that there was little if any actual loss that resulted from his crime and that the district court erred in its calculation that his creditors lost over,and were entitled to restitution in that amount.he submits that most of the property he failed to report was held by him and his wife as tenants by the entireties under pennsylvania law,making the property unavailable for execution by his creditors to satisfy the debt owed by feldman alone.see and stating that restitution is limited to the amount of loss actually caused by the defendant crime.in other words,feldman claims that although he committed a crime he acknowledges that he was obligated to report the property,his crime had no effect on the amount of money his creditors ultimately received from the bankruptcy discharge.
the district court did not determine whether or not the property owned by feldman and his wife as tenants by the entireties would have been exempt from bankruptcy,reasoning instead that feldman lost the right to claim the exemption when he failed to disclose the property.the court then concluded that the actual loss to feldman creditors was the difference between what was owed to them and what they actually received in the bankruptcy discharge.the court based this conclusion on case law suggesting that bankruptcy courts can refuse to allow an exemption for property that the debtor initially concealed.
without getting into the merits of whether property exempt from bankruptcy because it is held as tenants by the entireties can ever be distributed to the creditors unique to one spouse,we conclude that the district court reasoning was flawed.in our view,the loss of an exemption during a bankruptcy proceeding does not impact upon the determination of actual loss for restitution or sentencing purposes since the bankruptcy court,unlike the district court here,is not calculating the harm caused by the defendant crime.
the determination of actual loss is relevant to the sentencing enhancement,since loss under the sentencing guidelines is the greater of the actual loss caused by the defendant illegal actions or the amount of loss the defendant intended to cause.see application note i f an intended loss that the defendant was attempting to inflict can be determined,this figure will be used if it is greater than the actual loss.united states yeaman,cir.under our jurisprudence,even if the district court erred in determining actual loss,we must still affirm the sentence if the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that feldman intended to cause a loss greater than the actual loss,even if it was impossible for that loss to have actually occurred.
feldman claims that the government failed to show that he intended to cause a loss to his creditors rather,he maintains that he thought the property he concealed was exempt from bankruptcy and he did not disclose it because he thought the large amount of property would raise a red flag and delay the bankruptcy proceeding.feldman also submits that he never intended his creditors to receive less money by failing to disclose all of his property,since by reason of the exemption they would not be able to reach the concealed assets.however,we do not believe that the government was obligated to disprove feldman claim that he thought the property was exempt.while the government must prove feldman intent by a preponderance of the evidence,we conclude that intent can be inferred from the fact that feldman concealed a large amount of property.it is enough that the district court found unbelievable feldman claim that he simply wanted to expedite the bankruptcy process.thus,while the district court may have erred in its discussion of actual loss,that error is irrelevant for sentencing purposes since the district court did not abuse its discretion by determining that feldman intended to cause a loss of the entire amount of debt owned.accordingly,the increase in feldman base offense level,while not justified by a finding of actual loss,is justified by a finding of intended loss hence we will affirm the sentence imposed.
in contrast,a restitution award can only be based upon actual loss.since the district court erred in its determination of actual loss,we will vacate the restitution award and remand for further proceedings,so that the district court can compute actual loss based on the difference between what feldman creditors would have received if feldman had acted lawfully and disclosed all of his assets and the amount they actually received.
on september,feldman filed a chapter personal bankruptcy petition,et,in the united states bankruptcy court for the eastern district of pennsylvania,seeking relief from in credit card debt he had incurred.feldman listed his personal property as valued at and his real estate holdings as valued at.on december,feldman amended the original bankruptcy schedule,listing his personal property at.he testified at a meeting of creditors on january,that he had fully and accurately disclosed all real and personal property he owned.
a bankruptcy trustee was appointed who learned that feldman had an ownership interest in a number of valuable pieces of art and other antiques that he had not listed on the bankruptcy schedule.these assets included the howard and catherine feldman collection,a collection of chinese treaty port paintings,american and english furniture,decorations,folk art,clocks,rugs and phrenological material,which eventually sold at a sotheby auction for on october,netting after commission.between september,and june,feldman and his wife also sold numerous other items through the sotheby and christie auction houses for a total of.the proceeds from these sales were wired to the feldmans joint bank account.
the bankruptcy trustee also learned that feldman owned two jaguar automobiles in his own name that he had not declared on the bankruptcy schedules.feldman produced a letter of sale,indicating that he had sold the vehicles to a man named daniel krause,yet feldman retained possession of and title to the cars feldman claimed that he did so because krause did not want his wife to find out that he had purchased them.krause denied that he had purchased the vehicles.feldman entered into an agreement with the chapter trustee to buy one of the cars for and the other was sold at auction for when a bankruptcy petition is filed,all the property that belonged to the debtor automatically becomes the property of the bankruptcy estate pursuant to and 
on july,the bankruptcy court granted feldman motion to convert the case to chapter.on august,feldman amended the bankruptcy schedule to reflect the findings of the chapter bankruptcy trustee,disclosing personal property valued at,the bulk of which he claimed was exempt from his creditors because it was owned as tenants by the entireties with his wife.however,at a november,creditors meeting,feldman admitted that he had sold property at a sotheby auction for approximately.he also stated that although he had initially listed his home,which he owned with his wife,as valued at,the house had been listed for sale at but later reduced to.the house eventually sold for on april,using this figure,the government contended before the district court that feldman had undervalued his home by.feldman nonetheless claimed that he was entitled to a discharge in bankruptcy because the personal property and real estate was also owned by his wife and was thus totally exempt from bankruptcy.based on the undervaluation of his home and the continued concealment of assets,the bankruptcy trustee objected to the exemptions and to feldman being discharged.
upon motion by the bankruptcy trustee,the case was reconverted to a chapter proceeding.the bankruptcy trustee eventually entered into a settlement agreement with feldman,whereby he would pay to settle the objections to the claimed exemptions.it is not clear from the record why the bankruptcy trustee decided that it was in the best interests of the creditors to settle we can only speculate that the trustee was concerned that the bankruptcy court would exclude the jointly owned property,even though it was initially concealed,or that the cost of continued litigation would reduce the amount of money available for the creditors.the settlement amount was added to the from the sale of the jaguar vehicles.feldman was ultimately discharged from the rest of his debt.
in the end,feldman paid to settle his debt.fees were subtracted,leaving feldman creditors with.although feldman had filed for bankruptcy protection in a greater amount,the proofs of claim that were filed totaled only.thus,the amount of unpaid proofs of claim totaled,resulting in a distribution of approximately of the amount owed to feldman creditors.
on march,feldman pled guilty to four counts of bankruptcy fraud in the district court of the eastern district of pennsylvania count one alleged that feldman concealed bankruptcy assets in violation of and counts two through four alleged that feldman made false declarations in a bankruptcy proceeding in violation of.the government told the court that feldman had concealed personal property with a total value of.at sentencing,the government urged that feldman be given an eight offense level increase in the sentencing guidelines calculation pursuant to b i,for losses more than,since,in its submission,he had intended to cause a loss of this included the amount of debt from which feldman sought to be discharged,including fees.feldman urged that there should be no offense level increase since the government could not prove that he intended or actually caused any loss.alternatively,feldman claimed that his offense level should only be increased by seven levels,pursuant to b h,for losses more than,since the amount of loss would not exceed without the addition of administrative costs 
the district court conducted two sentencing hearings a second hearing was scheduled to allow the parties to submit supplemental material.the district court made no finding as to the exact amount of loss,since feldman final offense level would be fifteen a guidelines range of eighteen to months whether his offense level was increased by seven or eight offense levels.feldman had a base offense level of six,plus seven offense levels or eight for the loss,plus two offense levels for more than minimal planning,b,plus two offense levels for fraud during a bankruptcy proceeding,b b,minus two offense levels or three if the offense level had been increased by eight for acceptance of responsibility.a and b.if feldman offense level was increased by eight offense levels,it would have been decreased by three offense levels for acceptance of responsibility,pursuant to b,and if his offense level was increased by seven offense levels,it would have been decreased by two offense levels for acceptance of responsibility,pursuant to a.
in its sentence,the district court ordered that feldman be remanded to the custody of the bureau of prisons for fifteen months on count one,and then receive an additional three years of supervised release.the district court imposed the same term for counts two through four,to run concurrently with count one.it also fined feldman and imposed a special assessment of.the district court gave the parties time to reach a settlement on the restitution amount.after it became clear that no settlement was forthcoming,the district court ordered restitution in the amount of for the actual loss to feldman creditors.it is not clear from the record how this figure was calculated.however,we need not determine how the district court decided on this amount since we will remand on the restitution issue for other reasons.
feldman timely appealed and the district court granted his motion for release pending appeal.the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to and we have jurisdiction pursuant to and.we review the factual determinations underlying the application of the sentencing guidelines for clear error,but we have plenary review over the legal determinations.see united states napier,cir.likewise,we exercise plenary review over whether an award of restitution is permitted under law,but we review specific awards of restitution for abuse of discretion.united states crandon,cir.
we will first discuss the restitution issue,which turns on the determination of actual loss.this will obviate the need to discuss actual loss in conjunction with the sentencing issue.
restitution 
under the victim witness protection act as amended by the mandatory victims restitution act mvra,the amount of restitution awarded is limited to the amount of actual loss caused by the defendant crime.and.feldman contends that the district court erred by awarding restitution since his creditors incurred no actual loss because the property that he did not report the proceeds from the sotheby and christie sales and the amount by which he undervalued his home would not have been reachable by his creditors even if he had disclosed it because it was held by him and his wife as tenants by the entireties.in feldman submission,this result follows from section of the bankruptcy code,which allows the debtor to utilize state law bankruptcy exemptions and the fact that in pennsylvania,property owned by both husband and wife as tenants by the entireties is not reachable by the creditors of only the husband or the wife.see.
the credit card debt that triggered the bankruptcy was incurred in feldman name alone,while the assets he concealed excluding the jaguar vehicles were owned by both feldman and his wife.the government does not concede that the property would have been exempt from bankruptcy if feldman had acted lawfully.additionally,the government asserts that in light of the large amount of property owned by feldman and his wife even if exempt,the bankruptcy trustee may not have recommended discharge.
instead of holding a hearing to determine whether or not the property would have been exempt if feldman had acted lawfully,or whether the bankruptcy trustee would have recommended a discharge,the district court ordered the parties to submit briefs discussing the government proposition that in bankruptcy court,if you fail to disclose something you then lose the right to exempt it from the estate.the court reasoned that if this proposition was supported by caselaw,it makes a very easy disposition of the determination of loss.
the district court was ultimately persuaded by the government assertion that in bankruptcy proceedings,a debtor is not entitled to claim an exemption in bankruptcy property that he fraudulently concealed under this view,creditors can reach property that would have otherwise been exempt.see in re glass,cir affirming a decision of the bankruptcy appellate panel which did not allow the debtor to voluntarily amend his bankruptcy schedule and claim a homestead exemption where the debtor had concealed the property redmond tuttle,cir property fraudulently transferred out of an estate and later recovered by the trustee can not then be exempted by the debtor.matter of doan,cir c oncealment of an asset will bar exemption of that asset.in re yonikus,cir agreeing with doan.the district court concluded that this logic should extend to the determination of actual loss,reasoning that a debtor who has been dishonest in concealing assets should not be allowed to use the exemption provision as a shield.thus,the court determined that the calculation of actual loss would not exclude the property feldman claims was exempt.
