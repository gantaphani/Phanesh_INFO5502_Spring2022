we must decide whether the bankruptcy court was correct to give preclusive effect to an issue raised in a prior state court action.because we conclude that the state court treatment of the issue in question does not satisfy california threshold requirements for the application of collateral estoppel,we reverse and remand for a nondischargeability proceeding.
background 
donald kobrin,a physician,and charles harmon,a pharmacist,worked at the same hospital in lodi,california.harmon invested in ostriches through one of his former employees,rhonda de la cruz,who,together with john lucas,operated lucas ostrich industries lucas ostrich,an ostrich ranch.at de la cruz prompting,harmon spoke to kobrin about harmon ostrich investments.kobrin and harmon formed a partnership,kimnod ostriches kimnod,and together purchased a number of ostriches and ostrich chicks.the partnership contracted with lucas ostrich to board the birds and to represent kimnod in ostrich sales to third parties 
kobrin relationship with harmon and lucas ostrich soured.he sued harmon,lucas ostrich,de la cruz,and lucas in california superior court,alleging,among other things,conversion and contract violations and seeking,in part,recission of contracts involving the kimnod partnership,restitution,and dissolution of the partnership.all defendants defaulted,and the state court entered judgment against harmon,lucas ostrich,and lucas.the court ordered,among other things,recission of the contracts and of the kimnod partnership agreement,and restitution in the amount of,plus interest and costs.the court held all defendants jointly and severally liable for the money judgment.
after the state judgment became final,harmon filed for chapter bankruptcy protection.kobrin then filed an adversary action,seeking to have the state judgment debt adjudged nondischargeable under the fraud exception,a a harmon filed a motion to dismiss,and kobrin filed a for summary judgment.kobrin based his motion for summary judgment on the argument that the state court default judgment was preclusive of the issue of whether harmon had committed fraud under a a.the bankruptcy court granted summary judgment to kobrin,declaring the debt nondischargeable.harmon appealed to the district court,which affirmed the bankruptcy court judgment.harmon now appeals the district court order 
standard of review 
we review the district court decision on appeal from the bankruptcy court de novo,without giving deference to the district court conclusions.preblich battley,cir.we review the bankruptcy court findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.id.in reviewing the bankruptcy court grant of summary judgment,we must determine,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the bankruptcy court correctly applied the substantive law.parker community first bank in re bakersfield westar ambulance,cir.no questions of fact are at issue in this appeal the parties disagree only about whether the bankruptcy court correctly applied california preclusion law.thus,our review is entirely de novo.
discussion 
principles of collateral estoppel apply to proceedings seeking exceptions from discharge brought under a.grogan garner,d.under the full faith and credit act,the preclusive effect of a state court judgment in a subsequent bankruptcy proceeding is determined by the preclusion law of the state in which the judgment was issued.gayden nourbakhsh in re nourbakhsh,cir citing marrese am.acad.of orthopaedic surgeons,d.
in california,c ollateral estoppel precludes relitigation of issues argued and decided in prior proceedings.lucido superior court,cal d,in bank.california courts will apply collateral estoppel only if certain threshold requirements are met,and then only if application of preclusion furthers the public policies underlying the doctrine.see id.at.there are five threshold requirements 
first,the issue sought to be precluded from relitigation must be identical to that decided in a former proceeding.second,this issue must have been actually litigated in the former proceeding.third,it must have been necessarily decided in the former proceeding.fourth,the decision in the former proceeding must be final and on the merits.finally,the party against whom preclusion is sought must be the same as,or in privity with,the party to the former proceeding.
id.at.the party asserting collateral estoppel bears the burden of establishing these requirements.id.
there is no dispute concerning the fourth and fifth requirements.harmon was a defendant in kobrin state court action,and,because harmon failed to file a timely appeal,the state trial court judgment was final before kobrin brought his nondischargeability action.
in addition,the issue in the bankruptcy litigation was identical to at least one issue raised in the state court proceeding.in order to establish that a debt is nondischargeable under a a,a creditor must establish five elements by a preponderance of the evidence 
misrepresentation,fraudulent omission or deceptive conduct by the debtor knowledge of the falsity or deceptiveness of his statement or conduct an intent to deceive justifiable reliance by the creditor on the debtor statement or conduct and damage to the creditor proximately caused by its reliance on the debtor statement or conduct.
turtle rock meadows homeowners ass slyman in re slyman,cir.in his state court complaint,kobrin adequately alleged facts that would satisfy the five elements under a a.kobrin requested dissolution of the partnership agreement in part because harmon was under a fiduciary duty and a duty of trust and good faith to kobrin harmon failed to disclose material facts with the intent to deceive kobrin so as to induce him to invest substantial monies and to forbear from suit kobrin justifiably relied on harmon representations and kobrin suffered actual damages as a direct and proximate result of harmon failure to disclose 
the critical questions,therefore,are whether kobrin has established that the issue of harmon allegedly fraudulent conduct was actually litigated in the state court proceeding and whether its resolution was necessary for the state court judgment.after careful review of the record,we conclude that under california law,the issue was not necessarily decided in the state court litigation.neither was the issue actually litigated.for these reasons,the bankruptcy court grant of summary judgment was in error.
the mere fact that kobrin obtained a judgment by default does not,in itself,foreclose the possibility that the resolution of some issues in the litigation would later have preclusive effect.in williams williams in re williams estate,cal d,in bank,the california supreme court held that t he fact that a judgment was secured by default does not warrant the application of a special rule.a default judgment is an estoppel as to all issues necessarily litigated therein and determined thereby exactly like any other judgment.id.at quoting horton horton,cal d,in bank 
however,the williams estate court placed two limitations on this rule.reviewing past cases,the court first noted that the rationale behind finding defendants estopped by default judgments is that a defendant who is served with a summons and complaint but who fails to respond is presumed to admit all the facts which are well pleaded in the complaint.id.at quoting brown brown,cal.the court noted,however,that this rationale is inapplicable in cases in which the defendant is unaware of the litigation where there is a complete lack of knowledge on the part of a defendant of the action,it would be unreasonable to hold that the judgment becomes,in effect,a contract between the parties that the judgment shall be final with respect to everything properly embraced within the allegations of the complaint and in the prayer for relief.id.at quoting brown,at.thus,the court held that a defendant may be precluded from relitigating issues raised in a complaint on which a default judgment was granted only if the defendant has been personally served with summons or has actual knowledge of the existence of the
