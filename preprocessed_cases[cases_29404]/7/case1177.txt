on the first day of its bankruptcy,kmart sought permission to pay immediately,and in full,the claims of all critical vendors.technically there are debtors kmart corporation plus of its affiliates and subsidiaries.we call them all kmart.the theory behind the request is that some suppliers may be unwilling to do business with a customer that is behind in payment,and,if it can not obtain the merchandise that its own customers have come to expect,a firm such as kmart may be unable to carry on,injuring all of its creditors.full payment to critical vendors thus could in principle make even the disfavored creditors better off they may not be paid in full,but they will receive a greater portion of their claims than they would if the critical vendors cut off supplies and the business shut down.putting the proposition in this way implies,however,that the debtor must prove,and not just allege,two things that,but for immediate full payment,vendors would cease dealing and that the business will gain enough from continued transactions with the favored vendors to provide some residual benefit to the remaining,disfavored creditors,or at least leave them no worse off.
bankruptcy judge sonderby entered a order just as kmart proposed it,without notifying any disfavored creditors,without receiving any pertinent evidence the record contains only some sketchy representations by counsel plus unhelpful testimony by kmart ceo,who could not speak for the vendors,and without making any finding of fact that the disfavored creditors would gain or come out even.the bankruptcy court order declared that the relief kmart permission to pay any debt to any vendor it deemed critical in the exercise of unilateral discretion,provided that the vendor agreed to furnish goods on customary trade terms for the next two in the best interests of the debtors,their estates and their creditors.the order did not explain why,nor did it contain any legal analysis,though it did cite a.the bankruptcy court issued two companion orders covering international vendors and liquor vendors.analysis of all three orders is the same,so we do not mention these two further.
kmart used its authority to pay in full the debts to suppliers,which collectively received about million.this came from the billion in new credit or dip financing that the bankruptcy judge authorized,granting the lenders in assets and revenues.see in re qualitech steel,cir.another or so vendors were not deemed critical and were not paid.they and additional unsecured creditors eventually received about cents on the dollar,mostly in stock of the reorganized kmart.capital factors,appealed the order immediately after its entry on january.a little more than months later,after all of the critical vendors had been paid and as kmart plan of reorganization was on the verge of approval,district judge grady reversed the order authorizing payment.he concluded that neither a nor a doctrine of necessity supports the orders.
appellants insist that,by the time judge grady acted,it was too late.money had changed hands and,we are told,can not be refunded.but why not reversing preferential transfers is an ordinary feature of bankruptcy practice,often continuing under a confirmed plan of reorganization.see mellon bank,dick,cir.if the orders in question are invalid,then the critical vendors have received preferences that kmart is entitled to recoup for the benefit of all creditors.confirmation of a plan does not stop the administration of the estate,except to the extent that the plan itself so provides.compare in re hovis,cir,with in re unr industries,cir.several provisions of the code do forbid revision of transactions completed under judicial auspices.for example,the dip financing order,issued contemporaneously with the order,is sheltered by e the reversal or modification on appeal of an authorization under this section to obtain credit or incur debt,or of a grant under this section of a priority or a lien,does not affect the validity of any debt so incurred,or any priority or lien so granted,to an entity that extended such credit in good faith,whether or not such entity knew of the pendency of the appeal,unless such authorization and the incurring of such debt,or the granting of such priority or lien,were stayed pending appeal.nothing comparable anywhere in the code covers payments made to,unsecured creditors,whether or not the debtor calls them critical.judges do not invent missing language.
now it is true that we have recognized the existence of a longstanding doctrine,reflected in unr industries,that detrimental reliance comparable to the extension of new credit against a promise of security,or the purchase of assets in a foreclosure sale,may make it appropriate for judges to exercise such equitable discretion as they possess in order to protect those reliance interests.see also in re envirodyne industries,cir.thus once action has been taken to distribute assets under a confirmed plan of reorganization,it would take some extraordinary event to turn back the clock.these appeals,however,do not question any distribution under kmart plan to the contrary,the plan which was confirmed after the district court decision provides that adversary proceedings will be filed to recover the preferences that the critical vendors have received.no one filed an appeal,which means that it is appellants in this court that now wage a collateral attack on the plan of reorganization.
appellants say that we should recognize their reliance interests after the order,they continued selling goods and services to kmart doing this was a condition of payment for debts.continued business relations may or may not be a form of reliance that depends on whether the vendors otherwise would have stopped selling,but they are not detrimental reliance.the vendors have been paid in full for goods and services.if kmart had become administratively insolvent,and unable to compensate the vendors for transactions,then it might make sense to permit vendors to retain payments under the order,at least to the extent of the deficiency.because kmart emerged as an operating business,however,no such question arises.the vendors have not established that any reliance alone any language in the future attempts to recover preferential transfers on account of debts.
handleman company,which received million as a critical vendor,makes a different procedural objection that the district court order does not affect it because capital factors notice of appeal did not name handleman as an appellee.handleman was not a party in the district court and,consistent with the due process clause of the fifth amendment,can not be bound by the district judge so it says.we permitted handleman to intervene in this court.thus it is a party today and will be bound by our decision,so it is hard to see why it matters whether the district judge resolution would have had independent effect.
notices of appeal in bankruptcy must name all parties to the judgment,order,or decree appealed from.fed.a.handleman was not a party to the order kmart was the sole party at the time.kmart filed an ex parte application that did not specify any particular creditor.it had notified only creditors of its impending request,and none of these was among the vendors to be left high and dry.the bankruptcy judge order likewise did not identify any creditor that acquired rights,for no creditor acquired rights.all the order did was authorize kmart to pay any vendor that kmart in its discretion deemed critical.the party that capital factors had to name thus was kmart itself,and this it did.if the lack of personal notice about the proceedings before the district judge deprived handleman of due process,then kmart application to the bankruptcy judge deprived about unsecured creditors of due process that would render the order void,and handleman would be worse then it would have to repay the money even if the order entry otherwise would have been lawful.but there is no constitutional obligation to make every creditor a party to every contested matter in the bankruptcy.as a rule,a trustee or debtor in possession represents the interests of many stakeholders.kmart vi
