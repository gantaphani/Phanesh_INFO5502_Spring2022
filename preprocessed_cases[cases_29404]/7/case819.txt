a trustee in bankruptcy brought an adversary action under to recover assets from the bankrupt debtor former husband,to whom the debtor had transferred property pursuant to a divorce decree.the bankruptcy court granted summary judgment in the former husband favor,the district court affirmed,and the trustee now appeals to this court.for the following reasons,we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
this case arises out of the bankruptcy of margaret anne erlewine the debtor.the debtor married mark erlewine erlewine in,and in the course of the marriage the couple acquired certain commercial real property.in november,erlewine filed a petition for divorce in texas state court.the proceeding was contested,and the court held several days of trial.on june,the divorce court entered a final decree of divorce,which granted erlewine custody of the couple minor child as well as ownership of more than fifty percent of the couple community assets.the court justified the disproportionate division of property on several grounds,most prominently that the debtor caused a significant amount of community funds to be spent on drug treatment,the debtor used community funds to purchase large and unnecessary quantities of prescription drugs,and the debtor unreasonable position in the divorce litigation caused erlewine to incur unusually high attorneys fees.the court awarded the couple commercial real property to erlewine,and in this action he claims that it is his business homestead and is necessary for the support of the minor child.
less than a year after the divorce decree,the debtor filed for chapter bankruptcy.the trustee of her bankruptcy estate the trustee then filed an adversary proceeding against erlewine to recover community property transferred to erlewine under the divorce decree.the trustee sought to avoid the transfer under of the bankruptcy code,which provides,in relevant part 
a the trustee may avoid any transfer of an interest of the debtor in property,or any obligation incurred by the debtor,that was made or incurred on or within one year before the date of the filing of the petition,if the debtor voluntarily or involuntarily 
b i received less than a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for such transfer 
the trustee filed two motions for partial summary judgment in the bankruptcy court.the first motion sought a ruling on whether the divorce decree effected a transfer of an interest in property within the meaning of,and the second motion asked for summary judgment on the question of whether the debtor received,in the statute language,less than a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for such transfer.the bankruptcy court granted the first motion but denied the second.the trustee then filed a motion to reconsider the denial of his second motion for partial summary judgment,and erlewine filed his own motion for summary judgment on the issue of reasonably equivalent value.
after a consolidated hearing on both pending motions,the bankruptcy court denied the trustee motion to reconsider and granted erlewine motion for summary judgment on the issue of reasonably equivalent value.the bankruptcy court ruled that the debtor received reasonably equivalent value as a matter of law,despite the fact that the divorce court had divided the couple property on a basis explicitly described as disproportionate.in reaching its conclusion,the bankruptcy judge relied on our decision in besing hawthorne in re besing,cir,which he read broadly as prohibiting bankruptcy courts from looking behind state adjudications in avoidance actions.
the trustee appealed the bankruptcy court ruling on erlewine motion for summary judgment to the district court,which affirmed without opinion.the trustee now appeals to this court 
ii.standard of review 
we review de novo the bankruptcy court grant of summary judgment.see williams int l of workers,local in re williams,cir.summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.applying.to adversary bankruptcy proceedings.
as to the particular issue of whether a debtor has received reasonably equivalent value under,we have recognized that the question of reasonable equivalence is usually a question of fact,or is at least.see.truck ins.agency cure in re dunham,cir besing,at.certain transactions,however,can give the debtor reasonably equivalent value as a matter of law.see besing,at.in the case before us,the bankruptcy court found that the debtor received reasonably equivalent value as a matter of law.like other legal conclusions of the bankruptcy courts,this conclusion is reviewed de novo.see bradley pac.southwest bank,fsb in re bradley,cir.
iii.discussion 
the bankruptcy court held that the state court division of the erlewines marital property could not be set aside under a b as a transfer for less than reasonably equivalent value.while this decision was based largely on an interpretation of our decision in besing,erlewine also offers two other grounds on which he might prevail the trustee action is barred by the doctrine,and res judicata and collateral estoppel preclude the trustee from relitigating the property division.
and preclusion 
although we believe that the trustee claim fails for other reasons,we begin by briefly assessing erlewine argument,since it implicates our jurisdiction.the doctrine,named after two supreme court cases holds that the inferior federal courts lack jurisdiction to exercise appellate review over state court decisions.see reitnauer.exotic feline,in re reitnauer,cir describing the doctrine.plainly,the trustee avoidance action does not seek appellate review of the state divorce proceeding in a literal sense.nonetheless,the doctrine is potentially applicable whenever the state and federal proceedings would be inextricably intertwined.see davis bayless,cir.
while courts have often had difficulty deciding whether a state adjudication and a later federal action are so intertwined that the latter would amount to a review of the former the answer in this case is relatively clear.even if it could be said that the trustee avoidance action seeks review of the state divorce seems doubtful,given that the two proceedings address rather different cases have indicated that the bar generally should not extend to state decisions that would not be given preclusive effect under doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel.see am.airlines,dep t of,cir.in this particular case,as explained below,the divorce decree is not entitled to preclusive effect because the trustee was not a party to the state court divorce proceedings,nor was he in privity with any party.for the same reason,the doctrine is inapplicable.see johnson de grandy,d refusing to apply the doctrine against a litigant who was not a party to the prior state action 
the trustee challenge to the divorce decree is not barred by the traditional preclusion doctrines of res judicata or collateral estoppel.the federal full faith and credit statute requires us to give state court judgments the same preclusive effect that they would enjoy in the courts of the rendering state.see marrese am.acad.of orthopaedic surgeons,d.under texas law,the preclusion doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel apply only against a litigant who was a party to,or who is in privity with a party to,the original suit.see amstadt brass,bonniwell beech aircraft,the trustee was not a party to the divorce action.nor can the trustee be considered the debtor privy,for two parties are said to be in privity when they share an identity of interests in the basic legal right that is the subject of litigation.amstadt,at.the interests of the debtor in the divorce proceeding and of the trustee in the instant case are,however,quite distinct.as we observed in coleman alcock,another case involving a bankruptcy trustee attempt to avoid a transfer,
w e are of the view that the trustee is not bound,either on res judicata or judicial collateral estoppel,by the prior state court proceedings.the trustee is,of course,a successor of the bankrupt for many purposes.but he is much more both in the extraordinary rights wit
