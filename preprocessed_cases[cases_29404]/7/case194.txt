on these appeals,plaintiff the massachusetts commissioner of insurance the commissioner argues the act,et two provisions of state law govern claims by the united states in a state insurance company liquidation proceeding.the district court said yes as to one issue claims priority and no as to the other bar date.we agree.
on march,a massachusetts state court determined that two massachusetts insurance companies collectively,american mutual were insolvent.the court then appointed the commissioner as permanent receiver to conduct their liquidation.on march,in accordance with state law,the court entered an order requiring all creditors of american mutual to file proofs of claim with the receiver within one year of the liquidation date,by march.see.laws ch,in re liquidation of am.mut.liab.ins.
agencies of the united states eventually filed claims against the two insurance companies totaling over.some of the claims were filed after the deadline these claims comprised claimed by the late interstate commerce commission and claimed by medicare contractors.the united states has asserted throughout that all of its claims are entitled to priority over claims of the guaranty funds and that the bar date does not apply to any of its claims.
virtually all states have set up insurance guaranty funds to protect policyholders if and when insurance companies go bankrupt.although the extent of coverage varies,in general covered claims by policyholders against an insolvent insurer are paid by the fund.the fund in turn acquires and can enforce the legal phrase is subrogated to the insured claim against the insurer assets held by the receiver.see.laws ch.american mutual did business in a number of states,and payments as of september by guaranty funds in jurisdictions to policyholders of american mutual totaled over million.
after making a number of partial payments to the guaranty are the largest creditors in the commissioner on may,filed a liquidation plan in state court.the plan proposes to distribute remaining american mutual assets as provided under massachusetts law pertinently,first priority is for administrative claims second,for policyholder claims including subrogated claims made by guaranty funds third,for unearned premiums and fourth,for claims of the united states.laws ch.
the american mutual assets held by the receiver do not suffice to cover all claims.the united states,which had consented to earlier distributions,insisted that as a matter of federal law its priority trumped that of the guaranty funds and also that the bar date could not be applied to its claims.in response,the commissioner,who can be held personally liable under federal law for ignoring proper claims of the united states,b,brought the present declaratory judgment action in the district court to settle the two issues.
various guaranty funds from massachusetts and other jurisdictions sought to intervene the district court denied them intervenor status but allowed them to file amicus briefs.on cross motions for summary judgment,the district court determined that,by reverse preemption,the act allowed state law to override otherwise applicable federal law,thus according the guaranty funds priority over the united states as to subrogated policyholder claims.ruthardt united states,d.conversely,relying on a prior decision of this court,the district court held that the united states was not bound by massachusetts law requirement for filing claims.id.at.
the united states now appeals to contest the priority ruling.the commissioner as to the time bar ruling.the guaranty funds appeal from the denial of intervention.for reasons that will become apparent,the important open issue on these appeals,which is subject to de novo review,euromotion,bmw of,cir,concerns the united states claim to priority over the guaranty funds.
claims priority.the priority issue is framed by several statutes.the first is the federal priority act,which gives first priority shall be paid first to the united states for its claims against,inter alia,an insolvent entity estate.by express qualification,this provision does not apply to bankruptcy code proceedings,id.a,but this qualification does not extend to state proceedings to liquidate insurance companies.
instead,to preserve state priorities,the commissioner relies upon the act,which as amended provides as follows the critical language is underscored 
section.congress hereby declares that the continued regulation and taxation by the several states of the business of insurance is in the public interest,and that silence on the part of the congress shall not be construed to impose any barrier to the regulation or taxation of such business by the several states.
a state regulation 
the business of insurance,and every person engaged therein,shall be subject to the laws of the several states which relate to the regulation or taxation of such business.
b federal regulation 
no act of congress shall be construed to invalidate,impair,or supersede any law enacted by any state for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance,or which imposes a fee or tax upon such business,unless such act specifically relates to the business of insurance provided,that after june,the act of july,as amended,known as the sherman act,and the act of october,as amended,known as the clayton act,and the act of september,known as the federal trade commission act,as amended,shall be applicable to the business of insurance to the extent that such business is not regulated by state law.
emphasis added.
the statute origins are familiar.in united states underwriters ass n,the supreme court held that insurance,hitherto regulated by the states as a local activity,fell within the commerce clause and was therefore subject to federal antitrust regulation.congress responded with the act.the provision of primary interest underscored language of section b immunizes against federal statutory preemption those state statutes enacted for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance.
unsurprisingly,the commissioner argues that the quoted language embraces the massachusetts priority statute insofar as it prefers the claims of guaranty funds arising out of their payments to policyholders.put differently,the commissioner says that the quoted language means that the federal priority act does not supercede this facet of the priority statute.in shorthand,this can be called reverse preemption of federal law by state congress consent.
if the act were read in lay terms,the commissioner would easily prevail.in ordinary usage,the liquidation of american mutual was surely part of the state regulation of the insurance business and,as we will see,the massachusetts statute according priority over the united states to guaranty funds for their subrogated claims is part of a scheme directed to protecting policyholders by assuring prompt and full payment of covered claims.but the supreme court has read the exemption more narrowly than literally,making this an extremely close case.
suffice it to say that the narrowing has been based in part on legislative history and in part on policy concerns.one special policy concern relates to a desire to assure antitrust enforcement but even when antitrust is not at issue the court has in general read business of insurance restrictively,focusing on the insurance contract and the protection of policyholders.see union labor life ins.pireno,d.other regulation or activities have also been deemed outside the protection of the act.the leading cases include pireno,group life health insurance royal drug,d,sec national securities,d,and united states department of treasury fabe,d 
fabe dealt directly with the question whether the federal priority act superceded a state statute governing priorities in insurance company liquidation.there,the ohio statute in question assigned all government claims a lower priority than,inter alia,administration expenses,employee claims for wages due,policyholder claims,and the claims of creditors.by a vote,the supreme court upheld the priority for policyholders and for administrative expenses,the latter on the ground that they were essential for the liquidation and therefore for policyholders receipt of payments.fabe,at.
but so far as the ohio statute gave priority to employee and general creditor claims,fabe held that the act did not protect the statute because their the employee and creditor claims connection to the ultimate aim of insurance was too tenuous,at.and accordingly,the federal priority act did give the united states priority ahead of those two classes.four dissenting justices thought that the liquidation statute in its entirety failed to qualify as regulation of the business of insurance and that the united states had priority over all claims.id.at.kennedy,dissenting.
if and when the next case reaches the supreme court,the dissenting position in fabe could prevail.that position may be closer to the mainstream of prior court cases on the act and,anyway,all four fabe dissenters still sit while two of the fabe majority have left the bench.but for now the premises of the fabe majority govern lower courts,see state oil khan,d i t is this supreme court prerogative alone to overrule one of its precedents,so for us the only question is where those premises lead.unfortunately,answering that question is difficult because our own case is very close to fabe but arguably a small step beyond.
prior to fabe,the touchstone of protection was the contract.fabe deemed the ohio liquidation provisions,so far as they gave priority for payment to policyholders out of the defunct insurer assets,to be close enough to enforcement of the original contract to qualify for protection.the court also upheld a priority for administrative expenses as necessary to assure policyholder payments,but held invalid as against the federal priority act the state priority for payments for past wages of company employees and payments to creditors other than policyholders.
strictly speaking,the priority that massachusetts gives to guaranty funds is not absolutely necessary from a assure payment by the funds to policyholders.if the necessity test were met,then fabe would clearly resolve the matter in favor of the commissioner.but the obligations of the guaranty funds to pay covered policy claims exists whether or not the guaranty funds are then reimbursed direct assessments against the insurers will be increased to cover the gap.similarly,the state priority for guaranty funds gives the funds,not policyholders,a priority over the united states.to this extent,the guaranty funds might appear to resemble general creditors who under fabe did not get priority over the united states.
this perspective is too narrow.fabe premise was not that priority over the united states for policyholders is all right and priority for anyone else is not fabe itself upheld a priority for administrative expenses of liquidation and apparently for administrative expenses of guaranty funds,too,see at.because these reimbursements facilitated payment to policyholders.in other words,priorities that indirectly assure that policyholders get what they were promised can also trigger protection the question is one of degree,not of kind.see id.at.upholding administrative expenses as reasonably necessary and striking down general creditor claims as too tenuous ly connected.
the priority that massachusetts affords to guaranty funds is part and parcel of an integrated regime aimed at the protection of policyholders.reimbursements to the funds are a significant source of revenue for making covered payments to policyholders for example,as of september,such payments to the guaranty funds financed approximately percent of the payments to policyholders in the american mutual liquidation.without the priority for such reimbursements,payments to policyholders could in practice be less secure and would at the very least be delayed in some instances.prompt payment is one of the main benefits of guaranty funds.
that policyholders benefit from a state regulation is not automatically enough to assure it protection.merely reducing insurer costs through low cost purchasing or peer review schemes may benefit policyholders in the long run,but the connection may be too remote.see,pireno,at.royal drug,at.but,as already noted,the issue is one of directness and degree.here,we are concerned with funding payment of promised benefits to policyholders,and payment of benefit to policyholders is just what fabe said is within the general ambit of the act.
the united states concedes that,under fabe,the policyholders have priority over its own claims.yet the guaranty funds are little more than a mechanism for advancing the money to pay policyholders promptly and then recovering those advances out of the estate assets,ahead of the united states,just as the policyholders could have done directly.if the state statutes had described the fund payments as merely loans,conditioned on the policyholders advancing their own priority claims to repay the loans,the united states would lose.
it thus becomes apparent that the united states is using the federal priority act not to maintain its priority but to enlarge it.if the policyholder makes a direct claim against the estate,that claim is satisfied out of estate assets ahead of the united states.if for speed and certainty the policyholder is instead paid by the guaranty fund,and the guaranty fund then seeks to recoup,the united states position in this case would mean that the same assets of the estate are subject to a priority claim of the united states.this would be a perverse result.
of course,if congress directed such a result,it would be the job of courts to enforce it.but the interplay of the federal priority act and the act is assuredly something about which congress thought little.the ironing of such wrinkles,as with many such statutes,has been left to the courts.fabe,which is just such a judicial construct,may not literally dictate the outcome here but,all things considered,upholding the priority of the funds is consistent with the logic and spirit of fabe.
the united states makes three arguments for an outcome in its favor.the best grounded is its claim that the state priority for guaranty funds does not easily satisfy the supreme court criteria for identifying the business of insurance in particular,the state priority does not directly regulate the insurance contract between insurer and insured,previously invoked by the court as a touchstone.that is so,but that was equally true of fabe priority for administrative expenses and perhaps even its priority for policyholder claims against the defunct insurer.if such priorities were close enough in fabe to satisfy the old criteria,they have to be close enough for us.
the second argument is that whether the fund is repaid ahead of the united states has nothing to do with protecting policyholders but is simply a benefit for the insurance industry.this is at most a half truth,and the half that is true does not matter.yes,the industry will be better off if the funds have a priority since direct assessments against the industry will be less.but the priority for the funds primarily provides adequate resources for a payment scheme whose central mission is to achieve prompt payment for policyholders of what their insurance policies promised them.
the final argument,admittedly inventive,is that some policyholders will be worse off if the guaranty funds get their priority if the funds state law priority is upheld,they will compete for estate assets with policyholder claims that are not covered by fund protection but,if the priority is struck down,those same assets after liquidation expenses will all be available first for uncovered policyholder claims,after which the united states will come in ahead of the guaranty funds.not amused by this attempt of the united states to pose as a friend of the policyholders,the district court called this argument specious.ruthardt,d at.
it is not quite that.the district court point was that i n the absence of guaranty funds,the policyholders covered claims would compete with uncovered claims for the same estate assets substituting the guaranty funds claims for the policyholder claims paid off by guaranty funds leaves the uncovered policyholder claims with exactly the same assets to,in add
