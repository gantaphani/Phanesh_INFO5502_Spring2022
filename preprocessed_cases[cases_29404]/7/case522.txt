opinion of the court 
petitioner scott hefta,a seaman,sustained serious injuries while employed aboard a steamboat owned by his employer.his attorney sent the employer a letter to put it on notice of a claim relating to hefta accident.shortly thereafter,the employer filed for bankruptcy.hefta attorney wrote the claims agent informing it that his client was injured and had a claim against the debtor.while the letter also requested a claim form,hefta did not file a formal claim prior to the bar date the issues in this case require us to clarify the requirements for an informal proof of claim in bankruptcy.we conclude that hefta letter was insufficient to constitute a properly filed claim and that his failure to file a timely proof of claim did not result from excusable neglect.we will affirm the judgment of the district court.
facts and procedural history 
scott hefta,a jones act seaman was injured in the course of his employment at the delta queen riverboat on june.the vessel was owned and operated by american classic its subsidiary delta queen steamboat company american classic or debtors.hefta reported the injury to american classic the next day.thereafter,counsel for hefta sent american classic a letter dated june,to advise it of hefta claim.hefta employer acknowledged receipt of the letter on july.
then,in october,american classic filed for chapter bankruptcy in the united states district court for the district of delaware.the debtors cancelled almost all of their scheduled passenger cruises,resulting in approximately claims for deposits on cancelled cruises.several hundred personal injury plaintiffs have also filed claims against debtors.
counsel for hefta received a notification of debtors bankruptcy that directed creditors to file proofs of claim with the appointed claims agent,logan company logan.on february,hefta counsel wrote logan,stating that hefta worked on the delta queen and was injured on june,he has a claim against the debtor.hefta letter also requested a proof of claim form and inquired whether debtors had insurance coverage for hefta injury.
on march,the bankruptcy court entered an order setting a claims bar date for april,the bar date.logan sent hefta and his attorney a notice of the bar date,together with a proof of claim form,on march.failing to appreciate the significance of that notice,neither hefta nor his attorney filed the proof of claim form prior to the bar date.
instead,hefta filed a motion for relief from automatic stay with the bankruptcy court on august.the next day,counsel for hefta received via fax an objection to that motion on the grounds that the bar date had passed.hefta counsel claims that only then did he realize that the bar date had passed.on august,hefta counsel filed a motion for enlargement of time to file proof of claim seeking an extension for excusable neglect under federal bankruptcy rule of procedure b.hefta counsel subsequently also argued to the bankruptcy court that his february,letter constituted an informal proof of claim.the bankruptcy court denied both motions initially and upon reconsideration.the district court affirmed each of those orders.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the bankruptcy court had subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to.the district court had appellate jurisdiction over the final order of the bankruptcy court pursuant to a.we have jurisdiction pursuant to d,and.in reviewing the decision of the bankruptcy court,we exercise the same standard of review as the district court,that is,we review the bankruptcy court legal determinations de novo,its factual findings for clear error,and its exercise of discretion for abuse thereof.see manus nrg energy,in re envtl.energy,cir.thus,we review de novo the question of law as to whether hefta february,letter constituted an informal proof of claim,and we review the bankruptcy court determination regarding the existence of excusable neglect for abuse of discretion.see,lafayette metals,in re,cir informal proof of claim issue jones chemetron,cir excusable neglect issue.
iii.informal proof of claim 
hefta primary argument is that his february,letter to the claims agent was an informal proof of claim properly filed prior to the bar date.specifically,he contends that the current law of this court does not require a formal pleading or that the proof of claim be sent to a court.debtors respond that bankruptcy law almost universally recognizes certain pleading and proof requirements for a properly filed proof of claim,which hefta did not meet,and that,in any event,hefta letter was too vague to actually put debtors on notice of hefta claim.
we addressed the requirements for a proof of claim for the first time nearly one hundred years ago in first bank of woodbury west in re thompson,cir.in thompson,the issue was whether a letter from a bank to the receiver in bankruptcy,stating that the debtor was indebted to the bank for,was insufficient to constitute a valid proof of claim.the court observed that the letter was a mere statement that the bank was a creditor and that,in any event,no claim could then have been made against the bankrupt estate because the estate had not yet come into being.id.at.accordingly,the court refused to permit a late claim and held that the allegedly timely letter from a creditor did not qualify as a proof of claim.the court specifically noted that the bank letter did not meet the requirements of even an informal proof of claim because the letter failed to state a demand against the estate,and failed to show the creditor intention to hold the estate liable.id.at.those requirements for a proof of claim have remained constant over the decades.
in more recent times,a number of courts of appeals have elaborated on the requirements for a proof of claim in the bankruptcy context and have adopted a slightly more exacting test.see barlow waterman,in re waterman,cir nikoloutsos nikoloutsos in re nikoloutsos,cir clark valley fed.sav.loan ass in re reliance equities,cir.under the test,a document will qualify as an informal proof of claim in bankruptcy only if it is in writing,contains a demand by the creditor on the bankruptcy estate,expresses an intent to hold the debtor liable for the debt,and the document is filed with the bankruptcy court see waterman,at.if a document meets those four requirements,the bankruptcy court must determine whether,given the particular surrounding facts of the case,it would be equitable to treat the document as a proof of claim.id.courts within our circuit have already applied that test.see,agassi planet hollywood int l,in re petrucci.
petitioner argues that the test is inconsistent with thompson.we disagree.in thompson we pointed out two deficiencies but did not purport to establish a comprehensive test.we stated only that w hether formal or informal,a claim must show as the word itself implies that a demand is made against the estate,and must show the creditor intention to hold the estate liable.thompson,at.the facts of that case did not require the court to explain precisely what constitutes a demand.while we note that the test enumerates several factors in addition to those identified in thompson,it is entirely consistent with the holding in that case,and,we believe,it more accurately identifies the requirements for a properly filed proof of claim.
the modern formulation of the test in thompson reflects significant changes in the administration of bankruptcy over the last nine decades.not only are modern bankruptcy courts themselves creatures of intervening statutes,but also,bankruptcy proceedings today,including those initiated by american classic,are of a scale and complexity unforeseen in.bankruptcy proceedings are now governed by elaborate rules of procedure designed to make that scale and complexity manageable.
two requirements in the test are absent in thompson that informal proofs of claim must be in writing and that they must be filed with the bankruptcy court those two new factors are justified,however,by specific rules of bankruptcy procedure.first,rule a defines a proof of claim as a written statement setting forth a creditor claim.fed.a.second,rule a provides,with certain s
