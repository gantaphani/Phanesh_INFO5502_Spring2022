this case presents the question of whether a bankruptcy court may limit a prior order where the prior order granted relief not permitted by the bankruptcy code.here,the bankruptcy court issued an order approving the assumption of a workers compensation insurance policy under of the bankruptcy code.the bankruptcy court later concluded that the assumption order violated because it allowed the assumption of a contract.relying on federal rule of civil procedure b,applied to bankruptcy proceedings by federal rule of bankruptcy procedure,the bankruptcy court interpreted the assumption order to comply with.we hold that the bankruptcy court properly relied upon federal rule of civil procedure b in limiting its prior order to ensure that the order complied with the bankruptcy code.accordingly,we affirm.
international fibercom,ifci or debtor filed for bankruptcy under chapter of the bankruptcy code on february.at that time,ifci had a workers compensation insurance policy with zurich american insurance zurich,but the policy was set to expire on february.weeks earlier,zurich expressed its intent not to renew the policy upon expiration.applicable laws required ifci to maintain workers compensation insurance in order to continue operating.consequently,ifci needed to replace zurich policy in order to continue operating until it could sell its business as a going concern.although ifci attempted to find another insurer prior to the petition date,it was unable to do so because other insurance companies had no interest in doing business with an ailing telecommunications company whose financial weakness was known throughout the industry.as a result,ifci requested that zurich renew the policy and eventually negotiated an extension of the policy until ifci could sell its business.
under ifci original workers compensation insurance policy with zurich,ifci paid an annual premium of,which had already been paid before the petition date.the policy also required ifci to pay a deductible on any workers compensation claim paid by zurich.in addition,ifci set aside in initial collateral to secure its reimbursement obligations in case of default.
as required by arizona law and similar state statutes,the original workers compensation insurance policy contained the following provision your ifci default or the bankruptcy or insolvency of you or your estate will not relieve us zurich of our duties under this insurance after an injury occurs.
ifci and zurich eventually agreed to assume the policy pursuant to of the bankruptcy code,effectively extending the policy from february to july.in consideration,ifci agreed to pay an additional premium for the extension.ifci also agreed to provide an additional in additional collateral to secure its obligation to reimburse zurich for deductibles arising under the assumed policy.zurich would have a first priority lien on the additional collateral.if the initial collateral and additional collateral were insufficient to provide full reimbursement of the deductible amounts due to zurich,zurich would be entitled to an administrative claim under a.ifci and zurich also agreed to a brief extension of the original policy until march so that the bankruptcy court could approve ifci request to assume the policy.
ifci filed a motion for entry of an order approving assumption of the policy on march,in its assumption motion,ifci requested the bankruptcy court approval of the assumption of its workers compensation insurance policy,as required by a.at the same time,ifci also filed a motion for an emergency hearing on the assumption motion.notice of the assumption motion and motion for emergency hearing was served on counsel for the official committee of unsecured creditors creditors committee,which the trustee appointed approximately two weeks before the assumption motion was filed.notice was also served on the trustee and three creditors.the bankruptcy court initially scheduled the emergency hearing for march,but,because no objections to the assumption motion were filed,the bankruptcy court did not hold a hearing.
on march,the bankruptcy court issued an order granting ifci request for approval of the assumption of the workers compensation insurance policy.the bankruptcy court assumption order approved the terms and conditions presented in ifci assumption motion and extended the policy through july,the assumption order also required ifci to immediately establish a segregated account and deposit into such account the sum of.the bankruptcy court further provided zurich a first priority lien on the funds in the additional collateral account for the purpose of securing zurich entitlement to reimbursement for disbursements made to workers compensation claimants up to the deductible amount provided for under the policy.
ifci never in fact established the additional collateral account after the bankruptcy court issued the assumption order.not only did ifci fail to set aside the additional collateral,ifci also failed to pay deductibles due to zurich under the policy.in response,zurich filed motions for allowance of administrative expense and relief from the automatic stay in october.discovery and briefing on the motions continued until the bankruptcy court granted ifci motion to convert its bankruptcy petition from chapter to chapter on august.at that time,the bankruptcy court appointed maureen gaughan as trustee for ifci estate.shortly thereafter,the bankruptcy court vacated the scheduling order and the motions were never decided.
zurich later filed a motion for summary judgment on march,in which it requested release of the additional collateral in order to cover ifci unpaid reimbursement obligations.by the time zurich filed its summary judgment motion,deductibles accrued under the initial and extended terms of the policy amounted to nearly million,exceeding the total of both the initial collateral of and the in additional collateral.in its summary judgment motion,zurich requested that the bankruptcy court order ifci to establish the additional collateral account out of the proceeds of the sale of its assets,the assets of the estate and then permit zurich to exercise its rights to the funds in the account.importantly,zurich did not reveal in its summary judgment motion that virtually all of the claims for which it sought reimbursement arose from injuries that occurred prior to the petition date.
opposing zurich motion for summary judgment,the trustee filed a motion to clarify or partially vacate the bankruptcy court assumption order,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b and federal rule of bankruptcy procedure,on may.according to the trustee,zurich was not entitled to have any of the deductibles resulting from injuries that arose prior to the petition date reimbursed as administrative expenses because the policy was not an executory contract and,therefore,could not be assumed pursuant to.the only legally permissible effect of the assumption order,according to the trustee,was to approve an extension of the policy and authorize payment of claims as secured administrative expenses.
according to zurich own data,only about of the nearly individual workers compensation claims for which zurich seeks reimbursement arose from injuries that occurred after the petition date.those claims add up to only approximately of the nearly million sought by zurich.if the trustee were ordered to pay zurich out of ifci estate,nearly half of the estate total assets would be removed,thus adversely affecting other creditors.as a result,the trustee requested that the bankruptcy court either clarify ambiguous language in the assumption order to limit the assumption order to claims or partially vacate the assumption order.
the bankruptcy court issued an order on july,in which it granted the trustee motion to clarify the assumption order.see zurich am.ins.int l fibercom,in re int l fibercom.in that order,the bankruptcy court concluded that the policy was not an executory contract and,consequently,could not be assumed under.id.at.the bankruptcy court further found that ifci assumption motion failed to comply with the notice and conspicuousness requirements of the bankruptcy court general order.id.at.for those reasons,the bankruptcy court interpreted its prior assumption order so that it does not do violence to the bankruptcy code priority scheme,and general order.id.at.in doing so,the bankruptcy court pointed to ambiguous language in the assumption order regarding which claims were covered by the extended policy.
the order merely provides that zurich is hereby granted a first priority lien on the funds on deposit in the additional collateral account,for the purpose of securing zurich entitlement to reimbursement for disbursements made to workers compensation claimants up to the deductible amount provided for under the wc insurance policy.this does not make clear whether the security is only for claims arising during the extended,period of the policy,or whether it also secures claims that arose.
id.because ifci stated in its assumption motion that it was current on its reimbursement obligations to zurich,the bankruptcy court found that the parties believed,and the court would have been justified in concluding,that there were no prepetition obligations to be secured.id.therefore,the bankruptcy court interpreted the assumption order to secure only those deductible reimbursement obligations that pertain to claims that accrued,with respect to workers whose injury occurred on or after february.id.at.as a result of the bankruptcy court order,only the approximately in claims stemming from injuries would be secured administrative expense claims the rest of the claims would be unsecured claims 
after the bankruptcy court issued its order clarifying the assumption order,zurich moved pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure a to alter or amend the order,for rehearing,and for a full evidentiary hearing.the bankruptcy court denied that motion.zurich then appealed the bankruptcy court clarification of the assumption order and denial of an evidentiary hearing to the district court,which affirmed the bankruptcy court decision on june.zurich timely appealed the district court affirmance to this court.

at issue in this appeal is whether a bankruptcy court may grant relief from a prior order under federal rule of civil procedure b due to legal error and procedural violations.rule b,incorporated to bankruptcy proceedings by federal rule of bankruptcy procedure,provides in pertinent part 
on motion and upon such terms as are just,the court may relieve a party or a party legal representative from a final judgment,order,or proceeding for the following reasons mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or excusable neglect the judgment is void or any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.the motion shall be made within a reasonable time,and for reasons,and not more than one year after the judgment,order,or proceeding was entered or taken.this rule does not limit the power of a court to entertain an independent action to relieve a party from a judgment,order,or proceeding,or to set aside a judgment for fraud upon the court.
fed civ.b.rule b compliments the discretionary power that bankruptcy courts have as courts of equity to reconsider,modify or vacate their previous orders so long as no intervening rights have become vested in reliance on the orders.meyer lenox in re lenox,cir citing chinichian campolongo in re chinichian,cir taylor lake in re cada,cir.that equitable power is established by a of the bankruptcy code,which provides that a bankruptcy court may,sua sponte,tak e any action or mak e any determination necessary or appropriate to enforce or implement court orders or rules,or to prevent an abuse of process.a see also in re superior toy,cir in addition to the court discretionary power,trustees may seek relief pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.
in limiting its prior order,the bankruptcy court pointed to legal error as the basis for its clarification of the assumption order.the provision of rule b provides that a bankruptcy court may relieve a party from an order for any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.b.and errors of law are cognizable under rule b.liberty mut.ins.eeoc,cir.
we have stated in the past that rule b should be liberally applied,hammer,at,to accomplish justice.yanow weyerhaeuser,cir quoting klapprott united states.at the same time,j udgments are not often set aside under rule b.latshaw trainer wortham,cir.rather,rule b should be used sparingly as an equitable remedy to prevent manifest injustice and is to be utilized only where extraordinary circumstances prevented a party from taking timely action to prevent or correct an erroneous judgment.united states washington,cir quoting united states alpine land reservoir,cir.accordingly,a party who moves for such relief must demonstrate both injury and circumstances beyond his control that prevented him from proceeding with the action in a proper fashion.community dental servs.tani,cir.
the bankruptcy court correctly found that extraordinary circumstances justified reconsidering the assumption order because the order erroneously granted assumption of a contract,thereby violating of the bankruptcy code.under,a debtor may assume the obligations of any executory contract,subject to the bankruptcy court approval.a.a contract is executory,and therefore assumable under,only if one party failure to perform its obligation would excuse the other party performance.commercial union ins.texscan in re texscan,cir pac.express,teknekron infoswitch in re pac.express,cir quoting vern countryman,executory contracts in bankruptcy part i.in texscan,we held that a workers compensation insurance policy was not executory under because,pursuant to arizona law,the insurance company was required to continue processing claims despite the debtor bankruptcy petition.texscan,at quoting.even if the debtor in texscan failed to pay its premiums or otherwise breached the contract,the insurance company would be obligated to continue covering workers compensation claims that arose prior to the policy expiration.id.
the workers compensation insurance policy between zurich and ifci contained a provision based on the same arizona statute involved in texscan.specifically,the policy contained the following qualification your default or the bankruptcy or insolvency of you or your estate will not relieve us of our duties under this insurance after an injury occurs.that provision was mandated by arizona revised statute consequently,if ifci failed to pay its premiums or failed to reimburse zurich for deductibles,zurich would be contractually and legally obligated to continue performing under the contract by covering workers compensation claims,despite ifci breach.therefore,the workers compensation insurance policy in this case is clearly not executory under texscan.the bankruptcy court thus correctly concluded that its assumption order granted relief inconsistent with.
zurich arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive.first,zurich attempts to distinguish texscan on the ground that the case involved a policy that had already expired prior to the petition date,whereas the policy in this case was still in effect at the time of the bankruptcy petition but would have expired if not for the assumption order.zurich fails to explain why that distinction is meaningful.a policy pending expiration does not transform it from to executory,and zurich provides no reason to believe that the expiration date is relevant to whether a contract is assumable under.second,zurich attempts to distinguish this case from texscan by arguing that renewal of the policy required both debtor and zurich to undertake additional material obligations,none of which had yet been performed and which were therefore executory.zurich does not state which material obligations in particular made the renewal of the policy executory.presumably,such obligations would include ifci payment of the additional premium,establishment of the additional collateral account,and reimbursement of deductibles.the facts of this case demonstrate,however,that those material obligations did not render the policy executory.after all,ifci failed to establish the additional collateral account,but zurich does not contend that ifci failure would have excused its performance.additionally,zurich continued to pay workers compensation claims and advance ifci deductibles,as it was contractually and legally required to do,even after ifci stopped reimbursing zurich.thus,the policy was not executory despite those additional obligations.finally,zurich argues that the arizona statute does not render the policy because the statute allows an insurer to refuse to cover claims from injuries arising after the insured files for bankruptcy.according to zurich,filing for bankruptcy would excuse the insurer performance going forward,such that claims arising from injuries that occur after the petition date would not be covered by the policy.the text of the statute does not support zurich argument.in fact,the statute states that bankruptcy of the employer shall not relieve the insurance carrier from payment of compensation for injuries or death sustained by an employee during the life of the policy.emphasis added.as such,the language of the statute expressly prohibits such termination of coverage.similarly,nothing in our opinion in texscan supports such a reading of the statute.even the text of the policy in this case does not support zurich interpretation.therefore,we reject zurich attempt to characterize its workers compensation insurance policy with ifci as executory.because the workers compensation insurance policy was and,therefore,under,there was no legal basis on which zurich could obtain a lien on ifci assets to secure claims arising under the policy.
in addition to requesting relief not permitted by the bankruptcy code,ifci assumption motion also violated the bankruptcy court notice and conspicuousness requirements.general order requires that any first day motion must conspicuously state in the first or second paragraph whether the bankruptcy court approval would result in.granting a prepetition creditor a lien or security interest in petition assets in which the creditor would not otherwise have a security interest by virtue of its prepetition security agreement and applicable law sometimes known as.general order also provides that such relief will not be granted unless an official creditors committee has had sufficient time to organize,engage professionals,and investigate the requested relief.a first day motion is defined as any motion for which an accelerated hearing is sought within the first days after the filing of a chapter petition.zurich does not dispute that ifci assumption motion was filed within the first days and was accompanied by a motion for an emergency hearing.consequently,the district court correctly found that general order applied on its face to the assumption motion.
nevertheless,zurich argues that general order does not apply to any assumption motion whatsoever.general order applies only to a lien on assets that the creditor would not otherwise have by virtue of its prepetition security agreement and applicable law.emphasis added.according to zurich,its lien on the additional collateral was created by virtue of applicable law when the contract was assumed under.zurich argument is misguided for two reasons.first,general order uses and as a connector,not or.for general order not to apply,the original,workers compensation insurance policy would also have to grant zurich a lien on ifci assets.it does.second,even if constitutes the applicable law referred to in general order,does not grant zurich a lien on the additional collateral because the workers compensation insurance policy was and.therefore,contrary to zurich assertions,general order applied to the assumption motion.
the assumption motion failed to comply with general order because the motion was granted before the creditors committee professionals had sufficient time to review it more importantly,at no point did the motion state that the requested relief would result in.the motion did state that zurich would have a first priority lien on the additional collateral,but it also stated that ifci was current on its reimbursement obligations to zurich.consequently,the motion facially appears to request a lien on the additional collateral only for workers compensation claims arising.both the bankruptcy court and the district court found that statement misled the bankruptcy court into believing that ifci had satisfied all of its obligations to zurich and,as a result,that no claims would be elevated to secured claims in fact,the bankruptcy court went so far as to state that c learly,if it had been brought to the court attention that the contract was not executory and that the effect of granting the debtor motion would be to secure the debtor prepetition obligation to reimburse zurich for the deductibles incurred on claims arising prepetition,this court would not have granted the motion.int l fibercom,at.thus,not only did the assumption motion fail to comply with general order,but that failure affected the outcome of the proceeding.as a result,the bankruptcy court properly clarified the assumption order under rule b so that it would comply with general order.
zurich argues that the trustee,as ifci successor in interest,is not legally permitted to challenge the actions of ifci as the in general,a s the successor in interest,the trustee is bound by all authorized acts of the debtor in possession.nicholas united states,d.the purpose for such a rule,as correctly highlighted by zurich,is that c reditors must be able to deal freely with,within the confines of the bankruptcy laws,without fear of retribution or reversal at the hands of a later appointed trustee.armstrong norwest bank,cir.zurich argument misses the mark,however,because it implies that a trustee is bound by the earlier actions of a even if those actions are inconsistent with the bankruptcy code.but a trustee may challenge a actions in extraordinary circumstances,such as where a acted outside the confines of the bankruptcy laws.see superior toy,at.where,as here,the bankruptcy court unknowingly approved an assumption order that unlawfully assumed a contract,the trustee may seek relief pursuant to rule b.see id.
zurich also asserts that the bankruptcy court could not alter,amend,or reinterpret the assumption order once zurich had detrimentally relied.in lenox,we held that,in the absence of vested rights,bankruptcy courts have broad discretion under rule b to revisit past orders.lenox,at.in this case,there was no detrimental reliance because,absent the extension,zurich was still required to pay claims even if ifci stopped performing.zurich suggestion that it extended the policy only because the assumption order secured ifci claims is misplaced the extension had no impact on zurich prior rights or obligations under the policy.what the assumption order,as interpreted by the bankruptcy court,did do was provide security for claims that arose after the extension.zurich was under no obligation to extend the policy and it was entitled to seek guarantees for doing so.but zurich was not entitled to cut in line in front of other unsecured creditors.while the bankruptcy court clarification prevented zurich from doing this,it did not interfere with any vested rights.
because the assumption order granted relief not permitted by the bankruptcy code and ifci assumption motion violated the bankruptcy court notice and conspicuousness requirements,there were sufficient grounds for clarifying the assumption order
