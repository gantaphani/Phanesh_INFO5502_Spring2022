the two cases before the court involve instances in which the chapter trustee sought to modify a confirmed chapter plan to increase the amount to be paid to the unsecured creditors in the first case,that of stanley and doris goralski,the chapter trustee sought to modify the confirmed chapter plan after the bankruptcy court granted the goralskis permission to refinance the mortgage on their residence.in the refinancing,the goralskis received some of the equity in their residence in cash in exchange for a corresponding amount of debt,and the chapter trustee sought a portion of this money for the further benefit of the unsecured creditors.the goralskis sought to refinance their mortgage primarily because stanley goralski earned income was cut approximately in half,making it difficult for the goralskis to make their plan payments and,at the same time,pay their ordinary and necessary living expenses.in the second case,that of james owen murphy,the chapter trustee sought to modify the confirmed chapter plan after the bankruptcy court granted murphy permission to sell his condominium.the chapter trustee sought a portion of the sale proceeds for the further benefit of the unsecured creditors because,without a modification,murphy stood to pocket in excess of,as his condominium had dramatically increased in value.the bankruptcy court granted the motion to modify in murphy case,but denied it in the goralskis case.see in re murphy.the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court decisions.murphy appeals the decision in his case,as does the chapter trustee in the goralskis case.for the reasons stated below,we affirm.
the facts and procedural history in these two cases are not in dispute and are set forth separately for the reader convenience.
stanley and doris goralski filed a joint chapter petition in the united states bankruptcy court for the eastern district of virginia on april.the schedules filed with the petition reflected that they owned real property located at chevy chase lane,chantilly,virginia,which they valued at.the schedules further reflected that the property was subject to liens in the total amount of.the goralskis listed the sum of as the amount of their unsecured debt.the plan filed by the goralskis with their petition was confirmed without objection on september.it required the goralskis to pay the chapter trustee per month for months and estimated a percent dividend to the unsecured creditors.the goralskis confirmed plan provided that,upon confirmation,a ll property of the estate shall revest in the debtor s.
on october,approximately eighteen months after the chapter petition was filed,the goralskis filed a motion for permission to refinance the mortgage on their residence,which had appreciated significantly in value.as part of the refinancing,the goralskis sought to obtain a portion of the equity in their residence in cash in exchange for a corresponding amount of debt the primary reason given for seeking to refinance was that stanley goralski earned income had been cut approximately in half,making it difficult for the goralskis to make their plan payments and,at the same time,pay their ordinary and necessary living expenses in the motion,the goralskis offered to pay all remaining payments required under the confirmed plan.
at the hearing on the motion,the chapter trustee took the position that,to the extent the proceeds of the refinancing were sufficient to pay all filed claims in full,the goralskis should be required to pay the filed claims at a rate of percent.the bankruptcy court overruled the chapter trustee objection and granted the motion to refinance.the next day,the chapter trustee filed a motion to reconsider,as well as a motion to modify the confirmed plan,asking that the goralskis confirmed plan be modified to require from the refinancing be paid to the chapter trustee to allow for the payment of all filed claims at a rate of percent.
after the bankruptcy court refused to grant the chapter trustee motion for modification and motion for reconsideration,the chapter trustee appealed.following the district court affirmance of the bankruptcy court decision,the chapter trustee appealed to this court.
on december,murphy filed a voluntary chapter petition in the united states bankruptcy court for the eastern district of virginia.on his schedules,he indicated that he owned a condominium located at oakton terrace road,oakton,virginia,which he valued at,subject to a lien of.murphy schedules also listed of unsecured debt.murphy plan,which was confirmed on april,required him to pay the chapter trustee per month for months and projected a percent dividend to the unsecured creditors.like the goralskis confirmed plan,murphy confirmed plan provided that,upon confirmation,a ll property of the estate shall revest in the debtor.
on november,murphy filed a motion for authority to sell his condominium for,explaining that he had obtained a new job in pennsylvania and needed to move in the motion,murphy indicated that he was willing to tender a sum to the chapter trustee sufficient to complete the payment of debtor chapter payments.the chapter trustee did not object to the sale,but stated at the hearing that he needed approximately from the sale to pay the filed unsecured claims in full.murphy objected to paying the chapter trustee anything more than the approximately still owed under the confirmed plan.the bankruptcy court preliminarily ruled that the sale proceeds constituted income that had to be applied to the plan and directed that be turned over to the chapter trustee.because murphy counsel stated that he intended to appeal the ruling,and so that there could be a final order to allow the contract to go to settlement,the order entered by the bankruptcy court simply approved the sale and stated that disposition of the would be the subject of a further order.the bankruptcy court ruling allowed the chapter trustee to disburse up to of the proceeds the amount needed to complete the scheduled plan payments but required the chapter trustee to hold the balance of the pending further order of the court although the ruling technically favored the chapter trustee,the chapter trustee moved for reconsideration and,contemporaneously,moved to modify the plan payments to allow for payment of all pending unsecured claims at a rate of percent.
in its decision,the bankruptcy court modified the confirmed plan to provide for full payment of the pending unsecured claims.on appeal to the district court,the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court ruling.murphy now appeals to this court.
in contrast to a chapter bankruptcy,which involves the liquidation of a debtor assets,a chapter bankruptcy allows the debtor to keep his assets.in a typical chapter bankruptcy,the debtor submits for bankruptcy court approval a plan to pay the debtor creditors his disposable income over a period of three years,and.in exchange for the debtor commitment to part with all of his disposable income,the debtor is given a discharge of his remaining dischargeable debts if he successfully complies with the terms of the plan.in re crawford,cir.although secured claims in a chapter bankruptcy must be paid in full,unsecured creditors need not be paid in full,provided,among other things,the plan is proposed in good faith and the present value of what the unsecured creditors receive under the plan is at least as much as they would receive in a chapter liquidation.a,a.
generally,there are two types of chapter plans.percentage plans designate what percentage each unsecured creditor will receive without specifying an exact amount the debtor must pay into the plan.in re golek.in contrast,pot plans set the exact amount the debtor must pay into the plan,leaving in question the percentage each unsecured creditor will receive until all claims are approved.id.both of the plans in this case are pot plans.
a confirmed chapter plan is a new and binding contract,sanctioned by the court,between the debtors and their creditor s.matter of penrod,see also a the provisions of a confirmed plan bind the debtor and each creditor,whether or not the claim of such creditor is provided for by the plan,and whether or not such creditor has objected to,had accepted,or has rejected the plan.like other contracts,a confirmed chapter plan is subject to modification.in re arnold,cir.
under of the bankruptcy code a confirmed plan may be modified at any time after confirmation of the plan but before the completion of payments at the request of the debtor,the chapter trustee,or an allowed unsecured creditor in order to,among other things,increase or reduce the amount of payments on claims of a particular class provided for by the plan or to extend or reduce the time for such payments.a,a,and a under b,any modification must comply with a and b c and a of the bankruptcy code.id.b.moreover,we review the bankruptcy court decision whether to grant or deny a motion to modify a confirmed plan for an abuse of discretion.in re arnold,at.
we have not set forth a thorough analysis on how a bankruptcy court should analyze a motion for modification pursuant to a or a.in in re arnold,after rejecting several arguments of the debtor,we held that the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion by increasing the debtor monthly payment from to.id.at.in reaching this decision,we held that the doctrine of res judicata prevents modification of a confirmed plan pursuant to a or a unless the party seeking modification demonstrates that the debtor experienced a substantial and unanticipated change in his financial condition.id.at.this doctrine,which is applied in this circuit per in re arnold,ensures that confirmation orders will be accorded the necessary degree of finality,preventing parties from seeking to modify plans when minor and anticipated changes in the debtor financial condition take place.see in re butler,as a matter of sound public policy,as well as appropriate judicial economy,there is no reason why either a creditor or a debtor should be permitted to relitigate issues which were decided in the confirmation order or which were available at the time of confirmation but not raised by the parties.absent this salutary policy,there is no readily available brake on the filing of motions under by creditors and debtors simply hoping to produce a more favorable plan based on the same facts presented at the original confirmation hearing.but see barbosa soloman,cir rejecting doctrine of res judicata as inconsistent with the language of matter of witkowski,cir same.
although we did not define the term substantial in in re arnold,we held that an increase in the debtor salary from per year to per year was a substantial change in the debtor financial condition.at.a change is unanticipated if the debtor present financial condition could not have been reasonably anticipated at the time the plan was confirmed.id.
because the doctrine of res judicata did not prevent modification of the debtor confirmed plan in in re arnold,we proceeded to discuss and reject the one argument the debtor had concerning the requirements of b that he did not have the ability to pay per month under the modified plan.id.at.
simply stated,per in re arnold,when a bankruptcy court is faced with a motion for modification pursuant to a or a,the bankruptcy court must first determine if the debtor experienced a substantial and unanticipated change in his financial condition.this inquiry will inform the bankruptcy court on the question of whether the doctrine of res judicata prevents modification of the confirmed plan.if the change in the debtor financial condition was either insubstantial or anticipated,or both,the doctrine of res judicata will prevent the modification of the confirmed plan.however,if the debtor experienced both a substantial and unanticipated change in his financial condition,then the bankruptcy court can proceed to inquire whether the proposed modification is limited to the circumstances provided by a.if the proposed modification meets one of the circumstances listed in a,then the bankruptcy court can turn to the question of whether the proposed modification complies with b.
in the case of the goralskis,we agree with the bankruptcy court and the district court that,through the refinancing,the goralskis did not experience a substantial change in their financial condition.the record reflects that,although the goralskis residence appreciated in value,stanley goralski earned income had been reduced by approximately.to meet their obligations under the confirmed plan,the goralskis refinanced their existing mortgage,taking a sizeable amount of the equity over in their residence to allow them to continue to meet their financial obligations under the confirmed plan through a lump sum payment or continued periodic payments and to pay their every day living expenses.
all the goralskis did was to eliminate a portion of their equity in the property for cash in exchange for a corresponding amount of debt.thus,even when one considers that the goralskis residence appreciated in value at most,they simply received a large loan in place of a small one.by any stretch,a loan,regardless of the size,is not income.the apparent increase in their balance sheet was offset by the amount of the loan,resulting in virtually no change to their financial condition.to be sure,although the goralskis obtained a lower interest rate on their new loan,this fact alone did not substantially improve their financial condition,especially when one considers the primary reason for the goralski reduced income.under the doctrine of res judicata,there being no substantial change to the goralskis financial condition,the refinancing can not provide a basis for modifying the goralskis confirmed plan pursuant to a or a.
we note that there is considerable disagreement in the courts concerning whether a debtor proposal for an early payoff through the refinancing of a mortgage amounts to a motion for modification of a confirmed plan,thus,requiring an inquiry into the requirements of b before the modification can be granted.see in re brumm,discussing case law.some courts have held that a debtor proposal of an early payoff through refinancing amounts to a motion for plan modification.see,in re keller,in re drew.these courts primarily reason that an early payoff through refinancing reduces the number and the time for making payments under a and a preempts the right of the chapter trustee and the unsecured creditors to propose a modified plan during the remaining term of the confirmed plan should the circumstances warrant such a modification and amounts to a realization of the value of appreciation which is akin to selling property at a substantial gain.in re keller,at in re drew,at.in contrast to these courts,several courts have held that a debtor proposal of an early payoff through refinancing does not amount to a motion for plan modification.see,in re miller.these courts essentially reason that a debtor proposal of an early payoff through refinancing does not change the substance of the confirmed plan and actually increases the economic worth of the plan to the creditors by paying them off early.id.at.
if we were to write on a clean slate,we would find ourselves struggling much like these other courts have struggled.however,we are not writing on a clean slate.under in re arnold,a debtor must experience a substantial and unanticipated change in his financial condition before his confirmed plan can be modified pursuant to a or a.a debtor proposal of an early payoff through the refinancing of a mortgage simply does not alter the financial condition of the debtor and,therefore,can not provide a basis for the modification of a confirmed plan pursuant to a or a.
we also observe that our decision clearly strikes the right balance between debtors on the one hand and creditors on the other.our decision encourages refinancing when the debtor is struggling under less advantageous loan terms,which,by implication,puts the future stream of payments to creditors under the chapter plan at risk.in re brumm,at.as noted by the court in in re brumm,lower payments on long term debt,which often is achieved through lower interest rates on a refinancing,gives a debtor greater short term financial stability.id.moreover,our decision encourages refinancing when the debtor inco
