a bankruptcy trustee,who acts in the interests of the debtor general creditors,may acquire for the bankruptcy estate a greater right to a debtor real property than the debtor himself had.in particular,if there is a lien on a piece of property,the bankruptcy estate may take the property free of the lien that is,avoid the lien if the lien would not bind a hypothetical bona fide purchaser bfp of the property from the debtor.on this appeal we must decide whether this rule permits a trustee to avoid a mortgage on the ground that it misstates the lot number in its description of the property.
washington mutual bank the bank holds a recorded mortgage on the house of the debtors in this case,jorge colon and antoinette.the mortgage recites the correct street address and parcel identification number for the house but misstates the lot number.the bankruptcy court,affirmed by this circuit bankruptcy appellate panel bap,held,applying kansas law,that because of this error a purchaser would not be on constructive notice of the bank mortgage.it therefore allowed the bankruptcy trustee,jan hamilton,to avoid the mortgage.we disagree and reverse because a purchaser is deemed to know the contents of recorded documents in the debtors chain of title and,armed with this knowledge,a reasonably prudent purchaser would readily discover that the bank mortgage encumbers the debtors house.
the parties and the courts below were apparently unaware of bacon lederbrand,which holds that a purchaser of real estate in kansas is deemed to have notice of the contents of all the prior recorded deeds and mortgages in the grantor chain of title,id.at emphasis added,not just the contents of the county register indices.the purchaser is chargeable with notice of the facts appearing upon their face,and also with knowledge of all facts suggested therein,and which,with the exercise of reasonable prudence and diligence,he might have ascertained.id.internal quotation marks omitted.here,recorded documents in the debtors chain of title give the same street address and parcel identification number as the bank mortgage,together with the correct lot number.a recorded subordination agreement also clearly indicates that the bank mortgage is on the same property as the subordinated second mortgage on the debtors house.we hold that one exercising reasonable prudence and diligence,would have determined that the bank has a mortgage on the debtors house.therefore,the mortgage can not be avoided by the trustee.
we now summarize the proceedings below.then we turn to the authority overlooked in those proceedings,explaining why that authority requires reversal and distinguishing the cases relied upon by the bankruptcy court,the bap,and the trustee.
background 
under a a bankruptcy trustee can avoid a mortgage if it could be avoided by a hypothetical lien creditor or by a hypothetical bfp of the property.the trustee power to avoid transfers under this provision of the bankruptcy code is known as the strong arm power.morris hicks in re hicks,cir see collier on bankruptcy lawrence king,ed referring to a as the strong arm clause.the status and rights of the hypothetical lien creditor and bfp are determined by state law.see watkins watkins,cir midlantic bank bridge in re bridge,cir.under kansas law a purchaser for value who has neither constructive notice,see beams werth,nor actual notice,see larson operating petroleum,d,of an the property free of the encumbrance.see miller alexander,d.
after the debtors filed for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code,the trustee filed an adversary proceeding in april to avoid the bank mortgage on the debtors house under.that mortgage was created in to secure the debtors refinancing of a mortgage on their house at sw moundview drive in topeka,kansas.the mortgage was recorded with the shawnee county register of deeds.it correctly stated the house address and its parcel identification number which is assigned by the county clerk and used by the county appraiser for tax purposes.but it also described the property as lot in arrowhead heights subdivision,when the correct description is lot in the subdivision.the trustee based his avoidance claim on this error in the lot number.
the bank filed a motion for summary judgment,which was denied by the bankruptcy court.the court ruled that the trustee avoidance claim turned on whether he could prove that the mortgage filed by the bank would not show up in the chain of title during a reasonable title search in the office of the register of deeds,and thus that the mortgage,as recorded,was insufficient to provide constructive notice.vol.i at order setting mot.for scheduling conference.it set a bench trial on that issue.
at trial the title documents,the facts surrounding the debtors ownership of the property,and the mortgage history of the property were submitted by stipulation.the relevant recorded documents show the following 
the deed by which the debtors acquired the property gives the sellers address as sw moundview and contains the correct lot number for the conveyed property.in text aligned vertically along the left edge of the page,it states property address sw moundview.vol.iii at.
the mortgage,filed with the county register one minute after the deed,describes the property as lot the correct number,arrowhead heights subdivision,which has the address of sw moundview id.at.
a second mortgage on the property,given by the debtors in may and recorded on june,similarly provides the property correct lot number and street address in the property description it also recites tax id.id.at.
as previously noted,the mortgage at issue which was later transferred to the bank,filed on april,contains the incorrect lot number but the correct street address and parcel identification number.it recites that the mortgage secures the following described property located in the county of shawnee lot not,arrowhead heights subdivision,in the city of topeka,shawnee county,kansas.parcel id number which currently has the address of sw moundview topeka,kansas.id.at.
filed a few minutes later is a subordination agreement,which subordinates the second mortgage to the bank mortgage.it contains the same error as the bank mortgage.the agreement describes the second mortgage as a mortgage covering property located at sw moundview,topeka,ks property recorded on,as book,page and lot,arrowhead heights subdivision.the bracketed language was inserted through a footnote in the document.the book and page numbers accurately refer to the original second mortgage,which recited the correct lot number.id.at.
the release,filed on may,of the mortgage contains the correct lot number and lists the debtors mailing address as sw moundview 
the trustee called as a witness the shawnee county register of deeds,who testified that one could search for documents in her office by book and page numbers,by a person name,and by legal description,but not by street address.id.at.the term legal description is sometimes used as the label for a property description by block and lot number in a named subdivision.but see black law dictionary,ed defining legal description a formal description of real property complete enough that a particular piece of land can be located and identified the description can be made by reference to a government survey,metes and bounds,or lot numbers of a recorded plat.she did not describe the format of the indices or other search tools available in her office.
the trustee also submitted an expert report by kyle mead,an examining attorney for a local company.mead opined as follows 
i f a reasonable title search was conducted in the office of the shawnee county register of deeds,based on the proper legal description of the subject property,which is lot,arrowhead heights subdivision,in the city of topeka,shawnee county,kansas,the mortgage in question would not be found.if a reasonable title search was conducted in the office of the shawnee county register of deeds,based on the name of the debtor,which search would list all mortgages which the debtor had executed,the mortgage in question would be found,but it would not show that the subject property was intended to be encumbered,because the legal description appearing on the mortgage is lot,arrowhead heights subdivision,in the city of topeka,shawnee county,kansas.
the basis for these opinions is that standard title industry search procedure is to search using the proper legal description for the property as the primary identifier.the information used in forming these opinions is training and experience,and collected experience in the industry,and as reflected in the kansas title standards handbook.
id.vol.i at.
the bank called mead to the stand.he testified that his company does not search records at the register office but images all documents filed with the register and maintains its own files.office personnel then extract relevant information from the document and enter it in the company database.among the information placed in the database is the property street address.he indicated that the street address is important information for his work and that as a title insurer he would have needed to investigate whether the bank mortgage was the replacement for the mortgage.thus,the search he was asked to perform for his report to the trustee was not as extensive as what he would perform if asked to insure a purchase of the house.on by the trustee,however,mead said that he would not expect a reasonably prudent person to conduct as extensive a search as a title company performs and that the legal description is the keystone for determining the location of real estate because it is more stable than a street address or parcel identification number.id.vol.iii at.he added that using street addresses and parcel numbers as the standard would create problems for title companies because they are not uniform.id.at.mead also reiterated the essence of the first of the paragraphs of his report.with respect to the second quoted paragraph,he conceded on direct examination by the bank that the kansas title standards handbook,a manual,does not provide guidance on how to conduct a title search,and he could not point to any kansas statute that gives priority to a legal description by block and lot numbers over any other form of description of the property.no other witnesses testified.
the bank contended that the trustee was charged with constructive notice of its mortgage.it argued that because the mortgage document identified the debtors as mortgagors and identified the property by its street address and parcel identification number,and because kansas law requires only that the property description be sufficient to identify the property,a purchaser would be on notice that the debtors house was the property intended to secure the mortgage.it also argued that kansas law requires a purchaser to examine the contents of recorded documents in a property chain of title and that the other mortgage documents affecting the property were sufficient to put a purchaser on constructive notice 
consideration of the street address and parcel identification number,and the mortgage as the last in the chain of title of a series of succeeding mortgages that had included a legal description using lot would compel a reasonable purchaser to draw the conclusion that the mortgage was given on lot at sw moundview drive,or to ask more questions about what property the mortgage covered.
id.vol.i at.
the trustee countered that a reasonable search of the records kept by the shawnee county register of deeds would not put a purchaser on notice of the bank lien on the debtors house.a search for lot the correct lot number in the numerical index for the tract would not turn up the mortgage,he contended,and a search under the debtors names would show the bank mortgage to encumber a different lot lot.further,because the register of deeds does not index documents by street address or parcel identification number,the bank theory that these descriptions should provide constructive notice would upset the title standards of the state and require extraordinary searches to ensure good title.id.vol.iii at.
the bankruptcy court ruled in the trustee favor.see hamilton.mut.bank,fa in re colon.it found that r ecords maintained by the register of deeds reflect that this mortgage was indexed with records relating to lot.id.at.although it was properly in the grantor index under debtors last name,a review of the grantor index would have shown that previously granted a mortgage on a different lot in the same subdivision,in.id.the court defined the issue as whether a purchaser 
would have been put on constructive notice of the bank mortgage given the defective legal description t he court must decide,under the facts of this case,what steps a reasonably cautious person would take to obtain good title,including whether a bfp is required to search beyond the index and physically peruse the text of the underlying instrument to determine if the legal description is correct and,even if such a duty exists,whether the review of the mortgage would have put the trustee on constructive notice of the mortgage against this particular piece of property.
id.at.the court later explained that a reasonable person need not undertake the search that would be performed by a title examining company,which has greater expertise,resources,and exposure to liability than an ordinary person.id.at.
the bankruptcy court described kansas case law as stating that s ubsequent purchasers are charged with constructive notice of the presence and contents of recorded interests in land if the interest is sufficiently described,id.internal quotation marks omitted,and that c onstructive notice is implied when it consists of knowledge of facts so informing that a reasonably cautious person would be prompted to inquire further.id.quoting miller,at.it emphasized language in luthi evans,that the purpose of the recording statutes is to give subsequent purchasers notice of instruments which affect the title to a specific tract of land in which the subsequent purchaser is interested at the time,and that a property description is adequate if it identifies the property or affords the means of identification within the instrument itself or by specific reference to other instruments recorded in the office of the register of deeds.id.at quoted in in re colon,at.
the court placed its principal reliance,however,on hollinger imperial warehouse,whose facts it called fairly similar to ours.in re colon,at.the error in that case arose from confusion between two additions to the city of wichita that had been laid out and platted by a english.one addition was english addition the other was english fifth addition.the kansas supreme court held that a mortgage describing the subject property as lot of english addition,rather than correctly describing it as lot of english fifth addition,did not impart constructive notice.even if the defendant in the case,or the abstracter as his agent,had a duty to search the contents of the mortgage because of the common grantor,an examination of the record of the mortgage at length would have disclosed that it purported to be a lien upon another lot in another addition,and did not purport to be a lien upon the lot the title to which they were then searching.hollinger,at.nothing in the mortgage would cause an examiner of the record of the title to lot of english fifth addition to suspect that the mortgage was intended to be a lien upon this lot.id.the bankruptcy court followed hollinger 
i t is clear that had a bfp examined the index kept under the legal description for lot of arrowhead heights subdivision,it would not have found the bank mortgage in lot recorded under lot of the same subdivision.even if a bona fide purchaser the trustee,here had somehow become aware of the existence of the mortgage on lot by looking at grantor indices,for example,and had chosen to examine the actual mortgage,nothing in that mortgage would have informed the purchaser that the colons did not also own lot in arrowhead heights subdivision,or that the recorded mortgage contained any error.
in re colon,at.
the court rejected the bank argument that the presence of the correct street address and parcel identification number in the mortgage would suffice for notice.because the register of deeds does not index recorded instruments using either of those identifiers,the court reasoned,there would be no way to other records on that if there were a duty to other records,a question the court thought it unnecessary to decide.
the bankruptcy court distinguished hildebrandt hildebrandt,d.the deed at issue in hildebrandt misstated the section number,but the correct number appeared in the description later in the document,as did the name hildebrandt island,which encompassed the property.taken together,this information afford ed a reasonably certain and sufficient means of identification within the deed itself for identifying the property conveyed.id.at.the bankruptcy court said that hildebrandt was inapposite because nothing within the four corners of the bank mortgage would put an innocent purchaser researching the title to this property on notice that he needed to check further.in re colon,at.
finally,the court rejected the bank argument that the subordination agreement provided constructive notice,stating that the agreement misidentified the mortgaged property as lot and was also erroneously recorded under lot.id.
the bankruptcy court therefore held that because of the mortgage error in the lot number,a subsequent purchaser would not be on constructive notice of the mortgage under kansas law,and the trustee could avoid the mortgage as a hypothetical bfp under a or as a hypothetical lien creditor under a.
the bankruptcy appellate panel affirmed,adopting the bankruptcy court reasoning that the mortgage erroneous lot number precluded constructive notice to a purchaser.see hamilton.mut.bank,fa in re colon.it held,however,that because the bankruptcy court decision under a was correct,there was no need to review its decision with respect to a.id.at.
ii.discussion 
w e treat the bap as a subordinate appellate tribunal whose rulings are not entitled to any deference although they certainly may be persuasive.we review matters of law de novo,and with respect to factual findings which are made only by the bankruptcy court,not the bap,we review for clear error.mathai warren in re warren,cir.
resolution of this appeal requires us to determine to what extent a purchaser is put on notice of the contents of title documents properly filed with a county register of deeds in kansas.the applicable kansas statute,originally enacted in,would appear to state that one is on notice of the contents of every properly filed document.stat.ann.states 
every such instrument in writing conveying an interest in land,certified and recorded in the manner hereinbefore prescribed that is,by a county register of deeds under.stat.ann,shall,from the time of filing the same with the register of deeds for record,impart notice to all persons of the contents thereof and all subsequent purchasers and mortgagees shall be deemed to purchase with notice.
but no one could be expected to read every document filed with the county register.accordingly,the kansas statutes provide for indexing.two indices are required by.stat.ann.for every filed instrument one lists the instruments in alphabetical order by the name of each grantor,see id.a the other is an alphabetical index by the name of each grantee,see id.b.in addition,counties have the option which the great majority of counties have exercised to provide numerical indices of instruments of conveyance,generally one index for each quarter section.see id,miller,at.
the requirement of grantor and grantee indices is unsurprising because the standard method for title searches has long been to examine the chain of title.a vendor chain of title is the chain of recorded conveyances made to the successive holders of the record title and those made by them while respectively the holders thereof.iv james casner et,american law of property at.a search for a property confirms or disproves the right of the purported owner to transfer an interest in the property.the searcher first constructs a chain of grantors of the property,using the grantee index to find the deed to the purported owner from a prior grantor,returning to the grantee index to find the deed to that prior grantor from an earlier grantor,and continuing that process for an appropriate period of time.the searcher then uses the grantor index to find all conveyances by each grantor during the period of the grantor ownership of the property and examines each conveyance to determine whether the property conveyed is the property of interest.see id.at id.at james karp elliot klayman,real estate law ed.any conveyance in the grantor index during the period of the grantor ownership must be checked to see whether it affects the concerned parcel.harry cross,the record chain of title hypocrisy,colum,description of search francis philbrick,limits of record search and therefore of notice,disagreeing with the implicit view of tiffany,the law of real property ed,that every deed from a grantor in the chain of title must be examined in extenso,and instead suggesting that the examination of the deed can be limited to the description of the land,unless the described land is the property of interest.the conveyances in the chain of title must then be thoroughly examined.t he law assumes that a prudent purchaser would inspect records in the grantor chain of title and treats him on the basis of his having knowledge of their contents.casner,supra,at see cross,supra,at requiring study of the transactions discovered through the indices 
such a search,however,is an imperfect means of determining all potential claims to a property.the register of deeds may have made an indexing error,yet the erroneously indexed instrument might still be deemed to provide constructive notice.see luthi,at i n situations where an instrument of conveyance containing a sufficient description of the property conveyed is duly recorded but not properly indexed,the fact that it was not properly indexed by the register of deeds will not prevent constructive notice under the provisions of.also,such a search may totally miss a parallel chain of title to the property under which someone claims title through a grantor not in the chain of title to the vendor and there may be technical problems caused by delayed filings of instruments in the chain of title as when a deed to a grantor is recorded after recording of the deed from the grantor,see cross,supra,at.in addition,some authorities have complained of the time and effort required for this type of search,see paul basye,clearing land titles ed,although computerization should ameliorate the difficulty.in any event,other indices,such as the numerical index authorized by kansas law,provide a useful supplement to catch title defects not found in a search.
the critical question before us is what do the kansas courts expect a purchaser to know from using the grantor and grantee indices.although a purchaser may be expected to know further information from the use of other indices,we need not address that issue to resolve this appeal.there are two components to this question.first,what is the purchaser deemed to know about the contents of the documents referenced in the index second,what is the purchaser duty to make additional inquiry from which further knowledge is acquired based on what is deemed known about the contents 
we begin with the first question what is the purchaser deemed to know about the contents of documents referenced in the grantor and grantee indices because of the kansas statutory requirement of grantor and grantee indices,it would be natural to conclude that even if.stat.ann.should not be read literally as providing constructive notice of the contents of every properly filed instrument,there is at least constructive notice of the contents of every instrument in the chain of title.the kansas court of appeals essentially reached this conclusion in wichita great empire broadcasting,gingrich,d.addressing a claim of professional negligence against an abstracter,the court said that the abstracter must examine the filed instrument rather than rely on the description in an index in that case,a judgment docket that misdescribed a release as a total release rather than a partial release.see id.at.it cited authority relating to recording of conveyances as well as judgment liens and noted that i n other jurisdictions,relying on the index rather than going to the original instrument has been held to be negligence as a matter of law,id.at,and it quoted with approval an encyclopedia stating that failure to examine the original records is negligence as a matter of law.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the court also indicated approval of a nebraska opinion stating that an abstracter can not rely on a numerical index to the exclusion of the grantor and grantee indices.see id.citing crook chilvers.in addition,the court affirmed the trial court exclusion of the abstracter evidence of common practice in his profession because the evidence was not pertinent,thus making clear that the legal standard was not to be determined on the basis of what professionals think is appropriate.id.at 
bacon lederbrand,an opinion overlooked by the courts below and by the parties,confirms the view that purchasers are deemed to know the contents of recorded documents in the chain of title.dickson contended that he had acquired title to certain property free of a mortgage from schaeffer to bacon.the mortgage was executed on august,but not recorded until february,after conveyance of the land from schaeffer to rhine,and then from rhine to dickson in a deed recorded on january.because the mortgage was filed after dickson had acquired title,this filing did not put dickson on notice of the mortgage and ordinarily dickson interest in the property would therefore not be subject to the mortgage.but the court held that his interest was nevertheless subject to the mortgage because the mortgage had been referred to in a document in his chain of title.the deed from schaeffer to rhine contained the following language 
same to be free and clear of all incumbrance except one first mortgage of hundred dollars and interest at the rate of from mch,and a second mortgage of seventeen hundred and fifty dollars due,which said second party assumes and agrees to pay.
id.at emphasis added.the court held that dickson was on notice of the recital in the deed to rhine dickson grantor because the notice provided by the statute is notice of the contents of all the prior recorded deeds and mortgages.id.we assume that the word prior,rather than referring to every previously filed document,referred only to those documents in the chain of title.in other words,in answer to the first question regarding notice,a purchaser is deemed to know the contents of every recorded document in the vendor chain of title.the purchaser therefore must examine the full contents of the documents in the chain of title.no index entry of schaeffer deed to rhine would have disclosed the mortgage referred to in the deed after all,the document would be indexed as a deed not a mortgage,and its mention of the mortgage would not be found unless one read beyond the description of the property in the deed.
bacon also answers the second question posed is the purchaser duty to make additional inquiry based on what is deemed known about the contents of recorded documents bacon said that the purchaser is not only chargeable with notice of the facts appearing upon the face of the title papers,but also with knowledge of all facts suggested therein,and which,with the exercise of reasonable prudence and diligence,he might have ascertained.id.internal quotation marks omitted.thus,the court ruled against dickson because once he saw the mention of the mortgage in the deed to rhine,i nquiry of his grantor and at least of his grantor grantor would have revealed this unrecorded mortgage.id.we infer from bacon the general rule that if a document in the chain of title suggests a substantial problem,the purchaser must make reasonable inquiry.bacon is still good law.we note that the statute construed in bacon had the same wording as.stat.ann.and no subsequent published kansas opinion has questioned bacon.
one question that may arise is whether a particular conveyance is in the chain of title.the answer is important because constructive notice is limited to the contents of conveyances in the chain of title.if,for example,the search of the grantor index leads to a deed by the grantor of an entirely different piece of property from the one being purchased,the purchaser is not on constructive notice of the contents of that deed.but the purchaser must examine each conveyance from a grantor during the period of the grantor ownership of the property of interest to determine whether it is in the chain of title.apparently such an examination is generally required in conducting a title search.see,karp klayman,supra at any conveyance in the grantor index during the period of the grantor ownership must be checked to see whether it affects the concerned parcel.philbrick,supra at.and we understand kansas law to be the same.gingrich held that notations in an index can not be relied upon and that the abstractor has a duty to examine the original records.at judgment docket misstated that a partial release of a judgment was a full release luthi,at i n situations where an instrument of conveyance containing a sufficient description of the property conveyed is duly recorded but not properly indexed,the fact that it was not properly indexed by the register of deeds will not prevent constructive notice under the provisions of.
moreover,when examining a conveyance to determine whether it is in the chain of title,the purchaser must exercise proper care.in hildebrandt the hypothetical purchaser was not entitled to stop the examination of the deed as soon as he saw that the property was described as being in a section other than the section of interest the court found that a purchaser would be on notice of the additional information contained in the description,which provided the correct section number.see hildebrandt,at.as miller stated n otice is implied when it consists of knowledge of facts so informing that a reasonably cautious person would be prompted to inquire further if a possible cloud on the seller title appears,the prospective purchaser must either clear the cloud or proceed at his own risk.at internal quotation marks omitted.the knowledge that the purchaser is deemed to possess includes the contents of conveyances that are clearly in the chain of title.the purchaser is chargeable with knowledge of all facts suggested by documents,and which,with the exercise of reasonable prudence and diligence,he might have ascertained.bacon,at.consequently,a purchaser must take reasonable and prudent steps to determine whether a conveyance is in the grantor chain of title when the full description of the property in the conveyance,together with the contents of the instruments in the chain of title,create a reasonable possibility that it is.
we now turn to the specifics of the case before us to determine the extent of constructive notice to a purchaser of the debtors house.application of the above law will make it clear that such a purchaser was on notice that the bank had a mortgage on the house,or,at the least,that he needed to make inquiry regarding whether the bank mortgage burdened the house.
to begin with,a purchaser would be on notice of the contents of every recorded instrument in the chain of title to the property.these instruments undoubtedly include the following documents that recite the correct lot number 
the deed of the house to the debtors,which recites the correct lot number and recites the house street address along the document left margin and lists the same address a second time as the sellers mailing address.
the debtors mortgage on their house,which burdens the following described property located in shawnee county,kansas lot,arrowhead heights subdivision in the city of topeka,shawnee county,kansas,which has the address of sw moundview,topeka,kansas.vol.iii at.
the second mortgage,filed in book,page,whose description of the property likewise includes not only lot in arrowhead heights subdivision,but also the street address and tax id.id.at.
the release of the mortgage,which provides the correct lot number and also gives
