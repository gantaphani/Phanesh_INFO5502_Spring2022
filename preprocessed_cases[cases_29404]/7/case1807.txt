facts and procedural background 
plaintiff vincent cusano,professionally known as vinnie vincent,is a professional musician,songwriter and publisher,and former lead guitarist of the rock roll band kiss.cusano,individually and under his business names streetbeat music and vinnie vincent music,brought this diversity action in july against persons and companies associated with kiss.cusano alleged fourteen causes of action,including claims for unpaid royalties from songs cusano and performed for the band,and claims for defamation and infringement of his right of publicity arising from the release of two videos and a book about kiss two of the central questions raised by the appeal concern the effect of cusano chapter bankruptcy on his claims,and the effect of the statutes of limitations on his defamation and claims.
the kiss defendants include the kiss company,successor in interest to kiss paul stanley and gene klein gene simmons,individual members of the band kisstory,a corporation that merchandises a book about kiss and gene simmons worldwide,and simstanmusic,companies that administer copyright interests of band members.other defendants include polygram records,publisher of certain songs by cusano and horipro entertainment group,purported assignee of certain royalty rights to certain kiss compositions.
cusano was the lead guitarist for kiss from until,during which time cusano and performed three songs for the kiss album creatures of the night and eight songs for the kiss album lick it up.kiss and cusano publishing company,streetbeat music,executed agreements in and covering these compositions,agreeing to share royalties evenly.polygram allegedly administered the collection and distribution of royalties for kiss.cusano alleges that kiss failed to honor certain provisions of the agreements,and improperly exercised an option to purchase certain of cusano songrights,causing kiss wrongfully to receive and later assign to horipro a portion of cusano rightful share of the royalties.
cusano declared chapter bankruptcy in.on the schedule for personal property,he listed songrights in songs written while in the band known as kiss,which he assigned a value of unknown.defendants simmons and stanley were listed as creditors possessing contingent and disputed claims in an unknown amount.cusano reorganization plan provided for a cash payment to the plan of,generally,and another cash payment of to retain his songrights.the plan was confirmed in and cusano was released from bankruptcy in.
in,although no longer a member of the band,cusano three songs for the kiss album revenge.cusano alleges that he never received royalties for the revenge compositions because defendants klein and stanley fraudulently attached a photocopy of his signature to an agreement purporting to assign his interest in the compositions to gene simmons worldwide,and simstanmusic.also in,cusano assigned part of his royalty rights in the creatures of the night compositions to horipro,after which horipro allegedly directed polygram to pay horipro more than its rightful share.
in,the book entitled kisstory was published,allegedly pursuant to a merchandising agreement between kiss and other for the production and distribution of an authorized and limited edition picture book about the rock band.cusano alleges that his right of publicity was infringed because the book contains numerous photographs of cusano that were utilized without his permission.cusano further alleges that the book contains a defamatory reference to cusano.his defamation claim also includes alleged defamatory statements that were published in two kiss videos released in and.
cusano filed the present action in july against kiss,individual band members,polygram,and horipro,in which he alleged claims for breach of fiduciary duty,fraud and deceit,constructive fraud,negligent misrepresentation,conversion,imposition of constructive trust,breach of contract,infringement on the right of publicity,defamation,and open book account for royalties 
in december,in response to defendants rule b and other motions,the district court transferred or dismissed several claims,in whole or in part.first,the district court severed all claims against horipro and transferred them to the southern district of new york,thereby removing from the case all of claim for fraud and parts of claims and for conversion and imposition of constructive trust.second,the district court applied california statutes of limitations to dismiss claims through for breach of fiduciary duty,fraud,and misrepresentation,to the extent that they arose before july claims and for conversion and imposition of constructive trust,to the extent that they arose before july claim for breach of contract,to the extent that it arose before july and claim for defamation,to the extent that it arose before july.
third,the district court dismissed entirely claims and for fraud,because cusano failed to allege the reliance element and cited no authority allowing him to bring a claim for fraud upon a fiduciary.fourth,as a consequence of dismissing claim for fraud,brought against klein,stanley,gene simmons worldwide,and simstanmusic,the district court dismissed claims and for conversion and imposition of constructive trust with respect to those same defendants.fifth,the district court dismissed in part claim for defamation,holding that two of the four alleged defamatory statements are as a matter of law.
finally,having previously taken notice of cusano chapter bankruptcy,the district court dismissed without prejudice all claims for royalties on the creatures of the night and lick it up compositions compositions which should have been paid prior to march,or for other damages which were incurred prior to march,the date cusano filed his petition.the court found that cusano had failed to schedule his claims for royalties and that the songrights asset he did schedule was vastly undervalued.finding that these unscheduled claims would appear to belong to the estate,the court informed cusano that he could not proceed with these claims without first obtaining permission from the bankruptcy court.this ruling on defendants december motions resulted in at least partial dismissal of each of cusano fourteen claims.
in september,with a new judge presiding over the case,the district court granted defendants motion for summary judgment on claim for breach of contract,dismissing it in its entirety.the district court found that cusano could not maintain this claim,in which he sought payment of artist royalties for his performances with kiss,because he was not a member of the american federation of musicians afm during the time in which he was a member of the band,and thus had no standing to sue for breach of the afm labor agreement.
in november,with cusano having yet to petition the bankruptcy court to release his claims,kiss defendants and polygram moved for summary judgment on all claims arising from compositions.the district court granted the motion in february,possibly unaware that cusano had since moved the bankruptcy court in december to reopen his bankruptcy case.the district court held that cusano lacked standing to assert claims based on facts and transactions predating his bankruptcy,including all claims for unpaid royalties,accruing either pre or,from his compositions.in accordance with this holding and summary judgment,the district court partially dismissed cusano claims for open book account claim,breach of fiduciary duty claim,fraud and deceit claim,constructive fraud claim,negligent misrepresentation claim,conversion claim,and imposition of constructive trust claim.
also in february,the district court on its own motion dismissed cusano claim for infringement of his right of publicity claim,and granted defendants motion for summary judgment on the defamation claim claim.the court found that cusano had admitted in his opposition to defendants motion for summary judgment that the right of publicity claim was based on facts.the remaining portion of his defamation claim was dismissed as barred by the statute of limitations.these rulings resulted in the dismissal of these two claims in their entirety.
at this point in the proceedings,most of cusano remaining claims involved his revenge compositions.kiss defendants and polygram moved for summary judgment in january on the ground that cusano had been paid all sums due and owing.cusano countered by alleging that his signature on agreements in which he purportedly assigned his interest in the revenge compositions had been forged.the district court appointed a forensic examiner in march to determine the authenticity of the revenge agreements.the court ordered cusano either to submit a handwriting analysis report from the neutral examiner or to withdraw his dispute of the agreements and submit his opposition to the motion for summary judgment,limiting his arguments to the use of the revenge compositions on the kiss album alive iii and two kiss videos.when cusano failed to comply with the order by filing nothing,the court held that the revenge agreements were valid and binding on cusano and granted summary judgment for kiss defendants and polygram.this ruling resulted in the dismissal of all remaining portions of cusano claims through for open book account,breach of fiduciary duty,fraud,and misrepresentation and claims and for conversion and imposition of constructive trust.
meanwhile,cusano bid to reopen his bankruptcy case was unsuccessful.in april,after a hearing at which kiss defendants and polygram also appeared,the bankruptcy court denied cusano december motion to reopen.the court stated that it would not reconsider the district court findings that any claims for unpaid royalties on prepetition musical compositions did not revert to debtor and that such claims were never formally abandoned to debtor.the court also stated that,a ll claims based on facts predating debtor bankruptcy,including claims for unpaid royalties on musical compositions remain assets of the estate,and the estate is closed.finally,because the reorganization plan was fully consummated in,the bankruptcy court found that it had no authority to allow cusano to amend the plan.cusano missed his deadline to appeal the decision to the bankruptcy appellate panel.
in may,the district court rendered final judgments on all of its prior dismissal orders and summary judgment rulings.the final judgment also disposed of the only claim not entirely disposed of by its prior for open book that it was effectively dismissed when the court dismissed claim for breach of contract in september.noting that the bankruptcy court had refused to reopen cusano bankruptcy,the court went on to dismiss all fourteen claims for relief in their entirety with prejudice.from this ruling,and the award of attorney fees and costs,cusano appeals.
discussion 
compositions 
cusano contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment dismissing for lack of standing all of his claims concerning his interests in compositions we agree,in part.for cusano to have standing,he,rather than the bankruptcy estate,must own the claim upon which he is suing.the question of ownership turns on the validity and effect of cusano listing of his songrights as an asset in his bankruptcy schedules.we conclude that cusano scheduled songrights asset reverted to him upon the confirmation of his reorganization technical abandonment and by express provision of the vested in him all royalty rights to his compositions,despite his probable undervaluation of the songrights.he thus reacquired ownership of all claims to royalties derived from these compositions,but not claims for unpaid royalties,which were required to be scheduled separately as either receivables or legal claims.thus,we reverse the district court in part,and reinstate some of cusano royalty claims.
an estate is created when a bankruptcy petition is filed.see a in re fitzsimmons,cir.property of a bankruptcy estate includes all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.a.this broad category includes p roceeds,product,offspring,rents,or profits of or from property of the estate,except such as are earnings from services performed by an individual debtor after the commencement of the case.a.thus,revenues belong to the estate to the extent they are based on services or agreements.see,in re jess,cir in re wu,cir rau ryerson,cir.accordingly,cusano future royalties from his creatures of the night and lick it up compositions became assets of his bankruptcy estate.see in re dillon,waldschmidt cbs.in addition,assets of the estate properly included any of cusano causes of action.see sierra switchboard westinghouse,cir.the question presented here is what happened to these assets of the estate during and after their administration in bankruptcy.
two separate sections of the bankruptcy code govern reversion of assets of the bankruptcy estate to the debtor.the first provision,which applies to all forms of bankruptcy,including chapter,is the technical abandonment provision unless the court orders otherwise,any property scheduled under section of this title not otherwise administered at the time of the closing of a case is abandoned to the debtor and administered for purposes of section of this title.c.the second provision is unique to chapter bankruptcies,and sets forth the effect of confirmation except as otherwise provided in the plan or the order confirming the plan,the confirmation of a plan vests all of the property of the estate in the debtor.id.b.
the bankruptcy code placed an affirmative duty on cusano to schedule his assets and liabilities.id.if he failed properly to schedule an asset,including a cause of action,that asset continues to belong to the bankruptcy estate and did not revert to cusano.see stein united artists,cir holding that only property administered or listed in the bankruptcy proceedings reverts to the bankrupt accord hutchins irs,cir vreugdenhill navistar int l transp,cir holding that property is not abandoned by operation of law unless the debtor formally schedule s the property before the close of the case.
t he debtor has a duty to prepare schedules carefully,completely,and accurately.in re mohring,accord in re jones,in re baumgartner,in re mazzola.although there are no rules for how much itemization and specificity is required,cusano was required to be as particular as is reasonable under the circumstances.in re mohring,at.if possible,cusano was to list the approximate dollar amount of each asset.see in re wenande.if faced with a range of values,he was to choose a value in the middle of the range.in re seruntine.there are assets,however,the value of which is unknown when that is the case,a simple statement to that effect will suffice.in re wenande,at.
generally,mistakes in valuation will not enable a trustee to recover an abandoned asset,hutchins,at,not even upon subsequent discovery that the property has a greater value than previously believed.in re mcgowan,accord in re devore,cir recognizing the general rule that abandonment is irrevocable.revocation of abandonment is appropriate,however,where the trustee is given incomplete or false information of the asset by the debtor,thereby foregoing a proper investigation of the asset.in re ozer,accord in re adair,cir in re devore,at.the cases that contemplate such action,however,indicate that the revocation may be effected only by express order after the reopening of the bankruptcy case.see,in re ozer,at in re adair,at in re devore,at.
cusano listing was not so defective that it would forestall a proper investigation of the asset.cusano scheduled songrights in songs written while in the band known as kiss.he listed their value as unknown.his reorganization plan called for him to retain ownership of his songrights.in a memo to the bankruptcy court,cusano listed songrights as an asset being retained under the plan and listed its value as.he then noted that,in addition to he had already set aside to pay creditors,he would contribute cash representing the value of these songrights in the amount of.he concluded by noting that these amounts constitute a fresh contribution which greatly exceeds the value of the property interest he is retaining.
the songrights asset as described by cusano can reasonably be interpreted to mean copyrights and rights to royalty payments for songs written for the band kiss.the debtor in in re dillon described a similar asset on her bankruptcy schedules as songwriter share of songs.at.although it would have been more helpful for cusano to break down the description further so that it named songs,albums,and dates of and parties to royalty and copyright agreements,the additional detail would not have revealed anything that was otherwise concealed by the description as it was,which provided inquiry notice to affected parties to seek further detail if they required it.any undervaluation of the songrights asset does not impair cusano interest in it,because only an express order of revocation after reopening of the bankruptcy case would do so,and that did not occur see in re adair,at in re ozer,at.
we conclude,therefore,that his listing of the songrights asset was a sufficient scheduling of cusano interest in his compositions,which reverted to him upon confirmation of his plan.the reversion vested in cusano the rights to royalties on his compositions and other damages accruing with respect to these compositions.the district court erred when it applied to cusano case the general rule that revenues based on services or agreements belong to the bankruptcy estate.in re dillon,at.the rule is simply not applicable here,because the actual service or agreement at issue in this case,songrights,reverted to cusano ownership.
unpaid royalties and other damages which accrued,on the other hand,did not revert to cusano with the songrights asset,because these were subject to a separate scheduling requirement as accrued causes of action.causes of action are separate assets which must be formally listed.vreugdenhill,at.simply listing the underlying asset out of which the cause of action arises is not sufficient.see id.at stating that debtor who scheduled parts as an asset failed properly to list a cause of action for failure to accept those parts.
cusano contends that his royalty claims for compositions involved an open book account,see civ.proc,and thus no legal claim accrued until the entry of the last item,see,well after his bankruptcy.we reject this contention.it is true that,generally,a debtor has no duty to schedule a cause of action that did not accrue prior to bankruptcy.brassfield jack mclendon furniture,erickson baxter healthcare,d.to determine when a cause of action accrues,we look to state law.in re folks,cir.it is important,however,to distinguish principles of accrual from principles of discovery and tolling,which may cause the statute of limitations to begin to run after accrual has occurred for purposes of ownership in a bankruptcy proceeding.in re swift,cir.
we conclude that cusano open book account claim accrued for bankruptcy purposes to the extent that sums were owed on that account at the time he filed his petition.an action could have been brought for those sums at that time.our conclusion is not affected by the fact that limitations on such an action had not yet begun to run.an action for open book account in california must commence within four years of the entry of the last item on the account.see civ.proc.cusano alleged open book account with defendants has been open for years,and could continue to remain open for years to come.cusano can not avoid disclosing on his bankruptcy schedules a claim for an unpaid royalties balance,which was ascertainable and collectible when he filed his petition,simply because this claim does not accrue for statute of limitations purposes until the royalties dry up or payment is refused.thus,if there was any outstanding balance due cusano on the open book account when he filed for bankruptcy,he was under a duty to schedule it as a receivable or as a cause of action for unpaid royalties.his failure to do so vests the claim in the bankruptcy estate,where it remains the district court decision that cusano could not sue on his open book account claims was accordingly correct with regard to any sums owing at the time of petition.but cusano retains standing to sue for any royalty payments coming due.
finally,we reject defendants contention that the doctrine of res judicata bars cusano appeal of the district court decisions concerning standing,because of the bankruptcy court ruling that it would not reopen cusano bankruptcy nor reconsider the district court findings.the doctrine of res judicata bars a party from bringing a claim if a court of competent jurisdiction has rendered a final judgment on the merits of the claim in a previous action involving the same parties or their privies.in re int l nutronics,cir.the bankruptcy court simply denied cusano motion to reopen.the only res judicata effect of this denial is that the consequences of the prior closing will not be disturbed.just as the mere reopening of a bankruptcy case is a ministerial act that lacks independent legal significance and determines nothing with respect to the merits of the case,see in re menk,cir,the mere refusal to reopen a bankruptcy case similarly has no impact on the property of the debtor or the estate.any reference to the findings of the district court here was simply a statement that the bankruptcy court would not interfere with those findings.the district court made findings with regard to the consequences of the prior closing,and those findings,undisturbed by the bankruptcy court,are what are before us on appeal.
in sum,we conclude that cusano sufficiently scheduled his songrights,which vested in him upon confirmation of his chapter reorganization plan.any undervaluation was not fatal,absent some sort of action in the bankruptcy court.all songright royalties are cusano property because he retains the songrights asset.accordingly,we reverse the summary judgment in part and reinstate cusano claims through for open book account,breach of fiduciary duty,fraud,and misrepresentation and claims and for conversion and imposition of constructive trust,to the extent they seek royalties relating to compositions,or other damages that arose.unpaid royalties that arose,however,were subject to scheduling and should have been listed as either a receivable or as an existing cause of action.because they were not scheduled,they remain dormant in the bankruptcy estate.the same result follows for all claims,such as those for breach of fiduciary duty,fraud,and conversion,which arose.we affirm the judgment of the district court with regard to these claims that had accrued by the time of the bankruptcy petition.
ii.defamation 
the district court dismissed cusano defamation claim on the ground that it was barred by the statute of limitations.civ.proc.it is undisputed that the alleged defamatory statements,made in the video kiss and the book kisstory,were published in their only editions in and,respectively.under the uniform single publication act,cusano claim accrued on the first general distribution of the video and the book to the public.cal.cusano contends that the book and video were republished under an exception to the uniform single publication act,and also that the rule of discovery should be applied in this case to toll the statute of limitations,because he did not discover the defamatory statements until january,six months before he brought suit.we reject these contentions,and affirm the district court grant of summary judgment on the defamation claim.
no exception to the uniform single publication act applies here to save cusano defamation claim.all printings,over time,of the first hardcover edition of a book constitute a single publication.fleury ha
