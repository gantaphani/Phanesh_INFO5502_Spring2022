opinion of the court 
this case arises out of the chapter filing of papercraft corporation and the subsequent litigation.here,in our second review of determinations made by the bankruptcy court and the district court,we must assess justifications for the subordination of several of citicorp venture capital cvc claims,and we must evaluate the accompanying calculations.first,cvc argues that the district court erroneously upheld the bankruptcy court subordination of certain administrative costs and professional fees.second,cvc contends that the district court erroneously upheld the bankruptcy court subordination of cvc claim by an additional amount incurred during a delay in the plan process.third,cvc asserts that the finding that cvc made a profit on its note purchases is error.finally,in a cross appeal,the committee of creditors holding unsecured claims and committee of creditors holding unsecured claims as estate representative of papercraft corporation the committee argues that the district court erred in reducing the bankruptcy court equitable subordination remedy on account of lost interest income.we hold that the american rule should not be applied to the subordination of the administrative and professional costs,and that the district court findings are not clearly erroneous.we will affirm.
background 
in,an informal committee of papercraft creditors and papercraft agreed to a restructuring plan known as the bdk plan,which was to be filed in conjunction with a voluntary chapter petition.the creditors claims against papercraft would be converted into bdk units,consisting of stock and bonds issued by the new venture,in proportion to an estimated value of such units.papercraft directors,including cvc,approved the bdk plan,and the chapter petition and the bdk plan were filed.
the committee commenced litigation,alleging that cvc,while an insider and fiduciary of papercraft,attempted to take control of papercraft assets and reap significant profit at the expense of other creditors by withdrawing its support for the bdk plan and offering a competing plan,secretly purchasing in claims against papercraft for the discounted amount of,and delaying confirmation of the original plan.the committee asserted that because cvc breached its fiduciary duty to papercraft and papercraft creditors by engaging in such,cvc claims should be equitably subordinated pursuant to c of the bankruptcy code,c.
the bankruptcy court issued an october,memorandum opinion and order,finding that cvc purchases at a discount,without disclosure,while an insider,constituted breaches of cvc fiduciary duty to papercraft and its creditors.in re papercraft.the bankruptcy court limited cvc allowed claim to the price,and held that further subordination of cvc claims pursuant to the principles of equitable subordination codified at c was not appropriate because the bankruptcy court was already limiting cvc allowed claim to the amount it paid for such claim.id.at.
on appeal,the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court factual findings that cvc breached its fiduciary duties,acted inequitably,caused injury to papercraft and its creditors and gained an unfair advantage.in re papercraft.however,the district court remanded the case to the bankruptcy court for a further finding on the amount cvc claims should be subordinated beyond the amount paid for such claims,if at all,pursuant to the principles of equitable subordination.id.at.both parties appealed.
we affirmed the district court opinion,finding that cvc violated its fiduciary duty in a number of significant respects and that cvc misconduct caused harm justifying subordination.in re papercraft,cir.we explicitly stated that the findings of fact make this a paradigm of inequitable conduct by a fiduciary as that concept has been developed in the case law,and we believe that further elaboration is not required.id.at.we explained that,
further subordination may be appropriate,but only if supported by findings that justify the remedy chosen by reference to equitable principles while the bankruptcy court held,with record support,that the delay between the filing of the petition and the filing of the disclosure statement was not attributable to cvc machinations,it made no similar finding with respect to the period of delay between the filing of the disclosure statement and confirmation of the bdk plan.moreover,while the bankruptcy court found no evidence that cvc engaged in conduct designed to delay the plan process,if cvc pursuit of its own interest in fact resulted in delay of the confirmation,we do not read that finding as inconsistent with subordination based on injury resulting from that delay.on remand,the bankruptcy court should consider whether the record supports the proposition that creditors suffered loss as a result of a delay in confirmation caused by cvc advocacy of its competing plan and objections to the bdk plan.
id.at.our mandate to the bankruptcy court was clear determine whether the record supports the additional subordination of cvc claims.
on remand,the bankruptcy court found three kinds of economic harm to noteholder creditors the quantifiable monetary harm that resulted from the delay in confirming the plan the harm that resulted from the uncertainty over the amount of cvc claim distribution and the harm that resulted from the delay in fully implementing the confirmed plan that can be measured by the professional fees and expenses of three courts and five proceedings.in re papercraft.the bankruptcy court held,therefore,that cvc recovery would be further subordinated by for additional administrative expenses incurred during the delay for interest and dividends lost by creditors during the delay and for professional fees and expenses incurred paid by the estate or bdk through april,in re papercraft.
the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court decision,except that it reduced the lost interest income component of the subordination from to.memorandum order at.cvc filed a timely appeal.

iii.discussion 
first,cvc argues that the bankruptcy court violated the american rule by subordinating the attorneys fees.we disagree.
the expression of the american rule is found in alyeska pipeline service wilderness soc y,where the supreme court explained that,i n the united states,the prevailing litigant is ordinarily not entitled to collect a reasonable attorneys fee from the loser,d.there are,however,numerous exceptions to this rule.an element of all american rule exceptions is a determination that the litigant prevailed and should be awarded attorneys fees.for example,was enacted with the express intent of negating the effect of the alyeska decision in statutory civil rights cases.t he purpose of this amendment is to remedy anomalous gaps in our civil rights laws created by the united states supreme court recent decision in alyeska pipeline.under,a party must show it prevailed in the underlying action.
the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court subordination of attorneys fees,explaining 
the committee is not asking for the payment of attorneys fees as such.the fees and expenses at issue depleted funds that otherwise would have been available to creditors but for cvc misconduct in breaching its fiduciary duty.to ensure the distribution creditors should have received absent cvc misconduct,it is necessary to restore the estate funds by subordinating cvc share of distribution by the amount of fees and expenses incur
