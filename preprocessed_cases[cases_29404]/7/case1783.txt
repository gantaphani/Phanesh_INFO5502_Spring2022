this case arises out of the bankruptcy of stratosphere corporation stratosphere.stratosphere litigation,llc sl appeals the district court grant of partial summary judgment and its decision in favor of grand casinos,grand following a bench trial.
sl filed a breach of contract action against grand as a beneficiary to a contract between grand and stratosphere.the contract provided that should stratosphere annual cash flow fall below a target,stratosphere would be obligated to raise additional equity and grand would be obligated to fund an escrow account.
stratosphere annual cash flow fell below the target.sl asserts that grand failed to fund an escrow account when stratosphere cash flow fell below the target.it follows,sl insists,that grand breached the contract.
the district court rejected sl claim.it held that grand obligation to fund an escrow account was a concurrent condition to stratosphere obligation to raise additional equity.having filed for bankruptcy,stratosphere could not raise the required equity.therefore,grand obligation to fund an escrow account was discharged.we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and we affirm.
background 
the agreement,the standby equity commitment commitment,between stratosphere and grand was to facilitate stratospheres public offering of million of junk bonds.the agreement was a credit enhancement mechanism designed to reduce the perceived risks of stratosphere junk bonds stratosphere used the capital to finance the construction and development of the stratosphere tower,casino hotel in las vegas,nevada.this business venture ultimately failed,and stratosphere filed for chapter bankruptcy.
at issue is the determination of the obligations of stratosphere and grand under the commitment and sl rights thereunder was grand obligation to fund an escrow account under a of the commitment conditioned on stratosphere ability to raise equity 
a.the bankruptcy court ruling 
on june,the official committee of noteholders official committee moved to assume the commitment on behalf of stratosphere pursuant to of the bankruptcy code.the bankruptcy court held that the commitment would not be so assumed.it further held that stratosphere and grand respective obligations under the commitment are mutual and that of the commitment is not an independent and separate obligation of grand to the noteholders.the official committee did not appeal the decision of the bankruptcy court.
b.the district court grant of partial summary judgment 
sl then filed an action against grand for breach of contract.it alleged that grand breached the commitment by failing to deposit million in an escrow account when stratosphere cash flow fell below the target that triggered grand funding obligation.the parties filed for summary judgment.
the district court held that sl claim,that grand induced stratosphere bankruptcy to avoid its obligation to the noteholders,was barred by res judicata.it granted partial summary judgment in favor of grand on this issue.however,the district court held that the issue whether grand obligation under the commitment was independent of stratosphere obligation was not barred by res judicata and could be adjudicated.
c.the district court judgment following the bench trial 
subsequently,a bench trial was held to determine whether grand obligation under the commitment was independent of stratosphere.the district court found that the parties respective obligations under the commitment were mutual and not independent.it therefore held that grand obligation to fund an escrow account was discharged by stratosphere bankruptcy.it follows that sl claims against grand as a beneficiary to the commitment also failed.sl could not assert greater rights than could stratosphere.also rejected was sl claim that grand induced stratosphere bankruptcy to avoid its obligation to the noteholders.this appeal then followed.

discussion 
res judicataa.the bankruptcy court jurisdiction 
sl challenges the bankruptcy court jurisdiction over the noteholders claim against grand.this challenge lacks merit.the jurisdiction of a bankruptcy court extends to proceedings arising under title,or arising in or related to cases under title.celotex edwards,d.a bankruptcy court related to jurisdiction embraces more than simple proceedings involving the property of the debtor or the estate.id.at.accord in re american hardwoods,cir an action is related to bankruptcy if the outcome could alter the debtor rights,liabilities,options,or freedom of action.
the bankruptcy court related to jurisdiction embraces the determination whether grand obligation to fund an escrow account was discharged by stratosphere bankruptcy.the official committee acknowledged this,and it requested the bankruptcy court to determine whether pursuant to the terms of the commitment,grand is obligated to place million in an escrow account for the benefit of the noteholders.sl contest of the bankruptcy court jurisdiction is barred by the official committee voluntary consent to it.see in re mann,cir debtor who filed adversary proceeding in bankruptcy court and never objected to the court jurisdiction over him consented to the court jurisdiction corbett macdonald moving,cir a party that has had an opportunity to litigate the question of jurisdiction may not reopen that question in a collateral attack upon an adverse judgment.citation omitted.
sl claims against grand are barred by res judicata.
the bankruptcy court held that grand obligation to fund an escrow account was conditioned on stratosphere performance of its obligation to raise equity,which it did not do.thus,grand obligation was discharged.the official committee did not appeal this judgment.because sl and the official committee both represent the noteholders,the official committee failure to appeal the bankruptcy court judgment is imputed to sl for res judicata purposes see in re schimmels,cir.thus,sl can not challenge the bankruptcy court determination that grand obligation to fund an escrow account was discharged.
furthermore,stratosphere second reorganization plan discharged grand obligation to the noteholders.the bankruptcy court confirmed this plan,and the official committee did not object.accordingly,sl is barred from asserting a claim against grand.as held in trulis barton,cir 
once a bankruptcy plan is confirmed,it is binding on all parties and all questions that could have been raised pertaining to the plan are entitled to res judicata effect creditors who do not wish to release third party debtors pursuant to the principal debtor plan of reorganization should object to confirmation of the plan on the ground that such a plan provision is violative of section and not within the power,even jurisdiction,of the bankruptcy court.
id.citations omitted.
sl also contends that the bankruptcy court lacked the power to release grand liability to the noteholders because grand is a third party.sl relies on in re lowenschuss,cir.it is true that a bankruptcy court can not confirm a reorganization plan that discharges the liabilities of a third party.however,sl is barred from collaterally challenging the bankruptcy court confirmation of stratosphere second reorganization plan.this would be so even if the plan contained illegal provisions.see in re pardee,cir this court has recognized the finality of confirmation orders even if the confirmed bankruptcy plan contains illegal provisions.in the matter of gregory,cir creditor failure to raise objection to legality of confirmation plan at the confirmation hearing or to appeal from the order of confirmation should preclude its attack on the plan or any provision therein as illegal in a subsequent proceeding.we hold,therefore,that sl claims against grand are barred by res judicata 
ii.contract interpretation defenses 
grand obligation to fund an escrow account and stratosphere obligation to raise equity were concurrent conditions.
