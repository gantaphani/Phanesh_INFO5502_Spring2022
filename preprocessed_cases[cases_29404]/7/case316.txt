on october,jerald john hayward,ii and lois evelyn hayward collectively,debtors filed a chapter bankruptcy petition.debtors alleged that jerald owned real property with a market value of encumbered by a mortgage the property was exempt under and appellant cfcu community credit union cfcu held a claim for a may car loan,secured by an automobile valued at,leaving cfcu a general unsecured creditor for the balance.
cfcu objected to the homestead exemption to the extent it exceeded the amendment amount.cfcu argued that the amendment does not specifically provide that it applies to obligations or debts incurred prior to august,effective date of the amendment in the absence of such a provision,the amendment does not apply retroactively to any obligation or debt incurred prior to that date and even if the amendment applied to,debts,that construction would impair the contract between debtors and cfcu,thus violating the contract clause of the united states constitution.see const.art.i,cl.in opposition,debtors contended that the state legislature clearly intended the homestead exemption to apply because the law specifically provided that it shall take effect immediately.laws ch.debtors also argued that,under b a,they may exempt any property that is exempt under state or local law that is applicable on the date of the filing of the petition thus,because their petition was filed on october,after the effective date of the amendment,the increased exemption amount applies.
the bankruptcy court ninfo,denied cfcu motion,holding that debtors were entitled to the exemption even though they incurred their cfcu debt prior to the amendment.see in re hayward.the court principally relied on,and adopted the reasoning of,in re little,wl,at,which held that the amendment was remedial and therefore should be applied retroactively,and that retroactive application did not violate the contract clause.discussing the remedial nature of the amendment,judge ninfo concluded that the mischief and imperfection the legislature sought to remedy was a homestead exemption not indexed for inflation that had become tantamount to having no exemption at all.hayward,at quoting spons.the remedy was to adjust the exemption to make it realistic in today economy.id.at quoting spons.
the court concluded that limiting the reach of the law to prospective application only would defeat the clearly evident intention of the new york state legislature.id.the court also noted that cfcu had not reduced the haywards debt to judgment before august.id.the court concluded that such creditors do not have the kind of vested rights that require a detailed constitutional analysis beyond that set forth in little.id.the court concluded that the,who represents all the general unsecured creditors and is the perfect lien creditor under section,would only be vested with rights that came into existence when the debtors filed their bankruptcy petitions after august,the date when the amendment became immediately and retroactively effective.id.at.the district court siragusa,affirmed upon the opinion of the court below.cfcu cmty.credit union hayward,wl,at.
on appeal to this court,cfcu reiterates its challenge to the retroactive application of the amendment as it relates to debts,arguing that neither the language of the amendment nor its legislative history manifest a clear intent that the statute apply retroactively to debts,and retroactive application violates the contract clause.debtors counter that we should employ the exemption in effect at the time of the filing of their petition because b a provides that the state or local law that is applicable on the date of the filing of the petition governs the available state bankruptcy exemptions.new york attorney general has intervened pursuant to b in support of the statute while agreeing with debtors that they should have the benefit of the increased exemption,the attorney general rejects their reasoning and instead urges us to adopt the rationale articulated by the courts amendment is remedial and therefore applies to debts incurred prior to its effective date.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the order of the district court.
discussion 
i.the state law question interpreting the scope of the amendmenta.governing bankruptcy code provisions and new york homestead exemption 
pursuant to b,debtors may exempt certain property from the bankruptcy estate created by the petition,allowing them to retain those assets rather than divide them among their creditors.rousey jacoway,d see also bell bell in re bell,cir.new york has opted out of the federal exemption scheme set forth in d,choosing instead to provide its own exclusive set of permissible exemptions for debtors domiciled in the state.see b dubroff first bank of glens falls in re dubroff,cir in re nudo.debtors may exempt any property that is exempt under state or local law that is applicable on the date of the filing of the petition b a thus,while federal law governs the date on which the exemption comes into play,new york law governs the nature and scope of the exemption.
new york exemptions are set forth in debtor creditor law.see in re onyan.that statute explicitly incorporates,new york homestead exemption.see debt cred.law.exempts several categories of real property as long as the property in question is owned and occupied as a principal residence.the statute protects the residence from the satisfaction of money judgments up to fifty thousand dollars in value above liens and encumbrances unless the judgment was recovered wholly for the purchase price of the residence.a.
debtors contend that b a requires that all bankruptcy petitions filed in new york after the amendment enactment date employ the increased homestead exemption.one new york bankruptcy court has adopted this view.see rupp elmasri in re elmasri,it is true,as judge ninfo noted,that the is the perfect lien creditor under section of the bankruptcy code on the date debtors filed their bankruptcy petition.hayward,at.thus,one might conclude from section that the filing date of the petition defines the rights of unsecured creditors indeed it does.but the inquiry here is not merely the rights of the unsecured creditors,but also the breadth of the exemption protection of a debtors property in new york.section b a specifically notes that exemptions under the statute are limited to any property that is exempt under state or local law that is applicable on the date of the filing of the petition emphasis added.if,under new york law,the increased exemption does not apply to contract debts incurred before the effective date of the increase,then contract creditors have the benefit of the lower exemption level while contract creditors face the higher exemption.in both cases,their claims against the estate are governed by the trustee perfect lien,but are limited by the scope of the exemption as defined by new york law.
debtors also argue that owen owen,d applies here and requires that federal,not new york,law governs the applicability of the increased homestead exemption amount.in owen,the supreme court interpreted a different bankruptcy code f,the lien avoidance,at that time,provided that n otwithstanding any waiver of exemptions,the debtor may avoid the fixing of a lien on an interest of the debtor in property to the extent that such lien impairs an exemption to which the debtor would have been entitled under b,if such lien is a judicial lien or a nonpossessory,security interest owen,at.quoting f internal quotation marks omitted.although florida law excluded certain property from the scope of its homestead act,property subject to a judgment lien,the supreme court held that the debtor was nevertheless permitted to avoid the lien that impaired his homestead exemption under f.see owen,at.owen,however,does not require application of the increased homestead exemption in this case,where debtors seek to exempt property from the reach of creditors pursuant to a exemption without regard to whether new york intended the amendment to apply to debts contracted before its enactment.if a state opts out of the federal exemption scheme,then its debtors are limited to the exemptions provided by state law.nothing in subsection b or elsewhere in the code limits a state power to restrict the scope of its exemptions indeed,it could theoretically accord no exemptions at all.id.at.owen holds no sway here.this case requires that we decide the scope of the homestead set of debts subject to the reach of the amendment.clearly,this is a matter of new york law.
new york homestead exemption background 
new york law has provided a homestead exemption since.see homestead act of,ch.laws replaced by the code of civil procedure john mather mem.l,pearl,cir in re feiss,not surprisingly,the purpose of the homestead exemption is to protect a homeowner against seizure of his or her dwelling to satisfy a money judgment.ge capital bus.asset funding hakakian,dep t.courts have long recognized the strong policy considerations underlying new york exemption statute 
the statute is founded upon considerations of public policy,and has introduced a new rule in regard to the extent of property which shall be liable for a man debts.the legislature were of opinion,looking to the advantages belonging to the family state in the preservation of morals,the education of children,and possibly even,in the encouragement of hope in unfortunate debtors,that this degree of exemption would promote the public welfare,and perhaps in the end,benefit the creditor.
robinson wiley,opn.of johnson.the homestead exemption reflect s a legislative policy,both state and federal,to provide an honest debtor with a fresh start,and was drafted with the understanding that justice is not served by leaving the debtor and his family homeless and on the brink of financial ruin.westinghouse credit central trust in re leonardo,see also in re miller,in re pearlman.
since the homestead statute was incorporated into the in it has been amended several times to increase the exemption.see laws ch.in,the legislature increased the exemption from to.see laws ch.see also roosevelt hardware green,dep t.that amendment did not indicate if the statute applied to debts contracted prior to its effective date 
prior to the enactment of the amendment,the last time the state legislature increased the homestead exemption was in.in addition to raising the homestead exemption amount from to,the amendments modernized the statute by specifying three distinct and enumerated types of property which qualify for the exemption and by deleting the provisions requiring a judgment debtor to file a notice or conveyance with the county clerk in order to claim the exemption.wyoming county bank trust kiley,dep t.the legislation also explicitly directed that the act shall take effect ninety days after it shall have become a law,but shall not affect the application of property to the satisfaction of a money judgment for a debt contracted before it takes effect.laws ch,emphasis added.thus,under the plain language of the amendment,the increased homestead exemption did not impact judgment creditors who sought to enforce a money judgment for debts contracted prior to the amendment effective date regardless of when they converted the debt to a judgment.a number of bankruptcy court decisions have noted that the exemption under the amendment was not available for contract debts incurred prior to the amendment effective date.see in re buchardt,in re ventura,in re henninger.
c.the amendment to the homestead exemption 
the amendment does not contain language addressing whether the new exemption amount should be applied to debts contracted prior to the amendment enactment date.instead,the amendment merely directs that t his act shall take effect immediately.laws ch.a statute command that it take effect immediately does not resolve the question of whether,under new york law,the amendment should be applied retroactively to debts.see majewski cent.sch.in majewski,the new york court of appeals observed that the date that legislation is to take effect is a separate question from whether the statute should apply to claims and rights then in existence.id.the majewski court further concluded that w hile the fact that a statute is to take effect immediately evinces a sense of urgency,the meaning of the phrase is equivocal in an analysis of retroactivity.id.internal citations and quotation marks omitted.thus,the court concluded that the proviso that the subject provisions were to take effect immediately contribut ed little to our understanding of whether retroactive application was intended on the issue presented.id.at,thus,the language of the amendment is inconclusive on the retroactivity question presented here.
retroactive or prospective 
it should come as no surprise that retroactive operation is not favored by new york courts and statutes will not be given such construction unless the language expressly or by necessary implication requires it.majewski,at.as judge cardozo once opined,i t takes a clear expression of the legislative purpose to justify a retroactive application.jacobus colgate.generally,an amendment will have prospective application only,and will have no retroactive effect unless the language of the statute clearly indicates that it shall receive a contrary interpretation.stat.law.indeed,the supreme court has recognized that the presumption against retroactive legislation is deeply rooted in our jurisprudence,and embodies a legal doctrine centuries older than our republic.landgraf usi film,d.
remedial legislation,however,should be applied retroactively.majewski,at.remedial statutes constitute an exception to the general rule that statutes are not to be given a retroactive operation,but only to the extent that they do not impair vested rights.stat.law however,the mere classification of a statute as remedial does not automatically overcome the strong presumption that statutes should be applied prospectively,since the term may broadly encompass any attempt to supply some defect or abridge some superfluity in the former law.majewski,at,quoting stat.law.to determine whether a statute should be applied retroactively,courts must look at legislative history to see if it reveals that the purpose of new legislation is to clarify what the law was always meant to say and do.id.at.simply put,there must be a clear expression of legislative intent to apply a statute retroactively.id.at.
new york court of appeals has cautioned,however,that while the maxims of statutory construction described above provide helpful guideposts,the reach of the statute ultimately becomes a matter of judgment made upon review of the legislative goal.duell condon.other factors in the retroactivity analysis include whether the legislature has made a specific pronouncement about retroactive effect or conveyed a sense of urgency whether the statute was designed to rewrite an unintended judicial interpretation and whether the enactment itself reaffirms a legislative judgment about what the law in question should be.in re gleason michael vee.
legislative intent 
there are several key legislative documents which shed light on the statute purpose.the memoranda submitted by the amendment sponsors in the senate and assembly are helpful in that regard.in new york,while not determinative,a legislator sponsor memo submitted contemporaneously with the legislation is entitled to considerable weight in discerning legislative intent.vatore comm r of consumer affairs,quoting matter of broad.greenberg.each memo contains the following justification for the amendment 
the idea of the homestead exemption to civil judgments seems to have been that no civil judgment against any person should result in that person forfeiting his or her having a right to a place to live.to that end,chapter of the laws of made the value of a person homestead up to exempt from civil judgments against that person.
later on,section of the debtor and creditor law extended this exemption to assessments of the value of a person estate when bankruptcy is declared.when laws mention specific dollar amounts,it is prudent to periodically review and update those amounts.
current law sets the homestead exemptions at.that amount was set when the exemption was first enacted in,and has not been updated since.in,the value of that amount of money had declined to about in dollars.
this bill proposes to increase the homestead exemption to,a much more realistic figure.the current amount,which is years old,is not at all realistic in today economy.to have the figure so low is tantamount to having no exemption at all.
spons,spons.the assembly memo additionally noted,t his bill will help to provide some relief from the stringent bankruptcy laws recently passed by congress.spons.
this legislative history clearly reflects an intent on the part of the legislature to adjust the homestead exemption to account for inflation and to bring it in line with current economic conditions.the law sponsors specifically noted that the amount had not been updated since and was not at all realistic in today economy.spons,spons.the sponsors further explained that t o have the figure so low is tantamount to having no exemption at all.id.viewing the exemption as insufficient,the legislature increased the dollar value to a level that furthers the policy of reducing the number of debtors who lose their homes as a result of bankruptcy or a civil judgment,a longstanding goal of the homestead exemption in new york.see,leonardo,at.
based on the absence of language barring the application of the amendment to debts,and the legislative intent to provide for an immediate increased exemption,we can not infer that the legislature intended the amendment to apply only prospectively.cfcu points to nothing in the statute or legislative history that would require limiting the scope of the amendment in such a fashion.unlike the language of the amendment,see perry zarcone,dep t,appeal dismissed,the amendment does not address the issue of whether the statute applies to debts.in discussing the amendment,the perry court concluded that a judgment debtor was not entitled to the increased homestead exemption because the state legislature intended that the increase be prospective only,to apply only when the debt upon which execution is sought arose after the effective date of the amendment.id.at,the court referred to two executive memoranda concerning the amendment.the court noted that the first memorandum was a statement in support of the bill from the state executive department,which indicated that the proposed law would not apply to debts that exist before it takes effect.therefore,existing creditors will not have their security diminished by the amendment.id.at,alterations in original internal quotation marks omitted.the court additionally noted that a statement of the governor on approving the bill stated existing creditors will not have their security diminished by the amendment.id.at,internal quotation marks omitted 
no such legislative history exists here.in this case,the legislature decision not to include something akin to the provision of the amendment in the amendment suggests an intent to apply the law to contract debts.legislative concern with debts expressed in the amendment is simply not present in the legislation.rather,the legislature explicitly commanded that it was to take effect immediately.laws ch.although such a directive alone does not mandate retroactive application,see majewski,at,it certainly evinces a sense of urgency that the statute intended debtors subject to debts who file a bankruptcy petition after august,given the benefit of an increased homestead exemption.see gleason,at,noting that the legislature conveyed a sense of immediacy,by,among other things,direct ing that the amendment was to take effect immediately.
we also agree with new york attorney general that the amendment is remedial in nature.see,macumber shafer,retroactively applying an amendment to the washington state homestead exemption increasing the exemption amount to unsecured debts incurred prior to the amendment i n order to further the purpose of the homestead legislation in general,and to give effect to the amendment increasing the dollar amount of the exemption in particular.the amendment clear objective was to update the statute to reflect current economic conditions and to once again protect debtors from losing their goal more likely to be advanced with a exemption amount moreover,several bankruptcy courts,including the court below here,have observed that applying an increased homestead exemption only to debts incurred would not adequately advance the ameliorative purpose of the exemption.see hayward,at evans,at.if we adopted cfcu interpretation,the policy goal underlying the increased homestead exemption would not be fully realized for bankruptcy debtors,like debtors here,who filed shortly after august but are burdened by debts.indeed,under such a reading,the relief the legislature sought to provide immediately would be a long time in coming.
in addition,the state legislature action on the homestead exemption increase appears to have been partly precipitated by congress passage of the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of.the assembly sponsor memo explicitly provided that the amendment will help to provide some relief from the stringent bankruptcy laws recently passed by congress.spons.if,however,we concluded that the old exemption amount legislative sponsors believed that amount was tantamount to having no exemption at all,spons,additional relief would be accorded to new york debtors,thus contravening the amendment purpose.
in light of the legislative finding that the increased exemption amount was long overdue and that the old amount was unrealistic in today economy,it would defeat the intent of the legislature to judicially engraft an provision similar to that found in the amendment onto the statute where none exists.it is well settled that t he legislature is presumed to be aware of the law in existence at the time of an enactment.matter of amorosi colonie.cent.sch,quoting b f.liebig.if the legislature intended the amendment to be prospective only,not to apply to debts it could easily have carried over the language from the amendment.it chose not to do so.thus,a new york debtor ability to invoke the increased homestead exemption is determined not by the date the debtor unsecured contract debt was incurred,but rather,by the date upon which the debtor files his or her bankruptcy petition.
certification 
before we depart from our state law analysis,we take a moment to explain why we decline to exercise our discretionary authority to certify the state law issue to the new york court of appeals.although neither the parties nor the attorney general as an intervenor advocated certification,we may certify a question where an unsettled and significant question of state law will control the outcome of a case pending before this court.second cir.local see.certification may be appropriate if with respect to the question asked there is a statute implicated and its plain language does not answer the question.city of.com,cir internal quotations and citations omitted alteration in original.if,however,an open issue of state law is not necessarily determinative of the outcome,certification is unwarranted.see galdamez keane,cir.as we have previously noted,certification is not necessarily required whenever a a plaintiff raises a federal constitutional chal
