in this direct appeal from the bankruptcy court,we are called upon to interpret a provision of chapter of the bankruptcy code that requires debtors to commit their projected disposable income to the repayment of unsecured claims.the bankruptcy code defines projected disposable income by requiring calculation of a debtor current monthly income less certain reasonably necessary expenses.henry hildebrand,iii,trustee in bankruptcy trustee,brings this appeal and claims error in the bankruptcy court approval of david and marguerite darrohn bankruptcy plan due to alleged miscalculations in the darrohns income and expenses under the projected disposable income formulation.with guidance from the supreme court recent decision in hamilton lanning,wl june,we reverse the bankruptcy court approval of the darrohns plan and remand for a recalculation of their projected disposable income.
david and marguerite darrohn filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under chapter of the bankruptcy code on october.the darrohns included within their petition a set of statutorily required schedules,which detail financial information as it existed at the time the petition was filed.specifically,schedule d listed the darrohns creditors holding secured claims and included the property securing the claim along with the outstanding debt.in schedule d,the darrohns listed countrywide home loans and regions bank as secured creditors holding mortgages secured by two pieces of real property.the countrywide home loans mortgage was secured by property located at richards way drive,cordova,tennessee,which served as the darrohns primary residence in the period before filing the bankruptcy petition.the regions bank mortgage was secured by property located at north mcleansboro,benton,illinois,which served as the residence of david darrohn father.it is undisputed that the darrohns intended to surrender both of these properties as part of their bankruptcy plan and,therefore,would no longer be required to pay the mortgages.
further,the darrohns filed schedule i,which listed their monthly income at the time the bankruptcy petition was filed.schedule i listed david darrohn monthly income as,marguerite darrohn monthly income as,and a monthly commission income of.the darrohns monthly income on schedule i totaled after payroll deductions.finally,the darrohns filed schedule j,listing their current monthly expenditures.schedule j calculated the darrohns average monthly expenditures as.based on calculations in schedules i and j,the darrohns had a monthly net income totaling.
aside from the schedules,the darrohns filed a chapter statement of current monthly and disposable income,also known as form.this form instructs petitioners to calculate their income by averaging the income for the six calendar months prior to filing the bankruptcy case,ending the last day of the month before the filing.at the bankruptcy hearing,david darrohn testified that during this period,he lost his job,which carried an annual salary of.after a period of unemployment,david darrohn secured another job,which carried an annual salary of.thus,based on form instructions,david darrohn monthly income calculated to,and marguerite darrohn monthly income amounted to.the darrohns combined monthly income on form totaled,which was significantly less than the amount listed on schedule form also instructs petitioners to list debt payments secured by their home,which are then deducted from petitioners total monthly income.under this section,the darrohns listed payments for the mortgages held by countrywide home loans and regions bank,though the couple intended to surrender these properties.after subtracting all of the allowable deductions from their monthly income,the darrohns disposable monthly income under form totaled.
chapter also requires petitioners to file a proposed repayment plan,under which debtors repay unsecured creditors over time based on how much the debtors can afford on a monthly basis.these monthly payments are derived from the debtors disposable monthly income calculated in form.though the darrohns form disposable income totaled a large negative number,they nevertheless proposed to pay creditors for a period of months.this repayment schedule would have left unsecured creditors receiving substantially less than the full amount owed to them.the trustee therefore objected to the darrohns proposed plan.the trustee proposed that the mortgage payments to countrywide home loans and regions bank be omitted from the darrohns form income deductions because the darrohns would no longer be making payments on these mortgages.in addition,the trustee proposed that the darrohns monthly income listed in schedule i be used to calculate their disposable monthly income because the formulation used in form artificially deflated their income by including a period of unemployment for david darrohn.the trustee specifically argued that the bankruptcy court should have considered the darrohns changed circumstances in confirming the plan.
in deciding whether to confirm the darrohns proposed plan,the bankruptcy court noted that the case presents the conundrum that every bankruptcy court in america practically has written an opinion on,and that how you calculate disposable income when the numbers come out differently using schedules i and j versus c.tr.of bankruptcy proceedings at,in re darrohn.after recounting the various methods courts have employed to resolve this problem,the bankruptcy court rejected the trustee proposals.the bankruptcy court determined that the darrohns monthly income calculated in accordance with form should serve as the starting point for the darrohns disposable income,rather than the larger amount reflected in schedule i.the court also determined that the darrohns could deduct mortgage payments for the surrendered properties.both of these determinations were predicated on the bankruptcy court interpretation of chapter and the court belief that it could not account for the darrohns changed circumstances.the bankruptcy court then confirmed the darrohns proposed plan of for repayment to unsecured creditors.the trustee now appeals the plan confirmation.specifically,the trustee alleges that the bankruptcy court erred in using the darrohns income calculated under form,rather than the income listed in schedule i,and in allowing the darrohns to deduct mortgage payments even though they intended to surrender the properties.
in this case,we must review the bankruptcy court interpretation of two sections in chapter.we review the bankruptcy court legal determinations de novo.shaw aurgroup fin.credit union,cir.
to better understand how the darrohns case fits within the statutory framework of chapter,we begin by addressing the requirements of this chapter.the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of revised the bankruptcy code in part by requiring income debtors to file for bankruptcy under the reorganization provisions in chapter.schultz united states,cir.this revision meant that income debtors would be required to make more payments to unsecured creditors under their bankruptcy plans.id.in this case,the darrohns income fell above the median income for a family of four in tennessee they were therefore required to file under the reorganization provisions of chapter.
a debtor filing for bankruptcy under chapter must propose a plan that provides for the submission of a portion of future income to the trustee.the bankruptcy court then must confirm the debtor plan in accordance with the provisions of chapter.id.section of chapter specifically requires the following 
b if the trustee or the holder of an allowed unsecured claim objects to the confirmation of the plan,then the court may not approve the plan unless,as of the effective date of the plan 
b the plan provides that all of the debtor projected disposable income to be received in the applicable commitment period beginning on the date that the first payment is due under the plan will be applied to make payments to unsecured creditors under the plan.
for the purposes of this subsection,the term disposable income means current monthly income received by the debtor
