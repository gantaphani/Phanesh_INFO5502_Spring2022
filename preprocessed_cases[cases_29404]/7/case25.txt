this is an important case resting at the intersection of the bankruptcy code and medicare law.it concerns the efforts of the parkview adventist medical center parkview in brunswick,maine,which filed for bankruptcy on june,to use the bankruptcy code to challenge the actions of appellee united states,through the centers for medicare medicaid services cms,in terminating its provider agreement with parkview and declining to reimburse parkview for certain services provided after the effective date of that termination.
after receiving a letter from parkview,cms concluded that parkview provider agreement was to be terminated,because cms found that parkview was no longer a hospital under the medicare statute.see e.an administrative law judge alj has issued a determination upholding the termination but adjusting the effective date.
both the bankruptcy court and the reviewing district court,see parkview adventist med.ctr.united states,cv jdl,wl me.may,denied parkview motion to compel post petition performance of executory contracts,which sought,inter alia,a d etermin ation that the termination notice from cms is null and void and that the provider agreement governing parkview eligibility for medicare reimbursement remains in full force and effect.it also sought relief requiring cms to honor the terms of the provider agreement and to reimburse parkview for part b services provided by parkview from and after june,in accordance with the terms of the provider agreement,as well as such other and further relief as is just and equitable.
in this motion,parkview argued that the provider agreement was an executory contract under,and accordingly within the bankruptcy court jurisdiction.as such,parkview contended,cms termination of the provider agreement was a termination without court authority,and prior to the debtor having exercised its right to assume or reject the provider agreement,in violation of,and of the code.parkview further argued that cms termination of the provider agreement violated the automatic stay in a,which stays any act to obtain possession of property of the estate or of property from the estate or to exercise control over property of the estate,and the provision in a,which provides that governmental agencies may not revoke a license or a similar grant solely on account of a party insolvency or the fact that a party has filed a bankruptcy petition.
the bankruptcy court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over the motion until parkview claims were administratively exhausted and that cms had not violated either the automatic stay or the provision.the district court affirmed,reasoning that g and h t ogether require the exhaustion of administrative remedies through the agency review process before judicial review takes place.parkview,wl,at.section g provides in part that 
any individual,after any final decision of the secretary made after a hearing to which he was a party,irrespective of the amount in controversy,may obtain a review of such decision by a civil action commenced within sixty days after the mailing to him of notice of such decision or within such further time as the secretary may allow.
g.section h further provides that 
the findings and decision of the secretary after a hearing shall be binding upon all individuals who were parties to such hearing.no findings of fact or decision of the secretary shall be reviewed by any person,tribunal,or governmental agency except as herein provided.no action against the united states,the secretary,or any officer or employee thereof shall be brought under section or of title to recover on any claim arising under this subchapter.
h.the district court concluded that parkview claims arose under the medicare statute and that the final sentence of h bars bankruptcy jurisdiction over such administratively unexhausted claims.parkview,wl,at.the district court also affirmed the bankruptcy court holding that cms had not violated the automatic stay,see a,nor the provision,see a.parkview,wl,at.
we acknowledge that there is a circuit split on the holding pertaining to h,as described by the district court as the district court correctly observed,the majority of circuits have adopted the view based on previous versions of the statute and its legislative history that even though h specifically mentions a bar to jurisdiction under only federal question jurisdiction and jurisdiction when the united states is a defendant,its jurisdictional bar applies to other grants of jurisdiction under title,including bankruptcy jurisdiction under.parkview,wl,at.only the ninth circuit has clearly adopted a contrary position.see do sung uhm humana,cir.citing in re town country home nursing,cir.in re.med,cir.holding that h did not preclude bankruptcy jurisdiction over an action to bar the offset of reimbursement of services against overpayments because the claim did not arise under the medicare statute.rather than add our voice to the circuit split on this difficult issue,we choose to resolve this case on narrower grounds evident from the record we affirm.
since only statutory jurisdiction is at stake in the h jurisdictional question and not article iii jurisdiction,we assume hypothetical jurisdiction.we have done so before when confronted with the same h question,and we do so again here,because of the difficulty of the jurisdictional issue and because parkview merits claims under the bankruptcy code obviously fail.see in re ludlow hosp,cir.as the h jurisdictional question is problematic,and the merits of the trustee appeal are not,we elect to bypass the jurisdictional issue at this time.citations omitted 
assuming arguendo that this case arises under the bankruptcy code,we affirm the denial of relief to parkview.we do so because the record is clear that cms did not violate the automatic stay provision.the statutory police and regulatory power exception to the automatic stay under b plainly applies.it follows,then,for this and other reasons,that the provision of the code is not offended.as to the arguments parkview makes on appeal regarding the executory contract provision of the code,we find that parkview sparse briefing amounts to waiver of the issue see aponte holder,cir.
in the interests of brevity,we recite only the facts necessary to this opinion.before its petition for bankruptcy,parkview operated as a hospital in brunswick,maine.it provided emergency services,inpatient services,and a variety of outpatient,ambulatory clinics and other medical services to the community.it maintained a provider agreement with cms that specified the conditions to which parkview had to agree and adhere in order to participate in medicare and receive reimbursements for both part a inpatient and part b outpatient services.see generally a listing requirements of a provider agreement with a provider of services,u the term provider of services means a hospital,critical access hospital,skilled nursing facility,comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation facility,home health agency,hospice program,or,for purposes of section g and section e of this title,a fund,e defining hospital as an institution primarily engaged in providing specified inpatient services,and listing other conditions.
parkview sent cms a letter dated june,stating that parkview was ending its participation in medicare.the letter stated that parkview would be filing a voluntary chapter petition on june,and that it would be closing as a hospital effective upon the order of the bankruptcy court and will no longer participate in the medicare program as an acute care hospital provider.it further stated that parkview expect ed the bankruptcy court to enter its order within sixty to ninety days of the date of this letter.parkview would begin to transition acute care services to mid coast hospital beginning june,but would continue to provide outpatient services.parkview filed its voluntary chapter petition on june,
in a letter dated june,cms replied that it would terminate the provider agreement as of june,
based upon information from your hospital website,your statements to cms,and your emergency motion filed in the district of maine bankruptcy case,cms has determined that the date of voluntary termination of your part a medicare provider agreement is june.see b.
according to the information reviewed by cms,the hospital has closed its inpatient care services on june,and discharged all inpatients on or about pm on june.additionally,the hospital is not accepting new inpatients,and does not plan to accept new inpatients in the future.therefore,the hospital no longer meets the definition of hospital,as outlined in section e of the social security act.see also.more specifically,a hospital must be an institution which is primarily engaged in providing care to inpatients.additionally,you have also requested voluntary termination of your participation in the medicare program.
therefore,under the provisions of federal regulations at b,your part a medicare provider agreement with the secretary of health and human services is terminated,effective june.no payment under this agreement can be made under the medicare program for services rendered on or after june.
on june,the maine department of health and human services issued a conditional license for parkview to operate outpatient services during the pendency of the bankruptcy proceedings,but did not authorize parkview to admit inpatients.parkview then informed cms that it was not terminating the provider agreement and that cms s decision to terminate the agreement would adversely affect parkview bankruptcy transition plan.in response,cms stated that it would rescind the termination if parkview resumed admission of inpatients.parkview then filed its motion to compel in the bankruptcy court on july,and this litigation ensued 
we turn to the merits of the claims parkview has preserved for appeal.parkview argues that cms termination of the provider agreement violates the code automatic stay.see a.and it contends that the termination was an impermissible discrimination against a debtor in bankruptcy,within the meaning of a.these claims raise issues of law subject to de novo review.barbosa soloman,cir.both arguments fail on the merits.
automatic stay 
parkview argues that cms termination of the provider agreement violated the automatic stay in a.the statute provides that counterparties may not take any act to obtain possession of property of the estate or of property from the estate or to exercise control over property of the estate.a.parkview contends that,because the provider agreement is an executory contract,cms may not involuntarily terminate it.it cites a number of cases for the proposition that a counterparty may not involuntarily terminate an executory contract.see in re mirant,cir.in re comput.commc ns,cir.
the government does not dispute that the provider agreement is an executory contract within the meaning of the bankruptcy code but it contests on a number of grounds parkview assertion that the termination of the provider agreement violates a.it argues that the provider agreement is not property of the estate under the meaning of a that that automatic stay does not expand parkview contractual rights under the automatic stay,and that parkview has never had a cognizable property or contractual interest in participating in medicare without meeting medicare conditions of participation and that the automatic stay does not apply to the termination because it is a nonfinal agency action.the government further asserts that even if parkview had a property interest in the provider agreement and the stay applied on its face to the termination,the police and regulatory power exception to the stay in b would apply without reaching the other arguments,we agree that the police and regulatory power exception to the stay applies to cms termination of the provider agreement.
the exception provision in b provides that the automatic stay of actions against the debtor does not apply to an action or proceeding by a governmental unit to enforce such governmental unit police and regulatory power.in turn,under in re mcmullen,cir,we make two inquiries.we ask whether the governmental action is designed primarily to protect the public safety and welfare.id.if so,the government action here the termination of the provider agreement is exempt.id.but if the action is an attempt by the government to recover property from the estate,it has a pecuniary purpose and so remains subject to the stay.see also in re nortel networks,cir.if the purpose of the law is to promote public safety and welfare or to effectuate public policy,then the exception to the automatic stay applies.if,on the other hand,the purpose of the law is to protect the government pecuniary interest in the debtor property or primarily to adjudicate private rights,then the exception is inapplicable.
parkview argues that the cms termination was not based on findings of a threat to the health or safety of patients.the premise of this argument is true,but largely irrelevant,as it is based on too circumscribed a view of the public interest.our precedents distinguish between actions enforcing generally applicable regulatory laws governing the behavior of debtors,which fall within the exception,and actions by government agencies to enforce contractual rights against debtors,which do not.in re corporacion de servicios medicos hospitalarios de fajardo,cir.the question is whether cms termination enforces a generally applicable regulatory law or furthers a public policy interest beyond the contractual rights in the provider agreement.
cms has a strong public policy interest in seeing that dollars are not spent on institutions that fail to meet qualification standards.in this instance,the standards are those for hospitals.see t.reimbursing parkview pursuant to the provider agreement after it had taken actions to disqualify itself from the medicare program,rendering it unable to provide services required by that program,would have been a waste of public monies and unlike a dispute over a contractual agreement between the government and a single private party,such as the one at issue in in re corporacion,applying the stay against cms here would threaten cms ability to enforce generally the medicare statute carefully articulated regulatory structure.see in re corporacion,at contrasting actions to enforce contractual rights with actions to enforce specific provisions of general regulatory schemes,and noting that the government had not tried to revoke the debtor hospital license until after filing an action to rescind its contract with the hospital,as well as the fact that the hospital had passed a medicare compliance inspection.the termination here was plainly the exercise of a regulatory power provided in the medicare statute.see b b explaining that the secretary may terminate a provider agreement when the provider fails substantially to meet the applicable provisions of section of this title,which includes the statutory definition of hospital.
further,it is clear that the termination of the provider agreement does not meet the pecuniary test.the government is not seeking recovery from parkview,nor is it demanding any payment.rather,one could reasonably view parkview petition as being made for the purpose of evading cms efforts to secure compliance with the medicare statute exactly the kind of action the police and regulatory power exception is meant to prevent.see in re mcmullen,at.because cms termination of the provider agreement enforced the generally applicable framework of the medicare statute and advanced a significant public policy interest,the police and regulatory power exception applies,and the automatic stay does not bar the termination.
we do not reach the other arguments raised by the government as to the stay application.
parkview also argues that cms termination of the provider agreement violates the provision in a,which states that 
a governmental unit may not deny,revoke,suspend,or refuse to renew a license,permit,charter,franchise,or other similar grant to,condition such a grant to,or discriminate with respect to such a grant against,a person that is or has been a debtor under this title.
a.parkview argues that,because cms termination letter came only two days after parkview filed its chapter petition and expressly stated that cms termination
