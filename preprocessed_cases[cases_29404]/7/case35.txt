we hold in this case that a claim to payment that thomas patton drive,llc patton drive holds against steven fustolo fustolo is not contingent as to liability or the subject of a bona fide dispute as to liability or amount within the meaning of section b of the bankruptcy code.b.we therefore affirm the decision of the bankruptcy court,which found patton drive qualified to join with two other creditors also holding,undisputed claims to force fustolo into an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding.
patton drive claims against fustolo arise out of four promissory notes issued to patton drive by fustolo affiliate companies in connection with two real estate transactions.fustolo personally guaranteed two of the notes the guaranteed notes,which together totaled million,but did not guarantee the other two notes the unguaranteed notes,which together totaled million.when the principal debtors defaulted on all four notes,patton drive sued the debtor companies and fustolo,asserting that fustolo was personally liable on his guarantee.the massachusetts state court found fustolo liable for breach of contract and rejected fustolo argument that patton drive technical violation of a state usury statute should reduce the amount of interest owed on the notes.the court entered a final judgment against fustolo in favor of patton drive in the amount of roughly million fustolo contends that this judgment overstated his liability by approximately million because it erroneously assumed that he had guaranteed all of the notes.in response,patton drive demurs,declining to offer any defense of the state court damages calculation.fustolo lodged a timely appeal of the state court judgment but did nothing further to prosecute the appeal,which we are told has rested more or less dormant on the state court appellate docket for at least four years.
meanwhile,fustolo,who admittedly has at least twelve creditors,failed to satisfy his financial obligations to at least two of those other creditors,the patriot group llc patriot and richard mayer mayer.on may,eighteen months after entry of the state court judgment,patton drive joined with patriot and mayer to file a petition with the united states bankruptcy court,seeking to place fustolo into involuntary chapter bankruptcy,and to thereby cause fustolo debts to be determined and his assets gathered and liquidated in an orderly fashion to satisfy those debts.see b,et.
the creditors ability to force fustolo into bankruptcy rests on b,which provides that involuntary bankruptcy proceedings may be commenced via petition to the bankruptcy court 
by three or more entities,each of which is a holder of a claim against the debtor that is not contingent as to liability or the subject of a bona fide dispute as to liability or amount if such noncontingent,undisputed claims aggregate at least more than the value of any lien on property of the debtor securing such claims held by the holders of such claims.
b see also id.a.fustolo does not dispute that patriot and mayer hold eligible claims against him.nor does fustolo dispute that the total amount of those undisputed claims exceeds the value of any related liens on his property by the statutorily requisite amount.however,fustolo maintains that patton drive has not asserted a claim that qualifies it to serve as a petitioning creditor because his pending state court appeal subjects patton drive judgment to bona fide dispute as to liability or amount.id.b.
following an evidentiary hearing in the bankruptcy court on fustolo challenge to their qualifications to initiate an involuntary proceeding,the three petitioning creditors moved for summary judgment.fustolo opposed the motion and filed his own for summary judgment.on december,the bankruptcy court granted summary judgment to the petitioning creditors,thus authorizing involuntary bankruptcy proceedings to commence against fustolo.
in assessing whether patton drive state court judgment constituted a qualifying claim despite fustolo appeal,the bankruptcy court employed the approach approved by the fourth circuit in in re byrd,cir.under this approach,the court did not accord the state court judgment against fustolo dispositive force in establishing the absence of a bona fide dispute concerning the right to payment recognized and affirmed in that judgment.instead,the court began with a presumption that the judgment foreclosed any bona fide dispute,but then proceeded to assess the merits of fustolo pending state court appeal to determine whether fustolo case exemplifie d the rare circumstance where the amount of the judgment is in bona fide dispute.upon examination,the court found a bona fide dispute as to the portion of the judgment that awarded damages against fustolo on the unguaranteed notes because,among other things,patton drive did not oppose the contention that it had no right to recover against fustolo on those notes.at the same time,the bankruptcy court separately assessed patton drive right to payment on the portion of the state court judgment that covered fustolo breach of contract on the guaranteed notes.finding this portion of the judgment free of bona fide dispute,the bankruptcy court granted summary judgment to fustolo creditors and denied fustolo.
fustolo then appealed to the district court and found himself jumping from the frying pan into the fire.the district court eschewed the fourth circuit analysis of the preclusive effect of an appealed state court judgment,opting instead for the approach announced in in re drexler,and adopted by the only other circuit court to have decided this issue,see in re marciano,cir.under the drexler rule,an unstayed state court judgment,whether or not subject to appeal,per se constitutes a claim that is not subject to bona fide dispute.see drexler,at.therefore finding that fustolo appeal in state court,however meritorious,could not raise a bona fide dispute as to patton drive claim,the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court order.
fustolo now appeals to this court pursuant to d urging us,first,to reject the district court decision to apply drexler categorical rule and,second,to reject the bankruptcy court determination that,even under byrd more rule,patton drive qualifies as a petitioning creditor because it holds a claim on the guaranteed notes that is free of bona fide dispute.for slightly different reasons,we affirm.
in bankruptcy proceedings,summary judgment is appropriate when the movant has shown that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.fed.a.we review the bankruptcy court grant of summary judgment de novo.in re colarusso,cir.in undertaking this review,we afford no deference to the district court intermediate decision.in re healthco int l,cir.
we begin with the creditors argument that we can easily resolve this appeal by adopting the district court conclusion that the drexler rule applies and that patton drive claim is therefore categorically free from bona fide dispute.if the creditors are correct on this point,we need not and indeed can not look behind the state court judgment to assess its merits.on the facts of this case,however,we can not hold that the drexler rule applies.
the drexler rule,followed by the ninth circuit,see marciano,at,has much to commend it.it is simple to apply,and it reduces the waste of assets inherent in opening the opportunity for a financially troubled party to argue the merits of issues previously adjudicated in state court.it also arguably accords to a state court judgment the sort of respect and finality reflected in the full faith and credit act,which requires that federal courts give state court judgments the same full faith and credit as they have by law or usage in the courts of such state from which they are taken.see also marciano,at 
more importantly,the drexler rule fits with congress apparent purpose in requiring each claim underlying an involuntary petition to be free of bona fide dispute.in usual course,bankruptcy serves as a haven for debtors seeking protection from creditors and hoping to make a fresh start.see in re fahey,cir.but the bankruptcy code also serves another,often conflicting,purpose to ensure fair payment to creditors.in re energy res,cir.section of the bankruptcy code thus allows creditors who satisfy certain conditions to force a debtor into bankruptcy,so that the disposition of the debtor assets can proceed in a more orderly fashion.
the requirement that the petitioning creditors claims be free of bona fide dispute was added by the bankruptcy amendments and federal judgeship act of,b,stat.the bankruptcy code does not define the term bona fide dispute,but courts have more or less settled on finding a bona fide dispute when there is either a genuine issue of material fact that bears upon the debtor liability or a meritorious contention as to the application of law to undisputed facts.in re bdc llc,cir citing cases,abrogated on other grounds as recognized in in re zarnel,cir.the purpose of the no bona fide dispute requirement,as courts have repeatedly recognized,is to prevent creditors from using involuntary bankruptcy to coerce a debtor to satisfy a judgment even when substantial questions may remain concerning the liability of the debtor.byrd,at quoting in re prisuta,see also bdc llc,at in re tikijian,it was stated by the proponent of the amendment that the primary purpose of the addition of the bona fide dispute language was to prevent creditors from using involuntary bankruptcy as a club to coerce a debtor to pay debts as to which the debtor,in good faith,had legitimate defenses.with that purpose in mind,courts generally try to determine whether,objectively,there is a dispute about a debt that reasonably warrants resolution by a factfinder or,in the case of a dispute of law,a court.see in re busick,cir t he bankruptcy court must determine whether there is an objective basis for either a factual or a legal dispute as to the validity of debt.when such a dispute exists,we do not allow the creditor to coerce the debtor surrender by credibly threatening to use the claim as a basis for an involuntary petition.
but when the creditor already holds a state court judgment upon which execution is possible,allowing the creditor to join in forcing a bankruptcy proceeding adds little material weight to the creditor ability to coerce payment of the debt.the absence of a stay also undercuts the debtor ability to argue that the state courts view the debt as not quite collectable.consistent with these reasons,the drexler rule applies only to unstayed state court judgments that actually entitle a creditor to access the debtor assets.drexler,at see also,in re raymark.
turning to the instant case,a massachusetts trial court judgment is effectively stayed by operation of state law for the purposes of execution,even absent a court order,while an appeal is pending.see.laws ch,id.ch.civ.a.thus,patton drive could not execute in massachusetts courts on its judgment.see,peterson,wl,at.may,refusing execution on a confessed judgment on a promissory note pending debtors appeal 
the courts below treated this wrinkle as inconsequential in light of the fact that massachusetts law does not automatically stay the other legal effects of a judgment pending appeal.in particular,the courts below held that patton drive state court judgment is unstayed because of the availability of postjudgment discovery and attachment under massachusetts law regardless of a pending appeal.see farrell,llp haddon,wl,at,unpublished opinion discovery borne haverhill golf country club,attachment.but these tools would have been available to patton drive even prior to the judgment that fixed its rights.see.civ.prejudgment attachment id,discovery.and the fact that a trial court judgment is stayed in some senses under massachusetts law pending appeal,while remaining unstayed in others,does not by itself tell us whether the judgment is stayed or unstayed for the purposes of the drexler rule.
we are not persuaded that a judgment is unstayed for bankruptcy purposes merely because that judgment continues to have some legal effects despite a creditor legal inability to execute.the bankruptcy code defines a claim as,in relevant part,a right to payment.a emphasis supplied.and in construing the requirement that such a claim be free from bona fide dispute,courts applying the drexler rule have focused not on the abstract existence of a legal right,but rather on the ability to vindicate that right in court.see,marciano,at no bona fide dispute when petitioning creditors were free under california law to collect the amounts owed under the judgments at the time the involuntary petition was filed emphasis supplied id.at ikuta,dissenting the majority reasoning seems to be that because an unstayed state court judgment is immediately enforceable,there can be no objective basis for dispute as to the claim liability or amount.emphasis supplied drexler,at unstayed state court judgment not subject to bona fide dispute because a contrary holding would effect a radical alteration of the enforceability of unstayed final judgments emphasis supplied.because the ability to execute on a state court judgment provides a crucial link in the rationale that justifies the bright line,automatic nature of the drexler rule,we find that rule inapplicable when,as here,execution on the judgment is stayed,even if only by automatic operation of state law patton drive state court judgment is therefore not categorically insulated from bona fide dispute.
even though a state court judgment does not necessarily establish the absence of bona fide dispute when that judgment is effectively stayed,the judgment must nevertheless play some role in our analysis.the fact that a state court has already considered and adjudicated the merits of a claim,and entered judgment on the claim,weighs heavily in favor of finding the claim beyond bona fide dispute.see byrd,at state court judgments were strong evidence that the creditor claims were valid.this observation is particularly salient where the judgment is stayed by virtue of the automatic operation of state law and not because a state court has probed the merits of the judgment and found reason to suspect that it may be incorrect.
but despite the weight we would normally attach to a state court judgment,here we have a judgment that appears on its face to be in error because it holds fustolo personally liable for roughly million on the unguaranteed notes and,notably,patton drive as the holder of the judgment offers no reason at all to think otherwise.as the bankruptcy court recognized,patton drive de facto concession on this point certainly creates a bona fide dispute as to the amount of patton drive right to payment on the judgment.
as patton drive points out,however,the dispute over the judgment concerns only a portion of the judgment.fustolo makes no real effort to deny that he owes,at least,the principal due under the guaranteed notes,which totals million based on this concession,patton drive asks us to rule that any dispute concerning the amount of the liability represented by the judgment can be ignored,because the amount admittedly owed well exceeds the amount necessary to justify patton drive joinder as a petitioning creditor under b.
in making this argument,the creditors essentially ask us to read an implicit materiality requirement into the statutory language bona fide dispute as to liability or amount.b.prior to,some courts had held as the bankruptcy court held here that a claim to a disputed amount could nevertheless form the basis of an involuntary petition if the undisputed portion of the claim could independently qualify the creditor.see,in re focus media,cir bdc llc,at ibm credit compuhouse,in re willow lake partners ii.in,however,congress amended section to add the language as to liability or amount.bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of,stat.faced with a dearth of clarifying legislative history,courts are more or less evenly split on whether the amendment was intended to change the prevailing law by establishing that a dispute as to any portion of a claim,even if some dollar amount would be left undisputed,means there is a bona fide dispute as to the amount of the claim,in re vicor,wl,at,or simply to reinforce the interpreta
