three executives signed employment agreements with their corporate employer.each agreement contained a provision stating that if either party the executive or the corporation had a ny claim against the other,the claiming party had to present the claim in writing to the other party within one year of the date the claiming party knew or should have known about the facts giving rise to the claim.otherwise,the claim was forever barred.subsequently,the employer filed for bankruptcy.
plaintiff,the trustee in bankruptcy,filed this action against the three executives,alleging a breach of fiduciary duty.after litigating the breach of fiduciary duty claim in court but before trial,all three executives moved to compel arbitration of the claim pursuant to an arbitration clause in their employment agreements.the trial court granted the motions to compel.on appeal,we reversed as to two of the executives on the ground they had waived the right to arbitration we concluded the third executive had not waived the right to arbitration,but the trustee declined to arbitrate the claims against him,and he was therefore dismissed from the suit zamora lehman th,d.litigation proceeded in the trial court as to the other two executives.
the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the two executives on the ground that neither the corporation nor the trustee in bankruptcy had satisfied the contractual notice provision.we agree with the trial court and affirm.
background 
the allegations and facts in this case are taken from the complaint and the papers submitted on the motion for summary judgment as well as our two prior opinions in this case.we accept as true the following facts and reasonable inferences supported by plaintiff evidence and by defendants undisputed evidence.see jackson county of los angeles th,d.
the original complaint was filed on december,by the trustee in bankruptcy,nancy zamora.a first amended complaint complaint was filed on may.it alleged as follows.
was a direct marketing company that promoted a wide variety of products via television,radio,and the internet.each week,broadcast more than television programs,commonly known as infomercials,around the world.the infomercials reached percent of the television homes in the united states and million television households in more than countries worldwide.
stephen lehman was the chairman and chief executive officer of.eric weiss was the and chief operating officer.daniel yukelson was the chief financial officer.all three were executives and directors.zamora lehman,supra,th at,d.
the executives controlled and dominated for their own personal benefit by issuing misleading press releases announcing that had raised million when the money was in fact required to repay investments and had retained donaldson,luftkin jennerette as financial consultants.the executives also caused or allowed to engage in improper billing procedures.they did not disclose any of these acts.
the executives caused one of subsidiaries,quantum north america qna,to enter into a loan and security agreement with foothill capital corporation foothill under which qna obtained a million credit facility in exchange for a promise to maintain a minimum net worth of million.the executives caused or permitted qna net worth to fall below million.as a result,qna defaulted under the agreement with foothill.
acquired a percent interest in buyitnow,a leading internet retailer featuring a large selection of brand name products and specialty items.the executives transferred more than million from buyitnow to with no invoices or management committee consent,commingled the two companies funds,failed to hold proper board meetings,f ail ed to obtain unanimous board consent on several corporate transactions including stock issuances,advertised products for buyitnow as seen on tv when could not fulfill the orders in a timely manner,caused to show a million accounts receivable from buyitnow without providing any accounting or billing information to buyitnow,and improperly billed buyitnow to manipulate ebitda earnings before interest,taxes,depreciation and amortization.these actions diminished investment in buyitnow,exposed to substantial liability,and harmed its reputation and creditworthiness.
the executives caused or permitted and its subsidiaries to inflate earnings and net worth artificially by charging customers credit cards multiple times for a single purchase and by charging customers credit cards for merchandise did not have in stock.in so doing,the executives violated the chargeback limits of the credit card company.
attempted to sell its asian subsidiaries but that effort failed when the executives allowed the subsidiaries to fall significantly off their operating budgets.
eventually,lost its ability to fill and ship orders.the executives caused or permitted to sell and transfer its computers to employees for nominal sums.
on or about march,filed for chapter protection under the bankruptcy code.the chapter proceeding was later converted to a chapter case.
the executives concealed their wrongful acts and omissions.did not discover the acts and omissions until november.
as stated,on december,the chapter trustee,nancy hoffmeier zamora,filed this action,alleging the foregoing facts and a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty against the three executives.lehman superior court th,d,italics added.
motion to compel arbitration 
on november,yukelson filed a motion to compel arbitration and stay the action pending the outcome of arbitration.in a supporting declaration,he stated because more than five years had passed between the time i left and the time i received notice of this lawsuit,i did not remember any of the terms of my employment agreement.similarly,yukelson attorney did not know that yukelson had a written employment agreement until november.in the motion,yukelson argued,while still in business,had been engaged in interstate commerce,and thus the federal arbitration act faa applied.yukelson asserted that,under the faa,he had not waived the right to arbitrate because he had no knowledge of his contractual right to compel arbitration at the time the litigation began and only discovered that right three days ago.
on december,lehman and weiss jointly filed a motion to compel arbitration based on the arbitration provision in their respective employment agreements.that provision was identical to the one in yukelson agreement.lehman and weiss stated in declarations that they had forgotten about the arbitration provision in their employment agreement s until the week before the motion was filed.they,too,argued the faa applied and,under the faa,they had not waived the right to arbitrate because they did not know about the arbitration provision during the litigation.
zamora filed opposition papers contending the california arbitration act caa code civ,not the faa,governed the case and,under the caa,defendants had waived the right to arbitrate by delay in bringing their motions and by engaging in discovery not available under the arbitration provision.zamora asserted that the discovery conducted by defendants had prejudiced her ability to pursue the case in arbitration.
the motions to compel were heard on february,and were granted by judge william highberger.zamora lehman,supra,th at,d.on appeal,we concluded that lehman and weiss had waived their right to arbitration by engaging in discovery,and we reversed the trial court order as to them.we concluded that yukelson had not waived his right to arbitration because he had attempted to settle the case and had not engaged in discovery to the same extent as the other two executives.zamora declined to proceed with arbitration as to yukelson,resulting in his dismissal from the action.id.at,d.
motion for summary judgment 
on august,lehman and weiss defendants filed a motion for summary judgment,contending that the breach of fiduciary duty claim was by a notice provision in their employment agreements,the delaware statute of limitations ann.tit,a,and california catchall statute of limitations code civ.the notice provision was part of the arbitration section of the employment agreements and read 
the parties agree that any disputes,controversies or claims which arise out of or relate to this agreement,the executive employment or the termination of his employment,including,but not limited to,any claim relating to the purported validity,interpretation,enforceability or breach of this agreement,any other claim or controversy arising out of the relationship between the executive and the company or the continuation or termination of that relationship,including,but not limited to,claims that a termination was for cause,or for claims for breach of covenant,breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,wrongful termination,breach of contract,or other tort or property claims of any kind,which are not settled by agreement between the parties,shall be settled by arbitration under the labor arbitration rules of the american arbitration association before a board of three arbitrators,as selected thereunder.
any claim which either party has against the other party which could be submitted for resolution pursuant to this section must be presented in writing by the claiming party to the other within one year of the date the claiming party knew or should have known of the facts giving rise to the claim,except that claims arising out of or related to the termination of the executive employment must be presented by him within one year after the date of termination.unless the party against whom any claim is asserted waives the time limits set forth above,any claim not brought within the time periods specified shall be waived and forever barred.italics added.
in moving for summary judgment,defendants both stated i never received notice from or the bankruptcy trustee of a potential breach of fiduciary duty claim against me until this action was filed.they argued that a breach of fiduciary duty claim fell within paragraph,which encompassed any disputes,controversies or claims which arise out of or relate to this agreement or the executive employment including,but not limited to,tort or property claims of any kind.consequently,the notice provision applied.
in opposing summary judgment,zamora relied on documents that,according to her,constituted timely notice to defendants that had a breach of fiduciary duty claim against them.
on november,the trial court,judge mary strobel presiding,heard the motion.the same day,she signed a order granting the motion and explaining the basis for her decision.
the order stated the inquiry is whether zamora presented defendants with a written claim within one year of knowing the facts of the claim.both defendants declare that they were not provided with such notice.thus,defendants have met their burden of showing that zamora claim is waived and forever barred under the language of the employment agreements for failure to give written notice of claims.the burden therefore shifts to zamora to raise a triable issue of fact.
zamora argues that notice was in fact given,citing to several letters regarding directors and officer insurance.the first of these is an october,letter from general counsel william matthews addressed to yukelson and copied to lehman and weiss attaching a draft letter to be sent to insurance carriers matthews explains that the draft letter provid es notice of certain potential claims that may be made against the policies referenced in the letter.the attached draft letter is addressed to various insurance companies with whom has directors and officers insurance policies,and has the stated purpose of advising the insurers of the following events circumstances which may result in a claim being made for insurance coverage pursuant to one or more of the policies.in short,this is a letter from counsel telling defendants to notify insurance carrier via the draft letter of potential claims against the company or its officers and directors.this is not a written claim from to defendants notifying defendants that has a claim against them.
zamora also argues that mention of shareholder claims in this letter should be sufficient to constitute notice.the letter mentions claims that foothill may have against qna management and board of directors,but foothill is neither nor one of its shareholders.the letter also mentions complaints received from shareholders of buyitnow,which raise allegations of corporate mismanagement and unfairness to minority shareholders.however,these shareholder complaints are from shareholders of buyitnow,not.in any event,this letter does not constitute written notice to defendants of claims against them as required under the employment agreements.
zamora also presents sent to yukelson and messages posted on a yahoo message board as evidence that notice was given.the were sent to yukelson by shareholders,and then faxed by yukelson to attorneys the court has overruled in part,and sustained in part,defendants objection to this exhibit,rendering admissible the to yukelson but not the messages posted on the yahoo message board.as regards the first five pages of the fax,these are not notice from the company to lehman and weiss regarding a claim under section.
zamora next cites to a draft letter dated october,from lehman and addressed to david salzman,a member of the board of directors,which appears to have been faxed to salzman on november.zamora cites to page of the letter in which lehman explains that claims were made on the d o policy.the letter states 
the d o policy is on a claims made basis.accordingly,the policy must be in effect at the time a claim is made in spite of when the act may have occurred,or there is a risk of not being covered.in order to address this issue,the company has to put its d o carrier on notice of possible claims involving shareholders of buyitnow,issues that foothill may have,and claims involving shareholders of the company.the notification was broad in order to attempt to the possible claims should they be brought against the company,its directors officers at a later date.in the event of a claim,the policy has a deductible.however,in the event that the company is unable to indemnify officers and directors,company is insolvent or under bankruptcy proceedings,there is no deductible.there is presently million of coverage.
in sum,lehman is notifying salzman,a board member,of the fact that insurers have been notified of potential shareholder claims against buyitnow,claims by foothill,and unspecified claims involving shareholders of the company.again,this is not a letter from notifying defendants that has claims against them.the court does not find that this letter creates a triable issue of fact as to whether notice of claims was given to defendants as required under section of their respective employment agreements.
at the first hearing on this motion on november,zamora argued that because the defendants were the officers of the company,there was no other person within the company to give notice to defendants of the company claim against them.the evidence submitted and discussed above shows that there were other members of the board who could have provided such notice.crawford declares that there were a total of seven members of the board five excluding defendants.crawford and salzman,two members of the board,both state that they did not feel that board of directors was dominated or controlled by management.crawford and salzman also state that from their observations,buchalter was a knowledgeable and independent director who performed his duties competently.thus,the evidence indicates that there were members of the board of directors other than defendants who could have given notice of claims by against defendants,as long as they had knowledge of the claim.as noted above,no such notice was given.
assuming that board of directors failure to give notice to defendants of its claims within one year is for some reason excusable,zamora,as bankruptcy trustee of,could have given notice of claims and failed to do so.the complaint acknowledges that zamora was aware of the facts underlying the breach of fiduciary claim on or about november.thus,the period under section expired at the latest by november.after that date,the breach of fiduciary duty claim against defendants was waived and forever barred.because zamora did not provide notice of her claim before november,her claim is barred by the express language of the employment agreements.italics added.
the trial court concluded,in the alternative,that the action was barred by california catchall statute of limitations code civ.see lehman superior court,supra,th at,d.the court did not reach the question of whether the delaware statute of limitations applied.nor did it decide whether the notice provision in defendants employment agreements required that a claim be filed with the american arbitration association during the same period.
on december,the trial court entered judgment in favor of defendants.zamora appealed.
discussion 
a motion for summary judgment must be granted if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c.
a defendant seeking summary judgment has met the burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if that party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action can not be established or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action once the defendant burden is met,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of fact exists as to that cause of action in reviewing the propriety of a summary judgment,the appellate court independently reviews the record that was before the trial court we must determine whether the facts as shown by the parties give rise to a triable issue of material fact t he moving party affidavits are strictly construed while those of the opposing party are liberally construed.we accept as undisputed facts only those portions of the moving party evidence that are not contradicted by the opposing party evidence in other words,the facts supported by the evidence of the party opposing summary judgment and the reasonable inferences therefrom must be accepted as true.jackson county of los angeles,supra,th at,d,citations omitted.
t he party moving for summary judgment bears an initial burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable issue of material fact if he carries his burden of production,he causes a shift,and the opposing party is then subjected to a burden of production of his own to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a triable issue of material fact.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.
on appeal,zamora argues that the notice provision is unreasonable and therefore invalid.as she sees it,and defendants could not adopt a notice provision that has the same effect as shortening california statute of limitations code civ.zamora also contends that disputed issues of fact exist as to whether,in accordance with defendants employments agreements,provided defendants with timely notice that it had a breach of fiduciary duty claim against them.
we conclude that and defendants could lawfully require one year notice of a claim by one party against the other and that neither or zamora,as the trustee in bankruptcy,gave such notice to defendants.we reach this conclusion regardless of whether the contractual notice provision is subject to strict construction against defendants see lewis hopper d,or,as more recently suggested,is not subject to strict construction see zalkind ceradyne,th,d.
a.the notice provision 
because the notice provision has the same effect as a statute of limitations,the parties analyze its validity by relying on cases addressing whether the statute of limitations may be lawfully shortened by contract.
waiver of the notice provision 
zamora seems to argue that because defendants waived their right to arbitration under the employment agreements,they also waived their right to invoke the notice provision.that argument is without merit.in zamora lehman,supra,th,d,we held that defendants had waived their right to arbitration because they unnecessarily delayed in seeking arbitration,and,in the meantime,they had engaged in discovery in the civil action that was unavailable in an arbitral forum.see id.at,d.we did not suggest that the notice provision was unenforceable.indeed,we did not discuss it at all.
as defendants assert,the employment agreements,which contained the notice provision,were properly approved the agreements were negotiated between defendants,on the one hand,and compensation committee,on the other hand,and were then approved by the board of directors.thereafter,one of independent directors instructed lehman to execute weiss agreement on behalf of the company,and weiss to do the same for lehman.
validity of the notice provision 
with respect to the validity of a contractual limitations period,we have previously explained in general,california courts have permitted contracting parties to modify the length of the otherwise applicable california statute of limitations,whether the contract has extended or shortened the limitations period 
as to extending the limitations period,an early supreme court case upheld an agreement to permanently waive the statute of limitations as a defense.dexter pierson cal.however,in,the legislature enacted section of the code of civil procedure.that statute permits waivers of the statute of limitations defense provided they are in writing and do not extend the limitations period for more than four years at a time it allows for any number of successive,separately executed agreements for additional periods.in contrast,the legislature has provided in the california uniform commercial code that the limitations period for breach of a sales contract can not be extended by agreement of the parties,subd.nonetheless,once sued,if a defendant does not timely raise a limitations defense,it is waived regardless of how long the plaintiff has delayed 
as for shortening the limitations period,the courts will enforce the parties agreement provided it is reasonable for instance,the parties can shorten california statute of limitations for breach of a written contract code civ,subd.to three months,six months,or a year as provided by statute,parties to a sales contract governed by the california uniform commercial code can shorten the statute of limitations for breach of contract to not less than a year,subd.
thus,except as restricted by statute,california courts accord contracting parties substantial freedom to modify the length of the statute of limitations.as the supreme court has stated in permitting parties to shorten the limitations period s tatutes of limitations are regarded as statutes of repose,carrying with them,not a right protected under the rule of public policy,but a mere personal right for the benefit of the individual,which may be waived we are unable to perceive that any distinction can be made upon the ground of public policy between the right of a party to waive the plea of the statute of limitations as a defense to an action,and his right to waive a portion of the time granted by the statute for the commencement of an action.tebbets fidelity and casualty cal,citations omitted.hambrecht quist venture partners american medical,th,d hambrecht,fn.some citations omitted.
as we noted in hambrecht although the supreme court waiver analysis in tebbets fidelity and casualty,supra,cal,has withstood the test of time,subsequent supreme court cases have commented that the statutes of limitations do serve public policies of course,the statute of limitations remains a matter of personal right for the benefit of the individual in the sense that a defendant waives that defense by not timely raising it hambrecht,supra,th at,fn,d.
according to one treatise the obligor may seek special protection by incorporating provisions in an agreement that require the commencement of an action within a shorter period than that allowed by the applicable statute of limitations they are generally upheld if the shorter period is reasonable,if it gives sufficient time for the effective pursuit of the judicial remedy.witkin,cal.procedure ed.actions,italics added.
in moreno sanchez th,d moreno,the purchasers of a home,the morenos,hired an inspector,sanchez,to inspect the home for defects before escrow closed.he reported no significant problems.the home inspection contract contained a provision stating that any lawsuit against sanchez had to be filed within one year of the date of inspection.the inspection was conducted on august,and escrow closed in october of that year.in december,the morenos began feeling ill.they had the home inspected by others.one company discovered asbestos in the heating and air conditioning ducts.another company found an unsealed air return that permitted the heating and cooling systems to draw dust,dirt,and rust into the system and then spread them throughout the home.the morenos filed suit against sanchez on october,one year and two months after the date of the inspection.the trial court sustained sanchez demurrer without leave to amend,finding that the morenos did not file suit within one year after the inspection.
the court of appeal reversed.it found the limitations provision to be unenforceable,stating because of the hidden nature of these systems and components a potential homeowner may not see or recognize a home inspector negligence,and thus may not understand he has been damaged until long after the inspection date.this fact,coupled with the trust the potential homeowners must necessarily place in the professional home inspector,compel the conclusion causes of action for breach of a home inspector duty of care should accrue in all cases,not on the date of the inspection,but when the homeowner discovers,or with the exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered,the inspector breach.moreno,supra,th at,d.the court of appeal acknowledged that california courts have afforded contracting parties considerable freedom to modify the length of a statute of limitations.courts generally enforce parties agreements for a shorter limitations period than otherwise provided by statute,provided it is reasonable.reasonable in this context means the shortened period nevertheless provides sufficient time to effectively pursue a judicial remedy.it is a proposition of law that the parties to a contract may stipulate therein for a period of limitation,shorter than that fixed by the statute of limitations,and that such stipulation violates no principle of public policy,provided the period fixed be not so unreasonable as to show imposition or undue advantage in some way.id.at,d,italics added accord,william lyon associates,superior court th,d.
the court of appeal in moreno continued a contractually shortened limitations period has never been recognized outside the context of straightforward transactions in which the triggering event for either a breach of a contract or for the accrual of a right is immediate and obvious.moreover,no decision upholding the validity of a contractually shortened limitation period has done so in the context of an action against a professional or skilled expert where breach of a duty is more difficult to detect.moreno,supra,th at,d.in the present context,a cause of action may not be known,or even suspected,until long after the home inspection is completed.a shortened limitations period in this context may thus foreclose an effective judicial remedy for many homeowners.for this reason,for a provision in a home inspection contract shortening the statute of limitations to be enforceable,we hold accrual of a cause of action occurs not with the inspection,but when the homeowner discovers,or through the exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered,the breach.id.at,d,italics added.in short,no authority exists which sanctions a contractual provision permitting parties to opt out of the benefits of the discovery rule in situations where the discovery rule would otherwise apply.this suggests there exists an implicit consensus that an effective judicial remedy against professionals or skilled crafts people requires accrual occur only upon discovery of the breach and thus the law will not tolerate contractual nullification of that policy.id.at,d,italics boldface added accord,charnay cobert th,d provision in retainer agreement requiring client to challenge billing statements within days of receipt declared invalid because it did not incorporate delayed discovery rule client breach of fiduciary duty claim was not barred by day provision witkin,cal.procedure,supra,actions,discussing contractual provisions shortening statute of limitations and delayed discovery rule.
here,the notice provision stated that the claiming party had to give written notice of the claim to the other party within one year of the date the claiming party knew or should have known of the facts giving rise to the claim.italics added.because the provision contains language adopting the delayed discovery rule,it is valid under moreno and similar cases.contrary to zamora argument,a contractual notice provision is enforceable with respect to a claim against a professional or skilled expert as long as the provision incorporates the delayed discovery rule.see moreno,supra,th at,d.
in her opening brief,zamora states no reported opinion anywhere has ever enforced a contractual limitation on a corporation ability to bring claims against officers of that corporation for breach of fiduciary duty of the type asserted here but there is at least one decision supporting defendants position on this issue.in in re brocade communications systems,d,a corporation formed a special litigation committee to assume control of a previously filed shareholder derivative action and to pursue the action on behalf of the corporation.the suit was brought against former officers and directors who had allegedly participated in an illegal stock option backdating scheme.the original complaint contained a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty.the committee filed an amended complaint,adding causes of action for federal securities fraud b and fraud under california law.
with respect to two of the directors,the district court held that a contractual provision barred the new fraud claims,explaining defendants neal dempsey and seth neiman argue that the corporation is contractually barred from asserting a fraud claim under their individual indemnification agreements.these agreements provide no legal action shall be brought and no cause of action shall be asserted by or in the right of the company against indemnitee after the expiration of two years from the date of accrual of such cause of action,and any claim or cause of action of the corporation shall be extinguished and deemed released unless asserted by the timely filing of a legal action within such period 
both delaware and california courts recognize contractual provisions shortening the relevant statute of limitations as valid and enforceable 
here,the indemnification agreement operates to bar the fraud claims newly brought against dempsey and neiman.under the contract plain language,the corporation is foreclosed from asserting any claim or cause of action more than two years after such claim or cause of action accrued t he fraud claims accrued in october,at the point when the corporation was put on inquiry notice of the backdating scheme.no federal securities fraud claim or california fraud claim was asserted against these defendants until august,more than four years later.
plaintiff argues that under moreno,supra,th,d,the contractual period of limitations should be tolled.even assuming that california law applies to this matter,moreno merely stands for the limited proposition that a cause of action may not accrue in a suit against a home inspector until the injury is discovered applying the discovery rule here means that the federal securities fraud claim accrued in october,when the corporation was put on inquiry notice of defendants conduct.moreno simply can not be extended far enough to relieve the corporation of the indemnification it agreed to provide dempsey and neiman.
therefore,the claims for fraud under federal law and california law are barred by the indemnification agreement as to defendants dempsey and neiman.in re brocade communications systems,supra,d at,fns.citations omitted.in a footnote,the district court commented because the breach of fiduciary duty claims were timely filed in the origin
