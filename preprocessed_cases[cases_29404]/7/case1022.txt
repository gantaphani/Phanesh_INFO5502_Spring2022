background 
this case began in ingham county circuit court in lansing,michigan.there,on october,creditors filed suit against debtors and a third defendant,george wilbur,alleging fraud and defamation,among other things.the basis of the defamation claim was that debtors and wilbur made false and defamatory statements to third parties regarding the paternity of debtor diane kennedy.specifically,creditors claimed that debtors made statements to the effect that creditor phillip mustaine was not diane kennedy biological father but rather,george wilbur was her biological father,despite debtors knowledge of the result of the dna parentage test indicating that the probability of wilbur being her father was.following a bench trial on january,the ingham county court entered judgment in favor of creditors and against debtors in the total amount of.the court found no cause of action against wilbur.
meanwhile,on june,kentucky farm bureau mutual insurance company kfb filed a declaratory judgment action against debtors in jefferson county circuit court in kentucky.debtors were insured under a homeowner policy issued by kfb at the time of the defamation suit in michigan,and kfb filed suit seeking a declaration that the claims arising out of the michigan lawsuit did not come within the scope of debtors insurance coverage.the kentucky circuit court granted summary judgment to kfb,finding that because the defamatory statements were inherently injurious,the claims in michigan were outside debtors insurance policy.
as a result of the proceedings in the michigan and kentucky state courts,debtors claim that they were forced into filing chapter bankruptcy.debtors attempted to discharge the michigan judgment lodged against them as well as other debts.however,creditors filed an adversary proceeding,claiming that their judgment obtained against debtors in michigan was nondischargeable inasmuch as the debt was the result of willful and malicious injury by the debtor to another entity or to the property of another entity under a.
on october,the bankruptcy court entered a memorandum opinion granting summary judgment to creditors in the adversary proceeding,finding the debt to creditors nondischargeable based upon the previous decisions in the michigan and kentucky state courts.specifically,the bankruptcy court opined as follows 
in summation,this court finds that the facts necessary to support a determination of nondischargeability under a of the plaintiffs defamation claim are clearly established by the prior kentucky and michigan judgments.first,the michigan judgment establishes that the statements at issue were in fact made,while the kentucky judgment establishes that they were defamatory in character and intentional in nature.second,the kentucky judgment establishes that the statements were inherently injurious,giving rise to an inference of an expectation of harm and intent to injure.lastly,the michigan judgment expressly established that the statements were made without just cause or excuse.
consequently,the plaintiffs are entitled to judgment as a matter of law pursuant to a with regard to the nondischargeability of their defamation claim.
at footnote omitted.the october,order expressly states that it is not a final order.
thereafter,on october,creditors filed a motion to voluntarily dismiss those portions of the complaint upon which the district court did not grant summary judgment,and to make the court judgment final.the bankruptcy court entered an order on november,sustaining the creditors motion the order provides as follows 
it is further ordered and adjudged that for the reasons stated in the court opinion and order of october,the debt created by the judgment rendered by the circuit court for the county of ingham,state of michigan,of and concerning the plaintiffs defamation claims against the defendants is hereby declared to be in the full amount of pursuant to a.
this is a final and appealable judgment there being no just reason for delay.

on december,debtors filed a motion for reconsideration of the court november order,which the bankruptcy court denied in a memorandum opinion and order entered on january,debtors thereafter appealed the bankruptcy court decision to the united states district court for the western district of kentucky.in a memorandum opinion and order dated september,the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court decision,finding creditors judgment against debtors nondischargeable under kawaauhau geiger,d.thereafter,the district court issued its corresponding judgment affirming the bankruptcy court order,and it is from this judgment that debtors now appeal 
discussion 
when this court considers an appeal taken from the district court final order in a bankruptcy case,the court independently reviews the bankruptcy court decision.see koenig sporting goods,morse.in re koenig sporting goods,cir.in doing so,the court reviews the bankruptcy court findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.see millers cove energy,moore in re millers cove energy,cir.this court reviews the grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo as a matter of law.see markowitz campbell in re markowitz,cir.
test for determining dischargeability under section a 
section a of the bankruptcy code provides for an exception to the dischargeability of certain debts.specifically,a provides for purposes of this action as follows 
a a discharge under section,a,b of this title does not discharge an individual debtor from any debt 
for willful and malicious injury by the debtor to another entity or to the property of another entity.
a.in perkins scharffe,cir,this court held that willful and malicious injury as used within a could be found when an actor intends the act committed regardless of whether he intends the consequences thereof.however,in kawaauhau geiger,d,the supreme court addressed the pivotal question of whether a s compass cover s acts,done intentionally,that cause injury or only acts done with the actual intent to cause injury.in answering this inquiry,the supreme court held that only acts done with the intent to cause not merely acts done to the level of willful and malicious injury for purposes of satisfying a.see id.the court reasoned as follows 
the word willful in a modifies the word injury,indicating that nondischargeability takes a deliberate or intentional injury,not merely a deliberate or intentional act that leads to injury.had congress meant to exempt debts resulting from unintentionally inflicted injuries,it might have described instead willful acts that cause injury.or,congress might have selected an additional word or words,reckless or negligent,to modify injury.moreover,as the eighth circuit observed,the a formulation triggers in the lawyer mind the category intentional torts,as distinguished from negligent or reckless torts.intentional torts generally require that the actor intend the consequences of an act,not simply the act itself.restatement second of torts,comment a,emphasis added.
a little more than a year after the supreme court decision in geiger,this court had occasion to revisit the meaning of willful and malicious injury in light of the supreme court pronouncement,and held that the perkins standard for willful and malicious injury was effectively overruled by the supreme court in geiger and we now expressly overrule that standard.see markowitz campbell in re markowitz,cir.
