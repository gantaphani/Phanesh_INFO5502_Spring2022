this appeal presents an issue of first impression for our court to what extent,if any,do theodore labuzan,and his wife,deeann labuzan,creditors of the bankruptcy debtor,have standing to claim damages based on violations of the bankruptcy provision,k a n individual injured by any willful violation of a stay shall recover actual damages,including costs and attorneys fees,and,in appropriate circumstances,may recover punitive damages.the labuzans challenge the district court ruling they lack standing to pursue a claim under k.vacated and remanded.
the labuzans owned percent of the limited,and percent of the general,partnership interest in contractor technology,ctl,a construction company.paul fire marine insurance company provided payment and performance bonds for several of ctl projects.in turn,the labuzans had a personal indemnity agreement with paul in the event it had to pay claims under those bonds.
on may,with several projects ongoing,ctl filed a voluntary petition for chapter bankruptcy reorganization.approximately one week later,in claimed violation of the k provision,paul contacted the owners of those ongoing projects and advised them ctl was in bankruptcy and,if a project owner made payment to ctl and paul was later required to pay under the ctl bonds,paul would reduce its liability to the project owner by any amount paid ctl by that owner.
because of alleged resulting reduced revenues,ctl was unable to meet its financial obligations.its chapter reorganization was converted into a chapter liquidation proceeding in june.
paul paid over million on its ctl bonds.along that line,in november,paul sued the labuzans in district court for breach of their indemnity agreement with paul.
in response,the labuzans,inter alia,raised as an affirmative defense paul claimed violation of the k provision.the labuzans claimed such violation prevented ctl from reorganizing successfully and,therefore,caused paul having to pay on its ctl bonds.the labuzans claimed the following damages for loss of value suffered by ctl for judgments against theodore labuzan,and for other possible judgments that might be entered against him for irs liens against ctl for attorney fees and for loss of theodore labuzan earning capacity.
in january,paul moved for summary judgment on its indemnity claims.on the other hand,that january and february,respectively,the labuzans and ctl bankruptcy trustee the trustee filed adversary proceedings against paul in bankruptcy court,seeking compensatory and punitive damages based on paul claimed violation of k provision.
that may,paul action against the labuzans in district court,and the labuzans adversary proceeding against paul in bankruptcy court,were consolidated by the district court.that june,the district court granted in part and denied in part paul motion.the court ruled paul proved its,but the labuzans retained their k defense because material issues of fact existed concerning whether any portion of paul ctl bond losses was caused by paul own unlawful conduct.the district court granted paul motion regarding a number of the labuzans affirmative defenses,including failure to mitigate,assumption of risk,estoppel,discharge,and tortious interference with contractual relations.
that august,paul and the trustee entered into a global resolution of competing claims in ctl chapter bankruptcy.pursuant to the settlement agreement,and in exchange for paul reducing or waiving its claims against the bankruptcy estate,paul received from it.the trustee also permitted paul to retain certain funds in an amount over million.
the bankruptcy court approved the settlement agreement in november.in its order approving the settlement,the bankruptcy court allowed,inter alia,the labuzans unsecured claim in the amount of against the estate.
earlier,in september,paul raised in district court whether the labuzans have standing to pursue a claim under k based on paul claimed violation of the automatic stay created by ctl bankruptcy.in january,the district court ruled the labuzans lack standing to assert the k claim,based on its ruling that ctl,not the labuzans,owned that claim against paul.the district court reasoned 
assuming that a violation occurred,the labuzans would be required to show that the claim actually belonged to them as indemnitors.and they would have to show that as indemnitors they are the proper parties to bring this suit.
now,what the evidence shows is that the labuzans,while they were owners of ctl,first,they were not creditors of ctl.there were no claims,i believe,made by them against the estate,as i understand it.additionally,ctl was a separate entity or is a separate entity from the labuzans and,therefore,the labuzans are not and were not the primary owners of any claim that belonged to ctl.particularly,they were not the owners of the claim that there was a stay violation.
the record shows that ctl resolved its claims against paul and dismissed its adversary proceeding against paul and in that regard,the court is of the opinion that the labuzans are barred from bringing a claim on behalf of ctl,because that would be the way in which it would have to be brought.they have no right to bring a separate and independent claim because the claim does not belong to them.
transcript of hearing at,paul fire marine ins.labuzan,no,wl.the district court stated that,on behalf of a debtor,creditors could seek equitable remedies for k violations,but they could not recover damages.
because the district court ruling precluded the labuzans from asserting a k claim against paul,the labuzans abandoned their only affirmative defense paul claimed violation.accordingly,the labuzans allowed the district court to enter judgment for paul in march for,inter alia,approximately million.the labuzans motion for reconsideration was denied.

the provision states,inter alia 
a petition filed under this title operates as a stay,applicable to all entities,of 
the commencement or continuation of a judicial,administrative,or other action or proceeding against the debtor that was or could have been commenced before the commencement of the case,or to recover a claim against the debtor that arose before the commencement of the case under this title 
any act to obtain possession of property of the estate or of property from the estate or to exercise control over property of the estate 
any act to create,perfect,or enforce any lien against property of the estate 
any act to collect,assess,or recover a claim against the debtor that arose before the commencement of the case under this title and 
the setoff of any debt owing to the debtor that arose before the commencement of the case under this title against any claim against the debtor 
a.section k formerly h provides in part 
a n individual injured by any willful violation of a stay provided by this section shall recover actual damages,including costs and attorneys fees,and,in appropriate circumstances,may recover punitive damages.
k emphasis added.
our court has held that k creates a private remedy for violations.pettitt baker,cir we conclude that k creates a private remedy for one injured by a willful violation of an automatic stay.pettitt was decided,however,in the context of a claim by a debtor.id.at.in this instance,ctl,not the labuzans,is the debtor.along that line,dicta in in re pointer,cir,provided i t seems illogical to conclude that congress intended to limit k to debtors when one of the principal purposes behind the automatic stay is to protect creditors from unequal treatment.id.holding that creditors do not have standing to invoke avoidance powers under.
accordingly,at issue is whether,pursuant to k,individuals other than the debtor,who claim injury from an violation,have standing to pursue a claim for resulting damages.although k was added to the bankruptcy code in,this issue has not been addressed by many circuits,and it is one of first impression for our court.
to establish standing pursuant to k,the labuzans are required to meet both constitutional and prudential requirements.procter gamble amway,cir.for the reasons that follow,they satisfy the requirements for each.
to meet the article iii constitutional standing requirement,a plaintiff must show an injury in fact that is fairly traceable to the actions of the defendant and that likely will be redressed by a favorable decision.id.this constitutional requirement is easily satisfied by the labuzans.their alleged injuries sustained as a result of ctl failure to reorganize under chapter can fairly be traced to paul claimed violation of the automatic stay by contacting the project owners and instructing them about the consequences of payments to ctl.further,at least some of the labuzans injuries are likely to be redressed by a favorable decision.
prudential standing requirements exist in addition to the immutable requirements of article iii as an integral part of judicial.id.quoting acorn fowler,cir.these judicially created limits concern whether a plaintiff grievance arguably falls within the zone of interests protected by the statutory provision invoked in the suit,whether the complaint raises abstract questions or a generalized grievance more properly addressed by the legislative branch,and whether the plaintiff is asserting his or her own legal rights and interests rather than the legal rights and interests of third parties.id.citing acorn,at.
the labuzans claim standing because k expressly gives standing to an individual injured by paul claimed violation.further,they contend they satisfy the prudential requirements because as creditors and equity holders of ctl,their interests fall within the zone of interests protected by k their injury,sustained as a result of the conversion to chapter,was neither abstract nor generalized and they have shown that their injury is separate and distinct from that sustained by ctl.
paul maintains the labuzans lack standing because they do not own the claims they seek to pursue rather,those claims belong to ctl bankruptcy estate.paul asserts each item of damages claimed by the labuzans derives from harm to ctl,with ctl being the primary obligor,and the labuzans being secondary obligors,and only indirectly results in harm to the labuzans.finally,paul raises res judicata,based on the trustee adversary proceeding against paul for the very same debt the labuzans seek to bring here,and the subsequent settlement reached by the trustee and paul and approved by the bankruptcy court.
congress can modify or even abrogate prudential standing requirements,thus extending standing to the full extent permitted by article iii.procter gamble,at.we therefore look to the statute in question to determine whether congress expressed an intent to negate the background of prudential standing doctrine.id.footnote call and internal citations omitted.
again,k provides 
a n individual injured by any willful violation of a stay provided by this section shall recover actual damages,including costs and attorneys fees,and,in appropriate circumstances,may recover punitive damages.
k emphasis added.
the term individual is not defined by the bankruptcy code,but it is used throughout the code to refer to debtors and.see homer bank namie,citing,inter alia,b individual as debtor,a individual as trustee,and a a i individual as director,officer,or voting trustee of the debtor.when referring to k,collier uses the terms debtor and individual interchangeably.see collier on bankruptcy ed.
congress using the term individual in k might lead one to conclude that congress intended to abrogate the background of prudential standing for purposes of k and allow anyone to sue who could achieve article iii standing.procter gamble,at.as discussed,however,individual is not defined in the bankruptcy code.if congress intended to abrogate the prudential standing requirement by enacting k,that intent is not expressed clearly.therefore,we have to ascertain congress intent by examining the code legislative history.see id.at.that history for states in part 
the automatic stay is one of the fundamental debtor protections provided by the bankruptcy laws.it gives the debtor a breathing spell from his creditors.it stops all collection efforts,all harassment,and all foreclosure actions.it permits the debtor to attempt a repayment or reorganization plan,or simply to be relieved of the financial pressures that drove him into bankruptcy.

undoubtedly,based on the language,the term individual includes debtors,and our court has so held.see pettitt,at.the inquiry,however,does not end here.the relevant part of the legislative history states 
the automatic stay also provides creditor protection.without it,certain creditors would be able to pursue their own remedies against the debtor property.those who acted first would obtain payment of the claims in preference to and to the detriment of other creditors.bankruptcy is designed to provide an orderly liquidation procedure under which all creditors are treated equally.a race of diligence by creditors for the debtor assets prevents that.
cong.sess,cong d sess,cong,capitalization altered see also hunt bankers trust,cir the purpose of the automatic stay is to protect creditors in a manner consistent with the bankruptcy goal of equal treatment.namie,at same united states miller,wl,at.unpublished noting that creditors are clearly intended to benefit from.
although,as noted,the authorities on the scope of the term individual as used in the bankruptcy code are scant,decisions interpreting in general,and k in particular,are nevertheless instructive.
in re fuel oil supply terminaling,involved a corporation interpleaded by an insurance company in litigation,in violation of the automatic stay.after the debtor removed the matter to bankruptcy court,other parties to the litigation moved for remand,claiming void both the interpleader in violation of the stay and the subsequent removal.id.at.the bankruptcy court stated the automatic stay is for the benefit of the debtor and if it chooses to ignore stay violations other parties can not use such violations to their advantage.id.the action was remanded,however,based on equitable grounds mainly because the bankruptcy court determined that the parties litigating their claims in state court would not interfere with the debtor reorganization efforts.id.at.fuel oil,decided in the context of the removal statute,c,did not hold that lack standing to challenge violations.further,the decision was rendered before k was enacted,and,as such,is inapplicable to whether individual in k includes.
in this regard,a more recent decision is on point.in the namie,the court held that a corporate creditor had standing to assert an violation by another creditor.id.at.in namie,owners of a mobile home leased to the debtor seized it after the debtor became delinquent on lease payments.id.at.they also sued the debtor in state court.id.the debtor filed for chapter bankruptcy a few weeks later.id.although the owners received notice of the debtor bankruptcy filing,they obtained in state court a default judgment against the debtor several weeks later,and then sold the mobile home at a sheriff sale.id.at.
the bankruptcy trustee,with the bankruptcy court approval,subsequently sold the mobile home to a bank.id.at.after the bank was unable to take possession of the mobile home due to the previous sheriff sale,it filed an adversary proceeding against the subsequent owners of the mobile home.id.in defense,the owners claimed that k remedies were not available to creditors.id.at.the district court disagreed and held that the bank,as an individual under k,had standing to pursue a damages claim against the owners.id.at.the court reasoned,inter alia 
if congress intended to limit the remedies in k to debtors it could have done so by the simple expedient of replacing the term individual with debtor.congress chose not to do so,and this court is unwilling to impose limitations not supported by the statutory language,jurisprudence,or legislative history.m
