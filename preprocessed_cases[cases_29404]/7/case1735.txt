the issue presented in this interlocutory appeal is the extent to which a reorganization plan proposed under a preempts otherwise applicable nonbankruptcy law.section a was enacted as part of the bankruptcy code in.that section specifies what must be included in a reorganization plan under chapter and closely parallels of the predecessor bankruptcy act.section a provides,in part,n otwithstanding any otherwise applicable nonbankruptcy law a reorganization plan shall provide adequate means for the plan implementation.when a was originally enacted in,it did not contain the clause notwithstanding any otherwise applicable nonbankruptcy law,just as of the bankruptcy act contained no such clause.the notwithstanding clause was added to a by amendment in.
section a was also enacted as part of the bankruptcy code in.that section prescribes duties associated with the implementation of an approved reorganization plan under chapter and closely parallels of the predecessor bankruptcy act.section a provides,n otwithstanding any otherwise applicable nonbankruptcy law,rule,or regulation relating to financial condition,the debtor and any entity organized or to be organized for the purpose of carrying out the plan shall carry out the reorganization plan and shall comply with any orders of the court.the only relevant difference between a and its predecessor is that the clause notwithstanding any otherwise applicable law,rule,or regulation relating to financial condition was added in.
we hold that a reorganization plan proposed under a expressly preempts otherwise applicable laws only to the extent that such laws were already preempted before the addition of the notwithstanding clause to a by amendment in.that is,we hold that the addition of the notwithstanding clause to a was merely a clarification and confirmation of the preemptive effect of a reorganization plan that already existed under the bankruptcy code.that preemptive effect,expressly stated in the notwithstanding clause of a,was limited to otherwise applicable nonbankruptcy laws relating to financial condition.
we reverse the decision of the district court and remand for further proceedings.
background 
appellee pacific gas electric company pg e is a large,public utility in california,currently subject to regulation by various federal,state,and local entities.pg e owns and operates electric generation facilities,electric and gas transmission facilities,and retail distribution facilities.on april,pg e filed a voluntary petition under chapter of the bankruptcy code.on december,pg e and its corporate parent pg e corporation proponents filed a first amended reorganization plan plan accompanied by a first amended disclosure statement.the plan has since been amended,but the amendments do not affect our legal analysis.
among other things,the plan contains a proposal for the disaggregation of pg e into four new corporations,each of which would be owned by pg e parent corporation.the four proposed corporations are electric generation llc gen,which would own pg e generation assets etrans llc etrans,which would own pg e electric transmission assets gtrans llc gtrans,which would own pg e gas transmission assets and reorganized pg e,which would engage in retail distribution of electricity and gas.pursuant to the plan,reorganized pg e would remain subject to regulation by the california public utility commission cpuc after the proposed disaggregation.however,gen,etrans,and gtrans would not.rather,they would be subject to the exclusive regulatory jurisdiction of the federal energy regulatory commission.if pg e is not disaggregated,all of pg e would remain subject to regulation by the cpuc.
the disclosure statement filed in conjunction with the plan makes clear the extremely broad preemptive effect pg e attributes to the notwithstanding clause of a.section a provides,in part,n otwithstanding any otherwise applicable nonbankruptcy law,a reorganization plan shall provide adequate means for the plan implementation.in accordance with proponents reading of a,the disclosure statement statement describes the means proposed for implementing the plan,and states that the plan preempts various state and local laws 
section a of the bankruptcy code preempts any otherwise applicable law that may be contrary to its provisions.accordingly,a plan may contain certain provisions that would not normally be permitted under law.for example,section a of the bankruptcy code authorizes,among other things,the sale or transfer of assets by the debtor without the consent of the state or the california public utilities commission the cpuc.
s ection a of the bankruptcy code preempts state regulation from interfering with the implementation and consummation of the plan.accordingly,the proponents contend that the confirmation order approving the plan and authorizing the transactions pursuant to the plan will preempt otherwise applicable nonbankruptcy law in the following areas any approval or authorization of the cpuc or compliance with the california public utilities code or cpuc rules,regulations or decisions otherwise required to transfer public utility property including authorization to construct facilities,issue securities and implement the plan and the exercise of discretion by any other state or local agency or subdivision to deny the transfer or assignment of any of the debtor property,including existing permits or licenses,or the issuance of identical permits and licenses on the same terms and conditions as the debtor existing permits and licenses where both the reorganized debtor and one or more of etrans,gtrans and gen require such permit for their post effective date operations.such preemption pursuant to section a of the bankruptcy code shall occur at the time the plan is implemented.
the statement lists a number of specific sections of the california public utility code and decisions by the cpuc that proponents contend are preempted by the plan pursuant to the notwithstanding clause of a,but the list is not exhaustive.the statement provides,t he confirmation order will supersede any law,regulation or rule that might otherwise apply to the restructuring transactions and the implementation of the plan,whether specified here or not.the statutes,rules,orders or decisions thus preempted include,but are not limited to,the following listing specific statutory sections and cpuc decisions.
the statement also provides that otherwise applicable permitting and licensing requirements are preempted pursuant to a.although proponents insist in their brief that the plan does not seek to supercede or preempt federal law at all,the statement mentions federal as well as state and local permits and licenses.the statement provides 
the transfer or reissuance of the vast majority of permits and licenses issued by most state agencies and political subdivisions and federal agencies appears to be ministerial or governed by objective criteria that make it unlikely that the agencies could act or fail to act in a way that would interfere with consummation of the plan.as mentioned above,the proponents intend to follow the established procedures for the transfer or reissuance of such permits and licences.for these permits or licenses for which otherwise applicable nonbankruptcy law precludes transfer or gives state or local officials discretion to deny the transfer or reissuance,the proponents will rely on the protection of section a to ensure that all of the reorganized companies obtain the permits and licenses they need to operate lawfully.
appellants,the cpuc,the state of california,the city and county of san francisco,and the california hydropower reform coalition collectively the california parties object to the plan.the california parties contend that the plan conflicts with a number of state laws and that these laws are not preempted by a.most important,the california parties contend that the disaggregation contemplated by the plan would violate of the california public utilities code.section was passed by the california legislature in the wake of the energy crisis that plagued the state in the summer of.it provides that no facility for the generation of electricity owned by a public utility may be disposed of prior to january.cal.pub.the california parties also contend that the plan is subject to and potentially conflicts with other state laws.for example,they contend that some of the transactions contemplated by the plan must be subjected to environmental review under the california environmental quality act.
appearing as an amicus,the united states also objects to the plan.despite proponents assertion that they do not intend to use the plan to displace any federal law,the united states contends that the plan could,during its implementation,allow one or more of the four proposed corporations to do so.for example,the united states contends that federal statutes such as the clean air act and the clean water act could be preempted by the plan pursuant to proponents construction of a.it also contends that the otherwise applicable requirement of a federal nuclear regulatory commission license could be preempted by the plan.outside of bankruptcy,such a license would be required before pg e could transfer ownership of the diablo canyon nuclear power plant to another entity,such as the newly created egen.
the bankruptcy court rejected what it characterized as proponents,preemption strategy.it held that there is no express preemption of law that permits a wholesale unconditional of numerous state laws,some of which are identified in the disclosure statement and some of which are obscured by the phrase including but not limited to.the bankruptcy court concluded that some nonbankruptcy laws may be impliedly preempted by the plan under a,but reserved any ruling on implied preemption until proponents produced a plan that did not depend on the broad express preemption contemplated in the first amended reorganization plan.
on interlocutory appeal on the issue of express preemption,the district court reversed.it held that a expressly preempted nonbankruptcy laws.relying on in re public service of new hampshire new hampshire in re public service,the district court held that all nonbankruptcy laws otherwise applicable to the restructuring transactions necessary to an effective and feasible reorganization are expressly preempted.
because we are in as good a position as the district court to review the findings of the bankruptcy court,we independently review the bankruptcy court decision.ragsdale haller,cir.we review the bankruptcy court conclusion of law de novo.id.
we agree with the district court that a reorganization plan under chapter of the bankruptcy code expressly preempts otherwise applicable nonbankruptcy laws.however,we disagree with the district court as to the scope of that express preemption.we hold that the preemptive scope of a reorganization plan is stated in a.that section provides that a plan shall be implemented notwithstanding any otherwise applicable nonbankruptcy law,rule,or regulation relating to financial condition.that is,under a,nonbankruptcy law is expressly preempted by a reorganization plan only to the extent that such law relat es to financial condition.
neither the bankruptcy court nor the district court applied the standard of express preemption contained in a.we therefore reverse the decision of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
ii.section a,section a,and the notwithstanding clauses 
section a has deep roots.in its original form,a was b of the bankruptcy act of,added by amendment in.section b provided,in part 
a plan of reorganization shall provide adequate means for the execution of the plan,which may include the transfer of all or any part of the property of the debtor to another corporation or to other corporations,or the consolidation of the properties of the debtor with those of another corporation or corporations,or the retention of the property by the debtor,the distribution of assets among creditors or any class thereof,the satisfaction or modification of liens,indentures,or other similar instruments 
bankruptcy act of amendments,stat,emphasis added.four years later,b was recodified as and slightly modified to read,in part 
a plan of reorganization shall provide adequate means for the execution of the plan,which may include the retention by the debtor of all or any part of its property the sale or transfer of all or any part of its property to one or more other corporations theretofore organized or thereafter to be organized the merger or consolidation of the debtor with one or more other corporations the sale of all or any part of its property,either subject to or free from any lien,at not less than a fair upset price and the distribution of all or any assets,or the proceeds derived from the sale thereof,among those having an interest therein the satisfaction or modification of liens the cancelation or modification of indentures or of other similar instruments 
bankruptcy act of amendments,stat,emphasis added.
section a is the direct successor to b and.it was originally enacted as part of the bankruptcy reform act of now commonly referred to as the bankruptcy code.in its original form,as enacted in,a provided,in part 
a a plan shall 
provide adequate means for the plan execution,such as 
a retention by the debtor of all or any part of the property of the estate 
b transfer of all or any part of the property of the estate to one or more entities,whether organized before or after the confirmation of such plan 
c merger or consolidation of the debtor,with one or more persons 
d sale of all or any part of the property of the estate,either subject to or free of any lien,or the distribution of all or any part of the property of the estate among those having an interest in such property of the estate 
e satisfaction or modification of any lien 
f cancellation or modification of any indenture or similar instrument 
an act to establish a uniform law on the subject of bankruptcies,a,stat,emphasis added.
the emphases are added to all three statutes to highlight subsections a b and d and their predecessor subsections.proponents particularly rely on subsections a b and d to support their argument for the preemptive effect of their plan.these subsections have been largely unchanged since the addition of b to the bankruptcy act by amendment in.
less than a year after the effective date of the bankruptcy code,the house judiciary committee reported favorably on,a bill that would have made minor amendments to the code,including to a.the relevant provisions of were later incorporated into and passed by the senate but not the cong,cong.in the words of the committee report,was designed to correct technical errors,clarify and make minor substantive changes to the code.staff of house comm.on the judiciary,an act to correct technical errors,clarify and make minor substantive changes to public law,at.the report summarized as follows the problems was designed to address 
the bankruptcy reform act of has now been in effect less than one year.it is clear even at this early time in the life of this law that technical amendments are required.errors in printing,spelling,punctuation,grammar,syntax,and numeration arose in the bill as enacted because of the process of change through which the bill went when considered at the closing sessions of the congress.
these same changes also resulted in the enactment of a bill that contains incongruent provisions material that was removed from earlier versions remained as either or antecedents for provisions changed or inserted.and,material added often was not completely integrated into the total fabric of the bill as enacted.
such matters constitute the vast majority of the subject of the technical amendments act.in addition,however,there are several items of a substantial nature which are included because it was intended that the particular subject was to be dealt with at the earliest possible time after the enactment of the bankruptcy reform act in connection with whatever technical amendments would be considered further conforming changes were found to be necessary to complete the legislative work intended by the bankruptcy reform act the treatment of a subject in the bankruptcy reform act was found to be incomplete or there was overlooked some minor yet relevant matter.in each case the change proposed is consistent with policies adopted by congress in its enactment of the bankruptcy reform act.
id.at emphasis added.
among the amendments contained in were the following proposed changes to a and a.first,the phrase a plan shall of a would have been amended to read notwithstanding any otherwise applicable nonbankruptcy law,a plan shall.second,the word execution of a would have been replaced by implementation.senate bill also would have made several other minor word changes to,at.the committee report described the proposed changes to as follows 
this amendment makes it clear that the rules governing what is to be contained in the reorganization plan are those specified in this section deletes a redundant word and makes several stylistic changes.
id.at was never passed by the senate.
in,the same proposed amendments to a were passed by the senate as part of,cong.when was reported out by the senate judiciary committee,the committee report stated that the amendments make technical stylistic changes,at.on the floor of the senate,was combined with,a bill containing other proposed amendments to the bankruptcy code.cong.rec.the amendments to from became subtitle i of,entitled technical amendments to title.cong.rec.senator dole,on the senate floor,described this newly added subtitle as containing provisions designed to correct grammatical,punctuation,and spelling errors in the code,clarify the intent of the drafters in certain sections,and generally refine procedures.cong.rec.was passed by the senate,but not by the house.
the proposed amendments to that had been contained in in,in in,and in and in,were finally passed by both houses in.no committee reports were prepared,and the amendments were not mentioned on the floors of the two houses.the amendments to eventually became law in,and were contained in the conference bill in a subtitle headed miscellaneous amendments to title.bankruptcy amendments and federal judgeship act of,stat,cong.rec.
as a result of the amendments,a now provides,in the subsections upon which proponents particularly rely 
a notwithstanding any otherwise applicable law,a plan shall 
provide adequate means for the plan implementation,such as 
b transfer of all or any part of the property of the estate to one or more entities,whether organized before or after the confirmation of such plan 
d sale of all or any part of the property of the estate,
emphasis added.the italics indicate words added or changed by the amendment.
section a has equally deep roots.the early predecessor to a was h,added to the bankruptcy act of by amendment in.that section provided,in relevant part 
upon final confirmation of the plan,the debtor and other corporation or corporations organized or to be organized for the purpose of carrying out the plan,shall have full power and authority to,and shall put into effect and carry out the plan and the orders of the judge relative thereto,under and subject to the supervision and control of the judge.
bankruptcy act of amendments,stat.
four years later,h was recodified as,which provided 
upon confirmation of a plan the debtor and every other corporation organized or to be organized for the purpose of carrying out the plan shall comply with the provisions of the plan and with all orders of the court relative thereto and shall take all action necessary to carry out the plan,including,in the case of a corporation,the procuring of authorization,approval,or consent of each commission having regulatory jurisdiction over the debtor or such other corporation.
bankruptcy act of amendments,stat,emphasis added.
section a is the direct successor to h and.like a,it was originally enacted as part of the bankruptcy code.the heading for the whole of was execution of plan.section a provides,in its entirety 
notwithstanding any otherwise applicable nonbankruptcy law,rule,or regulation relating to financial condition,the debtor and any entity organized or to be organized for the purpose of carrying out the plan shall carry out the plan and shall comply with any orders of the court.
emphasis added.the italicized clause in,requiring,in the case of a,the procuring of authorization,approval,or consent of regulatory commissions,was eliminated in.the italicized clause in a the notwithstanding added.
there is little legislative history that provides background for the addition of the notwithstanding clause in a.section a is mentioned in neither the house nor the senate committee reports.see.the only mention is by senator deconcini,in his capacity as the chair of the subcommittee on improvements in judicial machinery of the senate judiciary committee.senator deconcini mentioned a and a together,as part of a lengthy statement on the senate floor,covering pages of the congressional record.the totality of what he said concerning either a or a is as follows 
section of the house amendment represents a compromise between similar provisions in the house bill and senate amendment.the section has been clarified to clearly indicate that both secured and unsecured claims,or either of them,may be impaired in a case under title.moreover,section a has been substantively modified to permit classification of certain kinds of priority claims.this is important for purposes of confirmation under section a.
section a of the house amendment is derived from a similar provision in the house bill and senate amendment but deletes the language pertaining to fair upset price as an unnecessary restriction.section is also intended to indicate that a plan may provide for any action specified in section in the case of a corporation without a resolution of the board of directors.if the plan is confirmed,then any action proposed in the plan may be taken notwithstanding any otherwise applicable nonbankruptcy law in accordance with section a of title.
section a was not substantially changed by the amendments to the bankruptcy code enacted in.the amendment eliminated a comma that had followed the phrase carry out the plan.it also changed the heading for from execution of the plan to implementation of the plan.bankruptcy amendments and federal judgeship act of,stat.this change matched the amendment of a,which changed adequate means for the plan execution to adequate means for the plan implementation.
proponents reading of section a as independent from section a 
proponents ask us to hold that provisions of pg e reorganization plan drafted pursuant a in particular,subsections a b and a d broadly preempt otherwise applicable nonbankruptcy laws with which the plan conflicts.they ask us,in order to reach that holding,to read the notwithstanding clause of a independently from,and more broadly than,the notwithstanding clause of a.for the reasons that follow,we do not agree that these two clauses can be read independently.rather,we hold that the clauses must be read together,and that the express preemption of a is limited to otherwise applicable nonbankruptcy laws relating to financial condition,as specified in a.
proponents also ask that we hold provisions of the plan broadly preempt conflicting california law because,they argue,congress intended preemption specifically with respect to reorganization plans of public utilities.they urge that we find evidence for this intention in the failure to reenact as part of a,the language of its predecessor requiring the approval of relevant regulatory commissions when a public utility files for bankruptcy.the elimination of this language in enacting a,however,can not be construed as evidence of a broad congressional intent to preempt the state regulatory laws,even with respect to public utilities.section a,unlike its predecessor,does not refer to public utilities in any way.a special requirement that once existed for public utilities is gone.section a,in its current form,simply does not distinguish between public utilities and other debtors.
iii.relevant principles of statutory construction 
the centerpiece of any preemption analysis is congressional purpose.the purpose of congress is the ultimate touchstone.retail clerks int l ass schermerhorn,d.after quoting this comment from schermerhorn,the supreme court recently wrote,a s a result,any understanding of the scope of a statute must rest primarily on a fair understanding of congressional purpose.medtronic,lohr,d citation omitted italics in original.to determine congressional purpose,we look to the statute language,structure,subject matter,context,and that typically help courts determine a statute objectives and thereby illuminate its text.united states,d see also medtronic,at.congress intent,of course,primarily is discerned from the language of the statute and the statutory framework surrounding it.also relevant,however,is the structure and purpose of the statute as a whole.internal citations omitted.
two presumptions assist us in determining congressional purpose in this case.the first is a general presumption,applicable in all preemption cases.the second is a presumption specific to cases decided under the bankruptcy code.
first,we presume that congress does not undertake lightly to preempt state law,particularly in areas of traditional state regulation.
b ecause the states are independent sovereigns in our federal system,we have long presumed that congress does not cavalierly causes of action.in all cases,and particularly in those in which congress has legislated in a field which the states have traditionally occupied,we start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the states were not to be superceded by the federal act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of congress.
medtronic,at.internal citation omitted.as the court stated in cipollone liggett group,d,in refusing to find state tort damage actions preempted by a federal cigarette labeling and advertising requirement,we must construe these provisions of federal law in light of the presumption against the of state police power regulations.
even though bankruptcy is one of only two federal legislative powers in article i,section of the constitution in which the power to make uniform laws is made explicit,the presumption against displacing state law by federal bankruptcy law is just as strong in bankruptcy as in other areas of federal legislative power.in midlantic national bank new jersey department of environmental protection,d,the question addressed was whether bankruptcy law displaced state environmental law.the court emphasized that if congress wished to grant an exemption from otherwise applicable nonbankruptcy state law,the intention would be clearly expressed.id.at.citation omitted.similarly,in bfp resolution trust,d,the court refused to construe bankruptcy law so as to interfere with the operation of a foreclosure sale conducted under state law.to displace traditional state regulation in such a manner,the federal statutory purpose must be clear and manifest.id.at.citation omitted.
second,we presume,absent clear indications to the contrary,that congress did not intend to change preexisting bankruptcy law or practice in adopting the bankruptcy code in or in amending it in.the supreme court,in a remarkably consistent series of cases,has explicitly and repeatedly relied on this presumption.the first case is a bankruptcy preemption case the others are straight bankruptcy cases.
in midlantic,the question addressed was whether,under a,a bankruptcy trustee could abandon burdensome real property and thereby entirely preempt as required environmental to that property.section a was enacted as part of the code and was amended slightly in.prior to the adoption of a,a trustee could not entirely escape obligations by abandoning property.however,a explicitly authorized abandonment by the trustee and did not mention any limitation on abandonment.the court rejected an argument by the trustee that a evidenced a congressional purpose to depart from prior bankruptcy practice and entirely to preempt state environmental law obligations 
if congress wishes to grant the trustee an extraordinary exemption from nonbankruptcy law,the intention would be clearly expressed,not left to be collected or inferred from disputable considerations of convenience in administering the estate of the bankrupt.
neither the court nor congress has granted a trustee in bankruptcy powers that would lend support to a right to abandon property in contravention of state or local laws designed to protect public health or safety.
at.citation omitted.
in kelly robinson,d,the question addressed was whether a,also enacted as part of the code,excepted from discharge a restitution order in a state criminal case in a chapter bankruptcy.under law,there was no such exception,despite statutory language arguably to the contrary.congress enacted the code in against the background of an established judicial exception to discharge for criminal sentences,including restitution orders.id.at.as an aid to construction,the court quoted from midlantic 
the normal rule of statutory construction is that if congress intends for legislation to change the interpretation of a judicially created concept,it makes that intent specific.the court has followed this rule with particular care in construing the scope of bankruptcy codifications.
id.at.quoting midlantic,at.emphasis added.relying in part on the absence of any significant evidence that congress intended to change the law,id.at,the court declined to interpret a as a departure from pre code law 
in light of the strong interests of the states,the uniform construction of the old act over of a century,and the absence of any significant evidence that congress intended to change the law in his area,we believe this result best effectuates the will of congress.
in united savings ass of texas timbers of inwood forest associates,d,the question addressed was whether another provision enacted as part of the code,d,allowed compensation to undersecured creditors for delays in foreclosing on their collateral that resulted from the operation of the automatic stay.under law,such compensation was not available.as part of its analysis,the court relied on the lack of any specific provision in the statute and any indication in the legislative history that congress intended to depart from the prior law 
such a major change in the existing rules would not likely have been made without specific provision in the text of the statute it is most improbable that it would have been made without even any mention in the legislative history.
id.at.internal citation omitted.
in dewsnup timm,d,the question addressed was whether d,enacted as part of the code,allowed a debtor to strip down a creditor lien on the value of real property.under law,stripping down was not allowed.because d was ambiguous,and because there was no indication in the legislative history that a major change was intended,the court refused to interpret d to change the prior law 
g iven the ambiguity in the text of d,we are not convinced that congress intended to depart from the rule that liens pass through bankruptcy unaffected.
when congress amends the bankruptcy laws,it does not write on a clean slate.furthermore,this court has been reluctant to accept arguments that would interpret the code,however vague the particular language under consideration might be,to effect a major change in practice that is not the subject of at least some discussion in the legislative history.
id.at.internal citation omitted.
finally,in cohen de la cruz,d,the question addressed was whether a a excepts from discharge a treble damage award obtained in a suit based on the debtor fraud.section a a was enacted as part of the code,and was amended in.as enacted in,a a read 
a a discharge does not discharge an individual debtor from any debt 
for obtaining money,property,services,or credit,by 
a false pretenses,a false representation,or actual fraud.
emphasis added.after the amendment,a a read 
a a discharge does not discharge an individual debtor from any debt 
for money,property,services,or credit,to the extent obtained by 
a false pretenses,a false representation,or actual fraud.
emphasis added.the debtor argued that the phrase to the extent obtained by,added by the amendment,meant that the portion of his debt was limited to amounts obtained by the
