this case involves interpretation and application of the hanging paragraph in title,united states code,section a,which was added to the bankruptcy code the code by the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of.see,stat.bapcpa specifically,we are called upon to decide if the provision in the hanging paragraph protects against cramdown of the negative equity in a vehicle.this issue has been confronted by a number of bankruptcy and district courts throughout the country with widely divergent results,but it appears to be of first impression in this or any other circuit.
background 
the area of bankruptcy law involved in this case is somewhat complex and,as indicated above,rife with terms of art.for better understanding,we will set forth a brief discussion of the statutory background before turning to the facts and history of this particular case.
a.the statutory scheme 
bankruptcy rehabilitation under chapter of the code commonly involves the adjustment of obligations owed to creditors holding liens on the bankruptcy debtor property.generally,lien creditors are deemed to hold a secured claim to the extent of the present value of the property that the lien encumbers,while the excess,if any,is treated as a separate and unsecured claim.section a of the code provides in relevant part 
a an allowed claim of a creditor secured by a lien on property is a secured claim to the extent of the value of such creditor interest in the estate interest in such property and is an unsecured claim to the extent that the value of such creditor interest is less than the amount of such allowed claim.such value shall be determined in light of the purpose of the valuation and of the proposed disposition or use of such property.
a.in dealing with the allowed secured claims under section a,the code provides for one of three possible treatments with respect to each allowed secured claim the creditor can accept the debtor bankruptcy plan for repayment the debtor can surrender the property securing the claim to the creditor in lieu of repayment or the debtor can bifurcate the claim into a reduced secured portion equal to the present value of the collateral and an unsecured portion equal to the excess of the claim,and then receive a cramdown of the reduced secured claim upon the creditor.see generally a.under the cramdown option,as the supreme court has recognized,the debtor is permitted to keep the property over the objection of the creditor the creditor retains the lien securing the claim,and the debtor is required to provide the creditor with payments,over the life of the plan,that will total the present value of the allowed secured claim,the present value of the collateral.the value of the allowed secured claim is governed by a of the code.associates commercial rash,d internal citations omitted.cramdown was a familiar and routine occurrence before bapcpa was enacted in.as judge lundin notes in his treatise 
prior to bapcpa,cramdown of secured claims at confirmation in chapter cases was uniform and well understood.oversimplified,under a an allowed claim was a secured claim to the extent of the value of the collateral.undersecured claims were split into secured and unsecured components based on the value of the collateral.with or without consent of the lienholder,a chapter debtor could confirm a plan that proposed to pay the allowed secured claim in full with present value interest and to treat the balance of the debt as an unsecured claim.
keith lundin,chapter bankruptcy,at ed.
however,congress viewed the use of cramdown as abusive,so it amended section a through bapcpa and added the hanging paragraph,which provides 
for purposes of paragraph,section cramdown shall not apply to a claim described in that paragraph if the creditor has a purchase money security interest securing the debt that is the subject of the claim,the debt was incurred within the preceding the date of the filing of the petition,and the collateral for that debt consists of a motor vehicle as defined in section of title acquired for the personal use of the debtor,or if collateral for that debt consists of any other thing of value,if the debt was incurred during the period preceding that filing.
a.although the hanging paragraph has caused significant confusion and incoherence in the law and has been rightly criticized for its poor drafting,in re long,cir see also in re carver,its legislative history leaves little doubt that its architects intended only good things for car lenders and other lienholders.see long,supra,at citations omitted see also,general motors acceptance peaslee,to the extent that it is possible to glean any congressional intent behind the hanging paragraph that intent seems to be to protect creditors from the abuse of cramdown.in re payne,t hrough the bapcpa amendments to a,congress was attempting to remedy a perceived abuse by those who buy vehicles on credit on the eve of bankruptcy and then utilize the cramdown provisions of the bankruptcy code to pay the secured creditor a lesser amount than its full claim.in re duke,the history of the hanging paragraph does indicate that it was meant to discourage bankruptcy abuse.it is interesting to note that the section of bapcpa that added the hanging paragraph was entitled,section secured creditors fair treatment in chapter restoring the foundation for secured credit.thus,whatever else may be said about the hanging paragraph,it seems clear that by it congress intended to take away the right of debtors to reduce their secured obligations on retained vehicles to the value of the vehicles.see in re rodriguez,cir.bap.to fall within the hanging paragraph and be entitled to this protection,four general requirements must be satisfied the creditor must have a purchase money security interest in the collateral the debt must have been incurred within days before the filing of the debtor bankruptcy case the collateral for the debt must consist of a motor and the vehicle must have been acquired for the personal use of the debtor.see generally a.if these requirements are satisfied,the allowed secured claim is fixed at the amount of the creditor claim without resort to the cramdown provision mandated by section a.
facts and procedural history 
the facts of this case are simple,undisputed,and taken almost verbatim from the district court order.on june,stephen michael graupner debtor purchased a chevrolet silverado truck from a motor vehicle dealer in georgia.the vehicle was for his personal use and had a cash price of.the dealer agreed to finance the sale pursuant to a retail installment contract,with the seller retaining a security interest in the vehicle to secure the unpaid balance of the total sales price.
as part of the transaction,the debtor traded in a chevrolet silverado truck.that vehicle had a negative equity,with the debtor owing more on the vehicle than its value.there is nothing in the record of this case to indicate that the negative equity was not bona fide and reasonable in amount.the total sales price of the new vehicle included the negative equity,which had the effect of increasing the purchase price.the total amount financed was.the dealer subsequently assigned the retail installment contract to nuvell credit corporation creditor,which perfected its security interest by having its lien noted on the title to the new vehicle.
three hundred and one days later,on april,the debtor filed for chapter bankruptcy protection.the creditor filed its secured proof of claim showing an amount due on the contract of.the debtor retained the vehicle and listed it on his schedules as being valued at.the debtor proposed a chapter plan that sought to modify the creditor secured claim of by bifurcating it into secured and unsecured portions based on the retail value of the vehicle.the creditor objected to the confirmation of the proposed plan,contending that its secured claim could not be modified through cramdown because it fell within the hanging paragraph.the parties agreed that the debt for the vehicle was acquired within days of the filing for bankruptcy and that the vehicle was intended for the debtor personal use.consequently,the only question to be decided in the bankruptcy court was whether the creditor held a purchase money security interest in the vehicle.if it did,the debt could not be bifurcated.
because the term purchase money security interest is not defined in the code,the bankruptcy court began its analysis by stating that the question of whether a creditor holds a purchase money security interest is a matter of state law.the bankruptcy court referred to georgia version of article of the uniform commercial code ucc,found in the official code of georgia annotated,which provides 
a definitions.as used in this code section,the term 
purchase money collateral means goods or software that secures a purchase money obligation incurred with respect to that collateral.
purchase money obligation means an obligation of an obligor incurred as all or part of the price of the collateral or for value given to enable the debtor to acquire rights in or the use of the collateral if the value is in fact so used.
b purchase money security interest in goods.a security interest in goods is a purchase money security interest 
to the extent that the goods are purchase money collateral with respect to that security interest 
the bankruptcy court opined that while the definition of purchase money obligation in section appears clear at first glance,it becomes blurred and ambiguous when one attempts to define price in subsection a because the extent or reach of the term is uncertain.the bankruptcy court then went on to determine that price is more properly understood when viewed in conjunction with a separate,but related,section of the the amendments to the georgia motor vehicle sales finance act mvsfa,which specifically defines cash sale price to include any amount paid to the buyer to satisfy a lien on or a security interest in a motor vehicle used as a on the motor vehicle which is the subject of a retail installment transaction under this article.see a.reading these sections in pari the bankruptcy court determined was proper in light of the ambiguity in section a and the relationship between the two court held that the georgia general assembly intended,with its amendment to the mvsfa,to permit negative equity in a vehicle to be added to the cash sales price of a new vehicle without precluding the financing creditor or its assignee from taking a purchase money security interest in the new vehicle.the debtor was thus found to have a purchase money security interest in the vehicle pursuant to state law,which precluded bifurcation and cramdown under section.in affirming this decision,the district court held on appeal 
t he price of the collateral included the negative equity.the of the vehicle was an integral part of the sales transaction.the value of that along with its accompanying debt affected the ultimate price that was paid for the new truck.the negative equity is inextricably intertwined with the sales transaction and the financing of the purchase.this close nexus between the negative equity and this package transaction supports the conclusion that the negative equity must be considered as part of the price of the collateral footnote omitted.accordingly,the court finds that the creditor has a purchase money security interest for the full amount of its debt.thus,shall not apply to modify the amount of the secured obligation.
the debtor now appeals.
ii.standard of review 
the factual findings of the bankruptcy court can not be set aside unless they are clearly erroneous however,conclusions of law made by either the bankruptcy court or the district court are subject to de novo review.see in re sublett,cir.in a bankruptcy case,the district court functions as an appellate court,rendering this court the second court of review.id.at citation omitted.
iii.discussion 
as we noted at the outset of this opinion,the issue presented in this case has been confronted by dozens of lower courts.these decisions generally fall into two broad camps.the first camp holds,as the bankruptcy court held here,that the creditor purchase money security interest encompasses all components of the new vehicle purchase,including financing of negative equity.see,peaslee,supra,at in re myers,wl.june,in re ford,in re austin,in re dunlap,in re vinson,wl,in re schwalm,in re weiser,in re brei,wl,in re burt,in re bradlee,in re watson,wl,in re wall,in re cohrs,in re petrocci.
the second camp holds that certain components of the loan,most notably negative equity in a vehicle,do not constitute a purchase money security interest.see,in re munzberg,wl.june,in re callicott,in re jernigan,wl,in re look,in re wear,wl,in re johnson,in re tuck,wl,in re lavigne,wl,in re conyers,in re hayes,in re pajot,in re price,in re,in re bray,in re mitchell,in re sanders,in re blakeslee,in re acaya,in re vega.
the latter group of cases lead to a further inquiry on how to treat partial purchase money securities,which has caused still more divergences in the law.some courts have adopted the rule which allows the court to treat the portion as,while the portion remains,see,pajot,supra,at,whereas other courts have adopted the transformational rule which holds that a security interest that is part and part completely loses its character and is entirely transformed into a security interest,see,price,supra,at see also lavigne,supra,wl,at noting that courts are divided on the issue of whether to apply the dual status or transformational rule and collecting cases on both sides.one court has appropriately described the foregoing as a maddeningly inconsistent body of decisions.see in re westfall.
the ultimate issue we must decide is whether the debtor negative equity in his vehicle constitutes purchase money.our court has defined what is,and what is not,a purchase money security interest,and we apply that definition here 
a security interest in collateral is purchase money to the extent that the item secures a debt for the money required to make the purchase.if an item of collateral secures some other type of debt,antecedent debt,it is not purchase money.
in re freeman,cir.so,the question is whether negative equity on a vehicle is debt for the money required to make the purchase of the new vehicle,or whether it is antecedent debt.it is,as the split in the decided cases indicates,a close call.
upon consideration,however,we agree with the bankruptcy court that,when looking to georgia state law,negative equity is more properly regarded as the former and not the latter.when ucc and a mvsfa are read in pari materia which we believe is appropriate for all the reasons stated by the bankruptcy court,it is the only reasonable conclusion to reach.because this issue was properly considered and analyzed at length by the bankruptcy court,and by certain of the courts in the first camp above,we see no reason to duplicate the analysis as the path is by now we do add,however,that our decision finds support in the relevant ucc official comment and is consistent with legislative intent.
section of the ucc,adopted by,provides that a security interest in goods is a security interest to the extent that the goods are collateral with respect to that security interest.it then defines collateral as goods or software that secures a obligation incurred with respect to that collateral.the term obligation is defined,in turn,as an obligation of an obligor incurred as all or part of the price of the collateral or for value given to enable the debtor to acquire rights in or the use of the collateral if the value is in fact so used.in sum,therefore,the focus of the definition of a purchase money security interest under the ucc is on the obligation that is secured by the collateral,and this definition contains two prongs i the price of the collateral and ii value given to enable the debtor to buy the collateral.official comment to the ucc explains 
t he definition of obligation,the price of collateral or the value given to enable includes obligations for expenses incurred in connection with acquiring rights in the collateral,sales taxes,duties,finance charges,interest,freight charges,costs of storage in transit,demurrage,administrative charges,expenses of collection and enforcement,att
