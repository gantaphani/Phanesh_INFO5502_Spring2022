that issue is whether congress abrogated the sovereign immunity of indian tribes when it enacted of the bankruptcy code.to answer this question,we look to the text of the code 
a notwithstanding an assertion of sovereign immunity,sovereign immunity is abrogated as to a governmental unit to the extent set forth in this section with respect to the following 
governmental unit,in turn,is defined as 
united states state commonwealth district territory municipality foreign state department,agency,or instrumentality of the united states,a state,a commonwealth,a district,a territory,a municipality,or a foreign state or other foreign or domestic governments 
neither the supreme court nor any circuit has determined whether these statutes,which do not include the term indian tribes or any similar language,suffice to abrogate indian tribes immunity from suit 
it is clear from the face of a and that congress did intend to abrogate the sovereign immunity of all foreign and domestic governments.section a explicitly abrogates the sovereign immunity of all governmental units.the definition of governmental unit first lists a of all governmental bodies,but then adds a phrase,or other foreign or domestic governments.thus,all foreign and domestic governments,including but not limited to those particularly enumerated in the first part of the definition,are considered governmental units for the purpose of the bankruptcy code,and,under a,are subject to suit.
indian tribes are certainly governments,whether considered foreign or domestic and,logically,there is no other form of government outside the dichotomy,unless one entertains the possibility of states.
the supreme court has recognized that indian tribes are domestic dependent nations that exercise inherent sovereign authority over their members and territories.potawatomi,at.citing cherokee nation georgia,pet.see also,blatchford native village of noatak,d comparing indian tribes to states and foreign sovereigns,and concluding that both states and indian tribes are domestic sovereigns.so the category indian tribes is simply a specific member of the group of domestic governments,the immunity of which congress intended to abrogate.
had congress simply stated,sovereign immunity is abrogated as to all parties who otherwise could claim sovereign immunity,there can be no doubt that indian tribes,as parties who could otherwise claim sovereign immunity,would no longer be able to do so.similarly here,congress explicitly abrogated the immunity of any foreign or domestic government.indian tribes are domestic governments.therefore,congress expressly abrogated the immunity of indian tribes.see in re russell,concluding that a abrogates tribal sovereign immunity unequivocally and without implication see also in re davis chevrolet.it seems to this court that other domestic government is broad enough to encompass indian tribes.in re mayes,cir mcfeeley,dissenting arguing that a does abrogate tribal sovereign immunity in re vianese.holding that tribe had individually waived its sovereign immunity,and stating in dicta that a did abrogate the sovereign immunity of indian tribes under the bankruptcy code.
similar syllogistic reasoning was followed in kimel,a case concerning the abrogation of state sovereign immunity.kimel,at,d.in that case,the supreme court held that congress had clearly expressed its intent to abrogate the sovereign immunity of the states when passing certain amendments to the age discrimination enforcement act adea.id.at the same time,kimel recognized that this expression of intent,while explicit,did not appear in terms on the face of the adea 
the adea states that its provisions shall be enforced in accordance with the powers,remedies,and procedures provided in section of this title b.section b,in turn,clearly provides for suits by individuals against states.that provision authorizes employees to maintain actions for backpay against any employer including a public agency in any federal or state court of competent jurisdiction any doubt concerning the identity of the public agency defendant named in b is dispelled by looking to x,which defines the term to include the government of a state or political subdivision thereof,and any agency of a state,or a political subdivision of a state.read as a whole the plain language of these provisions clearly demonstrates congress intent to subject the states to suit for money damages at the hands of individual employees.
id.congress,therefore,need not make its intent to abrogate unmistakably clear in a single section of a statute.id.at.see also osage tribal council united states dep t of labor,cir holding that the safe drinking water act contains a clear and explicit waiver of tribal immunity despite the fact that the court had to piece together various subsections of the statute to arrive at that conclusion.
the difference between kimel and osage,on the one hand,and the case presently before us,on the other,is evident but,in the end,unimportant unlike the definition of public agency in the adea,which does list states,no definition in the bankruptcy code actually lists indian tribes as either a foreign or domestic government.however,in enacting the bankruptcy code,congress was legislating against the of prior supreme court decisions,which do define indian tribes as domestic nations,governments,as well as against the ordinary,meaning of the term other foreign or domestic governments.
