we adopt in full the opinion of the bankruptcy appellate panel in this case,published at cir,which we reproduce below 
the bankruptcy code requires an individual debtor in a chapter case to undertake certain obligations with respect to personal property that secures a debt.a.a debtor must file a statement of intention indicating whether she intends to surrender or retain such property and must file and perform on her intention within a certain time frame.a a.if a debtor fails to timely meet those obligations,the automatic stay terminates and the property is removed from the estate unless the chapter trustee obtains a determination that the property is of consequential value or benefit to the estate.a c,h and.
in this case,the debtor did not file a statement of intention with respect to personal property that was pledged to a creditor and the chapter trustee did not seek a determination that the property was of value or benefit to the estate.however,the chapter trustee appeals the bankruptcy court ruling that h terminated the automatic stay on all of the debtor personal property secured by the creditor claim and not just on personal property scheduled as securing the claim.we affirm.
edra blixseth the debtor guaranteed a loan loan made to her son by western capital partners,llc western capital.the debtor also pledged certain personal property as collateral for the loan the collateral western capital security agreement security agreement describes the collateral as including all interests owned by the debtor in any corporation,partnership or limited liability company,all instruments,general intangibles,rights of action,contracts,accounts,goods,antiques,art,and automobiles,wherever located.on june,western capital filed a ucc financing statement,referencing the loan and security agreement.the ucc financing statement,like the security agreement,contained a comprehensive description of the collateral,and encompassed all personal property of the debtor wherever located.

on june,the chapter meeting of creditors was held by that date,the debtor had not filed a statement of intention regarding the collateral,as required by a a the trustee did not move for a determination of consequential value or benefit under h or for an extension of time to do so 
during the bankruptcy case,western capital filed three motions for relief from the automatic stay the stay relief motions.the stay relief motions sought relief under d and were filed on may,june,and august.in its may,stay relief motion,western capital sought relief from the stay in order to liquidate the debtor stock in blx group,blx.
in its june,stay relief motion,western capital sought relief in order to liquidate the debtor fine art,furnishings,collectibles,jewelry and other personal property located at the debtor california residence,known as porcupine creek,in rancho mirage,california.in its august,stay relief motion,western capital sought relief in order to liquidate some of the debtor jewelry.the trustee did not file objections to the stay relief motions.
on october,the bankruptcy court held a hearing on western capital may,and august,stay relief motions western capital and the trustee both attended the hearing.western capital argued that,notwithstanding its request for relief under d,it was additionally entitled to relief under h since the debtor had not timely filed a statement of intention regarding the collateral.the bankruptcy court agreed and entered an order granting western capital two stay relief motions on october,the order granting relief.the order granting relief found that 
the debtor had not filed a statement of intention and 
the trustee had not objected to the stay relief motions indicating to this court that the bankruptcy estate has determined that debtor personal property is of inconsequential value to the bankruptcy estate.the bankruptcy court held that h provided western capital mandatory relief.
western capital subsequently filed various notices of ucc sales to liquidate the collateral.the sales were postponed while western capital and the trustee worked to resolve the trustee concerns regarding the sales,including the trustee assertion that the sales violated the automatic stay.however,on march,western capital moved forward with a sale of blx stock,which was the subject of the order granting relief the march sale.the march sale also sold the debtor interest in two entities and various accounts receivable,which were not the subject of the order granting relief.western capital was the successful bidder at the sale for.

in his motion to enforce,the trustee contended that the may sale proposed to sell property that was protected by the automatic stay because the automatic stay never terminated under h on all of the collateral,but only terminated on personal property identified on the debtor schedules the trustee interpreted the schedules as limiting the collateral to the debtor personal property located at the family compound at yellowstone mountain club.because the contract rights referenced in the may sale notice were not located at the yellowstone mountain club,the trustee argued they remained under the protection of the automatic stay.
western capital filed an objection to the motion to enforce,contending that h applied to all the collateral securing the loan.on august,the bankruptcy court held a hearing on the motion to enforce.it issued a memorandum of decision on august,holding that h terminated the automatic stay on the collateral regardless of whether it was listed on the schedules.an order denying the motion to enforce was entered the same day the order denying enforcement.on august,the trustee filed a notice of appeal.

discussion 
jurisdiction 
we lack jurisdiction over an appeal that is not timely filed.saunders band plus mortg.in re saunders,cir requirement of timely notice of appeal is mandatory and jurisdictional.western capital contends that this appeal is untimely.see rule a notice of appeal must be filed within days of the date of the entry of the judgment or order.according to western capital,the order granting relief,entered on october,determined that the automatic stay terminated under h on the collateral,and therefore,the trustee should have appealed that order.
although the bankruptcy court granted relief pursuant to h,the trustee argument that h applies only to personal property identified by the debtor on her schedules was not at issue.th
