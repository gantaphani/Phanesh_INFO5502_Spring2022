opinion of the court 
allows a debtor to sell substantially all of its assets outside a plan of reorganization.in modern bankruptcy practice,it is the tool of choice to put a quick close to a bankruptcy case.it avoids time,expense,and,some would say,the bankruptcy code unbending rules.the issue at the core of this appeal,which arises from such a sale,is whether certain payments by a purchaser here an entity formed by the secured lenders of the debtors in connection with acquiring the debtors assets should be distributed according to the code hierarchy.
to give some color to this issue,the secured lenders here were owed more than the value of the debtors assets,making them undersecured.they acquired the assets by crediting approximately of the secured debt they were owed.no cash changed hands.this purchase mechanism is known in bankruptcy parlance as a credit bid.the only cash payments made in connection with the deal were those the secured lenders deposited in escrow for professional fees and paid directly to the unsecured creditors.we conclude,as we explain more fully below,that neither of the two payments went into or came out of the bankruptcy estate.thus the cash was not subject to the code distribution priority.
background 
lifecare business troubles 
at the start of,lifecare holdings,lifecare once a leading operator of acute care hospitals,was struggling financially.management blamed its condition on hurricane katrina destruction of three of the company facilities and federal regulations that followed the natural disaster.because of the weight of its debt load million,of which approximately million was secured,new capital was hard to find.as a result,management considered two transactions that would salvage it as a going concern a sale or a restructuring of its balance sheet.
the sale did happen initially because none of lifecare suitors there were at least seven of them offered an amount that exceeded its debt obligations.the best offer submitted by one of lifecare biggest competitors reflected a recovery to the secured lenders of only.management considered that option inadequate and thus was left with the restructuring alternative.to go that route,however,it needed the support of its secured lenders.but they had another idea.rather than support a restructuring of lifecare balance sheet,the secured lenders wanted to purchase the company outright that is,all of its cash and assets.to that end,they offered to credit million of the million debt they were then owed.
because their credit bid was lifecare best and only alternative to liquidation under chapter,the company agreed to part with all of its assets,including cash.to memorialize the proposed sale,the secured lender group through an acquisition vehicle called hospital acquisition,entered into an asset purchase agreement with lifecare in december.
in addition to its credit bid,the purchaser agreed to pay the legal and accounting fees of lifecare and the committee of unsecured creditors the committee and to pick up the tab for the company costs.because the professionals had completed their work,the agreement directed the purchaser to deposit cash funds into separate escrow accounts.any money that went unspent had to be returned to it.
lifecare files for bankruptcy 
lifecare and its subsidiaries,which together operated acute care hospitals in states and had about employees,filed for bankruptcy one day after entering into the asset purchase agreement among the company first requests was permission to sell substantially all of its assets through a auction under b.after receiving the from the bankruptcy court,lifecare marketed its assets to over potential strategic and financial counterparties.in the end,however,the secured lender group million credit bid remained the most attractive offer.according to the testimony of lifecare advisor from rothschild,many of the putative bidders were concerned with reimbursement issues and the challenging regulatory environment facing the acute care industry.hence they were unwilling to offer lifecare an amount commensurate with the debt relief put forward by the secured lenders.
though the secured lender group was selected by default as the successful bidder,the sale was not yet a done deal.two important players in the bankruptcy case,the committee and united states government neither of which would recover anything if the court approved the sale objected to the asset transfer.the former criticized it as a veiled foreclosure that would leave the bankruptcy estate so insolvent even administrative expenses would not be paid.the government,for its part,argued that the sale would result in tax liability estimated at million,giving it an administrative claim that would go unpaid.this was unfair,it maintained,because under the proposed sale arrangement equally situated administrative claimants primarily the bankruptcy professionals would get paid if the sale went through.
as is not uncommon,however,and before its objections to the sale reached resolution,the committee struck a deal with the secured lender group.in exchange for the committee promise to drop its objections and support the sale,the secured lenders agreed to deposit million in trust for the benefit of the general unsecured creditors.the compromise was embodied in a term sheet which we refer to as the settlement agreement or settlement that was submitted to the bankruptcy court together with the sale materials,but later resubmitted in a motion for the court approval.
c.the sale hearing 
on april,the bankruptcy court approved the proposed sale from the bench.applying the sound business purpose test,which bankruptcy courts use to decide whether to approve a sale,see in re montgomery ward holding,the court described lifecare condition as getting progressively worse in bankruptcy talk,it was a melting ice cube.the only way to avoid liquidation a potential threat to lifecare patients and a result that would leave the unsecured creditors and the government with nothing and allow the company to continue as a going concern was through a quick sale.the court order approving the sale noted that it was the only alternative to liquidation and best opportunity to realize the full value of lifecare assets,the offer accepted was the best and only one,and a plan of reorganization would not have yielded as favorable an economic result.the court also found that the parties gave proper notice of the sale and that the purchaser paid a fair and reasonable sum and acted in good faith.finally,and important for our purposes,the court addressed the government fairness objection.deeming the administrative fee monies put in escrow by the purchaser not to be estate property,those funds were subject to distribution to lifecare creditors,and thus the government had no claim to any of it.
the court reserved judgment on the proposed settlement until a later date.
d.the settlement hearing 
a bankruptcy court approval of a settlement agreement is not a fait accompli.the settlement must be fair and equitable.prospective comm.for indep.stockholders of tmt trailer ferry,anderson.to determine if it is,courts in this circuit apply the test set out in in re martin,cir,which balances the value of the claim that is being compromised against the value to the estate of the acceptance of the compromise proposal.in re world health alternatives,internal quotation marks omitted.the test requires a court to weigh whether in response to a challenge or on its own the probability of success in litigation the likely difficulties in collection the complexity of the litigation involved,and the expense,inconvenience and delay necessarily attending it and the paramount interest of the creditors.in re martin,at.
at the settlement hearing the bankruptcy court addressed the government argument that,assuming the settlement money was property of the estate which the government believed the money was,bypassing it and paying the unsecured creditors disturbed the code priority scheme for the payment of creditors.thus,regardless whether the settlement satisfied the martin factors,it was unlawful.as the government lawyer put it,the proposed million settlement attempts to distribute estate property to junior creditors over the objection of a senior creditor in violation of the absolute priority rule,and so therefore,it can not be approved.may,hr g tr.but the court rejected this contention,maintaining that,because the settlement agreement permits a distribution directly to the unsecured creditors from the purchaser,it is an indication that the funds are not property of lifecare estate,and as such,the absolute priority rule is not implicated.id.at.addressing the martin factors,the court approved the settlement,stating that the creditors objection had a very small chance of success and thus their million payday was an excellent outcome.
e.the government appeal and stay request 
the government appealed from both the sale order and the court approval of the settlement and sought to stay the effect of those decisions.at the stay hearing,the government made clear its intent was not to stop the sale but to alter the part of the sale order that provides for the payment of professional fees and expenses.likewise,it argued that the distributional terms of the settlement agreement should be modified to follow the code scheme.but the court again disagreed with the government assessment and denied its stay request.see june,hr g tr.at noting that there was nothing in the record on which to base a finding that the funds being held,in effect,in trust for other creditors,for other parties and specifically pursuant to a contract,are property of the estate.
the government appealed the denial of its request for a stay to the district court.but it too thought the government had a weak case on the merits,agreeing with the bankruptcy court that the funds at issue were not property of the estate and thus not subject to the code distribution rules.see app.at deferring to the bankruptcy court ruling,which was based on a voluminous and uncontested record supplemented by the argument and testimony presented at several hearings that the sale was warranted and the funds at issue belonged to the purchaser and not the estate.thus the district court denied the stay request,concluding that the government did make the threshold showing of a sufficient likelihood of success on the merits.
the government appeals the approval of both the sale order and the settlement.we have jurisdiction under d and.
ii.analysis 
the government raises two issues.did the bankruptcy court err in approving a provision of the sale of lifecare assets under which the secured lender group agreed to pay some administrative claims but not others of equal priority and did it err in approving the distributional terms of the committee and secured lender group settlement,which resulted in a million payday for the unsecured creditors even though a senior creditor namely the government received nothing before we can get to these issues,we must resolve the following questions 
a is the government appeal moot,be it constitutionally,statutorily or equitably 
b were the funds paid to administrative claimants under the escrow arrangement approved by the sale order,or to the unsecured creditors per approval of the settlement agreement,property of lifecare estate 
lifecare and the committee contend that constitutional,statutory and equitable mootness bar our review of the government challenge to the escrowed funds set up by the asset purchase agreement as well as the million deposited in trust by the purchaser for the unsecured creditors.
constitutional mootness 
lifecare constitutional mootness argument stems from the secured lender group retaining,after its credit bid is applied,a million first priority lien on all property of the bankruptcy estate.thus,lifecare argument proceeds,the government would be entitled to no relief making its case moot even if the escrowed funds were deemed estate property,as the funds would go to the secured lenders.we disagree.a case becomes moot in the constitutional sense only when it is impossible for a court to grant any effectual relief whatever to the prevailing party.chafin chafin,quoting knox.serv.employees.as long as the parties have a concrete interest,however small,in the outcome of the litigation,the case is not moot.id.quoting knox.at.we have that here.the government has a million administrative claim that will go unpaid if the distributional terms of the escrowed funds are left undisturbed.though the prospect of recovery might be remote,we can not say it is impossible.hence the government appeal is not constitutionally moot,and we have jurisdiction to consider whether it is entitled to a piece of the pie.
statutory mootness 
moving to statutory mootness,because the underlying asset sale was conducted under b of the bankruptcy code,which authorizes the sale of estate property outside the ordinary course of business,it implicates m.that provision moots any challenge to a sale that affect s the validity of the sale so long as the purchaser acted in good faith and the appellant failed to obtain a stay of the sale.collier on bankruptcy ed.
subsection m reads in full save for words not relevant here 
the reversal or modification on appeal of an authorization of a sale or lease of property does not affect the validity of a sale or lease under such authorization to an entity that purchased or leased such property in good faith,whether or not such entity knew of the pendency of the appeal,unless such authorization and such sale or lease were stayed pending appeal.

to give effect to m purpose,some courts limit the appealability of a section sale order to the issue of the purchaser good faith.in re motors liquidation.under that view,if the objecting party fails to obtain a stay of the sale,appellate review is statutorily limited to the narrow issue of whether the property was sold to a good faith purchaser.id.quoting licensing by paolo,sinatra in re gucci,cir.by contrast,we interpret subsection m more broadly and will review any that does affect the validity of the sale.cinicola,at.stated another way,so long as we can grant effective relief,m does bar appellate review.pittsburgh food beverage,ranallo,cir.thus the question we need to answer is whether we can give the government the relief it seeks a redistribution of the escrowed funds for administrative expenses and settlement proceeds to unsecured creditors,reply br.at without disturbing the sale.
lifecare and the committee both argue we can not.lifecare contends that,if we reallocate the escrowed funds,this will change a fundamental term of the transaction and deprive it of a key benefit.lifecare br.at.similarly,the committee asserts that the settlement can not be reversed without affecting the validity of the sale,committee br.at,and,like lifecare,it will be deprived of a key deal term,as it would not have withdrawn its objection to the sale without payment,id.at.
we disagree with both positions.the provision stamps out only those challenges that would claw back the sale from a purchaser.it does not moot every term that might be included in a sale agreement,even if each is technically integral to that transaction.reply br.at emphasis in original.and,while m aims to make sales of estate property final and inject predictability into the sale process,we do think it does so at all costs and certainly not for.thus we fail to see how m bars our review.
equitable mootness 
finally,the committee contends the government appeal is equitably moot because the government was unsuccessful in obtaining a stay of the settlement order and it too late to undo the compromise because over million has already been distributed.but,even if it is right about the consequences,the committee reliance on the doctrine of equitable mootness misses the mark.in re semcrude,cir,makes clear that the doctrine comes into play in bankruptcy so far as we know,its only playground after a plan of reorganization is approved.id.at.outside
