basem habash filed a voluntary bankruptcy petition in august.nearly months later,najib zedan,a judgment creditor of habash,initiated an adversary proceeding that objected to the discharge of habash debts because of alleged fraud by habash in representing his income and assets to the bankruptcy trustee.see a d.at the time zedan filed the adversary complaint,the deadline for creditors to object to a discharge had long passed,and the bankruptcy court had yet to grant a discharge to habash.the bankruptcy court dismissed zedan complaint,and zedan immediately appealed the decision to the district court,which affirmed the dismissal.see zedan habash in re habash.we also affirm the dismissal of zedan complaint.
habash filed for bankruptcy in the northern district of illinois in late august.the bankruptcy court scheduled the first meeting of creditors for late october,and set a deadline of december,for creditors to file objections to the discharge of habash debts.see fed.a.before the creditors meeting,the appointed bankruptcy trustee resigned consequently,the creditors meeting was rescheduled for early december.in late november,zedan,a judgment creditor,filed a motion to extend the time for creditors to object to the discharge.the bankruptcy court granted zedan motion and extended the creditors deadline until february.in january,the newly appointed bankruptcy trustee,deborah ebner,filed a motion to extend her own deadline to object to habash discharge.this motion,and a subsequent motion to extend,were both granted,and the trustee was ultimately given a september deadline to object to the discharge.
zedan did not file any objection to habash discharge before february,nor did any other creditor.for the next ten months,habash cooperated with the participated in discovery conducted by the trustee attorney in september,see fed,and negotiated a resolution of his case that would include an auction of his assets and the eventual discharge of his debts.the trustee did not object to the discharge,and in december,the bankruptcy court entered an order approving the procedure for dividing habash assets,and scheduled a sale for february.
in january,zedan hired new counsel,who immediately filed a motion to postpone the scheduled sale.this motion argued that the sale of habash assets should be postponed because,zedan alleged,habash had fraudulently represented his income and the value of his assets to the bankruptcy trustee.the bankruptcy trustee did not join in zedan objection.on february,the bankruptcy court denied zedan motion,and on february,the auction sale of habash nonexempt assets took place.the bankruptcy court approved the sale a few days later.
in april,zedan filed an adversary complaint in the bankruptcy court under a and d,and also under illinois law governing fraudulent transfer and misappropriation of corporate assets.the adversary complaint sought a judgment that habash debts were,and reiterated most of the arguments that zedan had raised in his motion to postpone the adversary complaint alleged fraud by habash when disclosing his income,property value,and inventory to the trustee.see habash,at.in july,without issuing an opinion,the bankruptcy court dismissed zedan adversary proceeding with because the bankruptcy court regarded the complaint as untimely 
zedan immediately appealed the bankruptcy court dismissal to the district court,asserting that the bankruptcy court failed to apply the proper legal standard when dismissing the adversary complaint and improperly dismissed the complaint as untimely.as for timeliness,zedan argued that the adversary complaint was based on fraud that was not discovered until after the deadline to file objections had lapsed.as such,zedan contended that his adversary complaint asserted a claim based on newly discovered fraud under d,and he argued that the timing requirement of e which permits a creditor to pursue revocation of a discharge within one year of an actual apply instead of the bankruptcy court deadline for creditors to object to the discharge.the bankruptcy court still had not granted a discharge to habash,and zedan argued that if one can file an adversary complaint based on fraud one year after discharge,then surely one can file it after a deadline has passed,but before a discharge.
in january,the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court dismissal of zedan adversary complaint on different grounds.habash,at.in the district court view,the bankruptcy court had erred as a matter of law because the february date to file objections did not bar zedan from pursuing relief under d.see id.the district court held that because no discharge had ever been entered,zedan had acted within the time limits set by e.see id.however,the district court adopted a different timeliness limitation it stated that zedan was required to file his adversary complaint within one year of discharge or within one year after the date to file objections.see id.citing citibank emery in re emery,cir.the district court then held that zedan adversary complaint was still untimely because he failed to file within one year of the date.see id.in addition to untimeliness,the district court also noted that zedan adversary complaint was legally insufficient because zedan failed to plead his claim with particularity as required by fed.bank,and because he had failed to investigate and diligently pursue his claim despite being on notice of the alleged fraud.habash,at.zedan filed a notice of appeal in this court on february.
ii.analysis 
before we can consider the merits of zedan appeal,we must first address a question of appellate jurisdiction noticed by the panel.in re salem,cir see also chiplease,steinberg in re res.tech,cir our first task is to confirm that we have jurisdiction to hear this appeal.at the time zedan filed his notice of appeal,the bankruptcy court had still not decided whether to grant a discharge to habash.shockingly,neither side brief contained this any facts regarding the status of the bankruptcy required by circuit rule a.see fifth third bank,edgar county bank trust,cir circuit rule a requires details on how the matters appealed in a bankruptcy case relate to any part of the litigation still under way in the bankruptcy court or the district court.nor could the parties definitively answer our questions about the status of the bankruptcy at oral argument.
frustrated by this noncompliance with our circuit rules,chief judge easterbrook,on behalf of the panel,issued an order from the bench requiring the parties to file supplemental memoranda addressing whether rejecting a single potential objection to discharge is a final order immediately reviewable by the court of appeals even though the bankruptcy judge has yet to decide whether the debtor will be discharged.that order also requested that the parties brief the status of the ongoing bankruptcy proceedings.the parties complied with the order,and both supplemental memoranda concluded that we have jurisdiction over this appeal.
from conducting our own review of the bankruptcy court docket,we learned that habash assets had been distributed from the estate prior to oral argument in this appeal,and on november,the bankruptcy court finally granted a discharge to habash.on november,zedan filed a new notice of appeal to the district court in the bankruptcy proceeding in that action,presently before the northern district of illinois c,zedan appealed both the bankruptcy court november,discharge order and its july order dismissing his adversary order at issue before us.habash filed a motion to dismiss that case based on lack of jurisdiction that motion is still pending.
this court has jurisdiction over appeals from all final decisions,judgments,orders,and decrees entered by a district court pursuant to its review of final decisions of a bankruptcy court.d.therefore,we only have jurisdiction over a bankruptcy appeal if both the bankruptcy court order and the district court order reviewing that original order are final decisions.salem,at citing in re rimsat,cir.we have observed that finality in a bankruptcy appeal under d is considerably more flexible than in an ordinary civil appeal taken under.in re gould,cir see also chiplease,at in re insulations,cir.in the bankruptcy context,finality does not require the termination of the entire bankruptcy proceeding.see in re ual,cir t he fact that the bankruptcy proceeding continues before the bankruptcy judge does not preclude treating an interlocutory order by in the sense that it does not terminate the entire final for purposes of appellate review.quoting in re szekely,cir.rather,the test we have utilized to determine finality under d is whether an order resolves a discrete dispute that,but for the continuing bankruptcy,would have been a suit by or against the trustee.see bank of am.moglia,cir citing golant levy in re golant,cir and rimsat,at.
we have consistently explained that the final disposition of any adversary proceeding falls within our jurisdiction.see in re teknek,llc,cir for the purpose of appellate jurisdiction we treat adversary proceedings as if they were separate suits.fifth third bank,at a final resolution of any adversary proceeding is appealable,as it is equivalent to a stand alone lawsuit.citing insulations,in re morse,cir emphasis added mellon bank,dick,cir we have jurisdiction of the creditors appeal,because the order under review is the final decision in an adversary proceeding.in re lopez,cir a bankruptcy case is often a congeries of functionally distinct cases.the clearest example is that of the adversary action once the action is finally decided in the bankruptcy and district courts,the fact that the bankruptcy proceeding may be continuing is no reason to delay the appeal from the decision in the action,so the decision is deemed final,and appeal allowed.see also in re ual,cir in re marchiando,cir.
this sweeping language is harmonious with the fact that adversary proceedings frequently resolve legal issues that appear logically separate from the ordinary measures determined in the main bankruptcy proceeding.see teknek,at adversary proceedings for example,tort actions against a debtor,or attempts by the debtor to recover preferential transfers are conceptually distinct from core matters such as locating the debtor existing assets and approving plans of reorganization.but here the conceptual gap between the subject matter resolved in the adversary proceeding and core matters has been somewhat narrowed because zedan has filed an adversary complaint to revoke a discharge,which is more closely related to the main proceedings.see kontrick ryan,d noting that congress has classified an objection to a debtor discharge as a core proceeding see also b j.nevertheless,we have acknowledged that the dismissal of an adversary complaint objecting to a debtor discharge is a final decision that falls within our jurisdiction.see marchiando,at suburban bank of cary grove riggsby in re riggsby,cir w e think it reasonably clear that the dismissal by the bankruptcy judge of a complaint objecting to the discharge of the bankrupt is final.this is because the adversary proceeding will finally determine the rights of the creditor seeking to object to or revoke the discharge,even if it does not finally determine the rights of the debtor.and that sort of discrete finality is sufficient to confer jurisdiction under the relaxed approach to finality applied in bankruptcy cases.see,chiplease,at moglia,at insulations,at.
zedan filed his claim as an adversary proceeding because the bankruptcy rules required him to do creditor who seeks to object to or revoke the discharge of a debtor must initiate a separate adversary proceeding.see fed.d.the adversary proceeding was finally resolved by the bankruptcy court in july when it dismissed the adversary complaint with prejudice.see fed.incorporating.into adversary proceedings in bankruptcy.b stating that an involuntary dismissal operates as an adjudication on the merits.once the bankruptcy court entered the order of dismissal,the court was left with nothing further to do with respect to the adversary complaint.see marchiando,at.similarly,the district court order affirming that dismissal also constituted a final judgment.therefore,we have jurisdiction over this appeal.
turning to the merits,we review the dismissal of an adversary complaint in bankruptcy de novo.enodis employers ins.of wausau in re consol.indus,cir.we may affirm the district court decision on any basis supported by the record.dye united states in re dye,cir goldberg sec.scarlata in re scarlata,cir.
zedan claims that the bankruptcy court and district court both erred in dismissing his adversary complaint for its untimeliness.zedan argues that his adversary complaint alleged evidence of fraud that was undiscovered until september.zedan claims that because of the newly discovered fraud,and because the bankruptcy court had yet to grant a discharge,his complaint was timely under e.zedan also contends that the district court erred by applying the improper legal standard when it determined that zedan had not pled the fraud with particularity as required by fed.
zedan adversary complaint requested a declaration that habash debts were not dischargeable because of the alleged fraud.at the time of the complaint,the bankruptcy court had not yet ordered a discharge in the ordinary course,zedan claim would have been filed as an objection to a discharge.see c.but because the deadline to file objections had lapsed,zedan adversary complaint invoked d,which entitles a debtor to different of an discharge.
at first blush,zedan adversary complaint seems filed a complaint to revoke a nonexistent discharge.but zedan creative pleading arises from a deeper quandary created by the juxtaposition of the bankruptcy code with the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure.under the code,a creditor may object to the granting of a discharge to a debtor.c.the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure require a creditor who seeks to object to or revoke the discharge of a debtor to initiate a separate adversary proceeding.see fed.d fed.in turn,fed.a,which governs adversary proceedings filed in objection to a debtor discharge,requires a complaint objecting to the discharge to be filed no later than days following the first set meeting of the creditors.once this time expires,and if no objection has been lodged,the bankruptcy rules state that the court shall forthwith grant the discharge.fed.c see also emery,at.
so the bankruptcy rules clearly contemplate that a discharge will follow almost immediately after the period to file an objection expires.yet,as this case demonstrates,the window under the bankruptcy rules may close well before any discharge is granted.when that happens,the expiration creates a gap period between the deadline for creditors to object to a discharge,and the date the discharge is actually granted.see emery,at england stevens in re stevens.in this case,the gap period resulted because the bankruptcy court bifurcated the deadline for the creditors to object to the discharge february and the deadline for the trustee to object to the discharge september.
the gap period creates a predicament for creditors who discover a debtor fraud during the gap period,the creditor who discovers the debtor fraud after the deadline to file objections has elapsed but before a discharge has been entered because the bankruptcy code requires a creditor to be ignorant of the debtor fraud until after the discharge date in order to avail himself of the process for revoking the discharge.see d.but under the bankruptcy rules,a bankruptcy court will likely dismiss a creditor objection as untimely if it comes after the deadline to file objections has was the case for zedan here.thus,a creditor who learns of fraud during the gap period is whipsawed and left no remedy under either the bankruptcy code or the bankruptcy rules he can not file a timely objection under the rules,and the language of the code prevents him from revoking the discharge once it is issued.
other federal courts have noticed this tension between the bankruptcy code and the rules.in in re emery,the second circuit resolved the dilemma,stating that we do not believe that congress intentionally drafted a statute to punish fraudulent conduct by debtors that at the same time provides
