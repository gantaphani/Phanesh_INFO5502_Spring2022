this appeal requires us to resolve the effect of two potentially conflicting provisions of federal law.section of the bankruptcy code allows a chapter debtor to reject its collective bargaining agreements cbas under certain circumstances the national labor relations act nlra prohibits an employer from unilaterally changing the terms and conditions of a cba even after its expiration thus,under the nlra,the key terms and conditions of an expired cba continue to govern the relationship between a and its unionized employees until the parties reach a new agreement or bargain to impasse.this case presents a question of first impression among the courts of appeals is a chapter able to reject the continuing terms and conditions of a cba under after the cba has expired 
unite here local union appeals the bankruptcy court order granting the debtors motion to reject their cba with the union pursuant to c.the union contends that the bankruptcy court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to approve the debtors motion because the cba had expired.the debtors,trump entertainment resorts,and its affiliated debtors contend that c governs all cbas,expired and unexpired,and that the bankruptcy court interpretation of is consistent with the policies underlying the bankruptcy code.
we conclude that does not distinguish between the terms of an unexpired cba and the terms and conditions that continue to govern after the cba expires.thus,we will affirm the order of the bankruptcy court.
the facts giving rise to this appeal are undisputed.the debtors own and operate the trump taj mahal casino in atlantic city,new jersey.the casino employs employees,of whom are unionized.unite here local is the largest of the employee unions,representing employees.the most recent cba between the union and taj mahal was negotiated in for a term.it contained a duration provision titled term of contract that provided 
the collective bargaining agreement shall remain in effect until on september,and shall continue in full force and effect from year to year thereafter,unless either party serves sixty days written notice of its intention to terminate,modify,or amend the collective bargaining agreement.
in early,due to the casino deteriorating financial health the debtors attempted to negotiate a new agreement.specifically,on march,the debtors gave the union notice of their intention to terminate,modify or amend the cba and asked the union to begin negotiations for a new agreement.the union did not respond.on april,the debtors followed up on their request.on april,the union responded that while it is also anxious to commence bargaining,the union is simply not ready,some five months out from expiration of the cba,to commence negotiations but it would contact the debtors within the next several months.
on august,at the debtors request,the union met with the debtors to discuss terms for a new agreement.although the debtors emphasized their critical financial situation,the union was not receptive to negotiations.on august,the debtors proposed modifications to the cba,including replacing the pension contributions with a k program,and replacing the health and welfare program with subsidized coverage under the affordable care act.the union responded that it was prepared to work with the debtors on workers pensions,but not on the health and welfare proposal.no agreement was reached.
on september,the debtors filed for chapter bankruptcy protection.on september,the debtors asked the union to extend the term of the cba,but the union refused,unless the debtors agreed to terminate the extension upon the filing of a motion.it is undisputed that,with no new agreement in place and with the debtors having served notice to modify the agreement,the cba expired on september.
on september,the debtors sent the union a proposal with supporting documentation to demonstrate the debtors dire financial condition,and requested to meet on any day and at any place within the next seven days.the union proposed to meet on september,for the first bargaining session.after the meeting on september,the union requested additional information,which the debtors promptly provided.two days later,the union sent a to the debtors,which consisted largely of more information requests.also on september,the debtors filed a motion pursuant to seeking to reject the cba and implement the terms of the debtors last proposal to the union.the debtors asserted that rejection of the cba was necessary to their reorganization based on a business plan,which anticipated concessions from the first lien lenders,local and state authorities,and the union.
on october,following evidentiary hearings,the bankruptcy court granted the debtors motion to reject the expired cba and authorized the debtors to implement their last proposal.
in granting the debtors motion,the bankruptcy court addressed three issues.first,the court considered whether it had the authority to grant the motion to reject the cba,given that the cba had expired after the debtors filed for bankruptcy but before the debtors filed the rejection motion.the court concluded that permits rejection of expired cbas,reasoning that is not limited to unexpired or executory cbas.the court observed that,in passing as a whole,congress recognized the need for an expedited process by which debtors could restructure labor obligations and provided several checks to protect union employees the court could not discern a reason for distinguishing between expired and unexpired cbas because granting the union the power to delay the bankruptcy process would subvert the policy and bargaining power balances congress struck in section.
having decided that encompasses expired cbas,the bankruptcy court determined that the debtors satisfied the requirements of.specifically,the court found that the debtors proposal provided for those necessary modifications that are necessary to permit the reorganization of the debtor that the union rejected the proposal without good cause and that the balance of the equities clearly favored rejection of the cba the bankruptcy court noted that,based on uncontroverted evidence at the hearing,the debtors would be forced to close the casino and liquidate if the requested relief were not granted the bankruptcy court also expressed concern that while the debtors were imploring the union to engage with them in discussions,offering to meet,the union was engaging in picketing,a program of misinformation and,most egregiously,communicating with customers who had scheduled conferences at the casino to urge them to take their business elsewhere.it was clear to the bankruptcy court that the union was not focusing its efforts on negotiating to reach agreement with debtors.
finally,the bankruptcy court determined that,under,it could authorize the debtors to modify the expired cba and implement the terms of debtor proposal.the court observed that the text of did not explicitly grant the court authority to implement the proposed terms,but the reasoned view is that a debtor in possession is authorized to implement changes to the terms and conditions of employment that were included in the section proposals approved by the bankruptcy court.
the parties petitioned this court for direct appeal which we granted on december.the union challenges only the first issue addressed by the bankruptcy court,whether a bankruptcy court may grant a motion to reject an expired cba under 
the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction under b and a we have jurisdiction under d a.we review the bankruptcy court legal determinations de novo 
the question before us is whether authorizes a chapter debtor to reject the continuing terms and conditions of a cba after its expiration.two statutory schemes are at issue the nlra and chapter of the bankruptcy code.we read these two statutory frameworks seriatim,and assume that congress passed each subsequent law with full knowledge of the existing legal landscape 
our role in interpreting a statute is to give effect to congress intent because we presume that congress expresses its intent through the ordinary meaning of its language,we begin our analysis by examining the plain language of the statute when statutory language is plain,the sole function of the courts at least where the disposition required by the text is not absurd is to enforce it according to its terms.
bankruptcy courts are divided on whether permits debtors to reject expired cbas but a mere divergence in statutory construction does not render ambiguous instead,we must determine whether is ambiguous by examining the language itself,the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.specifically,in interpreting the bankruptcy code,the supreme court has been reluctant to declare its provisions ambiguous,preferring instead to take a broader,contextual view,and urging courts to not be guided by a single sentence or member of a sentence,but look to the provisions of the whole law,and to its object and policy.a provision is ambiguous,when,despite a studied examination of the statutory context,the natural reading of a provision remains elusive.in that case,and as a last resort,we turn to practice and legislative history to find meaning 
section of the bankruptcy code governs the means by which a debtor may assume,reject,or modify a cba.it establishes an expedited negotiation process for modifying a cba and allows for judicial evaluation of a petition to reject a cba if negotiations are unsuccessful.specifically,provides that a debtor may reject a collective bargaining agreement if the bankruptcy court determines that the debtor has ma de a proposal to its employees which provides for those necessary modifications in the employees benefits and protections that are necessary to permit the reorganization,the authorized representative of the employees has refused to accept such proposal without good cause,and the balance of the equities clearly favors rejection of such agreement.section explicitly forbids debtors from terminat ing or alter ing any provisions of a collective bargaining agreement prior to compliance with the provisions of 
the union argues that the plain meaning of a collective bargaining agreement is a contract between an employer and a labor union.therefore,because the cba has expired,there is no contract to be rejected under.the union further contends that debtors are required to bargain to impasse before making any changes to the key terms and conditions of the expired cba.the union position is based on the nlra requirement that o nce a collective bargaining relationship has been established,an employer may not make a change affecting the mandatory bargaining subjects without affording the union the opportunity to bargain over the change.even when a cba expires,the employer must maintain the status quo with respect to mandatory subjects of bargaining until it either enters into a new contract or bargains to impasse 
while prescribes a process for rejection of a collective bargaining agreement,it does not mention the continuing obligations imposed by the nlra.however,neither does it restrict its prescription to executory or unexpired cbas following the lead of the supreme court to take a broad,contextual view of the bankruptcy code,we will not embark,as the parties do,on a parsing of the words and phrases that comprise or focus on a meaning that may seem plain when considered in isolation.we will turn instead to the situation in which was enacted and examine the provision in the context of the bankruptcy code as a whole 
section was a product of the organized labor movement push to overturn the supreme court decision in national labor relations board bildisco bildisco there,the supreme court addressed what standard governed rejection of cbas in bankruptcy.the court first held that cbas were executory contracts under of the bankruptcy code,and could therefore be rejected under if the debtor showed that they burden ed the estate,and the equities balance d in favor of rejecting the labor contract s.in recognizing national labor policy,the court included a bargaining component in the process of rejection,requiring an employer to make reasonable efforts to negotiate a voluntary modification of the cba before acting on a petition to modify or reject a cba this first holding of bildisco establishing the standard for rejecting a cba was unanimous.
the court then addressed whether the debtor noncompliance with the cba after filing for bankruptcy but before contract rejection constituted an unfair labor practice.justice rehnquist,writing for the majority,found that from the filing of a petition in bankruptcy until formal acceptance,the cba is not an enforceable contract within the meaning of nlra d.thus,it was not an unfair labor practice for an employer to unilaterally change the terms of a cba after filing for bankruptcy but before the court approved rejection justice rehnquist reasoned that the trustee was empowered by virtue of the bankruptcy code to deal with its contracts and property in a manner it could not have employed absent a bankruptcy filing.a rule,requiring trustees to adhere to a cba terms after filing,would run directly counter to the express provisions of the bankruptcy code and to the code overall effort to give the some flexibility and breathing space.he noted 
the fundamental purpose of reorganization is to prevent a debtor from going into liquidation,with an attendant loss of jobs and possible misuse of economic resources a beneficial recapitalization could be jeopardized if the were saddled automatically with the debtor prior agreement.thus,the authority to reject an executory contract is vital to the basic purpose to a chapter reorganization,because rejection can release the debtor estate from burdensome obligations that can impede a successful reorganization 
in response to bildisco,congress passed to overturn the second part of bildisco holding and prohibit unilateral changes in debtors cbas without bankruptcy court approval in crafting the stringent requirements of,congress was focused on preventing employers from terminating negotiated labor contracts and avoiding burdensome obligations to employees merely by entering bankruptcy 
as enacted,balances the concerns of debtors in avoiding liquidation and the unions goals of preserving labor agreements and maintaining influence in the reorganization process.unlike,which does not constrain a debtor rejection of burdensome executory contracts,prescribes strict procedural and substantive requirements before a cba can be rejected.specifically,before the bankruptcy court will consider an application to reject,the debtor must make a proposal,provide relevant information,meet at reasonable times,and confer in good faith.the debtor modifications must be necessary to permit reorganization and must treat all creditors,the debtor,and all affected parties fairly and equitably.the balance of equities must clearly favor rejection of the cba.the language of was designed to foreclose all but the essential modifications of the working conditions integral to a successful reorganization in other words,by requiring compliance with the stringent provisions of,congress sought to ensure that,when the nlra yields to the bankruptcy code,it does so only for reasons that will permit the debtor to stay in business 
this case exemplifies the process that congress intended.rejection of the debtors continuing labor obligations,as defined by the expired cba,is necessary to permit the debtors reorganization indeed it is essential to the debtors survival.as the bankruptcy court repeatedly emphasized,the debtors financial situation is desperate.not only are their losses large,but they have been unable to obtain debtor in possession financing for their bankruptcy cases and are operating with cash collateral.debtors cash will run out in less than two months.the debtors expert,whom the bankruptcy court found highly credible,testified that the 
debtors must have relief from the cba without which they can not avoid closing the casino and liquidating their businesses t he situation is so grim that without the court granting the motion and debtors obtaining other concessions,debtors would have to give notice to the new jersey department of gaming enforcement not later than october,that taj mahal will close the casino 
the debtors sold assets and closed one of their casinos,the trump plaza hotel and casino,to raise cash and reduce their obligations.as of september,the debtors working capital cash was approximately million,and its secured debt was approximately million.under the relevant terms of the cba,however,the debtors were required to make more than million per year in pension contributions,and to million per year in health and welfare contributions.after the cba expired,the debtors were required to sustain those payments at the same levels.to avoid liquidation,the debtors moved to reject the cba.their proposal to the union included annual savings of approximately million per year in pension contributions,million in health and welfare contributions,and million in work rule changes,including elimination of paid meal times.instead of negotiating with the debtors,the union stalled the bargaining sessions,engaged in picketing,and attempted to harm the debtors business 
notably,the debtors plan of reorganization is contingent on rejection of the cba,the obtaining of tax relief,the conversion of the first lien secured creditor debt to equity,and a capital infusion of million from the first lien secured creditor.the first lien secured creditor has made it clear that it will perform only if the cba and tax relief contingencies are achieved because the business will not succeed without the relief.a successful reorganization,therefore,depends on the rejection of the terms that the debtors are required to maintain under the nlra.
the union recognizes that the debtors are bound by the terms and conditions of the expired cba by virtue of their obligation to maintain the status quo.nevertheless,the union argues that those obligations are entirely distinct from the parties voluntarily assumed contractual obligation to honor their cba prior to its expiration.the union relies on laborers health welfare trust fund for northern california advanced lightweight concrete company this case involved the withdrawal of an employer from a multiemployer pension fund and the employer subsequent failure to make payments to the fund as required by the expired cba.the trustee of the fund brought suit in federal court to enforce the terms of the expired cba.the supreme court distinguished an employer obligation to make contributions to such a pension fund pursuant to the terms of a cba from an employer continuing obligation under the nlra to make contributions.the court held that,because an employer contractual duty to make multiemployer pension fund contributions does not survive the cba expiration,the employer failure to make contributions does not constitute a violation of of erisa the court concluded that was intended to cover only obligations arising under the cba.to seek contributions from an employer after the expiration of the cba,the trustee would have to go before the nlrb to obtain a remedy in a proceeding before that body the district court did not have jurisdiction to hear the claim.
the court in laborers health found congress intent in enacting was clear the court added that there were three countervailing policy arguments to support its decision that the reach of was deliberate rather than inadvertent.first,if there is a gap in the enforcement scheme to enforce contributions to multiemployer funds,its incidence is unknown and,since it has not been called to the attention of congress,it may not be a problem of serious magnitude.second,the issues to be decided in a dispute over an employer failure to make fund contributions are more complex when the refusal is rather than a simple collection action during the life of the cba third,a violation of the duty to bargain in good faith is a labor law matter and is better decided by the nlrb than by a district court 
conversely,we find the intent of congress here also to be clear but that intent was to incorporate expired cbas in the language of.our review of the decision in laborers health demonstrates to us that the three countervailing policy arguments in laborers health support our decision here.as we noted above,was enacted to balance the needs of debtors in avoiding liquidation and the unions needs in preserving labor agreements and safeguarding employment for their members.section meets a gap in the schemes to permit reorganizations when labor obligations will prevent the success of a reorganization.the number of cases cited in footnote supra demonstrate this gap.section was enacted to ensure that relief from a cba was granted only in situations where relief was necessary to permit the reorganization.it is a counter to the precedent in bildisco which permitted modification of a cba without close scrutiny by the bankruptcy court.under,approval will be granted only if the debtor modifications are necessary to permit reorganization.in this context,when the employer statutory obligations to maintain the status quo under the terms of an expired cba will undermine the debtor ability to reorganize and remain in business,it is the expertise of the bankruptcy court which is needed rather than that of the nlrb.for that reason,whether the cba is in effect or is expired,it is the bankruptcy court which should make the review and decide on the necessity of the modification.we conclude,therefore,that applies to a cba after it has expired.
the union contends,however,that because a debtor may not assume or reject an expired executory contract under,it may not reject an expired cba under.this argument ignores an important distinction between a cba and any other executory contract the key terms and conditions of a cba continue to burden the debtor after the agreement expiration.rejection of those terms,therefore,is not a moot issue as would be in the case of other contracts or leases.
to hold that a debtor may reject an expired cba or its continuing obligations as defined by the expired cba is also consistent with the purpose of the bankruptcy code,which gives debtors latitude to restructure their affairs a chapter reorganization provides a debtor with an opportunity to reduce or extend its debts so its business can achieve longterm viability,for instance,by generating profits which will compensate creditors for some or all of any losses resulting from the bankruptcy.congress has recognized that i t is more economically efficient to reorganize rather than to liquidate,because it preserves jobs and assets.similarly,we have held that t he policy behind chapter of the bankruptcy code is the ultimate rehabilitation of the debtor.as the bankruptcy court recognized,i n many cases,time is the enemy of a successful restructuring and the rejection process is a much quicker process than the relatively protracted process contemplated by the nlra.
section furthers the code rehabilitative policies by permitting debtors to restructure their labor obligations.a contrary holding,that does not allow a debtor to reject expired cbas or its ongoing obligations,would impede that overriding goal whether by force of contract or by operation of the nlra,the debtors here were bound by the key terms of the expired cba.but those terms burdened the estate so as to preclude a successful reorganization.just because the debtors filed the motion one week after the cba expired,they should not be bound by the expired agreement burdensome terms until the parties negotiate to impasse.that interpretation of the statute would undercut the rehabilitative function of chapter 
under the policies of bankruptcy law,it is preferable to preserve jobs through a rejection of a cba,as opposed to losing the positions permanently by requiring the debtor to comply with the continuing obligations set out by the cba.moreover,it is essential that the bankruptcy court be afforded the opportunity to evaluate those conditions that can detrimentally affect the life of a debtor,whether such encumbrances attach by operation of contract or a complex statutory framework.in light of chapter overarching purposes and the exigencies that the debtors faced,we conclude that the bankruptcy court did not err in granting the debtors motion.
for the reasons set forth a
