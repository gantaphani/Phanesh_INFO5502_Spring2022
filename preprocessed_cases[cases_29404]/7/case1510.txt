the bankruptcy code confers a right to be heard with respect to any issue in a case under chapter on any party in interest.b.we have previously held that status is a necessary prerequisite to bankruptcy standing.in re thorpe insulation,cir.in this case,we consider whether a beneficiary of a trust who disagrees with the way the trust was administered by former trustees is a party in interest with standing to object to the bankruptcy court approval of a settlement agreement between a debtor,creditor entities held by the trust,and the former trustees we hold that the trust beneficiary does not have standing under a to object to the settlement,at least where his interests are adequately represented by a trustee.we thus affirm the judgment of the district court dismissing this case for lack of standing.
a.the facts 
appellant alexander hughes hughes is the only son of mark hughes,the founder of herbalife who passed away in,and is the sole,beneficiary of the mark hughes family trust trust.mark hughes estate had an estimated worth of over million at the time of his death,and the bulk of his estate was placed in the trust.see hughes klein,wl,at,unpublished.the trust principal must remain in the trust,per mark hughes instructions,until alexander turns in.id.before his death,mark hughes named three successor trustees to the trust conrad lee klein,christopher pair,and jack reynolds.id.once they assumed responsibility for the trust,the trustees agreed that klein would act as the lead,trustee and manager of the trust various corporate holdings.id.the trust owns two llc relevant here hughes investment partnership,llc hip and mh holdings ii h,llc mh ii together,the hughes entities.virtually all of the trust assets are held either by one of the hughes entities or another llc owned by the trust.
at the time of mark hughes death,mh ii owned a real property asset called tower grove a acre undeveloped residential property located on a hill overlooking beverly hills,california.in,the trustees authorized the sale of the tower grove property to tower park properties,llc tower park,the debtor and appellee.notably,the sale was entirely mh ii loaned tower park the million required to purchase the property.hip advanced additional funding to tower park for the purpose of developing tower grove.through that transaction,mh ii and hip became the two largest secured creditors of tower park 
bankruptcy court proceedings 
tower park soon defaulted on its obligations and,in july,filed for chapter bankruptcy.as of,hip and mh ii aggregate claims,which included the purchase,construction,and development financing plus interest,amounted to approximately million.tower park proposed plan of reorganization restructured the hughes entities loans,modifying the interest rates and conditionally reducing the principal balance on certain loans.the proposed plan further provided that hip would provide tower park with million in exit financing.the bankruptcy court entered an order confirming tower park chapter plan in april.after the confirmation of the plan,however,disputes arose between the trustees,the hughes entities,and tower park over the implementation of the plan provisions.for two years,the parties litigated various disputes in bankruptcy court and,in at least one adversary proceeding,tower park named klein individually as a defendant,alleging various claims of personal misconduct.
consequently,tower park entered into negotiations with the trustees and hughes entities to settle the disputes.after six weeks of negotiations and two mediation sessions,tower park and its various associated entities entered into a settlement agreement with hip,mh ii,conrad klein individually and as trustee,and jack reynolds individually and as trustee the agreement was signed in early january.the day after the agreement was signed,tower park filed a motion seeking bankruptcy court approval of the agreement.see fed.a on motion by the trustee and after notice and a hearing,the court may approve a compromise or settlement.tower park requested and received an expedited hearing date,which the court set for later that month.
meanwhile,hughes had just completed a several months long trial in california probate court concerning a petition he had filed back in to remove the three trustees.the petition alleged that each of the trustees had committed various breaches of fiduciary duty with respect to the sale of tower grove and other trust management decisions.the parties were still awaiting a final decision by the probate court when tower park filed its motion for approval of the settlement agreement.six days after the agreement was filed,hughes filed an ex parte application with the probate court seeking the immediate suspension of the trustees and the appointment of a successor trustee.the probate court granted the motion the same day.in place of the trustees,the probate court appointed fiduciary trust international of california ftic as trustee ad litem.the court ordered ftic to analyze and independently determine whether the settlement is proper and in the best interests of the trust,and take whatever action is necessary and appropriate to promote or forestall approval of the settlement.
the day after the probate court suspended the trustees,hughes filed an objection to the settlement agreement with the bankruptcy court.he asked the bankruptcy court to take judicial notice of the pending probate court proceedings,including his petition for removal in probate court,ex parte application,and the probate court grant of immediate suspension of the powers.based on his concerns about the trustees potential breach of trust,hughes contended that the agreement was not negotiated in good faith and constituted an impermissible modification of a substantially consummated plan,prohibited under b of the bankruptcy code.specifically,hughes observed that under the proposed agreement,hip and mh ii agreed to accept a discounted payoff amount of million in full satisfaction of the tower park obligations under its loans,if approved by the bankruptcy court and paid by a certain date.the agreement acknowledged that as of december,the total outstanding balance on the hughes entities loans had risen to approximately million.the discounted payoff amount of million thus equaled a million or reduction of tower park debt.pointing to his removal petition,hughes contended that the trustees agreed to the agreement massive,reduction of the debt in exchange for personal gain million in cash and broad personal releases,not subject to court approval,to avoid the prospect of having to defend and settle the claims using their personal funds after they are removed as trustee s of the hughes trust.based on these objections,hughes asked the bankruptcy court to deny approval of the agreement,or,in the alternative,hold the matter in abeyance to allow the trustee ad litem appointed just the day before adequate time to review the agreement.
ftic filed a limited joinder to hughes objection,joining only the portion requesting abeyance of the approval motion to enable ftic to review and independently determine whether the agreement is proper and in the best interests of the trust.
on january,tower park filed a reply opposing hughes objection and ftic limited joinder on the grounds that both hughes and ftic lacked standing to object to the settlement agreement.tower park argued that hughes status as beneficiary of the trust does not confer standing to object.additionally,it contended,ftic lacked standing because it represents the trust,and the trust was not a party to the settlement agreement.tower park further argued that the settlement meets the rule criteria,offers benefits to the estate,does not constitute an impermissible plan modification,and was negotiated in good faith under the mediator guidance.hughes did not file a response to tower park reply.
in late january,the bankruptcy court held its scheduled hearing on the approval of the settlement agreement.the debtor argued that the settlement is great for the estate,discounting the debt by over million.but the main thing,the debtor explained,is that the litigation goes away.there finality,there certainty,and we can move forward with developing the property and getting the lender paid knowing what the amount is.counsel for hughes explained his reasons for objecting to the settlement and argued that hughes had standing to object because,among other reasons,he would be financially impacted by the settlement as the sole,beneficiary of the trust.ftic also defended its standing to object and explained that it needed more time to fulfill its mandate from the probate court to independently assess the benefits of the agreement for the trust.while unable to take a position on the propriety of the former trustees actions at the time of the hearing,ftic made clear that it intended to investigate and determine whether the acted outside the bounds of their fiduciary obligations,and take appropriate action.
at the close of the hearing,the bankruptcy court stated that it would approve the settlement.although the settlement troubled the court,it was not an improper modification and it clearly benefited the estate.the court also concluded that hughes and ftic had standing a lthough i have questions about it,i think from my standpoint that you have standing.it a close question,but i think that they have standing.later on,the court acknowledged that standing is a tricky little question,but explained that i always like to give the benefit of the doubt to people that have standing.with that explanation,the court issued its order granting tower park motion to approve the settlement agreement and overruling hughes objection.
in march,after the settlement agreement was finalized,the probate court issued its final decision regarding the removal of the.the court found that the trustees breached their duty to act with prudence,skill and diligence when,among other things,they sold tower grove to tower park.the court explained that the tower park principal to whom the entrusted the development of tower grove had no formal education in real estate,property management,real estate financing,and no professional licenses or certifications.consistent with its prior ruling,the court ordered the removed from their duties and retained ftic in place as the interim trustee ad litem.the probate court decision was recently affirmed by the california court of appeal.see hughes klein,wl,at,unpublished.
district court proceedings 
in february,hughes and ftic took separate appeals to the district court for the central district of california to challenge the bankruptcy court approval of the settlement.the district court dismissed hughes appeal for lack of bankruptcy standing,principally because it concluded that hughes was not a party in interest as required under the bankruptcy code.quoting the second circuit decision in in re refco,cir,the court explained that b ankruptcy court is a forum where creditors and debtors can settle their disputes with each other,and it would be unfair to allow what is essentially a dispute between alex hughes and the hughes trust trustees about whether the settlement is too good for tower park to obstruct tower park speedy and efficient reorganization.the court noted that hughes also had alternative forums available to resolve his dispute with the trustees,and indeed,had been using them since,he has been litigating in probate court a petition to remove the hughes trust trustees for alleged self dealing and breaches of fiduciary duties.in sum,the court concluded,hughes stake is too remote,and allowing such remote parties to participate would unduly obstruct the bankruptcy with collateral issues.after holding that hughes lacked status,the court analyzed hughes article iii standing and found that he had none.the district court thus declined to address whether hughes had prudential standing.accordingly,the court dismissed hughes appeal for lack of standing.hughes timely appealed.
although the district court dismissed hughes appeal for lack of standing,it did not dismiss the appeal taken by ftic.at present,ftic continues to litigate before the district court.in fact,ftic has taken the position that the conditional provisions became null and void when hughes appeal to the district court prevented the agreement from becoming final by the deadline,february.
the question before us is whether hughes has standing such that he possesses a right to be heard on his objection to the settlement agreement.the bankruptcy court thought the issue close and tricky,but granted hughes standing and ruled against him on the merits.the district court,however,dismissed his appeal on the grounds that he lacked standing in the bankruptcy court.hughes has standing to appeal the district court decision,so the question presented is one of bankruptcy standing.in re thorpe insulation,cir.
in order to have standing in bankruptcy court,hughes must satisfy three requirements.first,he must satisfy the statutory requirements of the bankruptcy code and qualify as a party in interest under b.second,because he seeks standing in federal court,he must satisfy the constitutional minimum required by article iii.third,he must meet federal court prudential standing requirements.thorpe,at.the district court concluded that hughes satisfied neither the party in interest nor the article iii requirements of the bankruptcy standing test,and declined to reach the prudential standing requirement 
we first address whether hughes is a party in interest.hughes advances two arguments.he claims that he is a party in interest because of his future financial stake in the trust,which holds corporations that are parties to the settlement.hughes also argues that he is a party in interest because,under california law,he has a cause of action against tower park for its complicity in the trustees breach of their fiduciary duty.because we conclude that neither rationale supports the conclusion that hughes is a party in interest for purposes of,we decline to address article iii and prudential standing requirements.
hughes financial stake is insufficient to confer party in interest status 
we turn to the question whether hughes is a party in interest,as required for bankruptcy standing.section b of the bankruptcy code governs the right to be heard in chapter proceedings 
a party in interest,including the debtor,the trustee,a creditors committee,an equity security holder committee,a creditor,an equity security holder,or any indenture trustee,may raise and may appear and be heard on any issue in a case under this chapter.
b emphasis added.the bankruptcy code does not define the term party in interest except operationally section b supplies us with a list of parties who must be considered parties in interest.because the list of parties is preceded by the word including,the list is illustrative,and not exhaustive.we have observed that the standard has generally been construed broadly,and that c ourts must determine on a case by case basis whether the prospective party has a sufficient stake in the proceedings so as to require representation.thorpe,at quoting in re amatex,cir.at the same time,we have also recognized that our sister circuits have not interpreted party in interest to mean anyone who might be affected by the bankruptcy proceedings rather,a party in interest is one who has a legally protected interest that could be affected by a bankruptcy proceeding.id.quoting in re james wilson,cir emphasis added see also in re global indus,cir thus,an entity that may suffer collateral damage but does not have a legally protected interest does not have standing under b.in re hall,cir.such interests are too remote to entitle the entity to intervene in a bankruptcy case.see collier on bankruptcy the general theory behind the section is that anyone holding a direct financial stake in the outcome of the case should have an opportunity to participate in the adjudication of any issue that may ultimately shape the disposition of his or her interest.
both parties agree that hughes does not fall under any of the categories of parties in interest listed in b.they disagree over whether hughes has a legally protected interest in the settlement approval proceedings such that he constitutes a party in interest under the bankruptcy code.hughes argues that he has a legally protected interest because any loss borne by the hughes entities as a result of the settlement will create a loss for the trust,which will,in turn,create a loss for hughes.by contrast,tower park contends that hughes interest in the trust assets is too remote,and that allowing trust beneficiaries to participate would clutter the bankruptcy proceeding with collateral issues.while we have not previously addressed whether a trust beneficiary has bankruptcy standing to object to a settlement that may detrimentally affect trust assets,a comparison of our decision in thorpe,with the second circuit decision in in re refco,cir,is instructive.
in thorpe,we considered whether certain insurers of a debtor had standing to object to the debtor chapter reorganization plan.at.the debtor,thorpe insulation company,faced substantial liability and thus filed a plan of reorganization under g,a provision of the bankruptcy code specially enacted to deal with asbestos claims.id.at.as required under g,thorpe established a trust for the primary purpose of distributing funds to present and future holders of asbestos claims.id.at.thorpe also reached settlements with thirteen of its insurers,which together agreed to provide more than million in assets to fund the trust.id.at.in exchange,the settling insurers sought protection under g sheltering mechanism an injunction,issued upon plan confirmation,designed to channel claims to the trust.id.the resulting plan permitted asbestos claimants to either bring their claims against the trust or get permission from the trust to sue the insurers who had not settled with the debtor.id.at.the insurers objected to the plan,and the bankruptcy court dismissed their objection for lack of standing.id.at.
we concluded that the insurers were parties in interest because the plan directly affected their legal interests.we identified two interests relevant here.first,we determined that the insurers might be bound by the trust determination of liability.thus,the trust actions would have preclusive effect on the insurers.id.at in re teligent,cir because entity lacked standing to challenge the settlement in bankruptcy court,it was not estopped from asserting a defense challenging the validity of the agreement in another forum.second,the settlement affected the insurers rights to recover costs against settling insurers,and cost recovery had previously been negotiated in a contract between the two groups of insurers.thorpe,at.the insurers reasonably complain ed that if they lacked standing to challenge the bankruptcy plan,which increased their liabilities,they might be bound by the plan valuation of particular insurance claims even though they were not permitted to participate in establishing the valuation matrix and could not challenge it.id.at 
in refco,the second circuit considered whether investors were parties in interest with standing to object to an allegedly fraudulent settlement between their company and the debtor company.at.in that case,approximately million worth of investment funds belonging to sphinx,an investment management company,were transferred from refco capital markets,rcm where the funds had previously been invested to accounts held on sphinx behalf at lehman brothers.id.at.five days after the transfer,refco,and its rcm affiliate filed for chapter bankruptcy.id.at.rcm creditors sued sphinx,complaining that sphinx had effected a preferential transfer and demanding a return of the funds to the rcm estate.id.at.sphinx and rcm creditors eventually reached a settlement in which sphinx agreed to return million to the rcm estate and waive any claim against rcm related to the transfer,including its right to file a claim against rcm estate.rcm filed a motion,seeking bankruptcy court approval of the settlement.id.at.sphinx investors objected,arguing that the settlement was the product of collusion and fraud,and pointed to evidence suggesting that sphinx directors had acted ultra vires in agreeing to the settlement.id.at.the bankruptcy court found that the investors lacked standing to object and approved the settlement.id.at.
on appeal,the investors argued that the settlement would cost them tens of millions of dollars,imposing a direct,pecuniary harm.id.at.in the alternative,the investors contended that when the sphinx directors breached their fiduciary duty by entering into a fraudulent settlement,the funds became the res of a constructive trust,of which the investors were the beneficiaries.because they held a constructive trust over the funds used in the settlement,they argued,they had standing under the test.id.
the second circuit disagreed with the investors arguments.it concluded that standing does not extend to those seeking to assert rights that are purely derivative of another party rights,and here,the investors could not claim to enforce any rights distinct from those of sphinx.id.at.the court reasoned that,b y investing in sphinx,investors placed control of their funds entirely within the hands of the sphinx directors only sphinx,not individual investors,or even investors as a group,could assert a claim against the refco estate,and only sphinx was permitted to negotiate a settlement id.therefore,investors maintain a financial interest in sphinx,but they are not a party in interest within the meaning of the bankruptcy code.id.
with respect to the investors allegations of breach,the court acknowledged that i t may be that the sphinx directors violated their fiduciary duties by entering into a settlement that was not in the best interests of investors.id.at.but the court concluded that the bankruptcy court was not the appropriate forum in which to resolve such a dispute bankruptcy court is a forum where creditors and debtors can settle their disputes with each other.any internal dispute between a creditor and that creditor investors belongs elsewhere.id.at emphasis in original.permitting too many peripheral parties status as parties in interest thwarts the traditional purpose of bankruptcy laws which is to provide reasonably expeditious rehabilitation of financially distressed debtors with a consequent distribution to creditors who have acted diligently.id.quoting in re ionosphere clubs.thus,the court concluded,permitting the investors to enter the bankruptcy plan confirmation process and attempt to prove the litany of wrongs allegedly wrought by the officers and directors of sphinx upon investors claims,the court noted,the investors could file elsewhere would cause a substantial delay in the refco bankruptcy proceeding and would not be countenanced.id.at.
applying refco and thorpe to the facts of this case,we conclude that hughes financial stake in the trust assets does not make him a party in interest within the meaning of b.the california court of appeal has explained that a trust beneficiary has no legal title or ownership interest in the trust assets,and as such,in civil lawsuits,a trust beneficiary right to sue is ordinarily limited to the enforcement of the trust,according to its terms.saks damon raike,th,d.in general,therefore,a trust beneficiary is not the entity positioned to take legal recourse to protect the trust assets,unless the beneficiary is seeking only to enforce the terms of the trust.here,hughes objection to the settlement agreement is not an action to enforce the terms of the trust.nor has hughes suggested that his interest in the trust assets is somehow different from that of an ordinary trust beneficiary.indeed,the record shows that the hughes entities and other llc own the vast majority of assets in the trust,including all the debt owed the trust by tower park.hughes has not claimed any direct ownership interest in the trust assets,nor any legal entitlement to control or manage those assets at this time.he does not,as we held in thorpe,have a legally protected interest in the settlement itself.
hughes interest in the settlement is therefore distinct from that of the insurers in thorpe.whereas the insurers demonstrated that the proposed plan directly interfered with their legal rights and financial liabilities,hughes makes no such showing rather,the financial inter
