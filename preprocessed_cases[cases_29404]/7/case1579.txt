this case involves a bankruptcy appeal.appellant jack tramiel,a member of the jts corporation board of directors,attempted to assist the debtor,jts corporation jts,and purchased real property from jts.it was held that this purchase was a constructive fraudulent conveyance and that tramiel was liable for the value of the property.the major issues in this case are what the fair market value of the real property is,whether tramiel is entitled to an offset for the value he paid for the property as a good faith transferee,and whether tramiel is entitled to a credit for the amount that his codefendants paid in a settlement agreement.we have jurisdiction under d,and we affirm.
factual background 
in,jts corporation jts was formed to design,manufacture,and market hard disks for personal computers.by,after a contract with jts was terminated,jts needed additional working capital to continue.at that time,jts determined that it was not able to go public to acquire the additional funds that it needed and agreed to merge with atari corporation atari to obtain the funds.through the merger,jts received million in cash,million in intellectual property,eight separate real properties located in california and texas,and a million loan which jts hoped would carry it through september.in addition,tramiel,the defendant,who was the chairman of atari board of directors,was brought onto the jts board of directors.
since the funds acquired through the merger were only intended to carry jts through september,virginia walker,jts chief financial officer,began to search for additional capital.after walker failed to secure funds from several banks,she approached tramiel and suggested that he buy the eight separate real properties real property that jts would acquire as a result of the atari merger.in response,tramiel suggested that he buy the real property for million and permit jts to retain an option to repurchase the real property for the same million for one year.if jts exercised the option,tramiel would keep the greater of million or the rental income generated by the property for a period.
in june,jts board of directors approved the sale of the real property to tramiel and authorized walker to work with an attorney to implement the sale.evidence showed that the jts board believed that the real property sale to tramiel was the quickest way of raising the necessary funds to keep the company running and that the repurchase option would allow a year to regain the real property if it decided to do so.one director recalled a discussion that although jts might receive a greater price for the real property under other circumstances,in light of the immediate need for funds,tramiel offer was fair.tramiel removed himself from the boardroom and abstained from all voting during the sale discussions.
by july,jts debt exceeded its assets by million.in september,the real property sale closed.still struggling,jts liquidated other property acquired from the merger.despite these and other efforts,jts was unable to recover and in november,was forced into bankruptcy through an involuntary petition.later,jts filed a chapter petition,scheduling assets of million and liabilities of million.in,the case converted to chapter.
ii.procedural background 
in,the trustee,suzanne decker filed a complaint against jts directors including tramiel,its attorneys,and a shareholder,alleging fraudulent conveyance and other claims.in,tramiel,the attorney defendants and two members of the jts board of directors,reached a settlement with decker in which they agreed to pay the jts bankruptcy estate million.the bankruptcy court issued an order approving the settlement and trial proceeded against only tramiel.
in,the bankruptcy court held inter alia that the sale of the real property to tramiel was avoided as a constructive fraudulent conveyance under b of the bankruptcy code and california civil code.the bankruptcy court stated that under b a trustee may avoid transfers of a debtor property that would be avoidable under state law.under california civil code,a transfer is avoidable if the debtor completed the property transfer without receiving a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the property and the debtor intended to incur or believed or reasonably should have believed that it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay.in determining reasonably equivalent value,the bankruptcy court found that the fair market value of the eight separate real properties which tramiel bought from jts was if the properties had been individually exposed to the market for one year and sold separately.because the property was sold as a bundled portfolio and it was a quick sale,the court held that a reduction should apply for a quick sale and a reduction should apply for a bundled sale.thus,the bankruptcy court held that the reasonably equivalent value of the real property was.
the bankruptcy court determined that the value of the option to repurchase the real property was.the bankruptcy court stated that the value of the repurchase option is determined by subtracting the strike price of the repurchase option from the fair market value of the real property.the bankruptcy court held that the stated strike price,million,should be added to the loss of rental income for the real property for one year,which was,to equal a total strike price.the bankruptcy court subtracted the strike price of from the reasonably equivalent value of the real property,and held that the value of the repurchase option was.the bankruptcy court held that tramiel paid a total consideration of for the real property by adding the value of the repurchase option to the million purchase price.
in addition,the bankruptcy court held tramiel was a good faith transferee under california civil code d.the bankruptcy court determined that under california civil code a the ability of a trustee to avoid a transfer is subject to the limitations under california civil code.under d,a good faith transferee is entitled to a reduction in liability to the extent of the value given to the debtor.the bankruptcy court held that tramiel was a good faith transferee entitled to a reduction of the million consideration paid for the real property plus the value of the repurchase option.the bankruptcy court held that subtracting the good faith transferee reduction of from the reasonably equivalent value left tramiel with a liability of.after determining that tramiel was not entitled to a settlement credit,the bankruptcy court held that tramiel liability was plus interest.
tramiel filed a motion in bankruptcy court to amend the judgment in order to grant him a settlement credit under california civil procedure code.the bankruptcy court amended its judgment and held that tramiel was entitled to a settlement credit against his liability in the amount paid by the settling defendants to the bankrupt estate,million.because this settlement credit exceeded tramiel liability,the bankruptcy court held that decker could not recover any amount from tramiel.
on appeal,the district court affirmed in part and reversed in part the bankruptcy court judgment.the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court determination that tramiel was liable for constructive fraudulent conveyance under b and a.the district court held,however,that the fair market value of the real property was and the rents were,creating a total fair market value of for the real property.unlike the bankruptcy court,the district court concluded that the appropriate measure of liability is the fair market value.
the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court determination that tramiel was a good faith transferee under california civil code d and thus reduced his liability by,the million purchase price and value of the repurchase option.the district court subtracted from the fair market value of the real property,and held that tramiel liability was.
the district court reversed the bankruptcy court holding that tramiel was entitled to a settlement credit of the million paid by his.the district court held that under california civil procedure code,a settlement bars nonsettling defendants from seeking contribution from the settling defendants,but the nonsettling defendant liability may be reduced by the settlement amount if all of the defendants are joint tortfeasors.the district court held that tramiel was not a joint tortfeasor because there was no evidence that tramiel had requested a finding of joint liability the written settlement agreement between the codefendants and bankrupt estate allocated liability for each codefendant for certain torts and did not address the fraudulent conveyance and the written settlement agreement contained an integration clause,stating that the agreement was the complete expression of the parties intent.thus,the district court held that tramiel was liable for the fraudulent conveyance in the amount of.
iii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court decision on appeal from a bankruptcy court.in re greene,cir.we apply the same standard of review applied by the district court.id.we review a bankruptcy court decision independently and without deference to the district court decision.in re strand,cir.the bankruptcy court findings of fact are reviewed for clear error,while its conclusions of law are reviewed de novo.id.citing galam carmel in re larry,cir.we must accept the bankruptcy court findings of fact,unless the court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.greene,at.mixed questions of law and fact are reviewed de novo.in re chang,cir.
fraudulent conveyance value of real property 
tramiel argues that the district court erred when it determined with regard to the fraudulent conveyance claim that the value of the real property was its fair market value.under b of the bankruptcy code,a trustee may avoid any transfer of an interest of the debtor in property or any obligation incurred by the debtor that is voidable under applicable law.under california civil code a,a transfer is avoidable if the debtor made the transfer without receiving a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transfer and the debtor intended to incur,or believed or reasonably should have believed that it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay as they became due.reasonably equivalent value is the value of the property on the date of the transfer from the perspective of the creditors.in re prejean,cir in re fairchild aircraft,cir.courts may consider the fair market value or what would be the fairly equivalent value of the property,taking into consideration all of the specific circumstances of each case affecting the value of the asset.hansen cramer,cal bailey leeper.a finding of what constitutes the value of real property is a finding of fact which may be reversed only if it is shown that it was clearly erroneous.in re arnold,cir in re tuma,cir.
in this case,we conclude that the district court erred in holding that the fair market value which it fixed at was determinative.the bankruptcy court finding that the reasonably equivalent value was was not clearly erroneous.the bankruptcy court found that the fair market value of the property was without applying quick and bundled sale reductions.both parties experts agreed that would be the value of the property if it had been sold individually and exposed to the market for a year and that this was thus an appropriate starting point.the bankruptcy court then applied reductions of for a quick sale and for a bundled sale to the,reducing the fair market value to the reasonably equivalent value.this was not clearly erroneous.evidence showed that jts wanted immediate cash and was willing to take a reduced price for the real property to obtain the funds quickly.jts wanted a quick and bundled sale and even decker expert agreed that reductions for a quick and bundled sale were proper if a seller required those terms.for a bundled sale,tramiel expert testified that a to reduction was proper and decker expert testified that a reduction was proper.the bankruptcy court found tramiel expert more persuasive and imposed the lowest percentage that he recommended.for a quick sale,decker expert testified that if a discount was applied that he would apply per month,a total of five percent.the bankruptcy court applied this percentage.no evidence shows that the bankruptcy court reasonably equivalent value determination of was clearly erroneous.accordingly,we disagree with the district court determination based entirely on fair market value,and affirm the bankruptcy court reasonably equivalent value determination.in re tuma,at holding bankruptcy judge determination was not clearly erroneous even though there were many different methods of determining value sammons comm r,cir holding court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting certain appraisals regarding valuation anderson city of bessemer city,stating if there are two views of the evidence,a court choice between them is not clearly erroneous.accordingly,we hold,as the bankruptcy court held,that the reasonably equivalent value of the real property was.
the bankruptcy court also did not clearly err in determining that the fair market value of the repurchase option was.the question of whether jts received a reasonably equivalent value also turns on the value of the repurchase option that tramiel gave to jts.tramiel expert correctly testified that the value of the repurchase option was the difference between the reasonably equivalent value of the property and the fixed strike price.see in re calvillo.here,the bankruptcy court properly concluded that the strike price was million plus for rents,for a total of.subtracting that total from the reasonably equivalent value of equaled a total of for the value of the repurchase option.because there is no evidence that this determination was clearly erroneous,the bankruptcy court properly found that the value of the repurchase option was.
good faith transferee 
decker argues that the bankruptcy and district courts erred by holding that tramiel was a good faith transferee under california civil code d and reducing his liability by the value he paid for the property.decker argues that b and a claims are only subject to state laws that determine voidability.decker argues that d does not determine voidability and is therefore inapplicable to b and a claims.
sections and of the bankruptcy code 
under b and a of the bankruptcy code,a trustee may avoid a fraudulent transfer of property if that transfer is voidable under applicable state law.in re united energy,cir.fraudulent transfer law has been a part of relations since collier on bankruptcy a,b at,alan resnick henry sommer ed.such laws were enacted to allow a creditor to avoid an improper transaction by a debtor who attempts to unjustly reduce assets and avoid his creditors claims.id.prior to,however,federal bankruptcy law only addressed a small number of fraudulent transfer cases in which there was actual intent to defraud and the transfer occurred within four months of the bankruptcy.id.at.in,congress enacted amendments to the chandler act and fully absorbed fraudulent transfer laws into federal bankruptcy law.id.these amendments brought the full panoply of fraudulent transfer law into federal law,including the ability to avoid constructively fraudulent transfers.id.given the elemental nature of fraudulent transfer law,however,there was no preemption of states intended,and states as well as the federal government continued to adapt parts of fraudulent transfer law for their own purposes.id.at.
sections and of the bankruptcy code were enacted by congress to allow a trustee the option of avoiding a fraudulent transfer under either state law or federal law.section was adopted in.section allows a trustee to avoid a transfer if it is made within two years of filing a bankruptcy petition and the debtor either had actual intent to defraud or received less than reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transfer.a a,b.subsection c of provides that a trustee recovery may be reduced by the value given for the transfer if the transferee made the transfer in good faith.
in,of the bankruptcy code was enacted in recognition of the growth of state fraudulent transfer laws.collier on bankruptcy at.section enables a bankruptcy trustee to avoid any transfer of property that an unsecured creditor with an allowable claim could have avoided under applicable state law.b alan resnick,finding the shoes that fit how derivative is the trustee power to avoid fraudulent conveyances under section b of the bankruptcy code,cardozo.the purpose of this section was to recognize the body of state laws addressing fraudulent transfers and allow a trustee the choice of avoiding transfers under and the applicable state fraudulent transfer law,or under only federal law pursuant to.collier on bankruptcy at.
section of the bankruptcy code authorizes a trustee,after avoiding a fraudulent transfer under or,to recover the property transferred or the value of the property for the benefit of the bankrupt estate.a.section a provides that to the extent that a transfer is avoided under section or the trustee may recover,for the benefit of the estate,the property transferred,or,if the court orders,the value of such property.the purpose of is to restore the estate to the financial condition it would have enjoyed if the transfer had not occurred.in re acequia,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the primary goal is equity and restoration,putting the estate back where it would have been but for the transfer.collier on bankruptcy a at e a in re integra realty,cir in re american way serv.abiding its equitable underpinnings,a trustee recovery under is limited if the transferee took the transfer for value in good faith without knowledge of its voidability.b.a good faith transferee is also permitted under to recover the value of any improvements that were made after the transfer.e a.
ii.cases involving sections and 
the supreme court and this court have interpreted claims under and of the bankruptcy code to require that once avoidance is shown,the trustee recovery can not be limited in certain situations.in moore bay,the supreme court addressed whether a bankruptcy trustee recovery was limited on a fraudulent transfer claim under of the bankruptcy act,the precursor to of the bankruptcy code repealed b,notes stating b is derived from former and that b follows the rule of moore bay sherwood partners,lycos,f d,cir stating that is the precursor of b.in moore,the bankrupt executed a mortgage of automobiles,furniture,show room and shop equipment and later recorded the mortgage.at.under california civil code,a transfer of personal property made by one who has the property and does not immediately deliver it,was void against those who were creditors at the time of the transfer and those who became creditors while the transferor still possessed the property.because of application,the mortgage was void against creditors who were such on the date of the mortgage and those who became creditors between the date of the mortgage and the date it was recorded.id.at.the supreme court,thus,had to address the issue of whether the mortgage was also void against creditors who gave the bankrupt credit after the date the mortgage was recorded.id.at.
the supreme court held that for fraudulent transfer claims asserted by a bankruptcy trustee under the right of the trustee to recover is dependent upon just one creditor with a cause of action and is not dependent at all upon the size of the creditor claim against the debtor.collier on bankruptcy at.the supreme court held that a trustee could avoid an entire transfer without regard to the size of the claim of the unsecured creditor whose rights and power the trustee is asserting.helen ryan frazer,laurel zaeske,and lynda bui,fraudulent transfer litigation under the bankruptcy code and state law,cal,internal quotation marks omitted.in other words,an entire transfer can be set aside even though the creditor claim is nominal and,moreover,the recovery of the trustee is for the benefit of all creditors including those who had no right to avoid the transfer.id.internal quotation marks omitted.thus,the supreme court held that the creditor with a cause of action under would share any recovery equally with unsecured creditors who otherwise could not recover.moore,at.
following the rule of moore bay,in miller sulmeyer,cir we held that a bankruptcy trustee asserting a claim under of the bankruptcy act could recover on a chattel mortgage even though under california civil code the mortgage was void as against any creditor after the date that the mortgage was recorded.in miller,the millers sold a business to the now bankrupt delcon corporation.id.at.in return,the millers took back from delcon a purchase money mortgage on chattels transferred to delcon.id.the millers did not record the mortgage for days.id.a creditor filed a claim against the mortgage for during that time.id.the millers later foreclosed on the mortgage,repossessed the chattel under the terms of the mortgage,and resold the property for.id.delcon was bankrupt at the time of the sale.id.
under california civil code,the mortgage and the miller receipt of the was void as against any creditors whose debts arose after the date that the mortgage was recorded.id.at.we held,however,that controlled,that the facts were similar to moore,the cases addressed chattel mortgages and claims,and stated that we were unable to distinguish moore from that case.id.at.we held therefore that the trustee was entitled to the,despite the invalidity of a creditor claim against the millers under california law.id.
many years later in in re acequia,cir,we addressed whether a bankruptcy trustee recovery for fraudulent transfers under b which replaced former and a could be limited to the amount of the unsecured claims against the bankrupt estate.in acequia,vernon clinton formed acequia,to conduct farming operations on his land in idaho.id.later,acequia filed for bankruptcy.id.the bankruptcy trustee for acequia filed suit,asserting that clinton had fraudulently conveyed acequia assets to himself and was liable under b and.id.at.clinton argued that the b claim was moot because the corporation had paid all of its unsecured creditors in its plan of reorganization.id.at.
in acequia,we held that it was improper to limit a trustee recovery under b and a based on the total amount of unsecured claims against the bankrupt estate.id.we held that the existence of a b claim requires only that one creditor exist at the time that the transfer was made and that that creditor have an actionable claim against the estate.id.we held that a trustee must establish the following to recover under b and a fraud or illegality under applicable law voidness of the transfer under b and applicable law and liability of the particular transferee under.id.at.once fraud and voidness are shown,a trustee may recover under to the extent it benefits the estate,even if there is a right to avoid a transfer,it does not mean that a right to recover on every transfer is automatic.id.at.
applying such rules in acequia,we held that the bankruptcy trustee had a right to assert claims under b because there were unsecured claims against the estate at the time that bankruptcy was filed.id.at.we held that the trustee was entitled to fully recover,even if it received a windfall,because recovery would ensure that acequia would perform its obligations under its reorganization recovery would allow the estate to be reimbursed for pursuing the fraudulent transfer action and clinton had actual fraudulent intent and did not deserve between the two parties to receive a benefit.id.at.
iii.good faith transferee 
the trustee position is that the interplay of b and requires full avoidance,and that california civil code d is not applicable because tramiel is not a good faith purchaser and d can not limit the transferee avoidance.both the bankruptcy court and the district court thought otherwise,as do we,which allows relief of avoidance to the extent necessary to satisfy the creditor claim is expressly made subject to the limitations in section and those limitations include a reduction for what a good faith transferee paid.
while we held in miller and acequia that a trustee recovery can not be limited by certain factors when asserting a b claim,those cases did not address the issue of good faith or this statutory provision,and we have held in other cases that certain good as a matter of law when such a claim is raised.in in re agricultural research and technology group,agretech,cir,we addressed whether the bankruptcy trustee for agricultural research and technology group,agretech could avoid fraudulent transfers made by agretech to palm seedlings palm under b and a and whether palm was a good faith transferee under state law.id.at.agretech was a hawaii corporation that took plant seeds,cultivated them and marketed the mature plants.id.at.several shipments of seeds were made to agretech pursuant to an agreement with palm in which agretech paid for the seeds and palm agreed to pay a certain amount for the plants once they were grown.id.at.throughout its business dealings,however,agretech was running a ponzi scheme and distributing funds to earlier investors from the receipt of monies from later investors.id.at.agretech president plead guilty to operating a ponzi scheme for several years,including years spanning the palm agreement.id.at.
we held that the transfers from agretech to palm were fraudulent and avoidable under b and hawaii revised statute a and that palm was not a good faith transferee under hawaii revised statute.under a,a transfer is fraudulent as to a creditor if it was made with the intent to defraud or without receiving a reasonably equivalent value in exchange.under,any transferee who received a transfer in good faith may recover the value he gave in a transaction which is avoidable under hawaii revised statute a.id.at.because the record demonstrated that agretech had actual intent to defraud its creditors by transferring the sums,we held that the transfers were avoidable under a.id.at.we concluded that palm did not constitute a good faith transferee under a because it should have known that agretech was running a ponzi scheme based on statements it made to palm and from agretech willingness to accept little value in exchange for the transfer.id.at.we held that this evidence showed palm not only knew of the fraud,but was an active participant.id.at.thus,palm was not a good faith transferee.
in in re afi holding,afi,cir,we addressed whether the trustee for advance finance incorporated afi could avoid transfers from afi to one of its investors,keith mackenzie,under and and whether mackenzie was a good faith transferee under california civil code.id.at.mackenzie invested with afi in and as a purported limited partner in exchange for a proportionately reduced restitution claim.id.at.mackenzie withdrew from afi and received,which constituted his initial principal of and a fictitious gain on his investment of.id.at.later,the founder of afi pled guilty to federal securities and mail fraud charges and admitted to operating a ponzi scheme.id.at.the bankruptcy trustee sought to avoid the transfer from afi to mackenzie and mackenzie argued that he was a good faith transferee and entitled to a reduction on that basis.id.
we held that the transfer from afi to mackenzie was an actual fraudulent transfer under and that the good faith transferee exception under california civil code was not barred as a matter of law.id.at.with regard to the fraud,we held that evidence of the ponzi scheme and the guilty plea by afi founder sufficiently established actual intent to defraud creditors.id.at.regarding the good faith exception under,we stated that mackenzie had exchanged a reasonably equivalent value for the transfer so that the good faith exception for the fraudulent transfer was not barred as a matter of law.id.at.we held that if on remand the district court determined that mackenzie took the transfer in good faith,then mackenzie would be entitled to the amount he gave afi,but not to the fictitious gain of.id.at.
in this case,based on acequia,agretech and afi,we hold that the trustee may recover under b and,but that tramiel has shown he is a good faith transferee under california civil code.first,the trustee has established recovery under the acequia test.acequia,at.the acequia test requires that the trustee show fraud or illegality voidness of the transfer under b and applicable law and liability of the particular transferee under.id.at.in this case,the trustee has satisfied steps one and two by showing that the real property transfer from jts to tramiel was a constructive fraudulent conveyance and was void under b and california civil code a.the trustee has also shown that tramiel has liability for the transfer,but the amount of recovery must be calculated to the extent that it benefits the estate,as expressly requires,and must further the intent of to promote equity and restore the estate to its prior condition.
to calculate the amount of recovery and abide by the intent of,we hold that california civil code d,the good faith transferee exception,applies in b cases and,if satisfied,allows for a reduction in the trustee recovery.section d provides that n otwithstanding voidability of a transfer or an obligation under this chapter,a good faith transferee or obligee is entitled,to the extent of the value given the debtor for the transfer or obligation,to a reduction in the amount of the liability on the judgment.here,the record establishes that tramiel was objectively a good faith transferee who gave jts million in exchange for real property to enable jts to survive financially.jts had no source for capital and it was jts who approached tramiel and suggested that they do the real property transfer.to protect the company,tramiel agreed to the deal,but gave jts an option to repurchase the property at the exact same price for a period of a year.if jts exercised the option,tramiel would keep the greater of million or the property rental income and retain a return on his investment.tramiel instructed board members that they should get an independent appraisal of the property and removed himself from all board discussions and votes regarding the transfer.tramiel was not aware of any appraisals of the property and testified that he may have stated they were worth to million at the time of the merger.finally,jts board members stated that given the circumstances,and jts dire need for cash,the real property transaction was fair.
in total,the evidence shows that tramiel entered the transaction in good faith to enable the company to survive and proposed a repurchase option to protect the company.because tramiel is thus a good faith transferee under california civil code d,his liability of is reduced by any value that he gave in exchange for the real property.tramiel gave million to purchase the property and a repurchase option valued at,meaning that the total consideration provided for the property was.deducting the amount of consideration,from the amount of liability,leaves tramiel with a liability of.
this conclusion effectuates the intent of to restore the bankrupt estate to the financial condition it enjoyed prior to the transfer.acequia,at.allowing the estate to profit by taking value that should be returned to a good faith transferee does not promote the purpose of to restore equity.id.moreover,allowing state law good faith transferee exceptions in cases asserting claims permits a symmetry with the bankruptcy code of the bankruptcy code,which voids fraudulent transfers under federal law,allows for a reduction in recovery due to a good faith transferee.section b,which allows for avoidance of fraudulent transfers under state law,should reflect this symmetry.
thus,we hold that tramiel is a good faith transferee under california civil code d and entitled to a reduction in liability of.
settlement credit 
tramiel argues that he is entitled to a settlement credit pursuant to california civil procedure code in the amount that his paid to the estate to settle their claims,which was million.under,where a covenant not to sue is given in good faith before a judgment to one or more of a number of tortfeasors claimed to be liable for the same tort it shall reduce the claims against the others in the amount stipulated by the covenant,or in the amount of consideration paid for it whichever is greater.section allows joint tortfeasors to equitably share damages if they have committed the same tort.wak
