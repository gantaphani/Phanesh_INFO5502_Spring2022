kent miller and terry mcgavern appeal from the district court order affirming the finding of the bankruptcy court that certain debts were nondischargeable in chapter bankruptcy proceedings.we reverse and remand.
the appellees in this case are retirees from a steel mill in utica,new york,and their spouses.they had never engaged in any complex investing,and none has more than a high school education.upon their retirements in the late and early,the appellees received large distributions from the steel mill retirement plan,and all of them desired secure,investments to supplement their retirement income.the appellees took their money to gary bohling,at the time a vice president and registered representative of andover securities,andover,a securities brokerage firm incorporated in missouri and licensed by the national association of securities dealers nasd.ignoring the appellees stated desires,bohling invested their funds in several speculative,high risk investments,including limited partnerships,investment trusts,and private placement offerings of debt instruments in such businesses as a catfish farm,a medical office complex,and a highly leveraged credit company.appellants do not dispute that these investments were inappropriate for these investors.the investments ultimately failed,resulting in the loss of most of the appellees retirement savings.
to obtain appellees consent to these investments,bohling was required to engage in fraudulent conduct.first,he told them that the investments were safe,even better than social security.also,since the investments were complicated and relatively risky,bohling had to manipulate his way around various restrictions.at least one of the investments required investors to be accredited,that is,they must have had a net worth of more than million or two years of income of more than.because none of the appellees met these requirements,bohling falsified their subscription documents by inflating the value of their homes and possessions and by capitalizing their potential social security income as a current asset.further,bohling identified the appellees investment objectives on their investment subscription forms as speculation.the documents prepared by bohling contained various other internal inconsistencies.
during the time bohling managed the appellees investments,miller was chairman of the board of andover securities and mcgavern was president and ceo.neither miller nor mcgavern made any fraudulent statements directly to the appellees.miller,however,was responsible for reviewing all documents bohling submitted for the appellees investments.bohling testified that mcgavern first suggested that he inflate investors assets in order to make them appear accredited.bohling also testified that he discussed capitalizing social security with miller and mcgavern.miller and mcgavern also suggested that bohling indicate that all his clients goals were speculation,thus purporting to limit the company liability if the investments failed.over the years,bohling practices in these areas became more blatant.miller testified that he missed some inconsistencies and red flags in the documents,and mcgavern admitted that he may have conveyed the impression to his brokers that it was permissible to sell unaccredited investors a little bit of the higher risk investments,regardless of the client stated investment objectives.in january,after a client filed a claim against andover securities based on bohling management of her account,miller and mcgavern sent bohling a letter requiring him to limit his sales to investments or ones that were preapproved by andover.this letter also specifically identified the investment in which the appellees lost the most money as one that did not fit most clients risk tolerances.nevertheless,bohling continued to sell the risky investments,and the documents he submitted to andover plainly showed those sales.in february,the wall street journal published an article reporting that the sec was alleging that of bohling customers had used incorrect statements of their assets and had capitalized social security benefits on their investment subscription forms.despite the various indications that bohling was engaged in fraud,miller and mcgavern allowed him to continue in the same practices until his voluntary termination of employment in march of.
in summary,the evidence before the bankruptcy court established that bohling engaged in clear violations of the securities laws throughout the entire period in which he managed the appellees investments and that miller and mcgavern knew or should have known about those violations but did nothing to stop him,with the result that the appellees lost nearly all of their savings.
when bohling subsequently filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter,the appellees accepted as an administrative priority claim and agreed not to sue bohling for the balance of their loss in exchange for his cooperation in proceedings against andover.the appellees then filed a statement of claim with the nasd,asserting violations of the securities exchange act,breach of fiduciary duty,and common law fraud against andover,miller,and mcgavern.
on june,arbitrators entered an award against andover,miller,and mcgavern,finding them jointly and severally liable to the appellees for,plus interest.the arbitrators did not specify the grounds for the award,however,nor did they make explicit factual findings.the arbitration award was later confirmed by the united states district court for the northern district of new york.owens andover,wl.
miller and mcgavern filed voluntary petitions for bankruptcy relief pursuant to chapter of the bankruptcy code on may,and december,respectively.both listed as dischargeable debts the amounts awarded to the appellees in the nasd arbitration.in response,the appellees filed an adversary action,contending that the debts in question were nondischargeable under a a 
because the precise grounds for the nasd award were uncertain,the bankruptcy court determined that nondischargeability under the bankruptcy code could not necessarily be implied from the nature of the debt.the court further concluded,however,that bohling conduct constituted fraud within the meaning of a a that bohling conduct violated of the securities exchange act of,b,and rule promulgated thereunder that pursuant to of the act,a miller and mcgavern,as controlling persons,were jointly and severally liable for bohling fraud to the same extent that bohling was liable,and that miller and mcgavern were ineligible for the good faith exception of a because they were negligent in their supervision of bohling.in short,the bankruptcy court concluded that a created an relationship sufficient to impute bohling fraud to miller and mcgavern and therefore concluded that the debt in question was nondischargeable under a a.owens miller.
