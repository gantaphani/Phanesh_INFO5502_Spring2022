this appeal presents us with a question arising from amendments to chapter of the united states bankruptcy code by the bankruptcy abuse prevention consumer protection act of bapcpa,stat.specifically,we are asked to determine whether an above median income debtor,with negative disposable income,may obtain confirmation of a chapter bankruptcy plan to last for less than five years when the debtor unsecured creditors have not been paid in full.the answer to this question rests on our interpretation of the term applicable commitment period.we find that a plain reading of,a recent united states supreme court ruling,and the congressional intent behind bapcpa mandate that an above median income debtor remain in bankruptcy for a minimum of five years,unless all unsecured creditor claims are paid in full.
background 
terry alan tennyson,the debtor,filed for chapter bankruptcy on november.nancy whaley,the trustee,was assigned as the standing chapter trustee.section of title of the united states code details the requirements for confirmation of a chapter bankruptcy.the debtor is required by b to calculate his disposable income according to the formula on form.tennyson current monthly income was and his annual income was,which was above the median family income for a household of one in his home state of georgia.thus,according to b a ii i,tennyson was an above median income debtor since tennyson was an above median income debtor,b a requires that a predetermined set of expenses,listed in b a b,be subtracted from his current monthly income.this yields the disposable income for an above median income debtor,which in tennyson case was negative.
tennyson proposed a plan to last for three years,without providing for full repayment of his unsecured creditors.whaley objected on the basis that b requires above median income debtors to remain in bankruptcy for at least five years,unless unsecured claims are paid in full.the bankruptcy court confirmed tennyson three year plan and the district court affirmed.
ii.jurisdiction 
the bankruptcy court confirmation of tennyson chapter plan is a final order.see catlin united states,a final decision generally is one which ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.citation omitted.the district court has jurisdiction to hear appeals from all final orders of the bankruptcy court.a.this court has jurisdiction over final orders from the district court when acting in an appellate capacity over a bankruptcy court order.d.
iii.standard of review 
conclusions of law reached by a bankruptcy court or by the district court are reviewed de novo.in re bateman,cir alteration omitted quotation omitted.
iv.discussion 
applicable commitment period is a term that appears in of the chapter bankruptcy code.the definition of applicable commitment period is found in b 
for purposes of this subsection,the applicable commitment period 
a subject to subparagraph b,shall be 
i years or 
ii not less than years,if the current monthly income of the debtor and the debtor spouse combined,when multiplied by,is not less than 
i in the case of a debtor in a household of person,the median family income of the applicable state for earner 
b may be less than or years,whichever is applicable under subparagraph a,but only if the plan provides for payment in full of all allowed unsecured claims over a shorter period.
whaley objected to tennyson plan because she interpreted the applicable commitment period to be the minimum required duration of a debtor chapter bankruptcy plan.however,the district court adopted the bankruptcy court ruling that the applicable commitment period does not stand alone and provide for a strict five year minimum plan duration for all income debtors.doc.at.rather,the applicable commitment period is a multiplier in the b b formula,whereby projected disposable income equals disposable income times the applicable commitment period.
the bankruptcy court pointed to the opening clause of b,for the purposes of this subsection,for support of this argument.if applicable commitment period exists only for the purposes of the subsection,then,the bankruptcy court argued,we must look to see where the term applicable commitment period is used in and constrain its application to the purposes of that subpart.the only other place that applicable commitment period appears is in b b.section b reads 
b if the trustee or the holder of an allowed unsecured claim objects to the confirmation of the plan,then the court may not approve the plan unless,as of the effective date of the plan 
a the value of the property to be distributed under the plan on account of such claim is not less than the amount of such claim or 
b the plan provides that all of the debtor projected disposable income to be received in the applicable commitment period beginning on the date that the first payment is due under the plan will be applied to make payments to unsecured creditors under the plan.
according to this interpretation of applicable commitment period,it exists solely for its function within the confines of b b.see in re kagenveama,cir subsections b disposable income and b amounts reasonably necessary to be expended exist only to define terms relevant to the subsection b b calculation.subsection b,which defines applicable commitment period,is no different.thus,when disposable income is negative,projected disposable income will always be negative,regardless of the length of the applicable commitment period,and unsecured creditors will not recover any of their unsecured claims.therefore,if disposable income is negative the applicable commitment period is inconsequential.as a result,tennyson was free to enter a bankruptcy plan of less than five years even though his unsecured debts had not been paid in full.
whaley argues that applicable commitment period is a fixed five year term,for above median income debtors,that can only be shortened if all unsecured debts are paid in full in the shorter time period.
a.a plain reading of section b requires a finding that applicable commitment period is a temporal term 
this case is one of statutory interpretation.specifically,we are asked to define the term applicable commitment period.to do so,we are guided by the traditional standards of statutory construction 
the starting point for all statutory interpretation is the language of the statute itself.we assume that congress used the words in a statute as they are commonly and ordinarily understood,and we read the statute to give full effect to each of its provisions.we do not look at one word or term in isolation,but instead we look to the entire statutory context.we will only look beyond the plain language of a statute at extrinsic materials to determine the congressional intent if the statute language is ambiguous applying it according to its plain meaning would lead to an absurd result or there is clear evidence of contrary legislative intent.

applying these principles,we first look at the term applicable commitment period and note that applicable and commitment are modifiers of the noun,the core substance of the term,period.the plain meaning of period denotes a period of time or duration.merriam webster collegiate dictionary ed.applicable commitment period at its simplest is a term that relates to a certain duration,and based on its presence in,it is a duration relevant to chapter bankruptcy.the modifier commitment then reveals that applicable commitment period is a duration to which the debtor is obligated to serve.see merriam webster collegiate dictionary ed.finally,the meaning of applicable reflects the fact that there are alternate commitment periods depending on the debtor classification as an above median income debtor or a below median income debtor.
section b clearly says that the applicable commitment period shall be five years for an above median income debtor,such as tennyson.the word shall is ordinarily the language of command.alabama bozeman,quotation omitted.the use of the word shall normally creates an obligation impervious to judicial discretion.lexecon milberg we
