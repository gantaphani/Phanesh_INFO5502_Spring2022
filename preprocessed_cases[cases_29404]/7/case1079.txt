rtc is a delaware corporation that installs collection systems at landfills to capture the methane gas created by degrading waste and then either uses it to fuel electric generators and produce electricity or sells the gas to others.in december,rtc entered into a contract with ads pursuant to which rtc committed to build and operate facilities at four ads landfills in pontiac,illinois,wheatland,kansas,wyandot,ohio,and clarion,pennsylvania hereinafter,the agreement or the ads agreement.the agreement was for an initial term of ten years,expiring on december.rtc had a right to extend the agreement beyond this term provided that the parties had not already terminated their arrangement for up to three consecutive periods of five years.in order to exercise its right to extend the agreement beyond its initial term,rtc was required to send ads by certified or registered mail written notice of its intent to renew at least thirty days prior to the december,expiration date,no later than november.allied waste industries allied later succeeded to ads rights under this agreement.
in,rtc was placed involuntarily into chapter bankruptcy by certain of its creditors.rtc converted the proceeding to a chapter reorganization.rtc subsequently assumed that portion of its agreement with allied relating to the landfill in pontiac,illinois,see a,a,but did not assume the balance of the agreement concerning landfills in wheatland,wyandot,and clarion.in september,on the motion of several creditors,bankruptcy judge eugene wedoff converted the case back to a chapter proceeding and appointed jay steinberg as the trustee of rtc estate.
on november,the trustee counsel wrote to counsel for allied seeking to extend the deadline by which the ads agreement could be renewed.the letter sought allied agreement to move the renewal deadline from november,to december.allied counsel replied on november,agreeing to the extension through december,insofar as the pontiac landfill was concerned.counsel added that it was allied view that the agreement had already terminated as to the three other landfills outside of illinois wheatland,wyandot,and clarion.she therefore noted that allied was consenting to the trustee request for an extension of time to renew the ads agreement only insofar as rtc had any remaining rights under that agreement and without prejudice to allied position that all but the pontiac portion of the agreement had terminated.id.
although the deadline for renewing the pontiac portion of the ads agreement had thus been extended,the final day of came and went without any renewal of the agreement.nor did the parties agree to any further extensions of the renewal date.
in march,the trustee entered into a settlement agreement with scattered,among other entities,resolving certain disputes the settlement.that agreement was subsequently approved by the bankruptcy court.pursuant to the court order approving the settlement,scattered obtained the right to designate certain of rtc contracts that scattered wanted to take over.once scattered designated a contract in which it was interested,the trustee would seek the bankruptcy court permission to assume the contract and,upon securing that authority,assign the contract to scattered pursuant to sections a and f of the bankruptcy code.however,the order provided further that scattered shall not have the right to designate any contract if the estate believes in good faith that a particular designation will result in the estate being subject to sanctions pursuant to fed.or allegations of bad faith in the event that the trustee refused to pursue assumption and assignment of a contract on that basis,the settlement entitled scattered to ask the bankruptcy court to compel the trustee to assume and assign the contract in question.
prior to the execution and court approval of the settlement,the trustee had sought and obtained from the bankruptcy court a series of extensions of time in which to assume or reject executory contracts and unexpired leases.the first of these motions was filed on november.in it,the trustee sought an extension of time until january,to assume or reject a number of contracts,among them the ads agreement.the motion indicated that the ads agreement was set to expire on december,and that there was a deadline of november,by which date notice of an intent to extend the contract had to be sent.the motion did not seek an extension of the life of the ads agreement itself,only an extension of time for the trustee to assume or reject that contract and the others listed in the motion.indeed,at the hearing on the motion,when judge wedoff inquired,if a contract was terminated,what more can be done,the trustee counsel responded,if a contract was terminated,then it terminated.in that vein,the trustee acknowledged allied position that a number of its agreements with rtc,including portions of the ads agreement concerning facilities other than the pontiac facility,had already been terminated.for that reason,the trustee request to assume the balance of the ads agreement was continued.following that hearing,the bankruptcy court on november,entered an order granting the trustee motion and thereby extending until january,the time in which the trustee could assume or reject the pontiac portion of the ads agreement.the attachment to that order listing the contracts as to which time had been extended again indicated that the pontiac portion of the ads agreement was set to expire on december,and that the trustee had until november,to send a notice of his intent to extend the term of that contract.as we noted above,on november,allied counsel agreed to the trustee request that the renewal deadline for ads agreement be extended until december.
subsequently,on november,the bankruptcy court entered a second order,this one expressly agreed to by and between the trustee and allied,extending the trustee time to renew or reject all portions of the ads agreement until january.the text of that order expressly acknowledged allied position that all but the pontiac portion of the ads agreement had already terminated and preserved allied right to so assert in future proceedings.
scattered points out that there were two additional orders that granted extensions of time to the trustee for purposes of assuming or rejecting unexpired contracts and leases.on or about january,the trustee sought an extension of time to assume or reject from january,to february.the attached list of contracts as to which the trustee sought the extension included several contracts relating to the pontiac facility,but not the pontiac portion of the ads agreement.interestingly,the trustee did seek additional time to assume or reject the portions of the ads agreement concerning the wheatland,wyandot,and clarion landfills.and when the parties appeared before the bankruptcy court for the hearing on the motion,allied counsel objected to the request for more time on the ground that these portions of the agreement had already been terminated.judge wedoff made the following remarks concerning allied objection and a similar objection raised by the city of columbus 
the court w hat will happen,gelman counsel for allied,is that i can grant this motion.and if the trustee should hereafter attempt to assume a contract that already been terminated,i am sure you will let me know.and i am also sure that steinberg would waste his time trying to assume an already terminated contract.so i think it is safe to grant this motion.
rzepka your honor,natalia rzepka for the city of columbus.i just wanted to state our objection on the record.i believe your honor denied the debtor motion to assume our contract back in.
the court right.it covered by the same remarks that i just made.
rzepka yes.
the court all that is happening here is that to the extent the trustee does have unexpired leases or unterminated executory contracts,this preserves the trustee right to assume or assign those contracts.it would otherwise be cut off,and the contracts would be deemed rejected.if you got a contract that already terminated,it not going to be affected by an extension.
the bankruptcy court decision to grant the trustee motion was memorialized in an order dated january,and,consistent with the trustee motion,the attached list of contracts as to which the extension of time was being granted did not include the pontiac portion of the ads agreement.in accord with the court remarks at the hearing on the motion,the order contained the following provisions qualifying the nature of the extension that the court was granting to the trustee 
with respect to certain landfills identified on exhibit a which are owned by american disposal services,and allied waste industries,collectively,along with its respective subsidiaries and affiliates,allied 
a in regards to that portion of the december,contract involving the wheatland,clarion,and wyandot landfill sites the disputed contract sites,and only to the extent rtc possesses any contract rights to or at the disputed contract sites which allied disputes,the time by which the trustee can move to assume or reject the disputed contract site portion of the contract is extended to february.
nothing in this order shall extend the right to assume or reject any contract that has already expired or been terminated and nothing in this order shall be deemed to be a release or waiver of any right,claim or cause of action of any kind that any party its affiliates and subsidiaries to such contracts may have that such contracts have expired been terminated prior to the date of this order.
the following month,as the february,deadline for assumption or rejection of these contracts approached,the trustee sought another extension of time to april.again,although other contracts were included in the list of contracts as to which the trustee was seeking additional time,the pontiac portion of the ads agreement was not among them.the court granted that motion on march.its order contained the same qualifying language as the january order.
it was also on march,that the bankruptcy court signed the order approving the settlement between scattered among other parties and the trustee that gave scattered the right to designate various contracts for assumption and assignment by the trustee.scattered subsequently designated the ads agreement as one of the contracts that it wished to assume.but the trustee counsel,in the face of objections from allied that the ads agreement had by this time expired in its entirety,wrote to scattered counsel on may,to inform scattered that the trustee would not seek to assume the ads agreement among others unless compelled to do so by the district court.scattered proceeded to file a motion asking the bankruptcy court to do just that.allied objected,contending that because the ads agreement had expired by its terms on december,it could not be assumed as a matter of law,and consequently the trustee,if he sought to assume the contract,would be exposed to sanctions under bankruptcy rule and allegations of bad faith.
the bankruptcy court heard scattered motion on june,and concluded that because the trustee had no plausible basis on which to assume the ads agreement,which had clearly expired,he had properly refused scattered demand to seek assumption.the ads agreement was one of a number of agreements as to which the trustee had declined to file motions to assume and that were consequently the subject of motions to compel.the essential inquiry,as the court acknowledged at the start of the hearing,was whether the trustee would be making a frivolous motion,subject to sanctions under rule,were he to move to assume these contracts.
the underlying question with all of these is whether the trustee is reasonably asserting that to pursue a motion here would violate the trustee obligations under rule,and so the question here is whether the trustee has a good basis for believing that pursuing an assumption here would violate.
the court went on to agree with allied counsel that the ads agreement had expired on december,with the result that there was no longer a valid contract for the trustee to assume and assign to scattered.the court rejected the suggestion of scattered counsel that a hearing was required in order to determine whether the extensions of time the court had granted the trustee to assume or reject the agreement had also extended the time to renew the agreement.
there is no need for a hearing.the question that being raised now is whether an order extending the time for assumption or rejection of an unexpired contract somehow has the effect of extending the contract or extending a deadline for renewal under the contract.those really are two separate questions.and each time that there was a motion to extend the time for assumption or rejection,i heard arguments to the effect that this has already expired,to which my response was if it already expired,extending the time for assumption or rejection will have no impact on the expiration.
so given that we dealing with two separate issues whether the contract has expired and whether the time for assumption or rejection of the contract can be extended,i think unless you can point to something,an agreement,an order of the court that extended the time for extending the contract under the contract terms,there is no basis for the trustee to assume this contract.
when pressed to identify any court order or agreement extending the renewal date of the ads agreement beyond its expiration date of december,scattered counsel could point only to the orders granting the trustee requests for additional time to assume or reject the contract.the court rejected the notion that those orders might have extended the life of the agreement 
okay.i do think so.we have always made a distinction between extending the time for the estate to assume or reject and the question of whether the underlying agreement was terminated.and given that there is that distinction,which,again,was repeatedly made as i granted motions to extend the time for the trustee to assume or reject,the distinction was always made that granting the motion in no way implied that the underlying agreement had not terminated.that was always a separate consideration.if there is nothing that prevents the expiration of the underlying agreement according to its terms other than an allegation that an order extending the time for the estate to assume or reject is in place,the trustee does not have a basis for going forward on it.
when scattered attorney suggested that the trustee might nonetheless have understood or have intended for these orders to extend the renewal date,the court pointed out that the trustee subjective and unilateral understanding would not have been sufficient to override the terms of the orders and the underlying contract.acknowledging that a bilateral agreement between the trustee and allied would have been necessary to extend the life of the agreement,scattered counsel suggested that there might be a factual question as to whether allied too had intended for the orders to extend the renewal date but the court found no basis to support such a question 
no,you not going to find anything,i am confident,in the record where allied counsel acknowledges that an extension of time to assume or reject constitutes an extension of the underlying agreement that subject to assumption or rejection.they been here vociferously arguing for a substantial period of time that the agreement had terminated.and entering an order granting the trustee a right to continue the time for
