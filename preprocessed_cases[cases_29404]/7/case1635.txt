edward maney,as chapter trustee,appeals the bankruptcy court order confirming the plan of the debtor,laura kagenveama.he argues that the bankruptcy court erred by calculating kagenveama projected disposable income by multiplying her disposable income over the applicable commitment period and finding the applicable commitment period inapplicable because kagenveama resulting projected disposable income was a negative number.we affirm.
background 
in,kagenveama filed a petition for chapter protection in the bankruptcy court.in her filing she included the required schedules a through j,a statement of financial affairs,a master mailing list,and a form statement of current monthly income and calculation of commitment period and disposable income.schedules i and j listed kagenveama projected monthly income and expenses.her schedule i listed a monthly gross income of,with a monthly net income of.her schedule j listed monthly expenses of.subtracting total monthly expenses from total monthly net income left kagenveama with in monthly income available to pay creditors.
kagenveama filed an amended form listing an average monthly gross income of for the six months prior to her bankruptcy petition,yielding an annual income of.because she was an income debtor,b required her to recalculate her expenses pursuant to b.this recalculation produced a revised form listing her disposable income as a negative number.
kagenveama determined that her projected disposable income was a negative number because her disposable income was a negative number.because her projected disposable income was a negative number,she would not be subject to the applicable commitment period.however,she voluntarily proposed a plan in which she would pay per month with a commitment period of three years.this plan yielded an estimated dividend of to her unsecured creditors.the trustee objected because the plan extended only three years,not the applicable commitment period under b a ii.the bankruptcy court held that because kagenveama had no projected disposable income,she was not required to propose a plan with an applicable commitment period of five years.the trustee appealed,and the bankruptcy court entered an order certifying this case for direct appeal to this court.
ii.analysis 
the parties dispute the meaning of two phrases contained in of the bankruptcy code,as amended by the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of bapcpa,stat.projected disposable income and applicable commitment period.this case raises solely questions of law,which we review de novo.in re alsberg,cir.
projected disposable income 
the parties dispute whether projected disposable income means disposable income,as defined by b,projected over the applicable commitment period,as kagenveama contends,or whether that phrase connotes a concept that only uses the disposable income calculation as a starting point,as the trustee contends.based on the plain meaning of the statute,we hold that the debtor interpretation is correct.
the starting point for resolving a dispute over the meaning of a statute begins with the language of the statute itself.united states ron pair,d.where statutory language is plain,the sole function of the least where the disposition required by the text is not to enforce it according to its terms.lamie united states trustee,d.
here,each party claims that the plain text of the statute supports its respective interpretation of projected disposable income.kagenveama argues that the term disposable income,as used in b b,is specifically defined in b.she asserts that the word projected is a modifier of disposable income that requires multiplying disposable income out over the applicable commitment period.the trustee argues that disposable income and projected disposable income are not directly linked concepts.under the trustee approach,projected necessarily implies a concept of disposable income,which would allow a court to depart from the b disposable income calculation and consider other evidence to derive projected disposable income.
we begin our analysis with the statute.if a trustee or holder of an allowed unsecured claim objects to the confirmation of a plan that does not propose to pay unsecured claims in full,the court may confirm the plan only if the plan provides that all of the debtor projected disposable income received during the applicable commitment period is applied to make payments under the plan.b.projected disposable income is not a defined term in the bankruptcy code.however,disposable income is defined in b reading the statute as requiring disposable income,as defined in subsection b,to be projected out over the applicable commitment period to derive the projected disposable income amount is the most natural reading of the statute,and it is the one we adopt.
courts must give meaning to every clause and word of a statute.negonsott samuels,d.section uses the term disposable income in only two places b b projected disposable income and b defining disposable income.the substitution of any data not covered by the b definition in the projected disposable income calculation would render as surplusage the definition of disposable income found in b.there can be no reason for b to exist other than to define the term disposable income as used in b b.if disposable income is not linked to projected disposable income then it is just a floating definition with no apparent purpose.in re alexander.the plain meaning of the word projected,in and of itself,does not provide a basis for including other data in the calculation because projected is simply a modifier of the defined term disposable income.therefore,to give meaning to every word of b,disposable income,as defined in b,must be projected in order to derive projected disposable income.
furthermore,projected disposable income has been linked to the disposable income calculation before bapcpa.any change in how projected disposable income is calculated only reflects the changes dictated by the new disposable income calculation it does not change the relationship of projected disposable income to disposable income,projected disposable income was determined by taking the debtor disposable income,under b a b,and projecting that amount over the applicable commitment period.in re anderson,cir.
in anderson,a case,the trustee objected to the confirmation of the debtors chapter bankruptcy plan because the debtors proposed to pay only their projected disposable income as calculated at the time of the filing of their plan.at.the trustee demanded that the debtors sign a certification that they would devote to the plan all of their actual disposable income,as determined by the trustee,as a prerequisite for plan confirmation.id.at.the bankruptcy court denied plan confirmation because the debtors refused to sign the certification.id.at.we reversed,holding that b b requires payment of projected disposable income as calculated at the time of confirmation.id.at.anderson shows that,prior to the enactment of bapcpa,courts determined the debtor disposable income and then projected that sum into the future for the required duration of the plan when considering whether to confirm the plan.id.at.
the trustee presents two lines of authority to support his argument that b b requires a determination of projected disposable income.the first line holds that the calculation of projected disposable income must be based upon the debtor anticipated income during the term of the plan,not merely an average of the debtor prepetition income as computed on form.in re hardacre.this authority reasons that projected disposable income is not related to disposable income therefore courts are free to arrive at a calculation of projected disposable income that ignores the b definition of disposable income.id.at.
we reject this position because the plain language of b links disposable income to projected disposable income,and we are bound by the definition of disposable income provided in b b.even before the enactment of bapcpa,we held that projected modified disposable income,thus foreclosing the argument that projected disposable income has no relationship to disposable income.anderson,at.in light of anderson,we can not read the word projected to be synonymous with the word anticipated in this context.see id.those courts that argue congress intended something more when it referred to projected disposable income in b b fail to address the fact that congress defined disposable income subsequently in b.in re miller,citing in re rotunda.to get from the statutorily defined disposable income to projected disposable income,one simply takes the calculation and does the math.in re alexander,at.
the second line of cases that the trustee urges us to follow holds that calculation of disposable income under b is merely a starting point for deriving projected disposable income.in re jass.under this line of cases,the data from form creates a presumptively correct definition of or a rebuttable presumption of disposable income.id.at.the presumptively correct calculation can be rebutted or supplemented by other evidence to arrive at projected disposable income.id.courts may consider both the future and historical finances of the debtor to make the calculation.id.at.
this line of authority is unpersuasive because no text in the bankruptcy code creates a presumptively correct definition of disposable income subject to modification based on anticipated changes in income or expenses.in fact,the textual changes enacted by bapcpa compel the opposite conclusion.the revised disposable income test uses a formula to determine what expenses are reasonably necessary.see b.this approach represents a deliberate departure from the old disposable income calculation,which was bound up with the facts and circumstances of the debtor financial affairs.in re winokur,in re,stating that e liminating flexibility was the point the obligations of c hapter debtors would be subject to clear,defined standards,no longer left to the whim of a judicial proceeding internal quotations omitted.
moreover,bapcpa changes to the bankruptcy code made it clear that congress knows how to create a presumption.see b stating when the court shall presume abuse exists.congress could have included a presumption in b,but it did not.when congress includes language in one part of a statute and excludes it from another part of the same statute,it is presumed that congress acted purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.barnhart sigmon coal,d citing russello united states,d camacho bridgeport fin,cir.we decline to follow the line of cases holding that form creates a presumptively correct definition of disposable income.
finally,the disposition required by the plain text of b is not absurd.section b new approach to calculating disposable income for debtors produces a less favorable result for unsecured creditors when disposable income is plugged into the projected disposable income calculation.we will not override the definition and process for calculating disposable income under b as being absurd simply because it leads to results that are not aligned with the old law.in re alexander,at.furthermore,we will not disposable income from the projected disposable income calculation simply to arrive at a more favorable result for unsecured creditors,especially when the plain text and precedent dictate the linkage of the two terms.see anderson,at stating that b b requires provision for payment of all projected disposable income as calculated at the time of confirmation,and we reject the trustee attempt to impose a different,more burdensome requirement on the debtors plan as a prerequisite to confirmation.if the changes imposed by bapcpa arose from poor policy choices that produced undesirable results,it is up to congress,not the courts,to amend the statute.see lamie,at.
furthermore,chapter trustees were aware of the change in the law and notified congress of their concerns before bapcpa was passed,but congress failed to act.in re alexander,at marianne culhane michaela white,catching debtors is the means test the only way,am.absent any revision by congress,we presume that it was aware of the new result,and the decision not to amend the statute was intentional.lamie,at.while the new law may produce less favorable results for unsecured creditors when applied to income chapter debtors,it is far from absurd to hold that debtors with no disposable income have no projected disposable income.see in re alexander,at.furthermore,if the debtor income increases after the plan is confirmed,the trustee may seek plan modification under.
applicable commitment period 
the trustee argues that applicable commitment period mandates a temporal measurement,it denotes the time by which a debtor is obligated to pay unsecured creditors,while kagenveama argues that it mandates a monetary multiplier,it is merely useful in calculating the total amount to be repaid by a debtor.based on the plain language of the statute,we conclude that the trustee interpretation is correct,but that the applicable commitment period requirement is inapplicable to a plan submitted voluntarily by a debtor with no projected disposable income.
prior to bapcpa,the bankruptcy code provided for a period.however,bapcpa changed three year to applicable commitment,but left the word period unchanged.based on widely accepted temporal connotation of period,the bankruptcy court noted that c makes clear that applicable commitment period has a temporal meaning however,the bankruptcy court went on to observe that in this case the applicable commitment period is irrelevant because it is applicable only to the payment of projected disposable income,and,in this case,there is no projected disposable income.the bankruptcy court also noted that the plain language of the code compels the conclusion that the applicable commitment period is not the minimum plan duration,but instead represents the period over which payments of projected disposable income must be devoted to unsecured creditors.
if the trustee or the holder of an allowed unsecured claim objects to confirmation of the plan and the debtor is unable to provide for full payment of allowed unsecured claims,the debtor must propose a plan in which all projected disposable income is submitted to make payments for the applicable commitment period in order for the plan to be confirmed.b.the plain meaning of the word period indicates a period of time.in re alexander,at citing webster new world dictionary college ed.however,applicable commitment period is exclusively linked to b b and the projected disposable income calculation.in re alexander,at.thus,only projected disposable income is subject to the applicable commitment period requirement.id.any money other than projected disposable income that the debtor proposes to pay does not have to be paid out over the applicable commitment period.id.
there is no language in the bankruptcy code that requires all plans to be held open for the applicable commitment period.section b does not contain a freestanding plan length requirement rather,its exclusive purpose is to define applicable commitment period for purposes of the b b calculation.subsection b states for purposes of this subsection,the applicable commitment period shall be not less than years for debtors.subsection b b states that the debtor projected disposable income to be received in the applicable commitment period will be applied to make payments under the plan.when read together,only projected disposable income has to be paid out over the applicable commitment period.when there is no projected disposable income,there is no applicable commitment period.
subsections b disposable income and b amounts reasonably necessary to be expended exist only to define terms relevant to the subsection b b calculation.subsection b,which defines applicable commitment period,is no different.aside from the definitional subsection b,the term applicable commitment period is used only once in the court may approve the plan over objection if all of the debtor projected disposable income received during the applicable commitment period is applied to plan payments.thus,the applicable commitment period applies only to plans that feature projected disposable income.here there is none.
a recent decision by the eighth circuit bankruptcy appellate panel bap supports limiting the application of the applicable commitment period to plans that have projected disposable income.in re frederickson.in frederickson,the bap held that applicable commitment period does not refer to a minimum plan duration,but rather it refers to the time in which the debtor must pay projected disposable income to the trustee.id.another statutory provision,d,governs plan duration for above median income debtors.id.the bap concluded that d would be superfluous if b set the length of the plan.id.we find this reasoning persuasive.
the trustee suggests that we should require a plan for confirmation under to allow an extended period for unsecured creditors to seek modification under.if a debtor proposes a plan,receives a discharge,and experiences an increase in income in year four,then the debtor receives a windfall at the expense of creditors.while this approach would promote the sound policy of requiring debtors to repay more of their debts,there is nothing in the bankruptcy code that requires a debtor with no projected disposable income to propose a plan.we must enforce the plain language of the bankruptcy code as written.we may not make changes to the plain language of the bankruptcy code based on policy concerns because that is the job of congress.nothing in the bankruptcy code states that the applicable commitment period applies to all chapter plans.
we stress that nothing in our opinion prevents the debtor,the trustee,or the holder of an allowed unsecured claim to request modification of the plan after confirmation pursuant to.here,we are dealing with the plan confirmation requirements of,not plan modification under.another section of the bankruptcy code governs modification of the plan before confirmation.because congress directly addressed the modification of plans in other sections,we need not transform into a plan modification tool.
here,the applicable commitment period is irrelevant because it applies only to the payment of projected disposable income,and,in this case,there is no projected disposable income.kagenveama voluntary payments come from money other than projected disposable income therefore,there is no requirement that these payments occur for five years.because her projected disposable income was zero or less and,therefore,the applicable commitment period did not apply,the bankruptcy court properly confirmed her plan.if her income changes in the future before completion of the plan,the trustee or the holder of an unallowed secured claim may seek modification of the plan under.
iii.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the order of the bankruptcy court.
this case deals with how long a chapter,debtor in bankruptcy proceedings will have to worry about whether his unpaid creditors can bring up any good changes in his fortunes,to get paid his debts to them.the majority lays down a rule so long as the debtor can calculate no disposable income at the time his creditor plan is confirmed,he can rest easy.the debtor can propose as short a time period as he wants a day,a week or a month.i dissent because congress pretty clearly stated his creditors should have up to five years to keep an eye on the debtor to perhaps share in any of his new good times.respectfully to the majority,i think the rule they adopt creates an incentive for the picaresque,by encouraging a debtor to fiddle with his expenses and income just before he presents his creditor plan for confirmation.so long as he can push up his expenses and delay receipt of income so as to show no disposable income at the time of plan confirmation,he can propose such a short period of time that he can save any postponed income from the creditors clutches.the majority result is not required by a close reading of the bankruptcy code indeed,quite the opposite is the correct reading.for this reason,i partially dissent from the majority opinion.
i concur in the majority opinion holding as to the calculation of projected disposable income.i agree projected disposable income in b b is calculated according to b statutory definition of disposable income,using form the debtor actual disposable income on the date of plan then projected out over the applicable commitment period.opinion at.
i also concur in the majority opinion holding that applicable commitment period,as defined in b and used in b b provides a temporal requirement for the length of a chapter plan.opinion at.i part company with the majority,however,in its determination the applicable commitment period is mandatory only when the debtor has projected disposable income at the time of plan confirmation.opinion at.
section b b provides 
if the trustee or the holder of an allowed unsecured claim objects to the confirmation of the plan,then the court may not approve the plan unless,as of the effective date of the plan the plan provides that all of the debtor projected disposable income to be received in the applicable commitment period beginning on the date that the first payment is due under the plan will be applied to make payments to unsecured creditors under the plan.
the applicable commitment less than years for an above median debtor,b a ii,and years for a below median debtor,b a i can be shortened only if the plan provides for payment in full of all allowed unsecured claims over a shorter period.b b.the majority agrees the applicable commitment provides a temporal requirement,but holds this temporal requirement should not apply to a debtor who has no projected disposable income at the commencement of the commitment period.the language of the statute provides no such exception.the statute requires a plan to provide that all of the debtor projected disposable income to be received in the applicable commitment period will be applied to make payments to unsecured creditors.b b emphasis added.thus,even if a debtor projected disposable income is zero at the time he seeks plan confirmation,he must commit to pay such disposable income as he receives he receive the applicable commitment period.he can make such a commitment only by proposing a plan that will be in existence at that later date or otherwise commit to pay all he owed to unsecured creditors in a shorter period of time.
although the purpose of chapter bankruptcy is to provide debtors a second chance,it is not a pardon of debt or,at least,a pardon right away.chapter bankruptcy is a statutorily constructed second chance for debtors that,through the plan modification procedures in,also provides a second chance for creditors to be repaid by a bankrupt debtor whose financial situation has improved.section specifically allows for periodic adjustments to disposable income calculation.b stating requirements apply to any modification under subsection a of.the applicable commitment period allows unsecured creditors who are otherwise not receiving payment from a debtor five years to monitor the debtor finances and,in the event the debtor disposable income increases during that time,file for plan modification under.plan modification may occur only after confirmation of the plan but before the completion of payments under such plan,and a modified plan may not provide for payments over a period that expires after the applicable commitment period under section b b.a,c.
the majority agrees that provision for plan modification after confirmation is the proper way for a creditor to deal with a possible change in the debtor income.opinion at.it then states that,because different sections of the bankruptcy code provide for plan modification we need not transform into a plan modification tool.id.the requirement of,however,is a necessary component of plan modification.if the plan is not continued for a period,an unsecured creditor who discovers the debtor finances have dramatically improved will find that there is no extant plan to modify.a,c.
section governs plan confirmation by providing the requirements a plan must meet before it may be confirmed when an unsecured creditor or the plan trustee has objected to confirmation of the plan.one of those plan confirmation requirements is that a plan propose an applicable commitment peri
