factual background 
we restate the facts of this case,as described in watman i,at.watman,a dentist,joined childrens dental associates of lowell childrens dental in april.at that time,groman,also a dentist,was the sole shareholder,officer,and director of childrens dental.the parties agreed that watman would be given the opportunity to purchase fifty percent of the practice at the end of one year if the two men worked well together.consistent with that plan,at the end of his first year with childrens dental,watman entered into an agreement to pay groman on a monthly basis for ten years in exchange for a fifty percent ownership stake in the practice.in,watman agreed to purchase the other fifty percent of the practice from groman,and the payment period was extended an additional ten years to cover the other half of the purchase price.watman made the monthly payments to groman until september of,when watman claimed difficulties in making the payments.in response,groman agreed to reduce the monthly payments from to.
watman made only two of the reduced monthly payments.in april,groman filed suit against watman and childrens dental as joint obligors for the remaining balance owed him.on december,groman obtained a judgment against watman and childrens dental in the amount of in middlesex superior court.neither watman nor childrens dental appealed that judgment.
in or about march,groman filed a complaint seeking the appointment of a receiver for childrens dental.a hearing on the appointment of a receiver was scheduled for march,but was continued by agreement of counsel to march.
on march,watman wrote checks from the childrens dental checking account,totaling.he recorded these transactions in childrens dental books.of that total,went to prepayments of childrens dental anticipated expenses for the month of april,including office rent,equipment rent,health insurance,and maintenance.although payroll was typically paid out every two weeks,watman caused payroll withdrawals to be made from childrens dental bank account on march,and march,the day after the original date of the receivership hearing.on march,on the advice of counsel,watman sent a letter of resignation to michael dana rosen,counsel for childrens dental,terminating his employment immediately.on march,watman filed his chapter bankruptcy petition.on march,childrens dental filed its chapter petition at the time that these petitions were filed,watman was the sole officer and director of childrens dental.at the time of filing,childrens dental had cash in bank accounts in the amount of approximately and accounts receivable of about.these assets were disclosed in the bankruptcy schedules and turned over to the bankruptcy trustee.on or about march,watman informed lowell doctors park from whom childrens dental was renting its office space,that childrens dental would be terminating its occupancy of the premises.
from march,through march,watman operated a dental practice under his own name at the office space that had been occupied by childrens dental at arcand drive,in lowell,massachusetts arcand drive location,using the same furniture and equipment that childrens dental had used.watman offered the employees of childrens dental positions in his practice on the same terms as childrens dental was employing them.then,on march,lowell dentistry for children,lowell dentistry was incorporated and began operations out of the same arcand drive location.the corporate documentation to form lowell dentistry had been prepared in january by the law firm of devine,millimet branch.childrens dental paid the cost of these services from a retainer that it had paid to that firm.watman became,and continues to be,the president,sole shareholder and director of lowell dentistry.most of childrens dental patients became patients of lowell dentistry when childrens dental ceased operating.
on august,groman filed a complaint,alleging,inter alia,that watman actions warranted a denial of his discharge pursuant to a and a.watman subsequently moved to dismiss groman complaint for failure to state a claim under rule of the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure and rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.that motion was granted by the bankruptcy court.on appeal,the bap reversed the bankruptcy court dismissal of the objections to discharge and remanded for a trial on the merits.after trial,the bankruptcy court entered judgment in favor of watman.on appeal,the bap affirmed the judgment of the bankruptcy court.groman appealed,and we vacated the judgment of the bankruptcy court in watman 
watman i and subsequent procedural history 
during the bankruptcy court proceedings and on appeal,groman argued that watman transfer of the assets of childrens dental to lowell patient records,office space,equipment,and employees shifted all the goodwill of childrens dental to lowell dentistry,stripped childrens dental of its aggregate value as a going concern,and eliminated its ability to generate income for the estate,leaving groman with an empty shell at childrens dental save approximately in cash and accounts receivable against which to pursue collection of his judgment.watman i,at.for his part,watman argued that he formed lowell dentistry to preserve the assets of childrens dental so that he could pay the debts to groman,and explained that he did so relying on advice of counsel.the bankruptcy court,noting that watman did not conceal his actions and emphasizing watman claim that he relied on counsel advice,initially concluded that groman had not established watman intent to hinder,delay,or defraud under a.
in reviewing the bankruptcy court reasoning,we found it problematic and incomplete in several respects.we noted that watman claim that he formed lowell dentistry to preserve the assets of childrens dental was never memorialized in writing,is not in any way referenced in any written memoranda,and was not reported in childrens dental bankruptcy schedules.watman i,at.we also observed that the bankruptcy court had not accounted for the fact that the assets of childrens dental were transferred to lowell dentistry without consideration,and had not considered whether several other indicia of fraud were evident in this case.see id.at.we therefore remanded the case for further findings.id.
on remand,the bankruptcy court held a status conference at which the parties agreed that no further evidence was needed to make the findings on remand.the bankruptcy court gave the parties an opportunity to submit further proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.after reviewing those submissions and the record,the bankruptcy court found in favor of groman on count ii of his complaint,denying watman a discharge pursuant to a on appeal,the bap found that the bankruptcy court addressed some,but not all,of the points mentioned in our watman i decision and thus remanded for additional findings.the bankruptcy court supplemented its findings but came to the same conclusion.watman filed another appeal,which groman elected to present to the district court pursuant to c b.the district court affirmed the decision of the bankruptcy court.this second appeal to us ensued.
we review the bankruptcy court conclusions of law de novo and its factual findings for clear error.see davis cox in re cox,cir although the district court reviewed the bankruptcy court decision in this case,we exhibit no particular deference to the conclusions of the district court.brandt repco printers lithographics,in re healthco int l,cir.
in this appeal,watman asserts that the bankruptcy court clearly erred in its findings on a what property of childrens dental was transferred to lowell dentistry and b whether watman acted with intent to hinder,delay,or defraud his creditors.watman also argues that the bankruptcy court erred in its approach to the inquiry on remand by reversing some of its initial factual findings without hearing additional evidence and exceeding the scope of remand.we address these arguments in turn.
a.the bankruptcy court findings of fraudulent transfer under a a 
on remand,the bankruptcy court concluded that watman is precluded under a,applying a a,from receiving a discharge in chapter bankruptcy.section a a states 
the court shall grant the debtor a discharge,unless the debtor,with intent to hinder,delay,or defraud a creditor or an officer of the estate charged with custody of property under this title,has transferred,removed,destroyed,mutilated,or concealed,or has permitted to be transferred,removed,destroyed,mutilated,or concealed property of the debtor,within one year before the date of the filing of the petition.
a a.we explained in watman i that 
in order for a debtor to be denied a discharge under a,an objector must show by a preponderance of the evidence that the debtor transferred,removed,destroyed,mutilated,or concealed his or her property or the property of the estate if the transfer occurs within one year of the petition filing date for prepetition transfers with intent to hinder,delay or defraud a creditor.
at.groman,as the party requesting the denial of the discharge in this case,has the burden of establishing these elements.fed.see also watman i,at.
property of childrens dental transferred to lowell dentistry 
under the first two elements of the fraudulent transfer test under a,as applicable here under a,groman must show that watman transferred or concealed property that belonged to childrens dental.the bankruptcy court,in its initial decision,concluded that there was no transfer here in the customary sense and that transfers,if they did take place at all,were not of the formal legal title nature,and to the extent that patients files,records,et cetera,are property of the estate they have been transferred.in watman i,we concluded that this analysis was inadequate.at.specifically,we questioned whether the bankruptcy court applied the correct definition of transfer in its analysis,noting that bankruptcy law defines transfer broadly to include a transfer of possession,custody,or control even if there is no transfer of legal title.see watman i,at discussing the legislative history of,which defines transfer citing,cong,as reprinted in,see also martin bajgar in re bajgar,cir noting the broad definition of transfer in bankruptcy law.we explained that the bankruptcy court should have determined whether assets such as childrens dental employees,patient files,office space,goodwill and overall going concern value were a properly considered property of childrens dental such that they would have been included in the estate for the benefit of creditors and b if so,whether they were transferred to watman or lowell dentistry.at footnote omitted.
on remand,the bankruptcy court concluded that childrens dental space,patient records,employees,and good will were property of childrens dental and that they were transferred to lowell dentistry.the bankruptcy court noted that watman also used childrens dental funds to prepay expenses that he knew he or a new corporation would incur.the bankruptcy court found that the only property not transferred and thus remaining in childrens dental estate for liquidation by its chapter trustee consisted of accounts receivable,an obsolete computer that lowell dentistry originally used then stopped using at some point,furnishings,decorations,and a box of dental supplies of unknown value.the bankruptcy court concluded that watman actions thus harmed childrens dental creditors.
watman challenges these findings on two interrelated grounds.first,he argues that the bankruptcy court erred by failing to calculate the specific value of these assets.second,he argues that the bankruptcy court finding that childrens dental assets had some value was clearly erroneous.both of these arguments are specious.
calculating the value of the assets 
the bankruptcy court was not required to calculate the precise value of the assets of childrens dental in order to determine whether those assets were property capable of being transferred in this context.the question of whether those assets were property capable of being transferred depends on whether they are susceptible of having value.watman i,at emphasis added quoting robinson watts detective agency,cir see also robinson,at explaining that the term property in the context of transfers is defined generally as anything of which has debt paying or debt securing power glosband watts detective agency,holding that the term property in the context of transfers should be interpreted most generously to incorporate anything of value which but for the transfer might have been preserved for the trustee to the ultimate benefit of the bankrupt creditors quoting segal rochelle,d.once the bankruptcy court determined that the assets of childrens dental had some value,it did not have to calculate the precise value.
whether childrens dental assets had value 
watman essentially argues that the assets of childrens dental were valueless.he focuses much of his argument on whether the bankruptcy court properly determined the extent of childrens dental goodwill and going concern value independent of watman own practice.we need not reach those arguments,however,because the evidence demonstrates that other assets of childrens dental had value.as the district court aptly observed,
watman,both as a solo petitioner and as part of lowell dentistry,decided to operate at the same location,use the same furniture,equipment and supplies,employ the same employees including an orthodontist and another dentist,retain the same patient records,and service the same patients as childrens dental.before watman filed for bankruptcy,he was willing to make monthly payments for these combined childrens dental assets.
in re watman,citations omitted.in addition,as the bankruptcy court noted,watman used childrens dental funds to prepay expenses that he knew he or a new corporation would incur.watman transferred these assets identified by the bankruptcy court precisely because they had value.if watman had walked away from childrens dental,he would have had to expend resources to find a new location for his practice,buy new equipment,hire new employees,find new patients or encourage his old patients to follow him despite changes in location and employees,and develop new patient records or enter into some arrangement to get the old records.instead,watman simply transferred by possession these assets of childrens dental to lowell dentistry.we therefore affirm the bankruptcy court finding that childrens dental assets had value and that watman used those assets for his new practice given this finding,we conclude that watman transferred the property of childrens dental to lowell property within the meaning of a a 
intent to hinder,delay,or defraud a creditor 
under the last element of a a,groman had to convince the bankruptcy court that watman acted with the intent to hinder,delay,or defraud his creditors.section requires a showing of actual intent,not constructive intent.watman i,at citing collier on ban
