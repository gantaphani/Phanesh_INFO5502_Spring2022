appellant community bank,community bank,appeals the august,judgment of the united states district court for the western district of new york siragusa.the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court denial of community bank motion to,inter alia,obtain an order confirming the automatic dismissal of the bankruptcy case of stephen riffle pursuant to i on the grounds that stephen and lora riffle collectively,appellees failed to file copies of all payment advices received by stephen riffle within days before the date of the filing of the bankruptcy petition as required by a b iv.we hold that because appellees provided information reflecting payment received from stephen riffle employer in the days prior to the petition,they satisfied the requirements of a b iv.we therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.
statutory requirements 
appellees filed a petition for bankruptcy under chapter of the bankruptcy code.schedules and statements filed by the appellees indicated that community bank was a fully secured creditor that held a mortgage on their residence.prior to the bankruptcy filing,stephen riffle was employed by yb sales and distribution.during the period before the filing,stephen riffle received from his employer four payment advices with respect to his compensation.according to the appellees schedule i of current income,lora riffle had no income during this time.
within the period for filing copies of all payment advices or other evidence of payment received within days before the date of the filing of the petition,by the debtor from any employer of the debtor,a b iv,the appellees filed the last payment advice that stephen riffle received during that period.the advice was dated september,covered the pay period ending september,included stephen riffle earnings and deductions for that pay period,and identified his earnings and payroll deductions in various categories.stephen riffle claims that he had thrown the other payment advices away.the appellees also filed a chart entitled sales earnings report.this document was issued by stephen riffle employer and showed his gross earnings for each pay period from january,through august.
after the period for filing had passed,community bank moved to confirm the automatic dismissal of stephen riffle petition for failure to file all of the payment advices received within the period and,upon dismissal of stephen riffle petition,to dismiss lora riffle petition because she had no income and could not fund a chapter plan.the trustee opposed the dismissal on the grounds that the evidence submitted by the appellees represented full compliance with the statutory requirements of a b iv.
the bankruptcy court denied community bank motion to dismiss stephen riffle case on the basis that the filed payment advice and sales earning report were other evidence of payment as required under section a b iv and provided gross and net pay,including every category of gross pay and applicable deductions.the court also stated that it did not believe that detailed information per pay period with respect to deductions is critical under section a b iv,as long as the evidence,as supplied here by the last pay stub received before the filing of the petition,provides a complete list of the categories of the deductions from the debtor pay for the period in question.the court accordingly also denied the motion to dismiss lora riffle case.
community bank appealed to the district court,which affirmed on the opinion of the bankruptcy court.on appeal to this court,community bank challenges only the district court affirmance of the bankruptcy court denial of the motion to dismiss.
ii.discussion 
appellate jurisdiction 
before we can decide whether the bankruptcy court properly denied the motion to dismiss stephen riffle case,we must first determine if we have jurisdiction to hear this appeal.to that end,in advance of oral argument,we ordered the appellant to submit additional briefing addressing the basis for our jurisdiction to review the order of the district court,and we directed the appellees to submit a response to the appellant submission.
we have previously explained that 
defines jurisdiction over appeals in bankruptcy matters.although interlocutory orders of bankruptcy courts may be appealed to the district courts with leave of the court,see a,the jurisdiction of the courts of appeals is confined to appeals from all final decisions,judgments,orders,and decrees of district courts sitting in review of bankruptcy courts,id.d.
bowers.bank,cir emphasis omitted.in this case,we need not resolve whether the district court judgment,affirming the bankruptcy court denial of a motion to dismiss the riffle bankruptcy petition,was a final decision of the district court within the meaning of d that conferred jurisdiction on this court.regardless of the finality of that decision,jurisdiction was proper by the time this court heard the appeal.
when community bank filed its notice of appeal of the district court judgment on september,the bankruptcy court had already confirmed the riffles chapter bankruptcy plan,issuing its order on june.such a confirmation order is a final order that may be appealed.see maiorino branford sav.bank,cir suggesting in dicta that such an order is final in re layo,cir holding that chapter order is a final judgment on the merits for preclusion analysis purposes in re am.preferred prescription,cir the confirmation of a plan in a chapter proceeding is an event comparable to the entry of a final judgment in an ordinary civil litigation.we have held that a premature notice of appeal from a nonfinal order may ripen into a valid notice of appeal if a final judgment has been entered by the time the appeal is heard and the appellee suffers no prejudice.smith ex rel.smith half hollow hills cent.sch,cir per curiam internal quotation marks omitted accord swede rochester carpenters pension fund,cir.this rule applies even if the final judgment was not itself appealed.see,half hollow hills cent.sch,at noting that no appeal was taken from the final judgment in that case.assuming that an appeal of the district court order in this case would have been premature had the riffles chapter plan not already been confirmed,the fact that the bankruptcy court had entered a final order by the time of the appeal ensured that the appeal was ripe at the time it was taken,and all the more so by the time it was heard by this court.
in light of the entry of the order confirming the appellees chapter plan,and because there will be no prejudice to the appellees by virtue of our deciding this appeal,we hold that we have appellate jurisdiction over this matter.
obligations under a b iv 
we exercise plenary review over a district court rulings in its capacity as an appellate court in bankruptcy.see in re dairy mart convenience stores,cir.w e independently examine the bankruptcy court factual determinations and legal conclusions,accepting the former unless clearly erroneous and reviewing the latter de novo.id.
under a b iv,a bankruptcy debtor must,unless the court orders otherwise,file copies of all payment advices or other evidence of payment received within days before the date of the filing of the petition,by the debtor from any employer of the debtor.if a voluntary filer under chapter or chapter does not comply with this requirement within days after the filing of the petition,the case is automatically dismissed.i 
we have not previously decided what obligations a b iv imposes upon a debtor,and the statute,to put it mildly,is not a model of syntactical clarity.at least two grammatically valid readings of the statute are possible,each of which would place a different requirement on the debtor.
statutory analysis begins with the text and its plain meaning,if it has one.green city of new york,cir quoting gottlieb carnival,cir.this text lacks a plain meaning.what makes the statute ambiguous is that it is not clear how the participle received functions in context.on one possible reading,the clause received within days could be understood to refer to the compound subject all payment advices or other evidence with the word all modifying both payment advi
