opinion of the court 
eastern pilots merger committee epmc or appellants appeals from a judgment of the district court affirming an order entered by the bankruptcy court enforcing a reorganization plan in favor of appellee,continental airlines.this appeal requires us to decide two questions whether the district court erred in interpreting the decision in in re continental airlines,cir continental i,as encompassing appellants rights under a collective bargaining agreement of eastern airlines,and if this court decision in continental i is so interpreted,whether that decision should be reconsidered.
because the facts and procedural history have been set forth in detail in continental i,we discuss here only the bare adjudicative facts underlying our discussion of the legal issues presented.
this dispute centers around an action which took place on february,when eastern airlines,and its pilots union,the air lines pilot association alpa,ratified a collective bargaining agreement the agreement that included certain labor protective provisions lpp.under these lpp,eastern pilots secured protection of their seniority rights in the event of a merger between eastern and another airline carrier by requiring the integration of eastern seniority list with the merging carrier list.the next day,texas air corporation,parent corporation of continental,acquired eastern.subsequently,continental initiated a chapter reorganization proceeding.
alpa filed protective proofs of claim claims in continental bankruptcy,contending that because a merger between eastern and another airline carrier continental had taken place,its members were entitled to specific performance of seniority rights under the lpp,together with money damages.thereafter,continental second amended joint plan of reorganization was confirmed by the bankruptcy court.the court confirmation order essentially clarified that any valid claims based on the lpp would give rise to a right of financial payments that would be dischargeable in bankruptcy.it also provided that claimants had no right to injunctive,equitable or other relief.
after appealing the bankruptcy court order to the district court,alpa settled with continental,but the lpp claimants continued their appeal.unsuccessful in the district court,several groups,including the present appellants,appealed to this court.we ruled that the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction to decide how the claims would be treated in bankruptcy,that the bankruptcy court was well within its authority to exercise jurisdiction over the issue of the status of the bankruptcy claim s.in re continental airlines,at.and critically important,we determined that the claims could be converted to money damages.id.at.
the supreme court denied a petition for a writ of certiorari.llp claimants continental airlines,d.
in response to the commencement of a separate lawsuit brought by appellants in the united states district court for the district of new jersey the new jersey action,continental filed a reorganized debtors motion for order compelling compliance with order confirming plan of reorganization and for sanctions the compliance motion in the bankruptcy court seeking to halt the new jersey action.the airline sought a determination that the confirmation order barred the new jersey action because all potential relief relating to the lpp had been addressed in the bankruptcy proceeding.the bankruptcy court agreed with continental,stating 
s ince we find that the decision of the third circuit affirmed the ruling that all claims of the eastern pilots are discharged by the confirmation order,we conclude that the confirmation order does bar the new jersey action instituted by epmc.continental is entitled to sanctions against epmc for its knowing and willful violation of the confirmation order.
in re continental airlines.
the bankruptcy court had interpreted continental i to mean that all remedies for breach of the lpp,whether before or after bankruptcy,had been reduced to claims for payment in the bankruptcy proceeding and had been discharged by the confirmation order.
on appeal,the district court held that continental i precluded any relief.according to the court,although the agreement survived the bankruptcy process,a ppellants demand for specific performance of the seniority integration clause did not.in re continental airlines,wl,at.furthermore,the district court stated that the bankruptcy process would be meaningless if the teachings of continental i did not require that any claim for prospective relief through specific performance be discharged.id.at.thereafter,epmc appealed.
appellants repeatedly emphasize that the members of the epmc have a right to enforce the lpp contained in the agreement because continental failed to reject the agreement in accordance with the requirements of.building on this major premise,appellants then argue that because continental failed to properly reject the agreement,it was assumed by operation of law.appellants direct our attention to a number of cases,including in re roth american,cir,in which we stated 
the union contends that since roth american has not sought to reject the collective bargaining agreement under section,roth american has assumed the collective bargaining agreement by operation of law,and that roth american thus is bound by all of its terms.we agree with the union 
id.at.appellants then argue that under,if the agreement is assumed it must be assumed cum onere,and any breach of the agreement must be cured.appellants brief at citing national labor relations bd.bildisco bildisco,d.from the foregoing premises they urge us to conclude that because the agreement rides through the bankruptcy as if the bankruptcy had never occurred,the llp provisions continue to be an unsatisfied obligation on the reorganized debtor as to all seniority rights.id.citing bildisco bildisco,at.brennan,concurring.
distilled to its essence,the argument states that because continental did not follow the statutory procedures for rejecting an executory contract as set forth in,somehow appellants are entitled to the injunctive relief that it sought and was denied during the bankruptcy proceedings.there is a glaring defect in appellants argument because its basic assumption is flawed.the reality is that the agreement has never been rejected.this makes their entire rejection argument irrelevant to the motion to enforce the reorganization plan.
in the various proceedings arising out of the plan,proceedings on all levels of the judicial hierarchy,including this court,no court has proceeded on the basis that the agreement had been rejected.in the case at bar,which seeks enforcement of the plan,neither the bankruptcy court nor the district court so suggested.nor do we do so here.
rights granted by the bankruptcy court,affirmed by the district court and discussed by us in continental i,did not arise out of thin air.they were based on the agreement.we made that crystal clear when this case was previously before us therefore,we conclude that the right to seniority integration set forth in the agreement gives rise to a right of payment such that the remedy constitutes a claim dischargeable in bankruptcy.in re continental airlines,at.
in continental i,this court,as did the bankruptcy court and the district court,did not reject the agreement.we interpreted it.we construed the seniority provisions of the agreement as a basis of providing a right of payment in lieu of injunctive relief after considering a variety of factors to include feasibility.the issue raised by appellants is irrelevant here because the legal basis for the relief to determine entitlement to,and if so,the amount of based on an interpretation of the agreement.what was involved here was a simple categorical deductive syllogism all claims for seniority relief must be based on the agreement appellants make a claim for seniority relief therefore,appellants claims for seniority relief are based on the agreement.
we believe the critical question for decision in this appeal to be uncomplicated did this court in continental i adjudicate only claims for seniority rights or did our holding include also rights arising the
