background 
debtor douglas palermo,a real estate consultant,filed for bankruptcy pursuant to chapter of the bankruptcy code,et,in the bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york on october.plaintiff appellee david kittay was appointed trustee of palermo estate in bankruptcy on january,after the initial trustee passed away.on october,two days before the statute of limitations period ended,kittay filed proceedings,pursuant to u.b and,in the bankruptcy court,against defendant appellant joseph korff korff and a number of other persons and entities.kittay alleged that these defendants had received fraudulent transfers pursuant to dcl sections,and,from palermo prior to his chapter filing subsequent to a request from the bankruptcy court,which considered some of the parties and claims misjoined,on january,kittay amended the complaint to drop all parties but palermo.he then refiled separate complaints against each group of defendants.in august of,korff moved,pursuant to e and federal rule of bankruptcy procedure,to withdraw the reference from the bankruptcy court adlai hardin,and the proceedings against korff were transferred to the district court for the southern district of new york.
under section b of the bankruptcy code,the trustee of an estate in bankruptcy may avoid any transfer of an interest of the debtor in property or any obligation incurred by the debtor that is voidable under applicable law by a creditor holding an unsecured claim.b.the applicable law in determining which obligations are voidable under section b is often state law.see,in re adelphia recovery trust,cir noting that state laws governing fraudulent conveyances may be invoked in federal bankruptcy proceedings by operation of b in re nextwave personal commc ns,cir applicable law under section b includes various state fraudulent conveyance statutes.pursuant to section b,kittay alleged that korff,a friend and associate of palermo,had received fraudulent transfers within the meaning of dcl,and,prior to palermo chapter filing.sections define constructive fraud 
under the dcl,a conveyance by a debtor is deemed constructively fraudulent if it is made without fair consideration,and inter alia if one of the following conditions is met i the transferor is insolvent or will be rendered insolvent by the transfer in question,dcl ii the transferor is engaged in or is about to engage in a business transaction for which its remaining property constitutes unreasonably small capital,dcl or iii the transferor believes that it will incur debt beyond its ability to pay,dcl.

the trial evidence reflected that,in july,palermo arranged to assign to korff of a larger fee palermo had earned for brokering a large real estate deal.at trial,palermo gave vague testimony describing the services performed by korff to earn fees.korff testimony on the topic was internally inconsistent and.korff testified both that he was entitled,because of his participation in the transaction to the fee,and that it was in repayment for as to which there was no documentation that he had made to palermo during their long association.palermo likewise testified both that korff fully earned the fee and that it was given to extinguish antecedent debts.
on october,about one week before trial was set to begin,korff moved to dismiss the complaint as barred by the statute of limitations.the district court denied the motion,finding that equitable tolling saved kittay filing.the jury found in kittay favor on all counts.after trial,korff moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,or alternatively,for a new trial pursuant to rules b and a.the district court denied both of these motions.on november,korff moved for reconsideration of the district court prior denial of the motion to dismiss on timeliness grounds.the district court denied this motion in an opinion and order entered on february.
korff now argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for judgment as a matter of law that there were errors in the jury charge that the complaint was untimely and that the district court erred in applying equitable tolling and that the court erred in awarding prejudgment interest without explanation.we address the latter two contentions herein the remainder of korff arguments have been considered and addressed in a summary order filed contemporaneously with this opinion.
timeliness 
factual background 
korff argues that the district court erred in not dismissing kittay complaint as untimely.some crucial facts are undisputed from the outset neither party disputes that the time for filing ended october,or that the complaint upon which trial proceeded in this case was not filed until january.nor is it disputed that kittay originally commenced the action against korff and the other defendants in bankruptcy court on october,two days before his time to file expired.although on its face kittay complaint against korff may have seemed untimely,however,the proceedings in bankruptcy court giving rise to this facially late filing belie any conclusion that it was,in fact,untimely.
on november,all parties on the original complaint,except for korff and another defendant,appeared in the bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york.from the outset,the court questioned the appropriateness or,indeed,the permissibility of lumping all these defendants in one adversary proceeding.it indicated that separate adversary proceedings were probably going to be necessary.when kittay counsel expressed concern about whether the refiled proceedings would be timely,the court stated the statute of limitations will not be a problem because to the extent that this complaint was timely as to any of these people,a refiling will be timely,as well.so that should not be a that will not be an issue.the court directed the parties to consider an appropriate way to split the claims up into separate complaints and adjourned.
the second proceeding in the bankruptcy court was held on december.korff again did not appear,though process was complete as to korff on december.as to remedying any misjoinder,kittay counsel told the court that the parties had agreed to maintain one adversary proceeding solely against palermo and to split the remainder of the claims into four separate adversary proceedings.the other parties expressed their agreement,and the court indicated that if the parties had come to an agreement,it would acquiesce in their division.kittay counsel and the court then had the following exchange 
the court okay,as a mechanical matter then,i take it you would now file separate complaints 
counsel for kittay yes,the understanding being,of course,that the statute of limitations would have been satisfied from filing the first complaint.
the court relating back to the initial complaint,that fine.
judge hardin directed that the new complaints be filed by january.the proceeding ended with the following exchange 
the court by the way,i guess once the new complaints are filed,you should do an appropriate consent order terminating this initial adversary proceeding,but with a specific provision that the i do know quite how you word it,but that the new complaints will relate back to the filing of this one,all right 
counsel for kittay it is my intention,your honor,to just amend the complaint in this action so that it will only cost the to avoid having to pay for another action.
the court say again 
counsel for kittay my intention was just to amend the complaint in this action to eliminate or would be to move to proceed under this caption against palermo and then to file the other.
the court all right,i see.okay,so this action would not be terminated this would just be amended to relate only to one set of defendants 
counsel for kittay yes,that correct,your honor.
the court okay,that fine.very good.thank you.
on january,kittay filed an amended complaint which functionally dismissed all defendants except palermo that same day,he filed separate complaints against the other defendants.no consent was obtained prior to these filings.the amended complaint against korff alleged that judge hardin held that for purposes of the statute of limitations,the date of filing for the additional adversary proceedings would relate back to the date the initial adversary proceeding was filed.no further motions were made as to timeliness until october,around one week before trial,when korff moved to dismiss the complaint as untimely.kittay claimed in response that he was entitled to equitable tolling.neither party produced the transcripts of the december and november proceedings at oral argument on october.the court reserved decision,and on october,immediately before trial began,the district court orally denied the motion to dismiss,indicating that equitable tolling was appropriate.after korff counsel objected that the basis for the court determination was hearsay,kittay counsel proffered that she now had the transcript and would produce it,though she indicated it was consistent with the timeliness allegation in the original complaint.the court did not make any further ruling,and the trial began.
after trial,on november,korff moved for reconsideration of the court equitable tolling determination.reviewing the transcripts of the bankruptcy court proceedings,the district court found that it was reasonable to read the transcripts to mean that the bankruptcy court required consent only if the initial adversary proceeding was terminated,and not,as actually occurred,if the initial complaint was amended to drop the misjoined parties.the district court indicated that it made its prior decision to toll the statute of limitations because the plaintiff had not sat on his rights,had timely commenced the initial adversary proceeding,and because there was no prejudice was suffered by the defendant.the court also found that the bankruptcy court transcripts were not inconsistent with kittay previous position,and thus were not inconsistent with its original decision.accordingly,it denied reconsideration.the court also held that the complaint was timely on an alternative ground,the relation back provision of federal rule of civil procedure c.korff appeals both of these determinations.
we need express no view on rule c or the applicability of equitable tolling,the two bases on which the district court found the complaint timely,because a clearly sufficient basis to affirm the district court is found in federal rule of civil procedure,which applies in bankruptcy adversary proceedings pursuant to federal rule of bankruptcy procedure.rule indicates that m isjoinder of parties is not a ground for dismissing an action.on motion or on its own,the court may at any time,on just terms,add or drop a party.the court may also sever any claim against a party.when faced with misjoinder,the rule allows the bankruptcy court to drop a party or sever claims.but the remedy for misjoinder is not,as the bankruptcy court initial instruction suggested,dismissal of the action,which rule specifically prohibits.see also clay martin,cir t he presence of improper parties is an invalid basis for dismissal of a complaint.misjoinder does not justify such an extreme sanction.sabolsky budzanoski,cir misjoinder or of parties is not ground for dismissal.the proper remedy in case of misjoinder is to grant severance or dismissal to the improper party if it will not prejudice any substantial right.citation omitted.the bankruptcy court initial direction to the parties aimed at curing misjoinder requiring dismissal of the complaint and refiling of separate complaints was thus in violation of rule.since the bankruptcy court clearly considered all claims appropriate to proceed and intended for them to do so,it should have ordered the misjoined parties to be severed.had it done so explicitly,the complaint would unquestionably be timely,as the date of initiation for statute of limitations purposes would have been october,the undisputed timely filing date of the original action.unlike a suit dismissed without prejudice,in which a suit is treated for statute of limitations purposes as if it had never been filed,elmore henderson,cir,when a court severs a claim against a defendant under rule,the suit simply continues against the severed defendant in another guise.the statute of limitations is held in abeyance,and the severed suit can proceed so long as it initially was filed within the limitations period,directv,leto,cir citations omitted.
we see no reason for a different result simply because the court did not expressly invoke rule.as an initial matter,we note korff concedes that the bankruptcy court was exercis ing its discretion under rule.even absent such a concession,the record unequivocally reflects that what the bankruptcy court intended to do was to effectuate a severance under rule.nothing on the face of rule,incorporating rule indicates that it must be explicitly invoked in order to have effect.there must be,however,a strong indication that the judge intended to effect a severance.white abco eng g,cir.here,a lthough the bankruptcy court did not explicitly refer to rule,we conclude that it clearly intended to sever.allied elevator.state bank of buna,cir.
here,the bankruptcy court indicated that the claims were misjoined and that separate adversary proceedings were probably going to be necessary.it also unambiguously indicated that to the extent that th e original complaint was timely as to any of the defendants,a refiling would be timely,as well.the court clear intent was that the claims be separated and allowed to proceed as timely,based on the filing of the original complaint.it is by operation of rule that this could be effectuated.accordingly,we conclude that the bankruptcy court intended to and did effectuate a rule severance.see allied elevator,at united states,cir concluding from judgments themselves,as well as from the c
