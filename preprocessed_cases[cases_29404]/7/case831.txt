this is an adversary proceeding brought by william hays,hays,trustee of the debtors bankruptcy estate,to recover paid by the debtors to jimmy swaggart ministries jsm from july to july.hays jsm these transfers can be avoided as actual constructive fraudulent conveyances under a.jsm additionally claims the good faith defense of c.for the reasons that follow,this court finds that jsm met the requirements of c and the criteria for a comparable defense under louisiana law.accordingly,we need not reach the other issues raised on appeal.the district court reversal of the bankruptcy court judgment must be reversed,and judgment must be entered in favor of jsm.
the debtors in this case are a number of corporations created and controlled by sam recile recile for the purpose of developing a shopping mall in baton rouge,louisiana.critical to the success of this project was recile acquisition of a tract of land owned by jsm.in july,one of recile corporations entered into an option agreement for purchase of a tract of jsm land in baton rouge,louisiana.the stipulated purchase price was.for the next two years recile made payments totaling on this and subsequently renegotiated agreements as he sought to obtain financing for the project.no purchase ever occurred.
although call option contracts on real estate are common enough,recile behavior was not.he offered to prospective investors promissory notes to finance his project.the nominal party on recile side of the option arrangement changed frequently.payments to jsm were,in later stages of the relationship,made on a weekly or daily in cash,sometimes with checks.most notably,recile came under sec investigation,a complaint being filed in april in the united states district court for the eastern district of louisiana.jsm was not a party to this action.
over the next fifteen months the supervising district judge issued a variety of orders,each of which allowed the debtor corporations to continue making payments on this and other options.eventually,in july,the court entered an order granting the sec broad injunctive relief that,among other things,appointed hays as receiver for the debtors.see sec recile,cir affirming district court grant of sec motion for summary judgment.in september,hays filed voluntary chapter bankruptcy petitions on behalf of the debtors.
in february,hays filed this action in bankruptcy court,seeking to avoid a total of in payments made by the debtors to jsm.following an extensive bench trial with multiple witnesses,judge jerry brown,the bankruptcy judge,ruled in favor of jsm on all of hays claims in this action.the court concluded that,although there was ample evidence that recile had engaged in illegal activities,there was no substantial evidence that jsm was a party to,knew of,or was put on notice of sufficient facts,that it should have known of such illegal activities when it accepted the numerous transfers of money and agreed to allow the debtors to tie up valuable real estate for the lengthy amount of time here involved.
hays appealed to the district court.three and a half years later,that court reversed and remanded the bankruptcy court decision.on remand,the bankruptcy court granted hays motion for judgment in his favor,but declined to award interest.on appeal,the district court reversed the bankruptcy court denial of interest.jsm filed notices of appeal to this court,the district court entered an amended judgment,and jsm filed a third notice of appeal.the appeals have been consolidated 
discussion 
i.the district court erred in reversing the bankruptcy court conclusion that jsm had satisfied the elements of the good faith defense under c.
with c,congress provided to transferees a defense against a trustee or debtor successful demonstration of an actual or constructive fraudulent transfer under,respectively,a a and a b of the bankruptcy code.c states in pertinent part 
a transferee or obligee of such a transfer or obligation that takes for value and in good faith has a lien on or may retain any interest transferred to the extent that such transferee or obligee gave value to the debtor in exchange for such transfer or obligation.
the burden of proof is on the defendant transferee.see in re bus.mach,cir in re agric.research tech.group,cir.to avail himself of this defense,the transferee must demonstrate that he took value in good faith.to keep what he received,he must subsequently demonstrate that he gave value.
hays argues that recile corporations made actual constructive fraudulent transfers to jsm under a.jsm argues that these payments were not fraudulent.it also argues,in the alternative,that it is protected by the defense provision found in c.because this court holds that jsm satisfied the terms of c,we need not undertake an evaluation of hays assertion that the transfers were actually constructively fraudulent under a.
good faith 
in an appeal from a district court reversal of a bankruptcy court judgment,this court should perform the same appellate review as did the district court the appellate court examine s the bankruptcy court findings of fact under the clearly erroneous standard,and the appellate court examine s that court legal determinations under the de novo standard.in re sewell,cir.
the dispute regarding jsm good faith under c comes to this court as a question of first impression.in the absence of clear factual error or controlling legal precedent,we decline the invitation to overturn the trial court finding that jsm received recile payments in good faith.
as courts and commentators frequently note,the bankruptcy code does not define good faith and the statute legislative history is quite thin.collier on bankruptcy a.moreover,there is little agreement among courts as to what conditions ought to allow a transferee this defense.id.this is not surprising,as the variables are manifold.
the most important set of questions concerns the transferee state of mind.first,what level of itself or some form of a claim of good faith second,need the knowledge be actual or merely constructive third,what duty of inquiry does notice impose 
the first set of questions begs the second knowledge of what of the transferor insolvency,fraudulence,or both if insolvency,then of what,imminent,or potential if fraudulence,then regarding what enterprise involving the transferee or any of the transferor dealings 
regarding the second set of debtor corporations insolvency and is no reason to disagree with the bankruptcy court.the debtor corporations were insolvent ab initio.they also made fraudulent representations to investors,though not necessarily at the outset.moreover,recile fraudulence pertained to the jsm land deal itself,not to some unrelated transaction.without an option on jsm land,recile could not have perpetrated his fraud upon his investors.the transferor was engaged in a crooked scheme.
the heart of the bankruptcy court conclusion lies,then,in the first set of transferee state of mind.once again,the bankruptcy court findings are comprehensive,cogent,and entitled to the respect due them under the clear error standard.we point here only to the most telling out of a voluminous list of findings.with regard to jsm knowledge of the debtor corporations insolvency,the bankruptcy court found that a t the time the transfers occurred,jsm had no way of knowing that the debtors were insolvent.with regard to jsm knowledge of the debtor corporations fraudulent activities,judge brown found that jsm had read newspaper accounts of the sec suit against recile.finally,with regard to jsm duty of inquiry,judge brown found that jsm,upon being duly alarmed newspaper stories,undertook its own investigation,contacting the sec and the federal district court,eventually receiving assurances from the district court that jsm could continue to receive option payments from recile corporations.
based on its findings,the bankruptcy court resultant legal conclusion is unproblematic.as noted above,there is little agreement among courts regarding the appropriate legal standard for this defense,because t he unpredictable circumstances in which the courts may find its presence or absence render any definition of good faith ina
