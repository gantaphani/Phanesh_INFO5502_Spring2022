we have for review the following question of florida law certified by the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit that is determinative of a cause pending in the federal courts and for which there appears to be no controlling precedent 
does article x,section of the florida constitution exempt a florida homestead,where the debtor acquired the homestead using funds with the specific intent of hindering,delaying,or defrauding creditors in violation of.stat.or.stat.and 
havoco of america,hill,cir.we have jurisdiction.art.v,b.const.for the reasons that follow we answer the certified question in the affirmative.
on july,elmer hill filed a voluntary chapter bankruptcy petition in which he claimed that real property located in destin,florida,destin property was exempt as his homestead under article x,section of the florida constitution havoco objected,arguing that hill converted nonexempt assets into the homestead with the intent to hinder,delay,or defraud his creditors.the dealings between the parties which precipitated the instant action,as stated by the eleventh circuit in its opinion,are as follows 
in,havoco filed suit against hill claiming damages for fraud,conspiracy,tortuous sic interference with contractual relations,and breach of fiduciary duty.havoco alleged that hill conspired to eliminate havoco as a principal under its ten year contract to supply coal to the tennessee valley authority.after several appeals to the seventh circuit,havoco case finally came to trial nine years later.the jury found for havoco on all its claims against hill and awarded havoco in damages.the district court entered judgment in accordance with the jury verdict on december,and the judgment became enforceable on january.
hill purchased the destin property on december.although he was a resident of tennessee,hill claims that he intended to make the destin property his retirement home.he paid approximately in cash for the destin property.
havoco,at footnote omitted.
the bankruptcy court held an evidentiary hearing in which havoco attempted to present evidence of other transfers of nonexempt assets by hill to demonstrate that the purchase of the destin property was part of a larger scheme to defraud hill creditors via bankruptcy.the bankruptcy court deemed the evidence irrelevant and denied havoco the opportunity to present the evidence in support of its claim.thereafter,the bankruptcy court overruled havoco objections to hill homestead claims,concluding that havoco had not proven by a preponderance of the evidence that hill acted with the specific intent to defraud his creditors when he purchased the destin property.
on appeal,the district court reversed,finding error in the bankruptcy court supposition that a debtor specific intent to defraud his creditors could provide a ground to deny the homestead exemption.the district court ordered the bankruptcy court on remand to determine whether and under what circumstances florida law prevented debtors in and from converting nonexempt property to exempt property.havoco,at.further,the district court ordered the bankruptcy court to conduct an evidentiary hearing during which havoco would be allowed to present evidence of hill other transfers of nonexempt assets if it determined that hill homestead claim was limited under florida law.
on remand,the bankruptcy court,relying upon bank leumi trust lang,and butterworth caggiano,so d,held that florida law did not prohibit hill from converting nonexempt assets into a homestead,even if done with the intent to place those assets beyond the reach of his creditors.havoco,at.the bankruptcy court further concluded that florida fraudulent conveyance statute did not affect the debtor right to the homestead exemption.id.the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court decision.
the eleventh circuit,detailing the inconsistent treatment of the issue in the bankruptcy courts stemming from this court application of the homestead exemption,certified the instant question to this court 
the homestead exemption 
florida homestead exemption provides,in pertinent part 
there shall be exempt from forced sale under process of any court,and no judgment,decree or execution shall be a lien thereon,except for the payment of taxes and assessments thereon,obligations contracted for the purchase,improvement or repair thereof,or obligations contracted for house,field or other labor performed on the realty,the following property owned by a natural person 
a homestead 
art.x,a.const.this court has long emphasized that the homestead exemption is to be liberally construed in the interest of protecting the family home.see,milton milton,so,organic and statutory provisions relating to homestead exemptions should be liberally construed in the interest of the family home.however,in the same breath we have similarly cautioned that the exemption is not to be so liberally construed as to make it an instrument of fraud or imposition upon creditors t he homestead exemption should not be so applied as to make it an instrument of fraud or imposition upon creditors.id.the petitioner and amici curiae seize upon this latter language to argue that the transfer of nonexempt assets into an exempt homestead with the intent to defraud creditors can not receive constitutional sanction.while we are certainly loathe to provide constitutional sanction to the conduct alleged by the petitioner and implicated by the certified question,this court is powerless to depart from the plain language of article x,section 
treatment of the exemption 
as previously mentioned,this court homestead exemption jurisprudence has long been guided by a policy favoring the liberal construction of the exemption organic and statutory provisions relating to homestead exemptions should be liberally construed in the interest of the family home.milton,so.at.a concomitant in harmony with this rule of liberal construction is the rule of strict construction as applied to the exceptions.see,quigley kennedy ely,so d,indeed,this strict construction of the exceptions proved paramount in our most recent inquiries into the homestead exemption in the context of civil and criminal forfeitures.
the forfeiture cases 
in butterworth caggiano,so d,the state sought civil forfeiture of caggiano residence following caggiano conviction on one count of racketeering in violation of the florida racketeer influenced and corrupt organization act and fifteen counts of bookmaking.the state sought forfeiture of caggiano homestead on the grounds that the property was used by caggiano in the course of racketeering activity.id.
this court,in rejecting the state attempted distinction between forfeitures and the constitution reference to forced sale s,held that article x,section prohibited the forfeiture of caggiano homestead 
consequently,in light of the historical prejudice against forfeiture,the constitutional sanctity of the home,and the rules of construction requiring a liberal,nontechnical interpretation of the homestead exemption and a strict construction of the exceptions to that exemption,we hold that article x,section of the florida constitution prohibits civil or criminal forfeiture of homestead property.
id.at.while our conclusion was influenced by the legally disfavored status of forfeitures paramount in our reasoning was the plain language of the homestead provision and the strict construction of the exceptions enumerated therein 
most significantly,article x,section expressly provides for three exceptions to the homestead exemption.forfeiture is not one of them.according to the plain and unambiguous wording of article x,section,a homestead is only subject to forced sale for the payment of taxes and assessments thereon obligations contracted for the purchase,improvement or repair thereof or obligations contracted for house,field or other labor performed on the realty.under the rule expressio unius est exclusio alterious the expression of one thing is the exclusion of are not excluded from the homestead exemption because they are not mentioned,either expressly or by reasonable implication,in the three exceptions that are expressly stated.
id.at first emphasis added.notably,we rejected the state attempt to imply an exception for homesteads acquired through criminal or immoral conduct 
the homestead provision of our constitution sets forth the exceptions and provides the method of waiving the homestead rights attached to the residence.these exceptions are unqualified.they create no personal qualifications touching the moral character of the resident nor do they undertake to exclude the vicious,the criminal,or the immoral from the benefits so provided.the law provides for punishment of persons convicted of illegal acts,but this forfeiture of homestead rights guaranteed by our constitution is not part of the punishment.
id.at alteration in original quoting state ex rel.apt mitchell.we were again faithful to our strict construction of the exceptions to the exemption five years later in tramel stewart,so d.
in tramel,the stewarts faced forfeiture of their homestead under the florida contraband forfeiture act after they were arrested for selling marijuana and a search of their home revealed drugs,drug paraphernalia,and a sophisticated marijuana growing operation the state thus sought forfeiture of the stewarts real and personal property,claiming that the property was either being used as an instrumentality of the drug operation or that the property was acquired with funds obtained from the drug activity.consistent with caggiano,we held 
as we found in respect to the florida rico act in caggiano,we find that article x,section,does not provide an exception for the forfeiture of homestead property for a violation of the forfeiture act.the homestead guarantee uses broad language protecting the homestead from involuntary divestiture by the courts.the constitutional protection of homesteads has not changed since our discussion in caggiano to include forfeiture as one of the enumerated exceptions.in the absence of such a provision,this court can not judicially create one.
tramel,so d at citation omitted emphasis added indeed,it is on the strength of our decisions in caggiano and tramel that several federal courts have rejected attempts by creditors to enforce claims against homestead property.
in bank leumi trust lang,the langs,new jersey residents,owned and operated a new jersey educational training business for which they secured million in financing from bank leumi in exchange for corporate promissory notes and personal guarantees.id.at.the langs business filed for bankruptcy in and bank leumi filed suit in new jersey federal district court to collect on the langs debt in april of.id.in may of,the langs sold their new jersey home for,purchasing a home the following month in palm beach gardens,florida,for id.bank leumi obtained a million judgment against the langs in november of and filed a postjudgment petition seeking to enforce the judgment against the langs palm beach gardens home.id.
in its findings of fact,the district court determined that the langs converted their nonexempt assets into the exempt homestead for the sole purpose of hindering and avoiding their creditors and defeating their claims.id.at.nevertheless,the court concluded,albeit reluctantly,that florida homestead exemption did not except property acquired with the intent to hinder and defeat the claims of creditors from its protection 
t he homestead exemption does not contain an exception for real property which is acquired in the state of florida for the sole purpose of defeating the claims of creditors.in light of the supreme court admonition in caggiano that the three exceptions to the homestead exemption should be read narrowly,this court is unwilling to graft an additional exception.
id.at.several bankruptcy courts have followed bank leumi s lead,reading the exceptions to the exemption strictly consistent with caggiano and tramel.see in re young,in re hendricks,in re lazin,in re clements,in re lane,in re popek.
nevertheless,the petitioner and amici curiae argue that this court has not hesitated to reach beyond the literal language of the exemption to allow the imposition of equitable liens against homestead property used as an instrument of fraud or imposition upon creditors.milton,so.at.admittedly,we have strayed from the literal language of the exemption where the equities have demanded it however,we have done so rarely and always with due regard to the exceptions provided in article x,section.
fishbein and the equitable lien cases 
in palm beach savings loan ass fishbein,so d,this court allowed an equitable lien against homestead property in favor of a lender,where the debtor husband fraudulently obtained a loan and used the loan to satisfy three preexisting mortgages on the homestead property.specifically,in march of,fishbein borrowed million from a palm beach bank,securing the debt with a mortgage on the house he owned with his wife.prior to his marriage,fishbein owned the house subject to two mortgages.following their marriage,and fishbein received a third mortgage in which they acknowledged the existence of the prior mortgages.
in securing the million loan,fishbein,while engaged in dissolution proceedings with his wife,forged his wife signature on the mortgage.fishbein used approximately of the loan to satisfy the three existing mortgages and taxes on the property.in august of,the fishbeins entered into a property settlement,in which fishbein agreed to buy his wife a home and pay her in exchange for her relinquishment of any interest in the palm beach house.as collateral,fishbein gave his wife attorney a quitclaim deed conveying the palm beach house to his wife and himself.fishbein represented that the house was clear of all liens except for those claimed by his mother and sister.he failed to comply with the property settlement agreement,and the palm beach house went into default.after the bank initiated foreclosure proceedings,fishbein moved back into the house.fishbein was awarded the house nunc pro tunc after the judge in the dissolution proceeding set aside the property settlement agreement for fraud in the procurement.
in the foreclosure proceeding the trial judge allowed an equitable lien on the property to the extent that the loan proceeds were used to satisfy the existing mortgages and property taxes.on appeal,the fourth district held that the bank was not entitled to an equitable lien because fishbein was not guilty of fraudulent or egregious conduct.
we agreed with the trial court and allowed the bank an equitable lien against fishbein homestead,accepting the bank argument that although it could not foreclose on the mortgage under the literal language of the exemption it should be entitled to a lien under the doctrine of equitable subrogation as its loan proceeds were used to satisfy the prior liens against the home.fishbein,so d at.stated differently,we allowed the palm beach bank to stand in the shoes of the prior mortgagees who would have been entitled to proceed against the fishbeins homestead under the express terms of article x,section.
as we emphasized in fishbein,the imposition of an equitable lien in circumstances suggesting the use of fraud in the acquisition of the homestead was not a remedy of recent vintage w here equity demands it this court has not hesitated to permit equitable liens to be imposed on homesteads beyond the literal language of article x,section.fishbein,so d at.
in jones carpenter,so,this court allowed the trustee of a bankrupt bread company to have an equitable lien against the homestead of its former president where the former president embezzled corporate funds to make improvements on his homestead the court concluded that the trustee claims fell within the exceptions to the exemption the funds involved in this litigation were all spent for labor and improvements on the house which appellee seeks to exempt and are clearly within the qualifications to his homestead as above enumerated.jones,so.at.as in fishbein,we employed the doctrine of equitable subrogation to accommodate the trustee claim within the exceptions to the exemption appellant,who steps into the shoes of the bread company,can not follow said funds or materials into carpenter home and recover them,they having been so converted,but he can subject the home to the repayment or restoration of said funds.see also greta kolcon,common law equity defeats florida homestead exemption,at,equitable subrogation,a sister remedy to the equitable lien,places one party to whom a particular right does not legally belong in the position of the right legal owner.
six years later in craven hartley,so,we again approved the imposition of an equitable lien against homestead property where hartley loaned craven money to complete craven purchase of a home from a third party in exchange for a promise by craven that she would execute a mortgage in his favor for the amount loaned as security.craven,however,failed to execute the mortgage to hartley once she secured her deed and hartley then filed suit obtaining an equitable lien against craven home and a judicial sale to satisfy the amount loaned.craven then filed suit seeking to have her land declared exempt from judicial sale as her homestead.we phrased the issue as follows it is agreed by both parties that the sole question presented here is whether or not under the facts stated the loan of can be held to be an obligation contracted for the purchase of said property within the terms of section of article of the constitution relating to married women property.id.at.
the court followed jones,once again invoking equitable principles to countenance hartley claim within the exceptions 
w hen she borrowed the from appellee and made the final payment thereon,the said loan to all intents and purposes became the price of property purchased by her,and that said lands immediately became charged in equity for the payment of said loan.
when appellant declined to execute the mortgage according to her promise,appellee was within his rights in seeking to have an equitable lien impressed on said lands under the doctrine announced by this court in jones carpenter,so.this holding is in harmony with spirit and terms of section of article of the constitution relating to homestead exemptions,as it is there provided that no property shall be exempt from any contract for the purchase price thereof,nor can the homestead exemption supersede prior judgments or liens.pasco harley,so.
hartley,so.at.
in lamar lechlider,so,we again allowed an equitable lien where the plaintiffs made valuable improvements to the defendant homestead with the understanding that they were acquiring an interest therein.recognizing,as we did in jones,that the plaintiffs claims did not come within the literal terms of the exemption,we nonetheless indirectly accommodated their claims within the exceptions to prevent the unjust enrichment of the defendant 
this court holds that the lien of plaintiffs is enforceable against the homestead of defendants,upon the theory that since the plaintiffs have innocently,and in the belief that they had the right to do so,with the consent of the holder of the legal title,placed on his land permanent and valuable improvements,it would be inequitable to permit the owner to retain the improvements without compensating the parties who placed them there for their reasonable value that so to permit him to retain them would be unjustly to enrich him.
lamar,so.at.
similarly,in sonneman tuszynski,so,we imposed an equitable lien in favor of the plaintiff,an elderly woman who advanced the defendant money and domestic services which the defendant used to purchase and operate a tourist camp with the understanding that the defendant would take care of her for the remainder of her life.the defendant reneged on that promise and we allowed an equitable lien against the defendant tourist camp,concluding that the plaintiff was entitled to the same on the strength of the money and sweat equity she invested in the property 
it may be reasonably inferred from the testimony adduced in this case that the money advanced by the plaintiff to the defendant was used by him in purchasing the tourist camp near tampa during the month of january.her services and labor were factors that aided the defendant in accumulating the money placed into the tourist camp and it appears from the evidence that an equitable lien exists in her behalf on the tourist camp property for the money advanced and the work and labor by her performed for the defendant.
the petitioner argues that this court through its equitable lien jurisprudence has created a fourth exception to the homestead exemption excepting homesteads claimed in the furtherance of fraud from the protection of article x,section.the petitioner is not alone in this belief.see in re tabone,t he florida supreme court has already engrafted an exception to the homestead provision in the florida constitution in order to prevent unjust enrichment.in re lazin,reading fishbein to create fourth exception where nonexempt funds are fraudulently obtained and used to acquire a homestead or pay off a mortgage on the homestead.
in fact,several bankruptcy courts have relied on fishbein and the cases preceding it to deny homestead claims or impose equitable liens where the evidence established that the transfer of assets to the homestead was accomplished with the intent to shield assets from creditors or with fraudulently obtained assets.see in re tabone,denying homestead exemption to the extent the homestead was purchased with funds impermissibly converted from nonexempt to exempt assets in re grocki,imposing equitable lien against debtor homestead where funds used by debtor to acquire homestead could be traced to those fraudulently obtained from plaintiff creditor in re south florida title,imposing equitable lien in favor of bankruptcy trustee where debtors used improperly appropriated corporate funds to satisfy mortgage on homestead in re gherman,denying homestead exemption where debtor used funds stolen to acquire exempt property see also in re pomerantz,denying debtor discharge from bankruptcy where evidence established that debtor,a new york resident,transferred nonexempt assets into a florida homestead for the purposes of defrauding creditor in re bandkau,denying homestead exemption to the extent debtors converted nonexempt assets into the homestead for purposes of shielding their assets from a creditor in re coplan,denying homestead exemption to wisconsin residents who moved to florida and purchased homestead shortly before their business filed for bankruptcy to the extent the debtors received a greater benefit under florida law than would have been available to them under wisconsin exemption laws.
nevertheless,in caggiano we cautioned that our equitable lien jurisprudence should not be read too broadly 
all of the cases cited by the state where a court has actually imposed a lien on the homestead in question,however,are either factually or legally inapposite.virtually all of the relevant cases involve situations that fell within one of the three stated exceptions to the homestead provision.most of those cases involve equitable liens that were imposed where proceeds from fraud or reprehensible conduct were used to invest in,purchase,or improve the homestead.see,jones carpenter,so,la mar,so.other relevant cases cited involve situations where an equitable lien was necessary to secure to an owner the benefit of his or her interest in the property.see,tullis tullis,so d,we hold,with the first district,that our constitutional provisions allow the partition and forced sale of homestead property upon suit by one of the owners of that property,if such partition and forced sale is necessary to protect the beneficial enjoyment of the owners in common to the extent of their interest in the property.in particular,tullis involved a marital situation with joint homestead property.in no other case has this court imposed a lien on a homestead beyond one of the three stated exceptions in the constitutional provision.the court in bessemer gersten specifically did not address the issue of whether the lien came within one of the stated exceptions to the homestead exemption.so d at.
caggiano,so d at.we reiterated that position in tramel in rejecting the state attempts to extend our holding in fishbein to allow the forfeiture of homestead property and do so again tod
