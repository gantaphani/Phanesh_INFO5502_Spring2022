ritchie special credit investments,et collectively,ritchie twice sought to intervene into an adversary proceeding initiated by the government pursuant to against minnesota businessman thomas petters,certain businesses that petters owned,including petters group worldwide,llc,pgw,and other individuals.the action alleged that petters and his associates orchestrated an extensive and ponzi scheme the government obtained a temporary restraining order freezing assets,and shortly thereafter petters stipulated to a preliminary injunction freezing assets,appointing a receiver,and staying litigation against petters and his corporations and all subsidiaries.ritchie alleges that it is a secured creditor of petters businesses with security interests in certain of the restrained assets.ritchie attempted to appoint its own receiver in its first motion to intervene but did not directly challenge the injunction.in ritchie second motion to subject of this challenged the receivership and asset freeze orders.the district denied ritchie second motion to intervene,finding it untimely and that sufficient evidence supported the injunction.
ritchie makes three arguments on appeal the district court abused its discretion in finding ritchie motion untimely because ritchie had proper justification for any delay,the litigation had not progressed to a point whereby intervention would be unfeasible,and the be prejudiced by denying the motion when ritchie could not adequately protect its security interests in bankruptcy court the district court violated ritchie due process rights by denying the motion and the injunction lacks evidentiary support as it pertains to pgw and its subsidiaries,and the district court erred in preventing ritchie to intervene to challenge the injunction on those grounds.for the reasons stated below,we affirm.
background 
a.the indictment 
this case arises from the government use of the injunction statute,to preserve assets for the benefit of the victims of allegedly the ponzi scheme in this country history,with fraud proceeds in excess of billion following an investigation into this scheme,petters and two of his companies,pgw and petters company,pci,were indicted for mail fraud,wire fraud,conspiracy,and money laundering.petters individually was tried by jury and convicted on all counts on december.
the indictment charged that pci and pgw did knowingly devise and participate in a scheme and artifice to defraud and to obtain billions of dollars in money and property by means of materially false and fraudulent pretenses,representations,and promises and that pgw and its agents made numerous false statements,false representations and material omissions to fraudulently induce investors to provide defendants pci and pgw with billions of dollars.
ritchie involvement 
the ritchie appellants are all entities among the many creditors of petters,pci,and pgw.ritchie alleges that it holds several security interests in polaroid and another petters subsidiary,petters capital,llc petters capital,worth approximately million.by a series of promissory notes made between february,and february,petters and pgw borrowed million from ritchie.on may,ritchie made additional loans to petters,pgw,and pci in the principal amount of million,evidenced by two promissory notes together with the february notes,the ritchie notes.
on september,ritchie and the borrowers extended the due date of the ritchie notes to december,and reduced the interest rate.polaroid and petters capital pledged certain assets to secure the new debt terms polaroid delivered a security agreement pledging polaroid trademarks in brazil,india,and china and the proceeds and products thereof,and petters capital pledged secured and unsecured promissory notes from polaroid in the face amount of million.the petters capital notes were secured by polaroid assets.these liens and interests are now in dispute in a pending bankruptcy action.polaroid ritchie capital.
on september,after details of a federal investigation into the petters ponzi scheme became known,ritchie served its borrowers with a notice of default that declared all outstanding amounts on the ritchie notes immediately due and payable and shortly thereafter brought a state court action in illinois against petters,pgw,and pci the illinois action to enforce the ritchie notes.in the illinois action,ritchie and other petters creditors obtained orders entered september,and october,freezing the assets of pgw and pci and appointing a the assets of those entities.
c.the injunction 
on october,the government initiated this action by filing a civil complaint under to prevent the dissipation of assets by petters,pgw,pci,and others involved in the ponzi scheme.the district court issued several orders under that operated,in relevant part,to freeze the assets of petters,pgw,pci and all entities owned or controlled by them appoint douglas kelley as receiver of pgw,pci,and their related entities,including polaroid and stay all litigation against the covered entities.
on october,the government and petters,individually and as percent owner of pci and pgw,stipulated to entry of the district court orders collectively,injunction,which froze petters assets and appointed kelley as receiver of those assets.fbi special agent eileen rice supported the injunction motion with an affidavit.agent rice investigation included the execution of numerous search warrants for documents,records,and proceeds from illegal activities,and the subsequent investigation and analysis of evidence seized pursuant to these warrants.agent rice affidavit outlined a scheme whereby petters,along with employees of pci and other petters entities,induced investors to provide financing to pci based on fictitious documents that petters associates prepared.the documents purported to purchase merchandise for pci,which pci would then resell.in reality,no merchandise was purchased,and instead the money that petters raised through pci was used for his other business ventures and to support his extravagant lifestyle.
the enjoined assets became subject to a receivership that kelley directed.the scope of the receivership included,inter alia,the corporate assets of pgw and pci,as named defendants,as well as polaroid.the injunction also imposed a stay of litigation against the named defendants,including polaroid,and the receivership assets.the injunction gave kelley broad powers to take possession of and manage the assets of petters,pgw,pci,and other individual and corporate defendants liquidate and sell assets and assume control of and manage ongoing businesses.kelley was also given specific authority to file bankruptcy petitions to preserve assets.the injunction stated that a ny bankruptcy cases so commenced by the receiver shall during their pendency be governed by and administered pursuant to the requirements of the united states bankruptcy code,section et,and the applicable federal rules of bankruptcy procedure.
ritchie alleges that neither the stipulation nor the injunction including pgw was based on any new admissible evidence about pgw or its subsidiaries.ritchie therefore challenges the addition of pgw with its subsidiaries petters capital and polaroid to the scope of the injunction,alleging that the court added pgw without the evidentiary showing that requires.to support its contention,ritchie notes that the injunction contains nine findings of fact,but none mention pgw,petters capital,or polaroid.instead,the findings recite that there is probable cause to believe that certain defendants have committed the fraud described in.
ritchie first motion to intervene 
ritchie first moved to intervene in this action on october,immediately after petters stipulated to entry of the injunction.ritchie asked the district court to defer to the illinois court as a matter of comity.ritchie did not then challenge the factual basis for the district court orders,petters authority to stipulate to the orders,or the appointment of a receiver.ritchie argued that it should be allowed to intervene to seek appointment of procida the illinois action receiver as receiver for both pgw and pci because ritchie had a substantial interest in the litigation and because kelley was not qualified to maximize the potential recovery for pgw and pci creditors.on october,the district court denied ritchie motion to intervene,stating that n o showing has been made that the court appointed receiver will not adequately represent the interests of all victims of the alleged fraud scheme.ritchie did not appeal.on october,the illinois circuit court ruled that its september,and october,orders had expired and were of no effect,ending illinois interest in the case.
e.the bankruptcies 
on october,kelley filed for chapter bankruptcy relief for pci,pgw,and certain related petters entities.the bankruptcy court appointed kelley as the chapter trustee of pgw and pci.ritchie objected to kelley appointment as trustee,arguing that kelley role as a receiver,charged with obtaining maximum recovery for fraud victims,posed a conflict of interest with the role of a trustee,charged with protecting creditors interests.ritchie further argued that kelley dual service as trustee for both pgw and pci also presented a conflict due to the likelihood of cross claims running between the two bankruptcy estates.the bankruptcy court overruled ritchie objections,finding that no conflict existed at the time and that any future conflicts could be addressed if and when they arose.according to the court,there was no indication in the record that kelley had ever taken any action that was,contrary to the interests of the bankruptcy estates,or in any way inconsistent with the obligations of a fiduciary steward of the estates.accordingly,the bankruptcy court approved kelley appointment as chapter trustee for both pgw and pci.pgw and pci each scheduled the ritchie claims as disputed in the bankruptcy proceedings.
ritchie appealed that order to the district court.on september,the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court decision to appoint kelley as chapter trustee and to authorize him to secure and hold assets.in so doing,the district court noted that kelley obligations did not give rise to an adverse interest that would prevent him from serving as a chapter trustee and emphasized that there was no present justification for separate bankruptcy trustees for the interests of pgw and pci.
on december,polaroid filed for chapter bankruptcy relief.because polaroid executive management remained intact,polaroid ceo mary jeffries executed the bankruptcy petition and no trustee was needed.polaroid became a chapter dip.pursuant to its powers as a dip,polaroid filed an adversary proceeding under against ritchie in the bankruptcy case,seeking to avoid ritchie liens as fraudulent and preferential transfers.this particular adversary proceeding is pending.see,supra,polaroid ritchie capital.
polaroid was offered for sale in march,and ritchie objected.following an auction,the bankruptcy court approved a sale of polaroid assets for million.see in re polaroid,wl,at cir.july,per curiam.the order approving the sale expressly states that any liens of parties,such as ritchie,remain because those liens attach to the proceeds of the sale with the same validity,priority and effect and to the same extent that existed immediately prior to the consummation of the sale and in all cases subject to any and all rights,claims and defenses that the debtors may have with respect thereto.
ritchie second motion to intervene 
on march,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure,ritchie filed a second motion to intervene in the action against petters and sought to challenge the underlying factual support for the injunction.ritchie sought to intervene for the purpose of asking the district court to vacate the injunction restraining the assets of pgw and to remove pgw and polaroid from the receivership.ritchie,in moving to intervene as of right to challenge the injunction as to pgw and its subsidiaries,argued that kelley was actively opposing,rather than representing,ritchie interests and that the asset freeze and receivership orders were improper as to pgw and its subsidiaries because the government had offered no evidence that pgw or its subsidiaries were engaged in or about to commit fraud pgw or its subsidiaries were alienating or disposing of property or pgw or its subsidiaries were assets traceable in any way to the alleged fraud.
the government opposed ritchie motion,arguing that ritchie in actuality issued the entire loan proceeds to just papered the loans as loans to pgw and that polaroid and petters capital received no consideration to justify the security interests they pledged so that ritchie was not a secured creditor of pgw or its subsidiaries.the government contended that the injunction was justified because pgw was property of equivalent value to property derived from fraud.
finally,the government presented new information in the form of an affidavit from kelley to suggest that the purchase of polaroid by pgw was funded by dirty money,funds pci had obtained from fraud victims.the government ultimately argued that the injunction was proper to restrain pgw and its subsidiaries.
on april,the district court denied ritchie second motion to intervene,finding it untimely because ritchie knew about the injunction from its inception ritchie did not show changed circumstances from its earlier motion to intervene because ritchie does not identify any change in the quality or quantity of proof supporting the issuance of the injunction and the creditors who have invested much time into the polaroid bankruptcy proceeding would be prejudiced if ritchie were permitted to intervene to challenge the injunction.the district court also found that ritchie could protect its security interests and liens in the polaroid and petters capital bankruptcy court proceedings.
the court also noted that there was sufficient evidence,including but not limited to petters stipulation and the superseding indictment,to justify imposition of the receivership and litigation stay.the district court found that the entry of the injunction in this case was not based solely on the stipulations by the defendants,but also upon a substantial showing that the injunction and its scope were properly justified under.
ii.discussion 
ritchie makes three arguments on appeal the district court abused its discretion in finding ritchie motion untimely because ritchie had proper justification for any delay,the litigation had not progressed to a point whereby intervention would be unfeasible,and the be prejudiced by denying the motion if ritchie could not adequately protect its security interests in bankruptcy court the district court violated ritchie due process rights by denying the motion and the injunction lacks evidentiary support as it pertains to pgw and its subsidiaries and the district court erred in denying ritchie permission to intervene to challenge the injunction on those grounds.
timeliness 
ritchie first argues that its motion to intervene was timely under eighth circuit common law principles.ritchie concedes that in some circumstances the delay between the entry of the injunction and the filing of the second motion to intervene would constitute an untimely filing.ritchie maintains,however,that changed circumstances legally justified the delay.
the government responds that the litigation has progressed substantially and with ritchie active participation,rendering ritchie new motion untimely.additionally,the government asserts that ritchie has not shown that it will be harmed if not allowed to intervene and none of ritchie rights have been impaired.the government also argues that ritchie has an adequate remedy to protect its interests in bankruptcy court.
