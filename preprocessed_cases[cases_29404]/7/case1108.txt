the central issue in this case is whether a regulation promulgated by the secretary of education that allows the assessment of collection costs on defaulted student loans to be done on a formulaic basis was a permissible implementation of the governing statute.the district court upheld the regulation,b,over the objection of a bankruptcy trustee,and accordingly allowed the claim for collection costs computed according to the regulation.the trustee appeals.we agree with the district court that the regulation was a permissible one,and we therefore affirm.
in,north shore savings,a private financial institution,issued two federal family education loan program ffelp loans,totaling and,to david barnes for truck driving school.two years later,barnes defaulted on the repayment of both loans.at the time barnes loans were issued,a borrower was in default if the borrower failed to keep up with her monthly payments for days currently the time period for default is days.see l.under ffelp,the federal government subsidizes student loans issued by private financial institutions and guaranteed by state or private agencies and reinsures these loans for losses,such as those caused by a borrower default.when barnes defaulted,north shore savings filed a claim against the original guarantor of barnes student great lakes higher education corporation great lakes.great lakes paid the claim,took an assignment of barnes student loans,and was subsequently reimbursed by the united states department of education the department.
for approximately six years,great lakes unsuccessfully attempted to recover barnes student loan debt.in,reporting that it was unable to collect the loan,great lakes assigned barnes student loans to the department.the department made further futile attempts at collection until november,when barnes,along with his wife nancy,filed for bankruptcy under chapter of the bankruptcy code.
on march,about four months after barnes and his wife filed their chapter petition,the department assigned barnes student loans to the educational credit management corporation ecmc,a corporation that acts as a guarantee agency and occasionally handles the defaulted ffelp loans of debtors who file a petition for relief under chapter.shortly after this assignment,ecmc filed an unsecured proof of claim in barnes bankruptcy proceeding for,which represented in principal and interest on barnes two defaulted student loans and in collection costs.the collection costs were approximately of the total of the principal and interest barnes owed by then.the district court indicated that collection costs were as opposed to the ecmc set forth in its proof of claim.although nothing turns on the cent difference,the district court should make this correction after it receives our mandate.ecmc arrived at this figure by using the methodology prescribed in b and c,which allows the use of a flat make whole rate,in lieu of actual collection costs in the particular case.
on april,joseph black,the chapter trustee,objected to ecmc proof of claim in bankruptcy court.although he did not dispute ecmc claim for the principal and interest on the defaulted student loans,he argued that the assessment of collection costs calculated as a percentage of barnes loan balance,as opposed to the actual costs ecmc incurred while attempting to collect barnes loan,was unreasonable and should not be allowed by the bankruptcy court.the flat rate was especially inappropriate,black argued,because ecmc received the assignment of barnes loans four months after he filed his chapter petition and,thus it had made no collection efforts.in its response to the trustee objection,ecmc defended both the accuracy of its calculations and its right to use the method set forth in the higher education act hea,b and its implementing regulation,b.black replied that the regulation itself was arbitrary,capricious,and manifestly contrary to the hea and thus could not be used.
on november,ecmc moved to withdraw reference from bankruptcy court,in accordance with d,arguing that resolution of barnes objection to the proof of claim required consideration of federal statutes and regulations outside of the bankruptcy code.although the district court initially denied ecmc motion,it later took this step,reasoning that the issues black had raised require d the interpretation,as opposed to mere application,of the statute.matter of vicars ins.agency,cir.shortly thereafter,the secretary of education intervened in the litigation to defend the regulation.the district court rejected black challenge and upheld the legality of b,concluding that the assessment of collection costs as a percentage for borrowers in default was not arbitrary or manifestly contrary to the statute,which permits guaranty agencies to charge reasonable collection costs.see b.
the higher education act,et,established the federal guaranteed student loan program in the.out of concern for the significant financial problems that defaulted student loans pose for the fisc,congress enacted the higher education amendments in,which include a provision allowing guarantors to assess collection costs against borrowers in default.specifically,the statute provides that a borrower who has defaulted on a loan shall be required to pay reasonable collection costs.b.the statute has nothing further to say about the meaning of reasonable collection costs.instead,congress left it up to the secretary to interpret that term through regulations.see chevron,res.def.council,d if congress has explicitly left a gap for the agency to fill,there is an express delegation of authority to the agency to elucidate a specific provision of the statute by regulation.as the supreme court recently reiterated,d eference in accordance with chevron is warranted only when it appears that congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law,and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.united states mead,d.otherwise,the interpretation is entitled to respect only to the extent it has the power to persuade.skidmore swift.gonzales oregon,d.

in response to this delegation of authority,the secretary issued,which establishes the basic rules for the assessment of collection costs against borrowers who have defaulted on their student loans.this regulation begins by providing that a guaranty agency shall charge a borrower an amount equal to reasonable costs incurred by the agency in collecting a loan on which the agency has paid a default or bankruptcy claim.b.these costs may include,but are not limited to,all attorney fees,collection agency charges,and court costs.id.it then goes on to adopt a mathematical formula the details of which are not important in this appeal to determine the precise amount a guarantor may charge a borrower for collection costs.see.the key point for our purposes is that the secretary allows guaranty agencies to charge borrowers a percentage for collection costs that takes into account the total costs associated with the agency entire defaulted student loan portfolio,as opposed to requiring the agency to track the individual charges associated with the collection of a particular borrower account.the total collection costs for any borrower may not exceed the amount the same borrower would be charged for the cost of collection if the loan were held by the department which,at the time of this litigation,was a flat rate of of the outstanding principal and interest,see.based upon ecmc total
