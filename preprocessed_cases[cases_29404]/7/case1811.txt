on page,delete the text from section.and substitute the following in its place 
pursuant to court order,on march,vortex submitted a list of its creditors to the bankruptcy court.it was agreed that this list could not be released without a court order.appellants never moved for the list to be released.instead,they argue that the bankruptcy court was required to notify each of the creditors on the list of the pending involuntary petition.they base their claim on federal rule of bankruptcy procedure b,which reads 
b joinder of petitioners after filing.if the answer to an involuntary petition filed by fewer than three creditors avers the existence of or more creditors,the debtor shall file with the answer a list of all creditors with their addresses,a brief statement of the nature of their claims,and the amounts thereof.if it appears that there are or more creditors as provided in b of the code,the court shall afford a reasonable opportunity for other creditors to join in the petition before a hearing is held thereon.
fed.bank.b.
rule b implements a portion of the c joinder provision.after an involuntary petition is filed but before the case is dismissed or relief is ordered,any other creditor with a noncontingent,unsecured claim may join in the petition with the same effect as if such joining creditor were a petitioning creditor in the original petition.c in re kidwell,intervention is of right per.a,canute pittsburgh wv coal.
any such joinder occurs in the context of expeditious litigation mandated by federal rule of bankruptcy procedure a t he court shall determine the issues of a contested involuntary petition at the earliest practicable time and forthwith enter an appropriate dispositive order.fed.bankr.a kidwell,at.similarly,the rules call for simplified litigation procedure consistent with expedition,fed.bankr.
rule b requires that the bankruptcy court pause before hearing on the merits of an involuntary petition in only one circumstance.it must assure that other creditors have a reasonable opportunity to exercise their c statutory power to join as petitioners when the alleged debtor answer to the petition filed by fewer than three petitioners asserts that the petition fails the b requirement for debtors with twelve or more creditors.kidwell,at in re iowa coal min,elsub,at.the rule,which functions to provide an opportunity to moot a defense of insufficiency in the number of petitioners,is needed because all creditors do not necessarily receive notice of an involuntary case until there is an order for relief adjudicating the merits of the petition in favor of the petitioning creditors.fed.bankr.f.
if there are three or more petitioners,then the rules do not require a reasonable opportunity to join and leave to judicial discretion the question of how much opportunity to afford other creditors to exercise their c joinder right.
both the reasonableness of the opportunity to join required by rule b in cases with one or two petitioners and the exercise of discretion over the opportunity to join in cases is measured in the context of the rule a mandate that the court resolve the merits of the involuntary petition at the earliest practicable time.
there were four petitioners in this instance.hence,the bankruptcy court had discretion over the notice to be afforded to other creditors before hearing the involuntary petition on the merits.
we can not say,in the face of rule a and of the omission of the appellants to ask that the creditor list be released,that the bankruptcy court abused its discretion when it proceeded to determine the merits of the contested involuntary whether vortex was generally paying its debts as they came requiring specific notification of other creditors.
this is a case in which an ousted business partner has attempted to force an involuntary bankruptcy in order to gain a business advantage.it calls for this court to determine the test to be used in determining whether a dispute is bona fide for the purposes of filing an involuntary bankruptcy petition under.we adopt the objective test used by the other circuits and affirm the bankruptcy appellate panel dismissal of the petition.
in,ray scott and wes higgins signed an agreement to form vortex fishing systems vortex,a company that manufactures blinking and beeping fishing lures.at the time,scott agreed to provide capital as a minority shareholder while higgins ran the business from kalispell,montana.in,scott still had not seen a profit and became more involved in the business.in what appears to have been a fairly acrimonious series of events,he flew into kalispell,got an accountant,and became the majority shareholder in the summer of.today,higgins maintains his shares in the company.scott investment is now shares.
by all accounts,scott took over a company in serious debt,both to the irs and to various creditors.some of these debts were to current business contacts,while others were to companies that had originally developed the technology and equipment to make vortex lures.the pertinent debts are described in some detail below.
vortex stayed in business and began to make progress on repaying its debts.in the late,scott moved the company to arizona.around the same time,he was approached by rodger ford,a businessman interested in purchasing vortex for his two sons.although scott and ford failed to reach an agreement on terms for selling the company,ford and higgins subsequently met privately with each other to discuss ford continuing interest in vortex.
higgins and ford began then exploring the possibility of filing an involuntary bankruptcy petition.because vortex had more than creditors,at least three creditors with claims not subject to a bona fide dispute had to join the involuntary petition.b.in and,higgins was assigned the claims of two of vortex putative creditors he also has a claim as an agent in one of vortex predecessors,vortex lures partnership vlp.at the same time,higgins and ford contacted other creditors of vortex to see who would be interested in joining a petition for involuntary bankruptcy.
the initial petition for involuntary bankruptcy,filed on january,included four petitioning creditors,liberty tool manufacturing,liberty tool,vortex lures ltd vlp,and viking lures manufacturing,viking.on february,filed a motion to withdraw as a petitioning creditor,citing a misunderstanding of the nature of the procedure as its reason for withdrawing.the bankruptcy court granted this motion on february.on march,bert and leora vincent,higgins,filed a motion to join the involuntary petition,which the court granted.on march,the bankruptcy court conducted a hearing on the involuntary petition.on april,and may,respectively,two additional creditors,telenational marketing and witchcraft tape products filed motions to join the involuntary petition.
on may,the bankruptcy court dismissed the involuntary petition without ruling on the recent motions to join or vortex opposition to these motions.the bankruptcy court found that the claims of liberty tool,vlp,viking,and the vincents were all subject to legal or factual dispute and that they were not bona fide creditors as required by b.it also found that vortex was generally paying its debts as they came due.
on appeal,the bankruptcy appellate panel bap affirmed the bankruptcy court dismissal of the involuntary petition.the bap held that claim had been properly dismissed and that the bankruptcy court had not clearly erred in determining that the claims of liberty tool,vortex lures,viking,and the vincents were subject to bona fide disputes.regarding the latter petitions to join,the bap ruled that witchcraft tape products was a proper petitioning creditor,but held that any error regarding the bankruptcy court failure to consider telenational marketing motion for joinder was harmless because on may,telenational filed a declaration stating that telenational marketing has not joined in any petition for involuntary bankruptcy against vortex fishing systems,emphasis in original.
the bap also held that bankruptcy rule b did not require the bankruptcy court to give notice to vortex other creditors and upheld the court determination that vortex was generally paying its debts as they came due.this timely appeal followed 
because appeals from the bap are subject to de novo review,this court independently reviews the bankruptcy court decision.in re mitchell,cir.we review conclusions of law de novo and conclusions of fact for clear error.in re chang,cir.a bankruptcy court exercise of discretion over a creditor voluntary withdrawal of claims is reviewed for abuse of discretion.in re lowenschuss,cir.
we have not previously had occasion to decide the appropriate standard of review for determinations of whether there is a bona fide dispute for the purposes of.we agree with the other circuits that have held that this is essentially a factual inquiry and adopt a clearly erroneous standard of review.see in re sims,cir in re rimell,cir.a bankruptcy court is not asked to evaluate the potential outcome of a dispute,but merely to determine whether there are facts that give rise to a legitimate disagreement over whether money is owed,or,in certain cases,how much.
before we can review the substance of the bankruptcy court decision,we must consider the standard that court used to find that there was an insufficient number of petitioning creditors.section requires that creditors filing a petition for involuntary bankruptcy against a debtor have claims that are not subject to a bona fide dispute.b.where there are twelve or more creditors,as here,three or more creditors without a bona fide dispute must file a petition,and the claims must aggregate at least.
we have previously held that the burden is on the petitioning creditors to show that no bona fide dispute exists.in re rubin,cir.this circuit has not defined a bona fide dispute,however,nor is it defined by statute.in the instant appeal,the bap adopted a test set out by the seventh circuit that requires the bankruptcy court to determine whether there is an objective basis for either a factual or a legal dispute as to the validity of the debt.in re busick,cir.
neither party contests this definition,and all other circuit courts that have considered the question have adopted some variation of busick objective test,first set out in in re lough,i f there is either a genuine issue of material fact that bears upon the debtor liability,or a meritorious contention as to the application of law to undisputed facts,then the petition must be dismissed.see busy beaver,cir sims,at cir.rimell,at cir.bartmann maverick tube,cir.see also in re eastown auto.
the alternative interpretation,adopted by some bankruptcy courts but largely discarded now,would be to apply a subjective standard and ask whether the claims were made in good faith.see in re johnston hawks.neither party advocates for this standard,and we see no reason to complicate our analysis with a subjective inquiry.as we have previously noted of the debate,t he ambiguity demonstrates why we should not use latin where english will do.in re seko investment,cir.we join our sister circuits in adopting the objective test for disputes regarding liability or amount 
we now turn to the claims of the petitioning creditors.
was the only initial petitioning creditor whose claim vortex did not dispute.a week after the involuntary petition was filed,wrote to higgins attorney,and asked to withdraw its name as a petitioning creditor.its manager wrote,we find that the facts are not exactly as represented in your letter and we therefore ask that our name be removed from this action.the bankruptcy court granted this motion,and took no part in any of the depositions or briefings in this case.appellants did not challenge motion to withdraw.
appellants contend that the court erred in allowing withdrawal not counting its claim to determine the sufficiency of the involuntary petition because its withdrawal arguably caused the petition to fail for lack of sufficient creditors.as the bap recognized,this is an attempt to apply case law without considering the underlying policy implications.more than seventy years ago,this circuit announced as a rather obvious proposition the rule that s ubsequent payment by the bankrupt of some of these creditors could not deprive the court of jurisdiction.reed thornton,cir.this rule has been adopted by bankruptcy courts seeking to prevent debtors from paying off petitioning creditors to the detriment of other creditors as a way of avoiding the involuntary petition.see in re carvalho,in re faberge restaurant of florida.as the bap noted,this policy concern is not implicated when a creditor seeks to withdraw based on a misunderstanding or misrepresentation as to the purpose and effect of a joinder.see in re elsub,discussing the policy concerns of the rule and its application in other cases.
appellants cite a single bankruptcy court case holding that a misled petitioner will not be allowed to withdraw if to do so would defeat the petition.in re molen drilling.in that case,however,granting the withdrawal would have defeated a dollar claim by the creditor solely for lack of sufficient number of involuntary petitioners under b.see id.here,the number of creditors was still sufficient had their claims been bona fide even after the court granted withdrawal.the molen court also supported its holding by finding that denial of the withdrawal motion was necessary to avoid collusion between the debtor and the creditors through payment of certain creditors claims as noted above,this policy consideration was not implicated here.
appellants contention calls for an omniscience far beyond the scope of the judiciary.at the time it made its motion,the bankruptcy court could well have believed that the three remaining petitioners had bona fide claims.if it had suspected that none of the other claims were bona fide,the court certainly was not obligated to force to remain a party on the chance that a bona fide creditor would turn up.the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in allowing to withdraw as an involuntary petitioner.
liberty and vortex predecessors 
in considering the claims of liberty and vortex predecessors,we find no new arguments raised by appellants that were not considered and ruled upon below.we adopt and affirm the following portion of the bap unpublished decision 
liberty produces plastic parts using a high pressure mold injection process.liberty claim against debtor vortex was based on an open account on which there were outstanding invoices with a balance owed of.from through august,debtor had periodically written liberty to apologize for and explain its payment delays.in october,debtor requested that liberty construct a new mold in exchange for a total payment of.the mold that debtor commissioned was never completed.
in june,in response to a complaint filed by liberty in district court in idaho related to the open account,debtor filed an answer and counterclaim.debtor denied that it owed liberty any money on the open account or that all the parts shipped to debtor had been accepted.additionally,debtor pled the following affirmative defenses impossibility of performance waiver of dealing failure to mitigate estoppel and price.
in determining that liberty claim was subject to a bona fide dispute,the bankruptcy court relied on the following evidence the parties current pending lawsuit in idaho in which the court had denied a motion for summary judgement the parties dispute regarding whether liberty breached an agreement to provide a mold for debtor,which the court held was an unanswered material question of fact and the parties dispute regarding whether the mold agreement was related to or dependent on liberty outstanding open account.
on appeal,petitioning creditors contend that in determining that liberty claim was subject to a bona fide dispute,the court ignored repeated admissions by debtor regarding the existence of an open account balance.they argue that,in an attempt to defeat the petition,debtor asserted a counterclaim against liberty that alleged that liberty converted a mold,interfered with prospective economic advantage,and breached the contract for the mold manufacture.the petitioning creditors assert that the mold construction contract is separate and distinct from the parties open account and that the liberty claim is not subject to bona fide dispute based on an allegedly unrelated counterclaim.see seko,at.therefore,they contend that the court clearly erred in determining that this claim was subject to bona fide dispute.we disagree.
it is true that the mere existence of pending litigation or the filing of an answer is insufficient to establish the existence of a bona fide dispute.see in re ross,in re onyx,in re gills creek parkway.additionally,
the existence of a counterclaim against a creditor does not automatically render the creditor claim the subject of a bona fide dispute.so long as the petitioning creditor has established that there is no dispute regarding the debtor liability on the creditor claim,the creditor has standing under section b to bring a petition.
seko,at.in contrast,the existence of affirmative defenses may suggest that a bona fide dispute exists.see king,collier on bankruptcy,b i,at ed.see also seko,at stating that b is concerned not with who ultimately owes money to whom rather,it is concerned with whether the creditor claim is disputed.
here,the bankruptcy court had sufficient evidence from which it could conclude that liberty claim was subject to bona fide dispute.in its answer,debtor raised the defenses of impossibility of performance and waiver,alleging that when debtor and liberty entered into the agreement for liberty manufacture of a mold,liberty was aware that debtor would be unable to pay the outstanding balance on the open account if it committed its resources towards the purchase of the molds.therefore,as an enticement to debtor,liberty agreed that any outstanding debt on the open account would be deferred and that payment of a month would not be required until debtor earned certain sums as a result of the completion of the first mold.by failing to complete the mold,debtor alleged that liberty rendered debtor performance impossible.debtor also alleged that liberty failure to complete its portion of this agreement resulted in its waiver or modification of the payment terms.
debtor affirmative defenses related to the interrelation of the two claims was supported by a letter dated february,in which scott stated that 
w e agreed to a specific payment plan,predicated upon the completion of the new mold and the funding we would be receiving from the marketing company.when it became obvious that the new mold would be late,you personally called me to inform me you were behind and that you knew that we would not be able to keep our payments as agreed,and stated that you had no problems with that.
thus,this evidence establishes that the validity of liberty claim is subject to bona fide dispute because liberty alleged breach of the contract to construct a mold may have resulted in its waiver of its right to collect on the open account.additionally,liberty may have rendered impossible debtor ability to make payments on the open account.
based on this evidence,the bankruptcy court did not clearly err in finding that liberty claim was subject to a bona fide dispute.
vortex lures and higgins 
vortex lures held the rights to a beeping fishing lure,and viking lures,higgins assignor,held the rights to a blinking fishing lure.on october,higgins and scott executed an agreement the vortex agreement to form debtor in order to market the fishing lures.the agreement provided that the corporation would assume liabilities under higgins and vortex lures royalty agreements and any liabilities thereunder in favor of viking lures and vortex limited partnership.the vortex agreement further provided that it was governed by montana law.in a june,letter the june letter from scott to higgins,scott stated that the parties needed to resolve subordination of the vortex lures limited partnership and viking lures obligation to my debt.
based on the assignment of claims that higgins filed with the court,the basis for his claim is a agreement the agreement in which vortex lures agreed to purchase viking lures assets.at the time of its assignment of its claim to higgins,viking lures believe that it was due from vortex lures and that the liability could be collected from debtor as vortex lures.
the bankruptcy court held that the claims of vortex lures and higgins were subject to a bona fide dispute because of the following a dispute over whether the texas or montana statute of limitations applied a legitimate dispute as to when the statute of limitations began to run and a dispute as to whether debtor was liable for the claims.in support of the last finding,the court noted that the vortex agreement had not been signed by an officer of debtor or a person on behalf of the debtor and that debtor lacked a board resolution or minutes showing the adoption of the vortex agreement.
on appeal,petitioning creditors contend that the court clearly erred because the vortex agreement legally obligated debtor to the claims of both vortex lures and higgins,montana law governed the vortex agreement because it was executed in montana,contemplated the formation of a montana corporation,and was to be performed in montana,and the statute of limitations for actions on a written contract in montana is eight years and the acknowledgment of a debt in writing and signed by the party to be charged tolls the statute of limitations.petitioning creditors assert that scott acknowledged the existence of the objections in the june letter and that this tolled the statute of limitations.therefore,petitioning creditors contend that the court clearly erred in finding that their claims were subject to a bona fide dispute.we disagree.
first,the evidence does not clearly establish that debtor assumed liability for these claims when the vortex agreement was executed.higgins claim is purportedly based on the agreement.however,the vortex agreement provided only that debtor assumed royalty agreements and liabilities thereunder in favor of viking lures and vortex lures.the agreement does not appear to be a royalty agreement.second,to the extent that the claims were based on royalty agreements,debtor submitted evidence to establish that the claims pertained to an october,agreement with utex industries utex that created a royalty payment obligation and debt the utex agreement.the utex agreement obligated utex to pay higgins,as vortex lures agent,of the gross sales revenues of fishing lures on a monthly basis until the total amount paid totaled.the utex agreement was to terminate once higgins had been paid this sum or when utex ceased its manufacture of the fishing lures,which it did in.the utex agreement provided that it was governed by texas law.because utex ceased its manufacturing prior to the execution of the vortex agreement,debtor disputed that it owed vortex lures or higgins any money as a result of the utex agreement.from this,the court could find that the claims of vortex lures and higgins were the subject of bona fide dispute.
additionally,based on the dispute over the source of any liability owed to higgins and vortex lures,there is a substantial disagreement as to which state statute of limitations is applicable.in a bankruptcy case,the court must apply federal choice of law rules.see lindsay beneficial reinsurance in re lindsay,cir.federal choice of law rules follow the approach of the restatement second of conflict of laws.see chuidian philippine bank,cir.under the restatement,if the claims of vortex lures and higgins are based on the utex agreement,texas law may apply.see restatement secondddddd of conflict of laws.under texas law,an action on a contract must be brought within four years of the date the cause of action accrues.see.civ.prac.rem.code ann.c vernon kansa reinsurance congressional mortgage,cir.an acknowledgment of the validity of a claim is admissible to defeat the statute of limitations if it is in writing and signed by the party to be charged.see tex civ.prac.rem.code ann.vernon.even if the june letter was considered an acknowledgment of the claims validity,the claims would still be because the statute of limitation
