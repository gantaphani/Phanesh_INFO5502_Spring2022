david wants what every debtor in bankruptcy wants a fresh start.you see,a debtor generally gets a discharge from debts owed at the time he files his bankruptcy petition.see b.but this opportunity is only for the honest but unfortunate debtor.grogan garner,d internal quotation marks omitted.and that is why congress enacted a number of exceptions to discharge.one makes debts for money procured by use of a written statement that that statement was materially false,related to the debtor financial condition,and reasonably relied on by the creditor,and provided also that the debtor caused it to be made or published with intent to deceive a b.an honest but unfortunate debtor is so a bankruptcy judge,relying on this exception,ruled after a trial in a proceeding between and one of his creditors,thomas toye iii.the bankruptcy appellate panel bap,for short later affirmed.now asks us to hold that the bankruptcy judge got it all wrong.what follows is our explanation of why this ruling must stand.
how the case got 
fishy financials 
is an experienced real estate developer,jumping into the field in the late.eventually he teamed up with rudy ferrante a childhood friend,and the two began acquiring real estate together,apparently through llcs companies,for the uninitiated.the pair were quite busy in the late,doing multiple deals.we discuss three including the one that landed in this mess to give a sense of what the trial was about.all three occurred within months of each other and featured kevin smith in a starring role.a longtime acquaintance of ferrante they had once worked together as brokers at the lenders network,smith supposed forte is financing.
the first deal involved team ferrante bid to refinance a piece of commercial property already in their portfolio.the second involved their attempt to acquire more commercial property.for the first transaction,and ferrante asked smith to prepare the financial paperwork.for the second,asked smith to help arrange the financing.i did ask him to help do the paperwork,added,that just came with the job.smith said yes both times.and,among other things,he ended up preparing various financial documents,including personal financial statements pfss,from here on out.
was no stranger to pfss.he knew from past deals that lenders wanted them,usually along with personal guaranties.and he gave smith some pertinent financial information to prepare pfss for both undertakings.smith got other important data from documents he had gathered.had what seemed to be a attitude when it came to putting financials together,delegating the bulk of the paperwork to smith and relying on him to know what to do and how to do it an arrangement was very comfortable with.smith sent pfs to the lender in the first deal.how the lender in the second deal got pfs is unclear on this record.
now we come to the transaction that sparked this litigation.hard on the heels of these two earlier deals,and ferrante,through an llc called alder street properties,llc,agreed to buy some more property from another party.as part of this transaction,they had to come up with a down payment at closing.once again,they recruited smith to help secure the financing.and smith asked thomas toye to loan the ferrante llc the money.a highflyer in the community who had known smith for years smith had hooked him up three or four times with similar loan deals before,toye said yes,but he wanted among other things and ferrante personal guaranties for the loan repayment.no problem,and ferrante essentially said.
so smith set about preparing pfss for both.collected documents showing what stocks he owned and how much money he had in the bank and gave them to smith.no one disputes the accuracy of this financial information.smith also managed to get other relevant data from other documents credit reports,mortgage statements,records,he already had on file or had dug up through searches he had conducted for this deal.he can not definitively say how he got some of the documents,however.nor can he say for sure whether he sent a copy of the pfs,whether he reviewed every aspect of the pfs with him,or whether he saw him sign the pfs.but he does remember emailing a signed copy of pfs,along with ferrante,to toye.for his part,insists that he never reviewed the pfs,that the signature on the pfs is not his,and that he never authorized anyone to send the pfs to toye.what everyone now agrees on,however,is that pfs was materially false,containing serious misrepresentations and omissions regarding his income and assets.
wowed by supposed net worth,toye lent the ferrante llc the,receiving a promissory note in that amount at interest from the llc secured by a mortgage on some property and by and ferrante personal guaranties.unfortunately,the llc did not pay the loan as required.and toye ended up turning to,who,also unfortunately,defaulted on his obligations.
a wave of litigation 
unwilling to take this lying down,toye sued in state court on the personal guaranty.supposedly first saw the false pfs here,in state court.eventually that court granted toye summary judgment and entered a judgment against.
later,sought bankruptcy protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code.toye responded by initiating this adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy court,alleging most relevantly here that debt to him was nondischargeable per section a b.under this provision the reader will recall,if a statement about a debtor financial condition is in a writing that is materially false and is reasonably relied on by the creditor,and if the debtor caused that statement to be made or published with intent to deceive,then the debt can not be discharged.of course,toye had to prove nondischargeability by a preponderance of the evidence.see,sharfarz goguen in re goguen,cir.
highlighting only what is needed to understand the issues before us,we note that the parties basically stipulated to everything pretrial except whether had caused the pfs to be made or published with intent to deceive.at trial,toye,smith,and took the stand.and after hearing their testimony and examining the exhibits,the bankruptcy judge refused to discharge debt to toye.
the judge began his reasoning this way contrary to contention,smith had acted as toye agent for this transaction.needed a loan,and smith said he could make it happen.said to smith,go ahead and give toye what he needs to make the loan,the judge wrote,so smith prepared the pfs on the authority and at the instruction of,and no one else.in other words,to quote the judge again set the wheels in motion for smith to prepare and send the pfs to toye.
true,did not review and sign the pfs,the judge added.but,the judge ruled,nondischargeability under section a b lies whether the debtor intentionally did exactly what was done or whether he was reckless ly indifferent to the propositions asserted in the pfs.and here,according to the judge,the evidence showed that willfully turned a blind eye to what the pfs said and,the judge concluded,did not car e what the pfs said,only that it said whatever toye needed to hear to make the loan.
an unhappy appealed.but the bap affirmed the judgment,ruling pertinently for our situation that the evidence amply demonstrated that smith was agent and that by having his agent prepare and send the pfs had in the lingo of section a b caused the pfs to be made or published turning to the question of intent,the bap said that a debtor reckless indifference to the accuracy of the submitted pfs satisfies the element of section a b.and,the bap stressed,the evidence of turning a blind eye here proved his intent to deceive.
which brings us to today,with a still unhappy asking us to undo this result.
our take on the case 
background legal principles 
before we go any further,a few reminders are in order.we are the second set of reviewers here the bap was the first,obviously.but we give the bap decision no special deference.see,goguen,at.rather,we focus on the bankruptcy judge ruling,giving review to factfindings and fresh review to legal conclusions.id.of course,if there are a couple of plausible ways to view the evidence,the judge preference for one over the other can not be clear error.see,berliner pappalardo in re sullivan,cir.and to find clear error,a finding must hit us as more than probably must prompt a strong,unyielding belief,based on the whole of the record,that the judge made a mistake.islamic inv.of the gulf bah.harper in re grand jury investigation,cir accord goguen,at.the case for deferring to the bankruptcy judge factfinding is particularly strong when intent is at issue since an intent finding depends heavily on the debtor credibility,and the bankruptcy judge is uniquely qualified to make that call.see,palmacci umpierrez,cir.and finally,because a principal goal of the bankruptcy code is to provide deserving debtors with a fresh start,we read exceptions to dischargeability narrowly.see,goguen,at.consequently,a person in toye position must show that his claim fits snugly within an exception contained in the code.see,id.
now on to the issues in play.
issues presented 
as framed by the parties,the case turns entirely on the final element of section a b whether caused the writing,the pfs to be made or published with intent to deceive.see a b iv the gist of argument is straightforward enough despite what the bankruptcy judge thought,one can not conclude that caused the pfs which he neither reviewed nor signed to be made or published,because smith was functioning as toye agent.and with this pfs the work of a runaway smith,one also can not conclude that intended to deceive toye with a shady pfs.toye disagrees,naturally.and we do too.
take the agency issue.to give his claim about smith being toye agent an aura of plausibility,plays up how smith and toye had known each other for years and how smith had made toye money three or four times by helping him lend others money before this deal went south.but the problem for is that other evidence cuts against him.recall how smith had helped and ferrante on some deals right before the deal at issue,then how the duo had enlisted his help in getting the loan,and finally how they had relied on him to prepare the necessary documents for all three transactions.the bankruptcy judge chose to accept this evidence in deeming smith agent on this loan.and the judge view seems entirely plausible,certainly not wrong with the force of a week old,unrefrigerated,dead fish,which is what had to but did not show to get anywhere.see s,centra,cir.ultimately,then,we are in no position to undo the judge agency determination.see goguen,at.
wait a second,says.smith had acted on his own in drafting up the false pfs,which means that the bankruptcy judge clearly stumbled in finding that had caused that document to be made or published to toye at least that is what writes.but what dooms this theory is that the judge expressly found that smith had acted on authority and instruction.and our patient review of the record leaves us convinced that the judge view of the evidence is a permissible one keep in mind that is a savvy businessman.he knew that toye needed a personal guaranty.he knew too that that would require a pfs without he must have known omissions.so gave smith some financial information for the pfs,tasking him with doing whatever was necessary to get the loan done more on this in a moment.and he knew from past experience that that would result in smith preparing the pfs and sending it to toye or so at least a factfinder could infer.ever mindful that the standard leaves us no room to the trier choices among plausible inferences,we easily reject smith thesis,which necessarily means that the rest of his argument on this score fails.see anderson city of bessemer city,d holding that if,on review,the lower court account of the evidence is plausible,then we may not reverse it even though convinced that had we been sitting as the trier of fact,we would have weighed the evidence differently.
that leaves the intent to deceive issue,with protesting that the bankruptcy judge rested the findings on air,basically.he reminds us,for starters,that he had neither reviewed nor signed the false pfs before smith emailed it to toye.yes,but intent to deceive under section a b may be demonstrated by the debtor knowledge of,reckless indifference to,or reckless disregard for the written statement falsity.see,union fire ins.of pittsburgh bonnanzio in re bonnanzio,cir ins.of am.cohn in re cohn,cir citing additional cases from the,and circuits morrison builders of amarillo,in re morrison,cir our caselaw holds that recklessness can suffice to prove the intent element under section a a section a b statutory sidekick,see field mans,d which at the risk of oversimplification makes nondischargeable any debt for money obtained by fraud,other than a statement respecting the debtor financial condition.palmacci,at,quoting a a.and today we join our sibling circuits and hold that recklessness can suffice under section a b too.anyway,recklessness is where gets tripped up.we explain.
because it would be a rare debtor who would concede that deception was his purpose,courts can take account of the totality of the circumstances,including as we just said a debtor recklessness.cohn,at see also collier on bankruptcy,supra,e ii.and that review reveals plenty of evidence from which a factfinder could infer recklessness on part.
once again,is no babe in the woods when it comes to financing.far from it.he knew that toye wanted a personal guaranty.and because a guaranty is only worth something if the lender knows the borrower financial status,he knew and this is easily inferable that toye would want a comprehensive pfs providing the truth,the whole truth,and nothing but the truth otherwise,why ask for one g o ahead and give toye what he needs,were marching orders to smith,the judge found,which suggests that took a approach to the pfs just like he had before.true,he did give smith some financial items.but,as his lawyer candidly conceded at oral argument,did not give smith enough data to produce a complete pfs,which meant and this is easily inferable too that smith had to come up with the missing information.also,a trier could draw a strong inference as this one did that knew that toye had gotten the pfs.knew this at least inferentially probably by the time toye had approved the loan,and certainly by the time toye had dispersed the loan proceeds remember,toye wanted pfs before making the loan.and yet never even tried to check his agent work at any point,bolstering the judge finding that he had willfully turned a blind eye,not caring what the pfs said though he clearly cared a lot about getting his hands on toye money,which he happily took after set ting the false pfs in motion.
searching for a way out,complains that there is zero evidence of his giving smith carte blanche,which,he argues,undercuts the findings.hardly.a factfinder could infer as this one apparently did that directing smith to do the paperwork and then not ever asking to see it shows a attitude.also grumbles that he gave smith accurate information,which,he maintains,cripples the findings.not at all.what ignores is that his disclosure was so lacking in required information that smith could not do a complete pfs.that is the rub.and a factfinder could infer like this one basically did that someone with résumé should have known that and did know that.
the bottom line here is this given these particular circumstances,and knowing how famously deferential review is,see,goguen,at,especially when it comes to intent findings,see,palmacci,at,we simply are in no position to upset the bankruptcy judge intent conclusion.see fdic reisman in re reisman,rejecting a debtor ostrich tactics,the court found an intent to deceive where the debtor knew that the bank required a pfs as a condition of a loan and that his accountant had submitted the pfs to the bank,and yet did not review the pfs or inquire as to its accuracy see also citizens bank of washington cnty.wright in re wright,finding a claim of ignorance concerning the falsity of financial papers unpersuasive because,if true,it was by d ebtor own design and so constituted recklessness on the debtor part first commercial bank robinson in re robinson,similar.and that is that.
summing up 
we see no clear error in the bankruptcy judge conclusion that toye ha
