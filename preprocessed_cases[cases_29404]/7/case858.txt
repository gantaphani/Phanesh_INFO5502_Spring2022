a.hickman bail bond judgment is payable to the state of texas,for the benefit of the state of texas,and is not compensation for actual pecuniary loss.the statute applicability to hickman bond forfeiture debt thus turns on the meaning of the phrase fine,penalty or forfeiture within the context of a.
in answering any statutory question,we begin with the language of the statute itself.united states ron pair enterprises,d kellogg united states,cir.the term forfeiture is 
a comprehensive term which means a divestiture of specific property without compensation it imposes a loss by taking away of some preexisting valid right without compensation.a deprivation or destruction of some obligation or condition.loss of some right or property as a penalty for some illegal act.loss of property or money because of breach of a legal obligation default in payment.

as a product of history,the term forfeiture in the bail bond context has become associated with the contractual damages owed to the state by an defendant or his a bond.historically,a defendant or his surety was required to post the full amount of the bond in order to secure release.however,the bonding system has evolved to allow the defendant or a professional bondsmen to enter into a contractual agreement with the state to guarantee the defendant presence in court.under this agreement,the state does not require payment of the entire amount of the bond in order to secure release.rather,the state requires a contractual promise to pay the amount of the bond by the defendant or his surety if the defendant fails to comply with the conditions of the bond.upon default,the state merely seeks a money judgment as damages for breach of contract against the obligor under the bond.we can not ignore that in common parlance,and consistently throughout history,the label forfeiture has been affixed to a bail bond debt.this common usage is evidenced by the dictionary definition of forfeiture as well as the term use in state and federal statutes and caselaw.we,therefore,consider whether congress intended a to apply to bail bond forfeiture debts by a surety.
a majority of courts have read forfeiture within a not to include the contractual damages incurred by a professional bondsmen as a result of the defendant failure to appear.in re collins,cir in re damore,in re midkiff,in re paige,wl.these courts principally rely on the supreme court analysis of a in kelly robinson,d.in kelly,the supreme court held that restitution paid as a condition of probation was nondischargeable under a.id.at.although not specifically listed in a,the court held that because a creates a broad exception for all penal sanctions,whether they be denominated fines,penalties,or forfeitures,restitution payments were included within its scope.kelly,at.relying on kelly and its own precedent,the fourth circuit concluded that t he nondischargeable fine,penalty or forfeiture under a is an obligation that is essentially penal in nature.in re collins,at.
to the extent that t he word penal is inherently a much broader term than criminal since it pertains to any punishment or penalty and relates to acts which are not necessarily delineated as criminal,we ultimately agree with the fourth circuit conclusion.black law dictionary ed.however,in light of the question presented in,although not listed,restitution was excepted from discharge under a the supreme court construction of a does not itself prevent the section application to bail bond judgments against a surety.in focusing on whether a created a broad exception for all penal sanctions,thus including restitution,the court did not decide a s applicability to civil,debts.thus,while the court analysis and approach in kelly are instructive,its holding does not compel the result that debts incurred in the capacity of a surety on a bail bond are dischargeable.
in kelly,the court found the language of a ambiguous.kelly,at.see also id.at.finding the language of a is subject to interpretation.the court then admonished that i n expounding a statute,we must not be guided by a single sentence or member of a sentence,but look to the provisions of the whole law,and to its object and policy.kelly robinson,d citations omitted.thus,in discerning congress intent we must consider the terms accompanying forfeiture in a a as a whole and the policies underlying the bankruptcy code and its exceptions to discharge.
