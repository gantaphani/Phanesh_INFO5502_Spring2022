in this chapter case,the united states department of health and human services hhs appeals the district court order affirming the bankruptcy court discharge of the health education assistance loans heal loans of zane todd smitley.because the district court erred in holding that nondischarge of the heal loans would be unconscionable,as is required by g west,we reverse.
from through,smitley obtained approximately in heal loans in order to attend the cleveland chiropractic college.after smitley graduated in september,the holder of the loans,student loan marketing association slma,provided smitley a repayment schedule,with payments to start in september.from august through may,smitley requested and received four forbearances he made no payments during those times.after the forbearances,smitley failed to keep his heal loan payments current.
smitley default resulted in assignment of the loans to hhs.in november,hhs notified smitley of the assignment,and the parties entered into a repayment agreement.at that time,the total debt amount equaled approximately.from march through august,smitley made monthly payments of,totaling.despite his promise in the repayment agreement to increase his monthly payment with the month following any increase in income,smitley did not increase the monthly payments,even though his income substantially increased over those years to more than in one year.
on october,smitley and his wife filed a chapter petition in the bankruptcy court.on february,they received a general discharge of over.on february,smitley filed the instant adversary proceeding against hhs,the educational credit management corporation ecmc,and the great lakes higher education corporation smitley sought discharge of approximately of principal and interest in heal loans and an additional in principal and interest in educational loans owed to ecmc 
on april,the bankruptcy court held a trial on the adversary proceeding.the parties agree that the facts of this case are undisputed.at the time of trial,smitley was years old,in good health,and lived in raleigh,north carolina.he had received an undergraduate degree in secondary education and worked as a secondary school teacher prior to seeking his chiropractic degree.after chiropractic school,smitley purchased a practice from another chiropractor and practiced for approximately years.during that time,smitley had a fire in his office,suffered an injury that kept him out of work for six weeks,and incurred medical bills of,which smitley testified had been paid off at the time of trial.in,he closed his chiropractic practice because of financial difficulties.
since closing the practice,smitley has worked as a carpenter.smitley now works hours per week as a finish trim carpenter,earning per hour.he testified that he had not explored the possible hours he could get from another finish carpenter job.
both his chiropractic and secondary education licenses had lapsed at the time of trial.smitley has made a few attempts to obtain or evening jobs at retailers and grocery stores.he also applied for a few teaching jobs at the university level and testified that people at his church had looked for management jobs for him.but smitley did not seek teaching positions at the high school level,positions as a factory foreman for which he had prior experience,positions in other geographic areas except for a teaching position at a college in ohio,or employment counseling of any kind.
at the time of the trial,smitley wife was years old.smitley works about hours per week,for per hour,as an assistant to two dentists.she testified that she can not work additional hours because of undiagnosed problems with her hands.
in april,the smitleys had four children under the age of eighteen twins and two other children ages and.the children have health insurance through the state,but smitley and his wife do not have health insurance.
from through,the smitleys reported the following annual income to the internal revenue service,and approximately.the smitleys made substantial donations to their church during some of those years in,in,and in.the family rents a,house for per month in raleigh,north carolina.smitley has a retirement account of approximately,consisting of her employer contributions.the family owns two automobiles,on one of which,a van,they owe a monthly payment of per month members of the family church occasionally donate money and other items to them.the smitleys often pay bills a month behind,and owe about in back federal and state taxes the irs has a payment plan of per month on the federal taxes.
smitley stated the following basis for his belief that the debt to the united states should be discharged based on unconscionability 
we are both working to hours a week,continuing to pursue our jobs to be able to support ourselves and our family.we are both employed,have good jobs.we are unable to pay our regular bills.our children must earn their own money to do activities.our teenage daughters are unable to get a driver license because we can not afford insurance.we can not afford health insurance,and it is not offered by our employers.therefore,we must pay all of our own medical bills.we have no way at this time to pay all of our bills,save for the future,or make plans for our children futures.
smitley testified that he had not made any efforts since the bankruptcy filing to consolidate his loans in order to reduce the monthly payments.
on april,the bankruptcy court issued an order,finding that smitley is probably underemployed as a carpenter,but he has no prospects for other employment.it stated that i t is apparent to the court that smitley can not possibly repay his educational loans that total more than sic.the court noted that inability to pay is not the test for dischargeability rather it recognized that the test for the heal loans is unconscionability under g and that the test for the ecmc loans is undue hardship under a west supp.the court held that,although the debtor is unable to pay the full amount of the loans,he may be able to pay a part of the loans.because smitley had not availed himself of the lenders programs for financially disadvantaged borrowers,the court concluded that it could not determine whether the debts should be discharged.it ordered smitley to apply to the lenders for consideration under these programs and report back to the court.
after smitley reported back that based on a total loan amount of,an annual gross income of and four dependents,the minimum payment under the lenders programs would be per month,the bankruptcy court ordered both the in heal loans and the in ecmc loans discharged.assuming an interest rate of,the court believed that interest would accrue on both loans at per year and the minimum payment would amount to just under per year x.the bankruptcy court recognized the differing standards governing discharge of the heal and loans,but concluded that it would be unconscionable to refuse to discharge both loans.the court reasoned 
even if smitley were to make the payments according to the repayment schedule submitted,not only would he never fully repay the loan,but he would also never reduce the principal due.instead,the amount would continue to increase.the prospects for smitley to make higher payments in the future are not good,and if the balance continues to increase,the chances of his ever repaying the loans are nil.in the context of the bankruptcy proceeding,the court finds that requiring the debtor to continue to pay this debt for the rest of his life,with no hope of a final payment,is unconscionable.the heal loan,therefore,shall be discharged and smitley loans from educational credit shall also be discharged.
the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court discharge order,holding that b ased on the reasoning of the bankruptcy court,and this court evaluation of debtor dire financial situation,this court finds that nondischarge of smitley outstanding student loans would be unconscionable in this case.it held that smitley had met both the undue hardship and the unconscionability standards.
this appeal involves only discharge of the heal loans ecmc did not appeal the discharge of its loans.
the sole question before us is whether the nondischarge of smitley heal loans would be unconscionable under g 
we begin with the standard of review.the determination of the meaning of unconscionable constitutes a question of law reviewed de novo.see,in re ekenasi,cir we review the bankruptcy court legal conclusions de novo.citing in re kielisch,cir.
in addition,both parties assert,and we agree,that application of the unconscionability standard to the facts of this case constitutes a mixed question of law and fact,requiring a conclusion regarding the legal effect of the bankruptcy court findings as to the debtor circumstances.in re long,cir holding question of undue hardship for discharge of educational loans reviewed de novo.we review mixed questions of law and fact under a hybrid standard,applying to the factual portion of each inquiry the same standard applied to questions of pure fact and examining de novo the legal conclusions derived from those facts.gilbane.fed.reserve bank of richmond,cir citation omitted see also in re hornsby,cir applying clearly erroneous standard of review to factual findings underlying undue hardship determination,which court reviews de novo fed.west supp findings of fact,whether based on oral or documentary evidence,shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous,and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the bankruptcy court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.
we note that this approach accords with that of the only circuit to have passed on the question in connection with heal loans,as well as all of the circuits to have considered the lesser undue hardship standard for other educational loans under a b.see in re rice,cir holding that question of whether nondischarge of a heal loan is unconscionable reviewed de novo citation omitted see also in re long,at collecting cases and joining second,third,sixth,seventh,ninth,and tenth circuits in holding that question of whether nondischarge of a loan constitutes an undue hardship under a b is reviewed de novo.
in the case at hand,the parties agree that the facts are undisputed.thus,our task involves de novo consideration of two legal questions the meaning of unconscionable under g and the application of that standard to the discharge of smitley heal loans.
congress has not defined unconscionable as used in g,and we have not addressed the question in a published opinion.the supreme court has directed,however,that i n the absence of an indication to the contrary,words in a statute are assumed to bear their ordinary,contemporary,common meaning.walters metro.educ,d quoting pioneer inv.servs.brunswick assocs,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
the dictionary defines unconscionable as excessive exorbitant lying outside the limits of what is reasonable or acceptable shockingly unfair,harsh,or unjust or outrageous.webster third new international dictionary see also matthews pineo,cir so construing term unconscionable as used in d a,which establishes conditions for discharge in bankruptcy of national health service corps scholarship obligations.in light of the common meaning of unconscionable,we agree with the sixth circuit the only circuit to have previously construed the term in g,that there is little doubt that in using this term congress intended to severely restrict the circumstances under which a heal loan could be discharged in bankruptcy.rice,at.
the unconscionability standard is stringent,demanding more than the undue hardship standard for the discharge of educational loans under a b the standard applicable to the ecmc loans in this case.see id.at citing,inter alia,in re malloy,aff,cir unpublished see also united states wood,cir noting that unconscionability is a higher standard than undue hardship.moreover,the debtor bears the burden of proving unconscionability,and g iven the strict nature of the unconscionability standard,this burden is a heavy one.rice,at citation omitted.
in determining whether nondischarge of a heal loan meets this stringent standard,a court must focus on the totality of the facts and circumstances surrounding the debtor and the obligation.see malloy,at in re barrows,in re emnett.the relevant objective factors include the debtor income,earning ability,health,educational background,dependents,age,accumulated wealth,and professional degree.rice,at citing barrows,at malloy,at in re quinn.a court should also examine the debtor standard of living,with a view toward ascertaining whether the debtor has attempted to minimize the expenses of himself and his dependents.rice,at citation omitted ekenasi,at under undue hardship test,debtor must show,inter alia,that he can not maintain a minimal standard of living for himself and his dependents,based upon his current income and expenses,if he is required to repay the student loans citing brunner new york state higher educ.servs,cir per curiam.
a court should determine if the debtor current situation is likely to continue or improve,including whether the debtor has attempted to maximize his income by seeking or obtaining stable employment commensurate with his educational background and abilities and whether he could supplement his income through secondary or seasonal work,e ven if the debtor is already employed.rice,at citing,inter alia,matthews,at t he proper inquiry is whether it would to require the debtor to take any available steps to earn more income see also in re,concluding that it was not unconscionable to require debtor to earn more income by relocating business or leaving medical profession entirely to seek alternative employment.a court should also consider whether any dependents of the debtor are,or could be,contributing financially to their own support.rice,at.
finally,the amount of the debt and the rate of interest are relevant.id.at.but when weighing these factors,a court must also consider the debtor role in accruing the amount of debt,including requesting multiple forbearances and making minimal repayments.see,rice,at t he current substantial amount of the debt was largely rice own doing.his minimal repayments,some made involuntarily,reflect little effort to satisfy the original obligation.this factor weighs particularly strongly against discharge in this case malloy,at m uch of the accrued interest on malloy debt is attributable to his own conduct in requesting forbearance and in failing to seek discharge in bankruptcy at an earlier date.see also united states kephart,holding,in case,that i t would be perverse to allow the debtor to benefit from her own inaction,delay and recalcitrance by automatically granting discharge simply because the debt is a sizeable one.this,of course,would benefit those who delay and obstruct the longest and could encourage other students to follow the course taken by the debtor.in this regard,the court should examine the debtor previous efforts to repay the heal obligation,including the debtor financial situation over the course of time when payments were due the debtor voluntary undertaking of additional financial burdens despite his knowledge of the outstanding heal debt and the percentage of the debtor total indebtedness represented by student loans.rice,at.
to flesh out the unconscionability standard,we have canvassed the decisions of courts applying that standard to the varied financial situations faced by heal debtors.after analyzing the above factors,courts have found nondischarge of heal loans unconscionable only in rare cases.see id.given the extreme nature of congress chosen standard for the discharge of heal loans,we believe that in all but the most difficult cases the question of whether the debtor has satisfied that standard will be obvious.
thus,courts generally have refused to hold nondischarge unconscionable even though the debtor earned only a modest income and the amount of the heal debt was substantial.for example,in rice,the debtor owed in heal loans and his family,which included three children ages,and,grossed annually.id.at.moreover,the debtor,age,was relatively young and healthy,and in all likelihood his income could increase in the future.id.at.the family owned a mortgaged home,an old automobile,and spent per month for school tuition and per month for recreation.id.at.the court found repayment would not force the family to maintain a standard of living below or even near the poverty level.id.at.furthermore,the substantial amount of the heal debt at the time of the petition was largely the debtor own doing because of his minimal repayments.id.at.for all of these reasons,the court held as a matter of law that nondischarge of this debt was not unconscionable.id.at.
similarly,in malloy,the district court denied a discharge to the debtor,a man with no dependents,who had failed to graduate from medical school,but was college educated.at,he lived with a roommate to save on rent and his mother helped him purchase clothes.id.at.the court,however,found the debtor arguably underemployed,earning only per year as an assistant activities director at a nursing home,and concluded that the debtor,with effort,could increase his income.id.at.further,the court noted that the debtor had not made substantial job search efforts in the prior five years and had requested multiple forbearances.id.at.based on these facts,the district court refused to affirm discharge of the heal loan.id.at.
in re pinkham,is also apposite.in that case,a debtor,age,had borrowed money under the heal program to finance his chiropractic degree,attempted to build a practice for five years,was unable to do so,and then accepted employment as a high school science teacher.id.at.the debtor earned only per year and did not anticipate earning significantly more in the foreseeable future.id.he supported his wife who did not work outside of the home,and two children,ages and.id.but,the court noted that the debtor could supplement his earnings with seasonal employment,that he was not in less than average health,and that he had not argued that his wife and sons were unable to contribute financially toward their support.id.at.on these facts,the court refused to discharge in heal debt.id.at.
in in re barrows,the debtor,a dentist,sought a discharge of in heal loans.the debtor combined family income ranged from to only in the years immediately prior to the bankruptcy court decision.id.at.moreover,the debtor had entered into an agreement with the irs to use her annual salary above for several years to satisfy back payroll taxes.id.the debtor and her husband,who had no dependents,lived in a condominium owned by the debtor aunt to whom they paid rent.id.the bankruptcy court noted that the debtor suffered from a series of physical problems relating to various illnesses including iritis,episodes of lupus,and back trouble resulting from spina bifida,a birth defect.id.at.yet,despite the debtor relatively low income and her health problems,the bankruptcy court refused to discharge either in heal debt or in other educational loans.id.at.it reasoned that,although the debtor had suffered setbacks in her dental practice,she had a promising future,and that her history had shown that her illnesses were not so severe that she was permanently unable to work.id.at.
in in re borrero,aff,wl,at,the unmarried debtor,age,had been involuntarily dismissed from medical school.he worked as a lab technician,earning per year,with the possibility of earning up to over the next few years,but had made only minimal repayments on his educational loans.id.at.the debtor financial condition had been improved by a general discharge of.id.at.given these facts,the bankruptcy court refused to discharge in heal loans,as well as in other educational loans.id.at.
similarly,in in re hines,the bankruptcy court denied an heal discharge to another debtor,who had been dismissed from medical school.the debtor,who was in good health,was married with two children,ages and.id.at.he had worked as a chimney sweep,bartender,satellite dish salesman,and at a nursery.id.he represented that he averaged only per year in income,and his wife earned about per year.id.at the time of filing for bankruptcy,the debtor had started a tire business,but still only earned about per month against in expenses.id.the bankruptcy court refused to discharge the heal debt,explaining that n either several years of underemployment nor beginning your own tire business warranted discharge.id.at.
conversely,in re kline,seems to typify the very extreme case warranting discharge of a heal loan.in kline,the bankruptcy court granted a discharge to a debtor who suffered from depression,anxiety,and panic attacks,and had attempted suicide,been raped at gunpoint by an employer,sexually harassed at another job,and abused by her spouse.id.at.the debtor had worked several jobs,primarily wage positions,but a t each job,she was fired after a short period.id.at.at the time of the trial,the debtor had worked for the prior months as a computer programmer,earning per year,but she apparently lost that job as well.id.given these facts,the court found that the debtor,who had an son,was unable to maintain meaningful employment for more than a short period of time.id.at.the court discharged the heal debt,concluding that the d ebtor has longstanding mental and emotional conditions that the evidence shows are likely to be permanent and t hese conditions render her incapable of functioning in a manner to enable her to maintain a job.id.at.
similarly,in in re nelson,the bankruptcy court granted a heal discharge of approximately to a debtor who had a nervous breakdown,was unable to finish medical school,and suffered from recurrent major depression with psychotic features,and slight paranoia.id.the debtor earned per hour the bankruptcy court held that the debtor was unable to financially support herself,and if she earned more money,she would only have to pay her true share of her medical and psychiatric bills.id.at.the court concluded that the debtor emotional and psychological impairments prevent her from functioning as a participating member of society and maintaining a job which would allow her to become totally.id 
with this precedent and these principles in mind,we consider the instant case.
we note at the outset that the reasoning of the bankruptcy court,which the district court largely adopted,was flawed in several respects.
first,although the bankruptcy court recognized that it must find nondischarge of the heal loan to be unconscionable in order to justify discharge,the court did not seem to appreciate the very demanding nature of that standard.thus,in its brief opinions,the court did not define or even discuss the meaning of unconscionable.it did not mention a single case involving this standard or engage in any discussion of many of the relevant considerations set forth above.
second,while the bankruptcy court recognized that differing standards govern discharge of the ecmc loans and the heal loans,its analysis improperly combined the loans.see it is apparent to the court that smitley can not possibly repay his educational loans that total more than sic.even if smitley were to make the payments according to the repayment schedule submitted for both loans,not only would he never fully repay the loan,but he would also never reduce the principal due.this approach is flawed.because different standards control discharge of the the heal loans subject to the more stringent unconscionability bankruptcy court should have considered the heal and ecmc loans separately,rather than focusing on the combined total amount of indebtedness.the court should have initially considered discharge of the ecmc loans,subject to the lesser undue hardship standard,since the disposition of that debt could affect the unconscionability analysis,especially because the bankruptcy court determined to discharge the ecmc loans.see,barrows,at in re greco,in re borrero,at.furthermore,improperly considering the heal and ecmc loans together led the bankruptcy court to conclude that the interest would accrue faster per year than the annual income contingent payments per year.if the court had initially considered the ecmc loans,it would not have so concluded,particularly given its discharge of those loans.then only the heal loans would remain,and the record indicates that interest on the heal loans has accrued at the rate of per annum and a rate of per day or per year therefore,the income contingent payment of per month,or approximately per year,would result in full payment of the accruing heal interest plus some principal.
finally,the bankruptcy court misinterpreted the undisputed facts in concluding that smitley would continue to pay the heal loans for the rest of his life.the direct loans repayment calculator summary and smitley letter,both in the record and submitted in response to the bankruptcy court order,indicate that the income contingent plan has a maximum term of years.moreover,at oral argument before us,smitley counsel conceded that the plan would only require years of payment,followed by forgiveness of the debt.interactive of repayment plans last visited july,if you have fully repaid your loans after years under this plan,the unpaid portion will be discharged.you will,however,have to pay taxes on the amount that is discharged.thus,under the income contingent repayment plan,smitley would only pay toward the heal debt for years,and he would do so at a rate that would cover both the accruing interest and some principal 
if the bankruptcy court had applied the correct legal analysis to the undisputed facts,it could only have concluded that it would not be unconscionable,shockingly unfair,harsh or unjust,to deny discharge of smitley heal loans.
the smitley family grossed per year in,the year immediately following the bankruptcy filing.this is not a substantial income,but,as in rice,at,repayment of the heal loan would not force the family to maintain a standard of living below or even near the poverty level.see annual update of hhs poverty guidelines,for a family of six hines,at denial of discharge to debtor,with spouse and two young children,grossing only per year in.although not dispositive,the poverty guidelines provide at least a modicum of objectivity in assessing unconscionability.certainly no court has suggested and not even smitley contends,as the dissent seems to,that if his family income after taxes does not exceed twice the poverty figure for a family of six that this should be a factor weighing in favor of discharge.
like debtors denied heal discharges in other cases,smitley,age at the time of trial,enjoys good health.see rice,at noting that debtor was relatively young as well as healthy malloy,at,noting debtor good health borrero,at same hines,at same pinkham,at considering debtor relatively young age,and good health barrows,at denying heal discharge despite debtor series of physical problems.thus,this factor too weighs against discharge.
moreover,both smitley and his wife have stable employment,another factor weighing against discharge.see rice,at.perhaps even more importantly,neither of the smitleys works hours per week and,like the debtor in malloy,at,smitley has not made substantial job search efforts.contrary to the suggestion of our friend in dissent,the bankruptcy court finding which we do not ignore,see supra at that smitley has no prospects for other employment,is not a finding that smitley would not have had such prospects if he had made substantial job search efforts to find other employment.indeed,the bankruptcy court also found,smitley is probably underemployed as a carpenter.malloy,at finding that debtor,earning per year as an assistant activities director at a nursing home,arguably now underemployed,given his college degree see also hines,at noting debtor several years of underemployment.
even recognizing that smitley chiropractic and teaching licenses had lapsed at the time of trial,smitley underemployment is apparent.additionally,we note that smitley himself acknowledged in testimony before the bankruptcy court that he had not explored the possible hours he could get from another finish carpenter,made only a few attempts to obtain or evening jobs at retailers and grocery stores,and did not seek positions as a factory foreman for which he had prior experience,positions in other geographic areas except for a teaching position at a college in ohio,or employment counseling of any kind.certainly,it would not be unconscionable to require smitley to work and to supplement his income with secondary work see rice,at pinkham,at debtor,a teacher,could supplement his income with seasonal employment.
furthermore,although the amount of the heal debt significant,it is a good deal less than other heal debts that courts have refused to discharge.see rice,at in heal debt borrero,at,in heal debt barrows,at in heal debt pinkham,at in heal debt see also malloy,at in heal debt.moreover,smitley bears responsibility for the debt escalation from the original in heal loans.he requested and received forbearances for almost two years and made no repayments during that period.after the forbearance period ended,smitley repaid his heal loan for a few years at the rate of only per month.the dissent argues that w hat is important is whether smitley forbearances and small payments were justified.we agree,but in arguing that they were justified here,the dissent ignores critical undisputed facts.namely,over the years,smitley never increased his monthly heal repayment,even though during this period the family income increased more than to between to in some years,and smitley had agreed in writing with hhs to increase his monthly payment on the heal debt if he attained any increase in income.emphasis added thus,this is another factor that weighs against finding that refusal to discharge smitley heal debt would be unconscionable.
in addition,like the debtor in borrero,at,who was not granted discharge of in heal loans,smitley financial condition has improved because he has received a discharge of other debts.smitley,with an income of and in heal debt,has received a general discharge of over and a discharge of the ecmc educational debt.however,the debtor in borrero,at,with an income of in and in heal debt,was denied a discharge of in other educational debts and granted only a general discharge,and the debtor in barrows,at,with a likely combined family income of approximately in the,was denied a discharge of in heal debt and in other educational debt.
finally,although we have no wish to micromanage anyone life,we must also,with respect,assess smitley claimed expenses to determine if nondischarge of his heal debt would be unconscionable.rice,at because the heal discharge standard is a particularly stringent one,the court must necessarily be unforgivingly critical in its assessment of the debtor claimed expenses for himself and his dependents.at the time of the april trial,two of smitley dependents were years one year away from another was also a teenager,leaving only one child under the age of.smitley rents a,house for a month,owes a car payment of per month on one of his automobiles a van,and also lists per month for recreation,clubs,entertainment,newspapers,and magazines.see id.at noting that claimed monthly expenses included for.surely,as his children reach age and possibly even before,smitley could at least reduce his monthly shelter and transportation expenses or request contributions toward housing and food from his children after they reach majority.
given the totality of the undisputed facts and the stringent standard for discharge under g,nondischarge of smitley heal debt would not be unconscionable.moreover,at oral argument,hhs assured us that it remains willing to work with smitley on a repayment program and that he would likely still be eligible for the income contingent repayment plan.in view of all of these facts,a court would be indeed to find it shockingly unfair,harsh,or unjust to require smitley to make repayments toward his heal debt for the next years.rather,in this case,it would be unfair to require taxpayers,who paid for smitley chiropractic degree,to bear the burden of discharge.
for the foregoing reasons,the judgment of the district court is reversed.
todd smitley,a chapter debtor who now works as a carpenter,has demonstrated that it would be unconscionable to deny him a discharge of his health education assistance loan heal debt.smitley and his wife have no prospects for increasing their income,and their family expenses exceed their total income.smitley family will suffer if he is denied a discharge.he will be able to make payments on his heal loan only if he neglects some of the essential needs of his family.accordingly,i respectfully dissent from the majority decision to reverse the discharge of smitley heal debt.
the heal program allows graduate students in the health professions to finance their educations with federally insured loans.see,o.a heal debt may be discharged in bankruptcy,but the debtor must satisfy a strict standard.discharge requires a finding by the bankruptcy court that the nondischarge of the heal debt would be unconscionable.id.g.the statute does not define unconscionable,and i accept the majority choice of the following dictionary definitions of the word excessive exorbitant lying outside the limits of what is reasonable or acceptable shockingly unfair,harsh,or unjust or outrageous.ante at quoting webster third new international dictionary.this fairly broad definitional range should give a bankruptcy court some latitude in deciding whether to find that nondischarge would be unconscionable.for example,it is easier to find that nondischarge would l ie outside the limits of what is reasonable than it is to find that nondischarge would be shockingly unfair or outrageous.because what is unconscionable defies precise definition,one bankruptcy court has likened unconscionability to beauty in that it appears to the senses and is found in the eyes of the beholder.in re hines.
in an effort to impose some objectivity,the majority follows other courts and lists a number of factors that a court may consider in conducting the unconscionability analysis.these factors include the debtor income,age,health,earning ability,educational background,including professional degrees,prospects for increasing income,including efforts to make that happen,dependents and whether they are able to contribute,accumulated wealth,total heal debt the debtor role in accruing the debt,including forbearance requests and payment history,is relevant,and expenses and ability to pay heal debt.see ante at.
i do not quarrel with the majority list of factors.the list should be used,however,as a general guide to the examination of the debtor overall circumstances and his efforts.as the majority points out,a court must focus on the totality of the facts and circumstances surrounding the debtor and the obligation.ante at quoting in re rice,cir.thus,the majority list of factors,which is lengthy,should not be used to reduce the unconscionability analysis to some rigid,calculation.this is because the unconscionability determination is an equitable one.in the end,the debtor good faith,or lack of it,must count for a lot.see in re rice,at w e believe the debtor good faith to be an appropriate and necessary consideration in the unconscionability determination.when i conduct the de novo review in this case,applying essentially the same standards as the majority,i come to a completely different conclusion it would be unconscionable to deny smitley a discharge of his heal debt.i will explain why,starting with the factors listed by the majority.
income.smitley and his wife have a combined gross income of about net of taxes.the majority counts this annual income level against smitley,stating that repayment of the heal loan would not force the family to maintain a standard of living below or even near the poverty level.ante at citing annual update of hhs poverty guidelines,quotation marks omitted.because the poverty threshold marks a point of desperation,i would not use the federal poverty guidelines to gauge when it becomes unconscionable not to discharge a heal debt.recent studies indicate that the method currently used by the federal government to set poverty levels is conceptually insufficient for measuring the basic income needs of a working family.jared bernstein et,how much is enough economic policy institute,see also studies cited therein measuring poverty a new approach constance citro robert michael,national academy press,proposal by national research council for developing new approach to official poverty measure in.a study commissioned by the economic policy institute concludes that the average family requires income of twice the poverty figure in order to maintain a safe and decent standard of living.bernstein et,supra,at.in,shortly before smitley trial,poverty level income for a family of six the size of the smitley family at the time was.doubling that to reach the safe and decent level would require,or more than the smitleys made.the smitleys are definitely short of the income necessary to reach the minimum safety level,for they can not afford health insurance.the smitleys gross income level is not adequate by any reasonable standard,and it should weigh in favor of discharge.
and.age and health.smitley was years old at the time of the trial,so he has a good many years of earning capacity left.smitley testified that his health is good,but he said that he had not had a physical examination for seven years.smitley had a serious medical problem a few years ago when he ruptured an artery in his leg and was hospitalized for ten days.he did not return to work for six weeks,and his uninsured status left him with in medical bills that he had to pay.a comparable health problem in the future would likely send the smitleys back into bankruptcy.
earning ability education prospects and efforts for increasing earnings.the majority notes that smitley and his wife have stable employment and weighs this against discharge.ante at.stable employment should not be an automatic penalty.as a general rule,it shows good faith and a sense of duty.what is more important is the earnings total which i have already discussed and whether sufficient effort has been made to increase the total.as for smitley,who works as a dental assistant,the bankruptcy judge found that she has no real prospect for advancement in her employment.moreover,the majority accepts that smitley can not work more than the weekly total of to hours she puts in at two jobs.ante at.she can not do more as a result of a hand problem that has not been diagnosed or treated because she can not afford to see a doctor.
as for smitley himself,the majority concludes that he has not made substantial job search efforts to find a position more appropriate to his level of education or to find work to supplement his current wages.ante at.this conclusion,which is key to the majority decision,runs into the bankruptcy judge finding that smitley has no prospects for improving his employment situation.specifically,the judge found that smitley is probably underemployed as a carpenter,but he has no prospects for other employment.emphasis added.because this finding is not clearly erroneous,it can not be set aside.fed.nor can it be ignored.
