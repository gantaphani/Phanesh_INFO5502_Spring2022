previously,we remanded this case to the board of immigration appeals bia to determine whether noncriminal informants working against the cali drug cartel constitute a particular social group within the meaning of that phrase in the immigration and nationality act ina,et.the bia concluded they did not.in this appeal,applying deferential review,we ask whether the bia interpretation of this statutory provision is reasonable.concluding that it is,we deny,with consternation,the petition for review of the bia order dismissing the appeal of diego,martha,andres,and diego collectively castillos from the immigration judge ij order denying their application seeking asylum and withholding of deportation.
background 
we incorporate the following facts and procedural history,which are not in dispute,from our previous decision in this case 
diego was born and raised in cali,colombia,the headquarters of the infamous cali drug cartel joined by his wife,martha,and his two sons,andres and diego,operated a bakery in cali and resided in the city until.during that time,
was an acquaintance of arturo davila,a former policeman in the cali police department who,after being fired for corruption,became the chief of security for the cali cartel.also happened to be a good friend of vladimir martinez meza,who was responsible for investigating and prosecuting narcotics traffickers in cali.
between and,davila would visit bakery on the weekends and chat openly and brazenly about his involvement with the cali cartel.during these conversations,davila would identify people,places and events related to the cartel exportation of narcotics from colombia to the united states and europe,as a citizen of cali,passed the information he learned from davila along to meza.he told meza about davila statements that the cartel had declared war against the colombian government and that the cartel would kill politicians who oppose it.also disclosed the extent,location and size of the assets of the cali cartel,including banks,bank accounts,mansions,haciendas,and villas both within and outside colombia.
good deeds would not go unpunished.on may,as was watching his son andres ride his bicycle in the street,a car suddenly blocked their path and three men emerged armed with pistols and an automatic weapon.the men tried to force into the car,but he resisted and was pushed to the ground and beaten.his beating caused andres to scream loudly,and one of the men andres in the face.andres scream and the accompanying commotion prompted people in the neighborhood to emerge from their homes,and the men fled in their car.as they departed,they told that things would only get worse for him and his family.then took his son to a clinic,where he needed reconstructive surgery to repair his mouth and jaw.
the castillos went to parents home in the northern section of cali for the rest of the month.attempted to rent his bakery while they were away,but his lessees were intimidated by individuals who would inquire about him,and on more than one occasion,a lessee was harmed after he refused to divulge information regarding whereabouts.although had never been involved in politics and had never testified against the cartel in a drug trial,meza recommended that go into hiding and,ultimately,leave colombia after made two trips to the united states in,the castillos entered the united states in february as visitors for pleasure with authorization to remain in the country until august.
on december,in accordance with a,the immigration and naturalization service the ins issued show cause orders to the castillos,charging them under a b with having remained in the united states for a longer time than permitted.at the show cause hearing,the castillos admitted the factual allegations in the show cause orders and conceded the charge of deportability.at that time,through counsel,they requested relief from deportation in the form of asylum,withholding of deportation,or at the very least,voluntary departure 
following a hearing on their requests for relief,the ij denied the castillos applications for asylum and withholding of deportation.initially,the ij noted that an alien is eligible for asylum under b only if he or she is a refugee,which is defined as an alien who is unable or unwilling to return to his or her country of origin because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a a.the ij concluded that even if the castillos have a fear of harm,that harm does not arise on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.instead,the ij concluded,the threat to the castillos was 
based on retaliation or retribution due to voluntary decision to be an informant against the cartel.admin rec.at.on this basis,the ij denied the castillos applications for asylum.and because the castillos failed to meet the lower burden of proof for establishing eligibility for asylum,the ij denied withholding of deportation because they could not satisfy the higher burden of proof to qualify for such relief.see h al najjar ashcroft,cir.the ij granted the castillos requests for voluntary departure and entered an alternative order of deportation to colombia.
the castillos timely filed an appeal to the bia.on appeal,and his family argued that they qualified as refugees under a a because they suffered a fear of persecution based on a political opinion imputed to by the drug cartel and his membership in a particular social group,namely,a group composed of informants.the bia rejected their first argument,holding that the people who threatened the castillos did so out of personal motives and not due to any political opinion imputed to.admin.rec.at.although the bia did not separately address their claim based on membership in a particular social group,the bia ultimately concluded that the record contained insufficient evidence that there was any motivation other than revenge for the aid provided to the government,and wrote that w e agree with the immigration judge decision that the respondents have failed to adequately establish that they suffered past persecution or that they have a fear of persecution on account of a ground protected under the immigration and nationality act.id.at.as a result,the bia affirmed the ij decision and dismissed the appeal.
att y.cir per curiam certain footnotes omitted or renumbered.
in that prior appeal,we held that the facts of the case were essentially undisputed,and the only issue was the application of the ina,at.we affirmed the bia conclusion that was not persecuted on account of his political opinion.id.at.however,we held that the bia conclusion that was targeted by the cartel solely out of revenge was not supported by substantial evidence.id.at.though there was evidence of revenge,a reasonable factfinder would be compelled to conclude that produced evidence that the harm was motivated by his membership in a group composed of noncriminal informants.id.at.we then remanded the case to the bia to decide the sole issue here on appeal,if noncriminal informants constitute a particular social group within the meaning of the phrase in the ina,a a,at.
on remand,the bia concluded that noncriminal informants did not constitute a particular social group.the bia relied on matter of acosta,bia,overruled on other grounds by matter of mogharrabi,bia,as authority for the premise that a particular social group refers to persons who share a common,immutable characteristic.at quoting matter of acosta,at.reiterating acosta,the bia stated that members of a particular social group are those persons with a shared characteristic such as sex,color,or kinship ties,or in some circumstances a shared past experience such as former military leadership or land ownership.id.quoting matter of acosta,at.the bia noted that this characteristic must be one that the members of the group either can not change,or should not be required to change because it is fundamental to their individual identities or consciences.id.quoting matter of acosta,at.it is only in these circumstances that membership in a particular social group becomes comparable to the other grounds listed in the statute.id.while reiterating its continued adherence to the acosta formulation,the bia decision also referenced guidelines from the united nations high commissioner for refugees unhcr,which define a particular social group as 
a group of persons who share a common characteristic other than their risk of being persecuted,or who are perceived as a group by society.the characteristic will often be one which is innate,unchangeable,or which is otherwise fundamental to identity,conscience or the exercise of one human rights.
id.at citing unhcr,guidelines on international protection membership of a particular social group within the context of article of the convention its protocol relating to the status of refugees,doc.may,hereinafter unhcr guidelines.
the bia then considered whether past acts were the kind of shared past experience that constitutes membership in a particular social group.id.at.in applying the acosta formulation,the bia listed two major considerations immutability and social visibility.id.at.in analyzing immutability,the bia conceded that a past experience is,by its very nature immutable,as it has already occurred and can not be undone.id.at.the bia noted,however,that this fact does not mean that any past experience that may be shared by others suffices to define a particular social group for asylum purposes.id.
analogizing noncriminal informants to occupations like the police or military,the bia stated that we do not afford protection based on social group membership to persons exposed to risks normally associated with employment in such occupations.id.citing matter of fuentes,bia.while noting that a former member of the national police could conceivably demonstrate membership in a particular social group,the bia cautioned that if a former police officer were singled out for reprisal,not because of his status as a former police officer,but because of his role in disrupting particular criminal activity,he would not be considered,without more,to have been targeted as a member of a particular social group.id.the bia further concluded that those who accept such employment are aware of the risks involved in the disruption of criminal activity.id.similarly,the bia noted that those who inform on criminal activity are also aware of similar dangers.it also dismissed the distinction between compensated informants and uncompensated,informants as not particularly helpful in addressing the question of who is deserving of protection under the asylum law.id.at.
in analyzing social visibility,the bia stressed that its other decisions recognizing particular social groups involved characteristics which were highly visible and recognizable by others in the country in question.id.at.the bia noted that the two illustrations provided in acosta,former military leadership and land ownership are also easily recognizable traits.id.quoting matter of acosta,at.once again referencing the unhcr guidelines,the bia stated that while persecutory action toward a group may be a relevant action in determining the visibility of a group in a particular society,the social group was not meant to be a and can not be defined exclusively by the fact that it is targeted for persecution.id.quoting unhcr guidelines,emphases in original.
with regard to confidential informants,the bia noted that the very nature of the conduct at issue is such that it is generally out of the public view,and it thereby concluded that informants lacked the necessary social visibility to be recognized as a particular social group.id.in ultimately denying appeal and affirming the ij decision,the bia raised additional concerns about the numerosity and inchoateness of informants and noted that the cartels have been known to target the population in general in order to intimidate potential witnesses and anyone perceived to have interfered with its operations.id.at.the castillos then timely appealed the bia decision.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
to the extent that the bia decision was based on a legal determination,review is de novo.mohammed ashcroft,cir.however,as we noted in our previous decision,de novo review of the bia interpretation is informed by the principle of deference articulated in chevron,natural resources defense council,d,at.
the supreme court has established a process for reviewing an agency interpretation of a statute which it administers.chevron,at.at.first,if congressional purpose is clear,courts and administrative agencies must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at.at.a second level of review,however,is triggered when the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue.id.at.at.in such a case,a court may not substitute its own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an agency.id.at.at see also ins,d t he bia should be accorded chevron deference as it gives ambiguous statutory terms concrete meaning through a process of adjudication.quotations omitted mazariegos office of att y,cir the degree of deference is especially great in the field of immigration.an agency interpretation is deemed reasonable unless it is arbitrary,capricious,or clearly contrary to law.alabama power fed.energy regulatory comm n,cir.
at issue in this case is the bia interpretation of the statutory phrase particular social group.under the ina,an alien who arrives in or is present in the united states may apply for asylum.a.the bia,through the attorney general,has the discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the ina definition of a refugee.see id.b a al najjar ashcroft,cir.in addition,the asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory refugee status.al najjar,at.in relevant part,a refugee is 
any person who is outside any country of such person nationality or,in the case of a person having no nationality,is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided,and who is unable or unwilling to return to,and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of,that country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.
a a emphasis added.with regard to withholding of deportation now removal,the attorney general may not deport an alien if his life or freedom would be threatened in that country because of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.h emphasis added now codified at b a.
congress did not directly speak on the issue of what constitutes a particular social group,one of the five listed categories that qualify for refugee status or withholding of deportation,within the meaning of the ina.see a a id.h now codified at b a.accordingly,we must follow the bia determination that noncriminal informants working against the cali cartel are not a social group under the ina unless the interpretation is unreasonable,arbitrary,capricious,or clearly contrary to law.see alabama power,at.
whether the bia interpretation is reasonable 
the castillos argue that the bia interpretation of particular social group,which excludes noncriminal informants working against the cali drug cartel,was unreasonable.in so doing,they contend that other social groups that have qualified under the ina are neither more visible nor recognizable than noncriminal informants or former informants.they further assert that the bia put forth contradictory rationales in concluding that noncriminal informants do not qualify as a particular social group.additionally,they contend that family members have suffered derivative persecution on the basis of his status as a noncriminal informant.
to date,we have not expressly reviewed,under chevron,the bia legal definition of particular social group.there are six circuits who have deferred to the acosta formulation.see thomas gonzales,cir en banc niang gonzales,cir silva ashcroft,cir ins,cir lwin ins,cir fatin ins,cir.two circuits,while not expressly deferring to the bia legal definition of particular social group,have viewed acosta favorably.see ashcroft
