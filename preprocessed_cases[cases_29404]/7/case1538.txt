in response to the terrorist attacks on september,congress passed the stabilization act.among many other provisions,the act gave airlines an opportunity to defer transfer of the excise taxes for a few weeks after the usual due date.stabilization act a.the act included a grant of discretionary authority to the secretary of the treasury to further extend the and excise tax due dates until january,an option that the secretary exercised.id.a a.the act also provided that airlines could collect direct government grants.id.a.national received such a grant,in the amount of million.it did not pay excise taxes during the deferral period.

to impose personal liability,the statute requires that the individual was required to collect,truthfully account for,and pay over the withholding taxes commonly known as a responsible person and willfully failed to meet one or more of these obligations.united states sotelo,d internal quotation marks omitted.in an action to collect taxes,the government bears the initial burden of proof.oliver united states,cir.the government satisfies its burden by introducing evidence of the tax assessment under.id.the burden then shifts to the taxpayer to prove that he is not liable.id.
on appeal,plaintiff does not challenge the district court finding that he is a responsible person for purposes of but he does argue that his failure to pay over the excise taxes was not willful under the second prong of the sotelo standard.in particular,plaintiff asks us to adopt a rule that the element of willfulness under can not be satisfied by a failure to use encumbered funds to make excise tax payments,elmore united states,cir,and to hold that national bankruptcy obligations rendered all funds encumbered as a matter of law for the purpose of analyzing willfulness under.
