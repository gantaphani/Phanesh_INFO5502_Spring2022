the real estate recovery program bus.et allows persons who have been defrauded by a real estate licensee to recover from a state monitored account,funded from real estate license fees the recovery account.to be eligible to recover,an applicant must have obtained a final judgment against the licensee for fraud or conversion of trust funds arising directly from a transaction in which the licensee performed acts for which a license was required,and the judgment must not have been discharged in bankruptcy,subds.a c f.the maximum amount payable to claimants against any particular licensee is limited to.when multiple claimants seek more than this amount,the real estate commissioner the commissioner must file an action for determination of the prorated share to be distributed to each claimant.this appeal arises from such an action.appellants are one group of claimants the bagnol group who contend that the trial court erroneously determined that a second group the allison claimants was eligible to share in the recovery,reducing the bagnol group portion.the trial court permitted the allison claimants to rely on a judgment against a licensee that had been previously discharged in bankruptcy,because the bankruptcy court had ruled that this judgment was not discharged for the limited purpose of obtain ing recovery from the real estate recovery fund.we conclude that such a judgment does not constitute the requisite personal judgment against a licensee and reverse the order directing payment.
the legal framework 
to obtain funds from the recovery account,a claimant must submit an application to the commissioner for payment of the amount left unpaid on a judgment.the decision to grant or deny the application lies with the commissioner,but a claimant whose application has been denied may seek from the court that rendered the judgment an order directing payment out of the recovery account.if the commissioner determines that the liability of the recovery account appears to be insufficient to pay in full all valid claims against a single licensee,then the commissioner must file a proration proceeding in court,and the court must determine how the funds are to be distributed.generally,the funds are to be distributed among the claimants in proportion to the ratio that each claim bears to the aggregate of all claims,but the court retains the authority to employ any other equitable method of distribution.
factual and procedural background 
during the,george albert barber,george michael montross,and their real estate company,montross barber investments,mbi,syndicated various real estate limited partnerships in the san francisco bay area.barber,montross and mbi all held real estate licenses issued by the department of real estate.montross and barber misused and converted partnership funds,resulting in financial losses for the investors.both barber and montross were ultimately convicted of criminal fraud.
the allison claimants,who had been limited partners in the lake kensington park project,brought an action in san mateo superior court against barber,montross,and mbi for fraud,conversion,and other causes of action.allison montross super.san mateo county.the allison claimants obtained default judgments against montross and barber in.that same year,montross filed for bankruptcy,and in the allison claimants obtained a fraud judgment against him from the bankruptcy court that was declared to be nondischargeable.barber filed for bankruptcy and received an order of discharge in.
in the allison claimants submitted an application to the commissioner for payment from the recovery account for their losses caused by montross,barber,and mbi.other groups of defrauded investors filed similar applications,and still other groups had outstanding lawsuits,bringing the aggregate claims against the licensees to millions of dollars.in the commissioner initiated a proration proceeding in san francisco superior court to obtain a judicial determination of how the account for each licensee should be divided 
initially,the commissioner sought proration based on the assumption that each investor had a judgment against both barber and montross.the commissioner motion for summary judgment and for an order directing payment was opposed by a group of investors in the sunnyside terrace estates project the bagnol group.the bagnol group argued that the recovery accounts for barber and montross should not be aggregated,that recovery from the recovery account for barber should be limited to those claimants who actually have a valid judgment against barber,and that the bagnol group was then in litigation to obtain such a judgment.the commissioner then withdrew its motion as no longer ripe for decision and further agreed with the bagnol group that applicants could recover only if they had a judgment against the licensee.
in february the bagnol group obtained a judgment from the bankruptcy court,finding barber liable for fraud and conversion in the amount of and declaring such judgment nondischargeable.the bagnol group then submitted an application for payment from the recovery account for barber,asserting that it was the only group of claimants with a judgment against barber,that all other claims had been discharged in barber bankruptcy in.
in october the commissioner moved for an order determining eligibility to participate in the recovery account proration.with respect to the recovery account for barber,the commissioner asserted that the eligible applicants were the allison claimants and the bagnol group.the bagnol group objected to the eligibility of the allison claimants,arguing,among other things,that the default judgment obtained by the allison claimants against barber was a clerk judgment that could not have been based on fraud and that the judgment had been discharged in barber bankruptcy.
in response to this challenge,the allison claimants asserted that they had never received notice of barber bankruptcy.they also impliedly acknowledged the defect in the clerk default judgment,and they returned to the san mateo superior court and applied for a new default judgment against barber by the court.after a hearing to establish damages,the san mateo superior court entered a default judgment in november in favor of the allison claimants and against barber for plus interest based on fraud and breach of fiduciary duty 
within the proration proceeding,the commissioner then argued that the replacement judgment satisfied the requirements for recovery by the allison claimants.the bagnol group objected,asserting that the judgment was a subterfuge to get around the bankruptcy discharge.the trial court ruled,however,that both the allison claimants and the bagnol group were entitled to a pro rata distribution from barber recovery account.the court directed the commissioner to ascertain the identities of the persons eligible,to compute the pro rata share of each claimant,and to apply to the court for approval of the proposed proration.
the bagnol group moved for reconsideration,arguing that the new judgment did not qualify the allison claimants for recovery.the bagnol group presented a copy of the schedule of creditors filed in barber bankruptcy,showing the allison claimants listed as unsecured creditors.the motion for reconsideration was denied.the bagnol group appealed the order determining eligibility,but we held the appeal was premature as no final order of proration had yet been entered.zinnemann bagnol,nonpub.opn.
meanwhile,barber moved in the san mateo superior court to declare the default judgment void on the ground that the initial judgment had been discharged in bankruptcy.the allison claimants removed the matter to the bankruptcy court for decision on that motion,and the matter was dropped from the superior court calendar.on august,during the pendency of the previous appeal,the bankruptcy court denied barber motion and ruled that the judgment had not been discharged in bankruptcy for purposes of allowing recovery from the recovery account 
also while the previous appeal was pending,the trial court determined the pro rata payment to be made to the numerous applicants from the recovery account for mon
