bankruptcy 
the panel reversed the bankruptcy appellate panel affirmance of the bankruptcy court dismissal of an adversary proceeding against a chapter debtor,seeking exception to discharge of debts pursuant to c.
the panel held that an intervenor can continue to litigate as the sole remaining party in a bankruptcy proceeding involving his own claim,when the original party who represented his interest,and whose adversary complaint he adopted without filing his own,was dismissed for failure to prosecute.the panel held that after the dismissal of the original party,an independent basis for subject matter jurisdiction existed because the bankruptcy court did not dismiss or otherwise adjudicate the claim itself.in addition,the goal of judicial economy was best served by allowing the intervenor to continue litigating the timely filed claim.
thomas,chief judge 
in this case we are asked to decide whether an intervenor can continue to litigate as the sole remaining party in a bankruptcy proceeding involving his own claim,when the original party who represented his interest,and whose adversary complaint he adopted without filing his own,was dismissed for failure to prosecute.because we conclude that he can proceed,we reverse and remand.
this appeal,the second in this bankruptcy proceeding,concerns augustine bustos ongoing efforts to pursue an claim under c against steven molasky,the debtor in may,a corporate entity controlled by molasky took out a loan and executed a promissory note for million in favor of onecap funding corporation onecap.molasky also executed a continuing guarantee that obligated him personally on this debt.bustos was an investor in this debt instrument through onecap his funds accounted for of the million loaned to molasky.
the agreement between bustos and onecap provided that onecap would represent bustos in any court proceedings as long as the agreement was still in effect and while any amounts we re still outstanding under the note s.it provided that bustos was not to represent himself in any courts unless the agreement is terminated.
molasky filed for chapter bankruptcy on may.under the deadline set by federal rule of bankruptcy procedure c,creditors received notice that the last day to file a complaint objecting to the discharge of a debt under c was august.in accordance with the agreement,onecap filed a timely complaint on behalf of the lenders who had invested in the promissory note.in its adversary complaint,onecap raised a claim under a a,alleging that molasky debt on the promissory note was not dischargeable because molasky had knowingly made false representations on which onecap had relied when making the loan.
a number of parties subsequently reached a settlement with molasky in the main bankruptcy case regarding a separate group of debts that indirectly related to bustos.as part of that settlement,the parties stipulated that bustos would be allowed to intervene in the adversary proceeding initiated by onecap.at a hearing on whether to approve the settlement agreement,counsel for onecap explained that molasky had agreed that bustos may file a motion to intervene in the onecap adversary proceeding regarding the claim,and the debtor will not raise any affirmative defenses regarding timeliness or statute of limitations.bustos counsel further described the agreement as providing that bustos would be treated as if he filed the complaint with the onecap representatives.molasky counsel agreed with this description of the settlement terms,and the bankruptcy court approved them as part of the settlement agreement.
bustos moved to intervene in the adversary proceeding on september,filing his own adversary complaint in accordance with federal rule of civil procedure c.bustos complaint almost exactly mirrored the portions of the onecap complaint relating to the promissory note disputed here.molasky did not object to bustos intervention but objected to his filing this separate complaint in intervention.
looking to the terms of the settlement agreement,the bankruptcy court allowed bustos to intervene in the complaint in the action brought by onecap under bankruptcy rule but it did not allow bustos to file his own,separate complaint.in granting bustos motion,the bankruptcy court ordered that bustos be afforded all the rights and remedies as those granted to onecap holding corporation in this adversary proceeding insofar as they pertain to any and all of the claims of augustine bustos against the.
several months later,the bankruptcy court allowed counsel for onecap to withdraw,and no replacement counsel appeared on onecap behalf at a status conference the following month.the court ordered onecap to appear and explain why it should not be dismissed from the adversary proceeding for failure to prosecute.when onecap did not appear at the hearing,the court dismiss ed onecap from the proceeding and explained that this situation le ft bustos as the lone party to carry the flag in this matter.
molasky then moved to dismiss bustos and the adversary proceeding entirely.the motion alleged that,following onecap dismissal,there was no party for bustos to assist as an intervenor in the action.because bustos had not filed his own claim,molasky argued that bustos could show no independent basis for jurisdiction against molasky.bustos opposed the motion to dismiss,arguing that he should be able to proceed on the basis of the onecap complaint,which he had effectively adopted when the court allowed him to intervene but prohibited him from filing his own complaint.
after holding a hearing,the bankruptcy court granted molasky motion to dismiss.looking to benavidez eu,cir,the bankruptcy court explained that an intervenor can proceed after dismissal of the original party only if an independent basis for jurisdiction exists,and it concluded that there was no such basis here because bustos had not filed his own complaint.bustos appealed to the district court,which reversed the dismissal,concluding that t he adversary proceeding underlying this appeal and the bankruptcy court subject matter jurisdiction survived the dismissal of onecap as a plaintiff.
molasky then appealed to this court,and a panel issued a memorandum disposition vacating the district court order.the panel held that the bankruptcy court had correctly stated the applicable legal standard under benavidez.molasky bustos in re molasky molasky i,app x,cir.citing benavidez,at.but in applying this standard to bustos in light of his failure to file a timely complaint the panel concluded that the bankruptcy court had erred in failing to consider equitable factors that might justify extending the deadline or otherwise allowing bustos to pursue the onecap complaint.id.at.as an example,the panel pointed to fasson magouirk in re magouirk,cir,which laid out five equitable factors that courts have previously considered in deciding whether to extend bankruptcy deadlines.molasky i,app x at.the panel therefore remanded to the bankruptcy court for a determination of jurisdiction over bustos under bankruptcy rule,which sets the deadline for claims.id.at.
on remand,the bankruptcy court considered an intervening precedential decision from this court,anwar johnson,cir,which clarified that bankruptcy courts do not have equitable discretion to extend the rule deadline retroactively.in light of this intervening precedent,the bankruptcy court concluded that equitable relief from the deadline under frbp c was not available to bustos and that,having failed to timely assert a separate objection to dischargeability before the deadline expired,bustos could not continue to prosecute the action.on appeal,the bankruptcy appellate panel bap affirmed this decision in all respects.bustos timely appealed to this court.we have jurisdiction to hear his appeal under d.
