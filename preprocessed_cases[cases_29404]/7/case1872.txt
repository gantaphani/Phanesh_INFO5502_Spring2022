the district court dismissed this action simply based on the fact that plaintiff bankruptcy case was pending at the time she filed this action and,consequently,p laintiff lacked standing to file it.doc.at.the district court supported this decision with citations to cases holding that the bankruptcy trustee in a chapter case has exclusive standing to assert claims belonging to the bankruptcy estate.see,vidal doral bank,d.similarly,in their brief on appeal defendants cite to several cases involving chapter proceedings and to the statutory provision defining the duties of a chapter trustee,a,in support of their argument that the trustee in plaintiff bankruptcy case had exclusive standing to bring the instant complaint.
however,plaintiff bankruptcy case was brought under chapter,not chapter.in a chapter case,unlike a chapter case,the debtor remains in possession of the property of the estate.see b.the duties of a chapter trustee differ from those of a chapter trustee,compare b with a,while a chapter debtor has many of the same rights and powers as a chapter trustee,see.
because of these differences between chapter and chapter bankruptcies,the four circuit courts to consider this issue have all concluded that chapter debtors have standing to bring claims in their own name on behalf of the bankruptcy estate see crosby monroe county,cir cable ivy tech state college,cir olick parker parsley petroleum,cir maritime united jersey bank,cir see also autos,gowin,cir citing this authority and concluding that chapter debtor had standing to pursue claim on benefit of estate.it would frustrate the essential purpose of to grant the debtor possession of the chose in action yet prohibit him from pursuing it for the benefit of the estate.cable,at see also in re bowker,explaining other practical reasons why debtor rather than trustee should have standing to pursue litigation on behalf of chapter bankruptcy estate.
this conclusion is supported by the legislative history of the bankruptcy provisions both the house of representatives and senate floor managers of the uniform law on bankruptcies,stated that although section is not specified in section,certainly it is intended that the chapter debtor has the power to sue and be sued.olick,at first alteration in original quoting cong.rec,statement of edwards cong.rec,statement of deconcini.rule of the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure also supports the conclusion that the chapter debtor has standing to bring a civil complaint with or without court approval,the trustee or debtor in possession may prosecute or may enter an appearance and defend any pending action or proceeding by or against the debtor,or commence and prosecute any action or proceeding in behalf of the estate before any tribunal.fed.emphasis added 
we find this authority persuasive.we therefore hold that plaintiff,as a chapter debtor,had standing to file this complaint on behalf of the bankruptcy estate.because the district court did not address any of the alternative grounds for dismissal asserted by defendants,we decline to address those issues for the first time on appeal,leaving them for the district court to consider on remand 
we note that plaintiff bankruptcy case was dismissed with prejudice approximately two weeks after she filed her complaint in this case.defendants argument that the dismissal of plaintiff bankruptcy case precludes any further bankruptcy proceedings may need to be addressed in the proceedings on remand,given our conclusion that plaintiff had standing in her capacity as a chapter debtor rather than in her individual capacity.we conclude that it would be best to leave this argument to be considered in the first instance by the bankruptcy court,if necessary.see in re gorski,cir argument,raised for first time on appeal,that bankruptcy court would not have authority to reopen case dismissed based on debtor noncompliance with plan need not be answered here and may be pressed on remand.if the district court decides that none of the alternative grounds for dismissal asserted by defendants apply,the bankruptcy court should determine whether it would be permissible and appropriate to reopen plaintiff bankruptcy case.the bankruptcy court may also determine whether sanctions would be appropriate for plaintiff alleged failure to disclose these causes of action in her bankruptcy schedule.if the bankruptcy court concludes that the bankruptcy case should not be reopened,the district court should determine whether,as defendants argue,plaintiff permanently lost possession of these causes of action under d because she failed to properly list them in her bankruptcy schedule.
we reverse and remand.
the majority has assembled an impressive list of cases concluding a chapter debtor has the capacity to sue on behalf of the bankruptcy estate without court supervision.majority op.at.perhaps it is shoveling sand against the tide,but i think we should do more than find and follow cases.such decisions are appealing only to the extent of their power to persuade i am not persuaded and,thus,dissent.
the common thread in the cases cited by the majority reveals two bases for concluding a chapter debtor has capacity to sue legislative history and rule of the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure.but the legislative history is utterly at odds with statutory text and the rule rationale is more legerdemain than reason.this result is contrary to the plain language of the bankruptcy code and is not sanctioned by bankruptcy rules.and giving a chapter debtor an expansive right to self help,independent of and untethered to oversight by the bankruptcy court,is unwarranted and unwise.
legislative history 
all seem to agree on one bankruptcy code does not expressly give a chapter debtor capacity to sue in her own name as a representative of the estate.that should end the debate,but the cases cited by the majority have read such a provision into the bankruptcy code,implementing,they say,congressional intent.doing so ignores the preeminent canon of statutory presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.bank germain,d.are first principles best honored in their breach it is perverse logic to conclude congress meant what it did not say

the source of the supposed congressional intent comes from statements made by house and senate floor managers,who conceded the statute does not give a chapter debtor capacity to sue but,nevertheless,said congress intended that result.majority op
