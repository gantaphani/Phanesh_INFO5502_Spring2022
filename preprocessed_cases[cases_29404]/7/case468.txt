opinion of the court 
we decide whether a chapter trustee who does not lodge a timely objection to a debtor exemption of personal property may nevertheless move to sell the property if he later learns that the property value exceeds the amount of the claimed exemption.where,as here,the debtor indicates the intent to exempt her entire interest in a given property by claiming an exemption of its full value and the trustee does not object in a timely manner,we hold that the debtor is entitled to the property in its entirety.
background 
debtor nadejda reilly is a cook with a catering business.on april,she filed a chapter bankruptcy petition with all of the necessary schedules and statements.relevant to this appeal,she listed as personal property on her schedule b an entry of business equipment with a value of.on her schedule c,where reilly claimed certain property as exempt from the bankruptcy,she again listed the business equipment with a value of.she claimed an exemption for the full value of the property,asserting of it under d and under d.appellant william schwab,who serves as the bankruptcy trustee in this matter,did not object to the exemption within the period prescribed by federal rule of bankruptcy procedure b.
schwab later sought an appraisal of the business consists of catering utensils and determined it to have a value of approximately.he then filed a motion before the bankruptcy court to sell the business equipment in order to recoup the value,less the exemption,for the bankruptcy estate.reilly filed a timely answer to the motion to sell,asserting that the business equipment had become fully exempt when the period for filing an objection expired and was therefore not subject to sale by the trustee.
the bankruptcy court for the middle district of pennsylvania held a hearing on the matter and ultimately denied schwab motion to sell.it agreed with reilly that the property was fully exempt from the bankruptcy estate because schwab had not filed a timely objection to reilly claim of exemption.schwab appealed,but the district court for the middle district of pennsylvania denied the appeal.specifically,the district court found that reilly had demonstrated her intent to exempt the entire value of the business property by listing the figure as both the value of the property and the amount of the exemption.because she exempted the entire value without a timely objection from the trustee,the district court held that reilly was entitled to the entire value of the exempted property,even if it was worth more than she had stated on the exemption forms.schwab now appeals to us.

iii.analysis 
when a debtor files for bankruptcy under chapter,he or she must file,among other items,a document known as a schedule b,which lists all of his or her personal property.fed.b.this property forms the basis of the estate to be distributed to creditors.the debtor is allowed to claim certain property as exempt from the bankruptcy estate,such that it is not distributed to creditors.id.
in order to exempt property from the bankruptcy estate,the debtor must file a list of property that the debtor claims as exempt.id.l.this document is known as a schedule c,and it requires the debtor to list both the value of the exemption claimed and the current market value of the property before the exemption is taken.
after the debtor files the bankruptcy petition and appropriate schedules,the bankruptcy trustee holds a meeting of the creditors,where he verifies the information contained in the debtor materials.id.after this meeting,any party in interest,including the bankruptcy trustee,can object to an exemption taken by the debtor on his or her schedule c.this process is governed by federal rule of bankruptcy procedure.it provides in relevant part 
a claim of exemptions.
a debtor shall list the property claimed as exempt under of the code on the schedule of assets required to be filed by rule.if the debtor fails to claim exemptions or file the schedule within the time specified in rule,a dependent of the debtor may file the list within days thereafter.
b objecting to a claim of exemptions.
a party in interest may file an objection to the list of property claimed as exempt only within days after the meeting of creditors held under a is concluded or within days after any amendment to the list or supplemental schedules is filed,whichever is later.the court may,for cause,extend the time for filing objections if,before the time to object expires,a party in interest files a request for an extension.copies of the objections shall be delivered or mailed to the trustee,the person filing the list,and the attorney for that person.
c burden of proof.
in any hearing under this rule,the objecting party has the burden of proving that the exemptions are not properly claimed.after hearing on notice,the court shall determine the issues presented by the objections 
fed.under rule b,then,the trustee,as a party in interest,has days from the close of the creditors meeting under a or the date of filing any supplemental schedules or amendment to the list,whichever is later to object to any exemptions a debtor claimed on his or her schedule c.if no objection is made,the property claimed as exempt on the schedule c is exempt.l.
as noted,reilly claimed her business equipment as exempt on her schedule c,and she listed the value of the property as and the value of the exemption as.the trustee,schwab,did not object to reilly exemption of her business equipment within days of the conclusion of the creditors meeting,nor did he timely seek an extension of the time in which to make an objection.schwab,however,argues that he was not required to file a timely objection because he was not objecting to the propriety of reilly taking the exemption as such rather,his objection goes to the value of the property claimed as exempt.stated another way,he contends that rule and l only place a limit on the trustee ability to object to an exemption on the ground that it was not properly there is no statutory basis for claiming the does not control objections to property valuation.schwab claims that applying rule to objections to an exemption valuation would invite gamesmanship among debtors,who would seek to undervalue their assets.he also asserts that trustees would be forced to object to the valuation of an exemption every time the debtor values the property and the exemption identically.
the starting point for our analysis is the supreme court decision in taylor freeland kronz,d.there the court had an opportunity to consider the application of rule limit on objections to exemptions.the debtor in taylor had filed a chapter petition for bankruptcy while she was pursuing an employment discrimination claim on appeal before the pennsylvania supreme court.on her schedules before the bankruptcy court,she listed as exempt the proceeds from her lawsuit and claim for lost wages.she listed both the value of the asset and the amount of the exemption as unknown.id.at.during the initial meeting of creditors,the debtor attorneys informed the bankruptcy trustee that the debtor might win a judgment in her suit.after the creditors meeting,the trustee investigated the potential lawsuit further,but ultimately did not object to the claimed unknown exemption.id.at.the lawsuit later settled for,of which was paid by a check to the debtor and her attorneys.the debtor signed this check over to her attorneys as payment for their representation,and the trustee filed a complaint against the attorneys in bankruptcy court,contending that the money was part of the bankruptcy estate.id.at.the supreme court di
