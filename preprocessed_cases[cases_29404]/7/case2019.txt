this appeal raises complicated questions regarding the application of res judicata to bankruptcy proceedings.teledyne industries,owns shares in a new corporate entity formed to receive the assets of a chapter debtor,piper aircraft.kaiser aerospace and electronics is currently suing teledyne in florida state court because teledyne allegedly violated an agreement between the parties that,kaiser says,would have given it certain shares in the new entity.in the state court action,kaiser seeks damages as well as a constructive trust over the shares that it contends belong to it.teledyne brought this case as an adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy court to enjoin kaiser state court action on the ground that it was barred by res judicata.teledyne asserts that kaiser should have,but did not,pursue its allegations during the chapter case.the bankruptcy court and subsequently the district court found that kaiser constructive trust claim was barred by res judicata,but that kaiser damages claim was not barred.
because we conclude that kaiser state court claims do not arise out of the same nucleus of operative fact as the chapter case,and kaiser lacked an adequate procedural vehicle to bring its state court claims,or their equivalent,in the chapter case,res judicata is not applicable to any of kaiser claims.accordingly,we affirm the district court insofar as it permitted kaiser damages claim to proceed in state court,but reverse the district court insofar as it enjoined kaiser constructive trust claim from going forward.
these arise out of a chapter reorganization proceeding filed by piper aircraft corporation piper on july.teledyne was one of piper largest creditors,holding a judgment of approximately at the time of the chapter filing.teledyne was the only unsecured creditor granted exclusive rights to participate in the preparation and submission of reorganization plans for confirmation by the bankruptcy court.only teledyne,the unsecured creditors committee,and piper itself were permitted to file such plans.
in november,teledyne entered into a cooperation and shareholders agreement cooperation agreement with kaiser,which was not a creditor of piper and had no other stake in the chapter case.the cooperation agreement provided that teledyne and kaiser would act as of a plan for the sale of piper assets.under this plan the plan,a newly formed entity,piper international corporation pic,now appellee paq,would purchase substantially all of piper assets.kaiser was to be the majority shareholder,holding of the stock,while teledyne was expected to hold the remaining.pursuant to the plan,pic would purchase piper assets for million in cash and a million junior secured note,and would assume certain liabilities as well.in exchange,teledyne would voluntarily subordinate its claims against piper estate.
the plan was submitted to the bankruptcy court over the objections of piper and the creditors committee,which submitted an alternative plan.a hearing was held on december,to consider approval of the respective disclosure statements regarding these proposed plans.after the hearing,the bankruptcy court concluded that neither plan was viable.
in the wake of that hearing through march of,piper,the creditors committee,teledyne,kaiser,and pic actively participated in negotiations to achieve consensus on a confirmable plan.finally,in march,teledyne and the creditors committee agreed on a new plan that provided for the acquisition of piper assets.by this point,however,teledyne was no longer aligned with kaiser.instead,teledyne had joined forces with another partner,dimeling,schreiber park.
after the bankruptcy court rejected the plan,the relationship between teledyne and kaiser began to erode.the parties differ on the cause of the breakdown.teledyne claims that kaiser,in order to satisfy the creditors committee and piper,and to avoid further objections from other creditors,demanded that teledyne accept a reduced interest in the new entity.according to teledyne,when it declined kaiser modifications,kaiser refused to attend a critical meeting with piper and the creditors committee to negotiate a workable consensual plan,and virtually abandoned the deal outlined in the cooperation agreement.by contrast,kaiser contends that teledyne demanded a substantially larger share of the new entity for no additional consideration.when kaiser insisted that teledyne honor its obligations under the cooperation agreement,teledyne unilaterally terminated the agreement and substituted,which was willing to accept a lesser share of the new entity,as a of what eventually resulted in the confirmed plan.these allegations are at the core of kaiser state court action.
on march,teledyne and,with the support of the creditors committee and piper,filed their joint plan the p plan in the bankruptcy court.the relevant portions of the p plan provided that a different new entity called new piper would acquire substantially all of piper assets.primary ownership of new piper would be held by teledyne and.an irrevocable trust,set up to obtain the sale and other proceeds to be paid by new piper,would be formed to make distributions to piper creditors.under the p plan,would hold of the shares of new piper,while the trust and teledyne would each hold.kaiser would not hold any ownership interest.
in exchange for its rights under the p plan,teledyne waived all claims against piper,including the liquidated judgment it had acquired.teledyne asserts that,because of the size of this claim,its waiver materially and substantially increased the distributions available for other creditors and interest holders.teledyne also contends that it made these concessions and acquired the new piper stock in reliance on,and pursuant to,the provisions of the p plan.
following two days of confirmation hearings,the bankruptcy court on july,entered an order confirming the p plan.although kaiser received formal notice and attended the confirmation hearing,it did not file or express any objections to the plan at the hearing or at any other time.nor did it appeal the confirmation order.
meanwhile,upon learning of the incipient arrangement between teledyne and,but shortly prior to the filing of the p plan,kaiser commenced a lawsuit against teledyne and others in florida state court.in its original complaint,filed march,kaiser sought damages from teledyne for breach of the cooperation agreement and for breach of fiduciary duty the damages claim.kaiser alleged that teledyne breached its express obligations under the cooperation agreement by,among other things,disclaiming and abandoning its obligation to cooperate with plaintiffs to enable pic to acquire the assets of piper,withdrawing from and otherwise ceasing to act as a proponent of the plan without the express consent of kaiser and pic,and unilaterally terminating the cooperation agreement without the mutual consent of the parties notwithstanding the absence of any breach by kaiser or pic of any obligations on their part.kaiser further alleged that teledyne violated implied obligations arising under the cooperation agreement,by us ing a knowingly erroneous excuse to try to justify its abandonment of a binding contractual obligation,its leap to schedule furtive meetings with to better its own position and its purported continued negotiation on behalf of kaiser and pic when it had already contacted to bring them into the deal.
on december,one and a half years after confirmation of the plan,kaiser amended its state court complaint to request a constructive trust over the stock in new piper to the extent necessary for kaiser to own the number of shares it allegedly would have received under the defunct plan the constructive trust claim kaiser does not ask the state court to unwind the bankruptcy court approval of the plan awarding ownership of new piper to teledyne and,or to alter any of the bankruptcy court rulings.the practical effect of granting the constructive trust,however,would be to give kaiser an ownership stake in new piper,even though the bankruptcy court never considered that possibility one way or another.
teledyne proceeded through the confirmation process without apparent concern over the state court suit.it did not mention kaiser suit to the bankruptcy court at the time of confirmation or address with that court any of the disputed facts giving rise to kaiser action.not until april did teledyne finally challenge before the bankruptcy court the viability of kaiser state court action,moving before the same bankruptcy judge who had confirmed the plan to enforce the confirmation order.
eventually,at the bankruptcy court urging,teledyne filed the instant adversary proceeding on july,in which it sought declaratory and injunctive relief.specifically,teledyne asked the bankruptcy court to delineate the rights of the parties and to enjoin kaiser from interfering with the distributions and interests provided by the confirmed p plan.the basis for this relief was res judicata.around that time teledyne also interposed a res judicata defense in the state court action,but did not pursue it,opting instead to seek injunctive relief from the bankruptcy court.
teledyne moved for summary judgment in the adversary proceeding.kaiser opposed the motion and filed a for summary judgment.on january,the bankruptcy court ruled from the bench.this oral ruling,which contained an extensive recitation of the facts and circumstances that led to the dispute,was ultimately incorporated into an order granting in part and denying in part motions for summary judgment on which these appeals are predicated.
the bankruptcy court concluded that kaiser constructive trust claim was barred by the doctrine of res judicata,because it attacks a material provision in the confirmed plan,namely,ownership and control of new piper,and thus,was an impermissible collateral attack on the confirmed plan which should have been raised as an objection during the confirmation process.the court therefore enjoined kaiser prosecution of the constructive trust claim in the state court.the bankruptcy court found,however,that because no plan was pending at the time kaiser filed its damages claim,the date the original,unamended complaint was filed in state court,the damages claim was not barred by the confirmation order and could proceed in state court.
both parties appealed portions of the bankruptcy court order to the district court.in a lengthy order dated january,the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court,although on somewhat different grounds.kaiser aerospace teledyne.like the bankruptcy court,the district court focused heavily on the different nature of the remedies sought by kaiser.the major distinction between the district court analysis and that of the bankruptcy court related to why kaiser damages claim was not barred by res judicata.the district court based its conclusion on a determination that the damages claim was not a core proceeding within the meaning of the bankruptcy code and hence could not have been brought in the bankruptcy case due to lack of subject matter jurisdiction.notably,in reaching this conclusion,the court emphasized that kaiser state court damages claims do not arise out of the same nucleus of operative fact as the bankruptcy proceeding and that the outcome of kaiser damages claims would have no conceivable effect on the administration of the estate as reorganized under the confirmed plan.
on the other hand,the district court also ruled that kaiser constructive trust claim was a core proceeding that arose out of a common nucleus of operative fact with the chapter case and thus should have been pursued in that case.accordingly,the district court,like the bankruptcy court,enjoined kaiser from pursuing its constructive trust claim while allowing the damages claim to go forward in state court.these followed.
the standard of review is clear.a court application of res judicata presents questions of law reviewed de novo.see richardson miller,cir.this standard applies to res judicata determinations made originally by bankruptcy courts.see,in re justice oaks ii,cir.de novo review requires the court to make a judgment independent of the bankruptcy court,without deference to that court analysis and conclusions.see moody amoco oil,cir 
both parties object to portions of the district court order affirming the bankruptcy court.as it did on appeal to the district court,teledyne contends that the bankruptcy court erred by ruling that kaiser damages claim was not barred by res judicata.kaiser,in turn,contends that the bankruptcy court erred by ruling that its constructive trust claim was barred by res judicata.
notably,neither party suggests that the res judicata analysis undertaken by the courts below is proper.both parties view res judicata as an proposition either all of kaiser state court claims are barred,or none of them is barred.it is well settled that res judicata turns primarily on the commonality of the facts of the prior and subsequent actions,not on the nature of the remedies sought.see,olmstead amoco oil,cir res judicata extends not only to the precise legal theory presented in the previous litigation,but to all legal theories and claims arising out of the same operative nucleus of fact.we agree,both generally and in the particular circumstances of this case,that the applicability of res judicata does not turn on the nature of a party alternative legal theories.it is undisputed by teledyne that if kaiser is entitled to pursue its damages claim as the courts below found,then kaiser also is entitled to pursue its constructive trust claim.
there is no dispute about the general principles of res judicata to be applied here.under res judicata,also known as claim preclusion,a final judgment on the merits bars the parties to a prior action from a cause of action that was or could have been raised in that action.see,allen mccurry,d.res judicata may be properly applied only if certain prerequisites are met.in the eleventh circuit,a party seeking to invoke the doctrine must establish its propriety by satisfying four initial elements the prior decision must have been rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction there must have been a final judgment on the merits both cases must involve the same parties or their privies and both cases must involve the same causes of action.see israel discount bank entin,cir in re justice oaks ii,cir.the court next determines whether the claim in the new suit was or could have been raised in the prior action if the answer is yes,res judicata applies.see justice oaks,at bankruptcy court order of confirmation is an absolute bar to the subsequent action or suit between the same parties in respect of every matter which was actually offered and received to sustain the demand,but also as to every claim which might have been presented citation omitted if even one of these elements is missing,res judicata is inapplicable.see hart,cir.at all times the burden is on the party asserting res judicata here,teledyne to show that the suit is barred.see,thorsteinsson drangur,cir.
we initially address the four prerequisites to res judicata.there is no dispute that two of the requirements are met.the parties agree that the confirmation order was issued by a court of competent jurisdiction and constitutes a final judgment on the merits.the parties disagree about the other two requirements whether kaiser was a party to the chapter proceeding,and whether the chapter proceeding involved the same cause of action that kaiser has attempted to assert in the state court action.because we conclude that the chapter proceeding did not involve the same cause of action,we do not separately decide whether kaiser was a party to that proceeding.
the parties agree that claims are part of the same cause of action for res judicata purposes when they arise out of the same transaction or series of transactions.see justice oaks,at citing restatement second judgments.in determining whether the causes of action are the same,a court must compare the substance of the actions,not their form.it is now said,in general,that if a case arises out of the same nucleus of operative fact,or is based upon the same factual predicate,as a former action,that the two cases are really the same claim or cause of action for purposes of res judicata.ragsdale rubbermaid,cir internal citation and quotation marks omitted.
kaiser contends that its state court action and the bankruptcy proceeding or,more specifically,the p plan confirmation process do not arise out of a common nucleus of operative fact.it asserts that merely because the bankruptcy proceeding gave rise to the events for which it seeks relief in the state court action does not establish that the cases share the same factual predicate in other words,it is not enough simply to show that but for the chapter proceeding there would be no state court action.the analysis,kaiser contends,must be more precise than that.moreover,says kaiser,the facts underpinning the state court action,teledyne alleged breach of the cooperation agreement and its fiduciary duties to kaiser were not at issue in the confirmation proceeding the bankruptcy court did not consider,and was not required to consider,any factual dispute relating to its stake in the ownership or capital structure of new piper when confirming the p plan.we agree with these contentions.
it is essentially undisputed that the facts at the core of kaiser state court suit were neither raised nor litigated in the chapter proceeding.the bankruptcy court did not purport to rule on whether teledyne breached any contractual or fiduciary duty to kaiser,and neither party introduced any evidence regarding those alleged breaches,or the facts relating to the breakdown of the relationship.the bankruptcy court made no finding or engaged in any express inquiry at the time of confirmation as to facts regarding the relative ownership interests or capital structure of new piper.no evidence was proffered or admitted regarding the creditworthiness or business acumen of new piper shareholders,and no one proposed or considered any limitation that would have prevented others from obtaining some or all of their shares.it is uncontested that the plan,disclosure statements,confirmation hearing transcript,and the confirmation order are completely devoid of any reference to the percentage ownership of stock to be owned by teledyne as opposed to kaiser,and the import,if any,of teledyne role as owner of new piper or the absence of kaiser as an owner.there is simply no indication in the record that the facts put at issue by kaiser state court suit were raised or litigated before the bankruptcy court indeed,both parties for their own strategic reasons purposefully avoided raising those facts during the chapter case.
that the critical facts underlying kaiser suit were never discussed by the bankruptcy court or litigated by the parties is powerful evidence that the chapter case did not involve the same cause of action as the state court suit.teledyne maintains,however,that the facts underlying kaiser state court suit were so implicated by the chapter proceeding that we should consider the two actions as arising out of a common nucleus of fact even though the relevant facts were never actually raised.teledyne position,as we see it,has two dimensions.it contends that but for the filing of the chapter case the facts underlying kaiser claims would never have emerged.it also contends that the ownership and capital structure of new piper was necessarily a subject considered by the bankruptcy court in the process of confirming the p plan.neither of these arguments is persuasive.
to begin with,the but for analysis proposed by teledyne represents too sweeping a standard for res judicata purposes.our case law requires us to compare with much greater precision the specific facts of the two claims being examined.see,ragsdale,at.here,the facts underlying kaiser state court action concern the efforts of teledyne and kaiser to submit a joint plan of reorganization on behalf of piper epitomized by the cooperation agreement and teledyne alleged breach of that relationship by forging a new proposal with.by contrast,the facts initially giving rise to the bankruptcy proceeding relate primarily to the financial collapse of piper and do not involve kaiser at all.we can not say that,simply because the commencement of the chapter proceeding ultimately spawned kaiser suit against teledyne,that suit arises out of a common nucleus of operative fact.
indeed,teledyne but for argument is at odds with this circuit frequent pronouncement that res judicata does not apply where the facts giving rise to the second case only arise after the original pleading is filed in the earlier litigation.manning city of auburn,cir.in manning,we considered a situation in which a plaintiff elected not to participate in an employment discrimination class action but instead brought a second suit alleging employment discrimination against the same defendant.the operative facts that gave rise to the plaintiff claims for discrimination had not occurred when the class filed its claim but some of those facts occurred before the district court dismissed the plaintiff from the class action.the plaintiff could have presented her claims in the class action by filing a supplemental pleading or by participating in discovery in that case.we observed,however,that the doctrine of res judicata does not punish a plaintiff for exercising her option not to supplement the pleadings with an claim.we reasoned that the parties frame the scope of litigation at the time the complaint is filed and that a judgment is only conclusive regarding the matters that the parties might have litigated at that time but not regarding new rights acquired pending the action which might have been,but which were not,required to be litigated.id.internal quotations omitted.
w e do not believe that the res judicata preclusion of claims that could have been brought in earlier litigation includes claims which arise after the original pleading is filed in the earlier litigation.instead,we believe that,for res judicata purposes,claims that could have been brought are claims in existence at the time the original complaint is filed or claims actually asserted in the earlier action.
id.emphasis added footnote omitted citing commercial box lumber uniroyal,cir.
we repeated this rule from manning in pleming,cir.there,the plaintiff did not receive a job for which she had applied.in,she filed an employment discrimination action against her employer for race and sex discrimination.in,during the course of litigation,two additional positions became available plaintiff again was not hired.although the plaintiff incorporated into her briefs additional allegations of discrimination arising out of these later incidents,she did not assert a claim based on them.the district court granted summary judgment for the employer,after which the plaintiff filed a second suit based on the job openings.invoking res judicata,the district court dismissed her second complaint,but this circuit reversed.we found that the summary judgment in the first case did not have a res judicata effect so as to bar the plaintiff later claim based upon the hiring decisions,which had not occurred when the first complaint was filed.in so ruling,we first reiterated that r es judicata acts as a bar not only to the precise legal theory presented in the previous litigation,but to all legal theories and claims arising out of the same operative nucleus of fact.a court,therefore,must examine the factual issues that must be resolved in the second suit and compare them with the issues explored in the first case.id.at citations omitted.we then emphasized that for res judicata purposes,claims that could have been brought are claims in existence at the time the original complaint is filed or claims actually asserted by supplemental pleadings or otherwise in the earlier action.id.emphasis added quoting manning,at.even more recently,in ragsdale,we applied the principle set forth in manning,although we ultimately found that the plaintiff claim in the later suit was barred because the events giving rise to it occurred before the first suit was brought.see at quoting manning,at.
in this circuit,therefore,res judicata does not bar a claim that was not in existence at the time of the original action unless the facts underlying the claim were actually raised in that action.here,the facts underlying kaiser claim were not in existence at the time the chapter case began,and as noted above were never actually raised as the case unfolded.although our decisions state the principle in unequivocal terms,we recognize that different res judicata considerations may come into play when the first case is a bankruptcy proceeding the evolving scope of a bankruptcy proceeding means that in some limited instances the bankruptcy process itself will generate and then squarely resolve the identical facts that underlie the case.that is plainly not what we have here,however,and decisions such as manning underscore just how difficult it is to square teledyne but for argument,and indeed its entire res judicata theory,with our precedent.
we also reject teledyne further argument that the facts underlying kaiser state court suit were sufficiently implicated by the confirmation process to declare that the two arose out of a common nucleus of operative fact.teledyne theory,essentially endorsed by the lower courts,is that facts related to the ownership and capital structure of new piper underlay the bankruptcy court decision to confirm the p plan and facts relating to the ownership and capital structure of new piper also underlie the state court action.the second of these premises is reasonable.the facts underlying kaiser specifically facts relating to the process by which teledyne first agreed to go forward with,and then allegedly excluded,kaiser from a proposed new entity meant to receive piper directly to the proper ownership and capital structure of new piper.but the first the key facts underlying the state court action were necessarily put at issue by the confirmation unpersuasive.
as we have said,the res judicata effect of a confirmed plan is premised on the notion that the bankruptcy court has addressed in the confirmed plan and order only those issues that are properly within the scope of the confirmation hearing.in re seidler,cir emphasis added.the confirmation process in a chapter case is primarily an inquiry into the viability of the proposed plan and the disposition of the debtor assets,not the conduct of unrelated third parties,let alone third parties such as kaiser that are not creditors and have no prior relationship with the debtor.the bankruptcy code,at a,sets forth the criteria that a court must consider in deciding whether to confirm a plan.facts relating to these criteria are the only facts that necessarily are put at issue by the confirmation process 
the facts underlying kaiser action against teledyne do not squarely underlie any of these criteria which likely explains why the bankruptcy court did not explore them the bankruptcy court,in confirming the p plan,was not determining the proper ownership composition of new piper either at the time of confirmation or for the future,but rather was primarily determining whether the plan,as presented,met the literal requirements and policy objectives of the bankruptcy code by maximizing the value of piper estate for the benefit of piper creditors.the facts put at issue by kaiser complaint do not involve those issues.
the only factor of arguably implicating the same core of facts as kaiser state court suit is contained in a,which requires the bankruptcy court to find that the plan has been proposed in good faith and not by any means forbidden by law.teledyne argues that determining whether a plan has been proposed in good faith necessarily requires consideration of all facts relating to the conduct of the plan proponent.our case law,however,does not define the inquiry quite so broadly.see mccormick banc one leasing,cir where the plan is proposed with the legitimate and honest purpose to reorganize and has a reasonable hope of success,the good faith requirements of section a are satisfied.the focus of the court inquiry is the plan itself,and courts must look to the totality of the circumstances surrounding the plan.citations omitted emphasis added this inquiry by definition has little to do with a prior business dispute between two potential bidders.a court certainly could have found that the p plan was proposed with the legitimate and honest purpose to reorganize piper without delving into facts surrounding teledyne alleged breach of the cooperation agreement or its fiduciary duties to kaiser 
teledyne also insists that the facts underpinning the state court action are necessarily bound up with determining whether the plan had a reasonable hope of success.see a.teledyne relies heavily on the bankruptcy court post hoc finding that facts underlying the state court action would have impacted its assessment of the likely success of the plan.the bankruptcy court observed that t he capital structure,ownership and viability of new piper was a material part of the plan considered by the parties and the court,and that teledyne rights to and ownership percentage in new piper are the very matters that were determinated and at stake in the confirmation hearing.the court also found that new piper ability to fund the trust that would be used to pay off creditors is a function of new piper success and profitability and it is no great stretch to,in turn,say that a function of the skills and business acumen of management and owners.but there is no indication that the bankruptcy court was required to make let alone actually made any inquiry into the skills and business acumen of new piper owners such that it would necessarily have considered collateral facts relating to teledyne inclusion of rather than kaiser in its plan.new piper was to continue with existing piper management under either the plan or the p plan.
moreover,the bankruptcy court was not required to,tellingly,did not limitation on teledyne ability to sell some or all of its shares and thereby relinquish ownership of new piper.teledyne argues that we should not attach much importance to the absence of a restriction in the plan on its ability to alienate its shares.but teledyne can not deny that the absence of such a limitation undercuts its argument that its stake in new piper was so important an issue that the facts surrounding its dispute with kaiser would necessarily have been implicated by the confirmation process.
ultimately the most one can say is that the dispute,and the attendant possibility that teledyne loss of that dispute might impact new piper either by transferring equitable ownership of some new piper shares to kaiser or by forcing teledyne to pay significant damages,could be viewed as material to confirmation of the plan.but the test for common nucleus of operative fact as defined for purposes of res judicata is not simply one of whether the two claims are related to or may materially impact one another.the underlying core of facts must be the same in both proceedings.quite simply 
the issue is not what effect the present claim might have had on the earlier one,but whether the same facts are involved in both cases,so that the present claim could have been effectively litigated with the prior one.
in re baudoin,cir.
looking at the facts that the bankruptcy court was by law required to consider,and the facts that it actually did consider,at the confirmation hearing,we simply can not say that the facts underpinning kaiser dispute with teledyne were sufficiently put at issue by the confirmation process to support res judicata.the facts raised by kaiser suit regarding teledyne private business dealings with kaiser and their relative allocation of ownership interests in the entity have only an attenuated relationship to the facts necessarily considered by the bankruptcy court as part of its analysis.we can not infer,on this record,that the bankruptcy court considered the kinds of facts raised by kaiser state court suit,and therefore can not hold that the confirmation process involved the same cause of action.
we are bolstered in this conclusion by teledyne own conduct during the confirmation process.if indeed kaiser suit must be viewed as nothing more than a collateral attack on confirmation of the p plan,or threatens so substantially the purposes for which that plan was proposed and adopted,why did teledyne never advise the bankruptcy court of the existence of the suit until long after the confirmation process was complete kaiser suit,as noted above,was filed before the p plan was even submitted to the bankruptcy court.yet teledyne chose not to inform the bankruptcy court about that suit,and chose not to delve into the facts put at issue by kaiser breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty claims.indeed,if the suit was truly meant to accomplish what teledyne now says it was meant to accomplish to undo and undermine the entire reorganization plan,then surely teledyne would have been under an obligation to disclose the existence of the suit to the court and creditors prior to confirmation either at the hearing or by amending its disclosure statement.it is not unfair to infer from teledyne conduct that kaiser suit,and the facts underlying it,were not quite so integral to the confirmation process as teledyne now suggests.
in short,we can not say that the state court action arises out of a common nucleus of operative fact with the chapter case.our task is to compare the factual issues explored in the first action with the factual issues to be resolved in the second.entin,at see also southeast.cable martin county,cir res judicata inapplicable where the factual premise of the present suit differs quite significantly from the prior one manning,at res judicata inapplicable where the second suit d oes not involve the same factual situation internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.here,the connection between the core facts of the state court to the contractual and fiduciary terms governing the relationship and the breakdown of that the core facts of the confirmation to the discharge of piper debts,the disposition of its assets,and the distribution of proceeds to its simply too attenuated to justify res judicata.this is especially true because the key facts underlying kaiser suit did not even exist at the time of the chapter filing and were never actually raised by the parties or discussed by the bankruptcy court during the chapter case.teledyne simply can not meet the same cause of action prerequisite to applying res judicata 
even if we were to decide that all of the prerequisites to res judicata were met,teledyne still would not be entitled to relief because the claims in kaiser state court action were not brought,and more importantly could not have been brought,in the bankruptcy proceeding.the courts below found that kaiser constructive trust claim could have been litigated in the bankruptcy action,but that its damages claim could not have been litigated there due to lack of jurisdiction.kaiser makes multiple arguments as to why neither its damages claim nor its constructive trust claim could have been litigated in the bankruptcy case.in particular,kaiser contends that it had no adequate procedural mechanism by which to assert its state court claims in the bankruptcy case teledyne fails to show that such a procedural vehicle exists.
teledyne argues that kaiser could have brought its claims in the form of an objection to confirmation of the p plan,or a motion to strike that plan kaiser counters that the nature of its breach of its contractual and fiduciary duties to not have formed a basis for invalidating the plan under the statutory criteria of a.we find that argument persuasive,as discussed above,but there is an even greater problem.merely objecting to the p plan would not have been the equivalent of pursuing the claims kaiser asserts in state court.if kaiser had succeeded in objecting to the plan even assuming that it had standing to object and could have done so merely on the strength of its breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty allegations,it would not thereby have received any equitable ownership rights in new piper or any money from teledyne rather,the plan would have been defeated,a form of relief kaiser does not seek in the state court suit.while defeat of the plan might have rendered unnecessary any claim of entitlement to shares in new piper,it would not necessarily have resolved kaiser claims for potential consequential and punitive on teledyne alleged breaches.more to the point,it plainly would not have guaranteed kaiser ownership of a piece of the reorganized entity eventually emerging from the bankruptcy case something its constructive trust claim would accomplish if successful today.we are unconvinced that kaiser possible right to object to the plan provided an adequate vehicle to assert fully the claims it raises in the state court action.
teledyne also suggests that kaiser could have brought an adversary complaint in the bankruptcy court to enjoin the p plan.for similar reasons,however,this relief would not have provided a complete substitute for the relief sought in the state court action.also hanson,cir confirmation of a plan is res judicata only as to issues that can be raised in the less formal procedure for contested matters confirmation generally can not have a preclusive effect as to matters which must be raised in an adversary proceeding.in re beard,if an issue must be raised through an adversary proceeding it is not part of the confirmation process and,unless it is actually litigated,confirmation will not have a preclusive effect.even assuming that kaiser had standing to oppose the p plan,challenging the plan through an adversary proceeding would not have made kaiser whole in the way the state court lawsuit would if kaiser eventually prevailed in that suit.
to reiterate,what kaiser seeks in the state court suit is not the defeat of the s plan,but rather ownership rights in the entity,or damages equal to the profits and benefits that it would receive if it had such ownership rights.we are unaware of any lawful basis upon which kaiser could have brought,let alone win,an adversary proceeding before the bankruptcy court not only to block the s plan,but also to have the court adopt an alternative plan giving it an ownership interest in a entity over the undoubted opposition of the debtor,teledyne,and all other proponents of the s plan.we can not even see how kaiser could have brought an adversary proceeding to force adoption of an alternative plan among other obstacles,kaiser did not have statutory standing to submit a reorganization plan of its own,and even if it did it could not have submitted a plan because it was not among the parties granted exclusivity.
simply put,we are unpersuaded that kaiser had an adequate vehicle to pursue in the chapter case the equivalent of the claims it asserts in state court none of the available bankruptcy court procedures would have assured kaiser the full relief sought in its state court suit.teledyne efforts to show otherwise are not only incomplete,but they also require too many highly questionable assumptions at odds with the plain language of the code and kaiser,status in the chapter case.
because kaiser did not have an adequate procedural vehicle to bring its state court claims,or their equivalent,in the chapter case,and kaiser state court does not arise out of the same nucleus of operative fact as the chapter case,teledyne can not meet its burden of showing that the technical requirements of res judicata are met.on this record,and under our precedent,kaiser is entitled to its day in court,and the considerations of policy argued at length by teledyne do not permit us to relax the requirements of res judicata in these circumstances.nor do the equities tip as powerfully in teledyne favor as teledyne maintains.even the bankruptcy court was troubled by teledyne delay in asserting that kaiser damages claim was an indirect attack on the confirmed plan.that court also admonished teledyne for not raising res judicata as a defense in the state court action promptly once the final order of confirmation was rendered.teledyne could have brought kaiser suit to the attention of the bankruptcy court prior to confirmation,but chose not to do so.we note these facts not to identify wrongdoing by teledyne,but merely to underscore why teledyne frequent emphasis on its perceptions of fairness and equity do not alter the res judicata analysis mandated by our precedent.
accordingly,we affirm the district court insofar as it permitted k
