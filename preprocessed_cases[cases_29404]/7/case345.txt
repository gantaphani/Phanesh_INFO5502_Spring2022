david rombro appeals from a judgment entered in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york seybert,affirming the order of the bankruptcy court bernstein,bankr.granting summary judgment to michael dufrayne,trustee of the med diversified.creditors trust,and subordinating rombro claim against med diversified under b,which mandates subordination of a claim for damages arising from the purchase or sale of a security of the debtor.in this appeal we consider the scope of section b,specifically whether the statute requires subordination of the claim of a former executive employee of the debtor,when the claim is based on the debtor failure to issue its common stock to the executive in exchange for his stock in another company,as provided by a termination agreement.because we agree with the lower courts conclusion that such a claim arises from the purchase of the debtor stock within the meaning and purpose of section b,we affirm the judgment.
background 
the relevant facts of this case are undisputed.in and,med diversified,then apparently known as.com and david rombro entered into executive employment agreements.med diversified first agreed to hire rombro as president and coo of its pharmacy division,and subsequently agreed to hire rombro as president and ceo of its health services and managed care division.later in,however,due to certain disputes,the parties entered into a termination agreement.therein,med diversified agreed to issue by january,shares of its common stock to rombro in exchange for rombro shares of primerx stock.the termination agreement also provided that,except for the stock exchange and other minor payments,med diversified owed rombro no other salary or benefits,and each party released any claims,other than breach of the agreement itself,arising out of rombro employment or termination.the stock exchange failed to occur by january,however,and rombro brought suit for breach of contract and fraudulent inducement.
thereafter,on november,med diversified filed for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code,causing the automatic stay of rombro lawsuit.on july,rombro filed a timely proof of claim against med diversified debtor for claim,premised on med diversified alleged breach of the termination agreement by failing to issue to rombro its common stock in exchange for his primerx stock.
on november,michael dufrayne,trustee of the med diversified.creditors trust,filed a complaint against rombro.dufrayne subsequently moved for summary judgment,seeking a determination that claim is subject to mandatory subordination pursuant to section b of the bankruptcy code.the statute provides in pertinent part 
b for the purpose of distribution under this title,a claim arising from rescission of a purchase or sale of a security of the debtor or of an affiliate of the debtor,for damages arising from the purchase or sale of such a security,or for reimbursement or contribution allowed under section on account of such a claim,shall be subordinated to all claims or interests that are senior to or equal the claim or interest represented by such security,except that if such security is common stock,such claim has the same priority as common stock.
b emphasis added.rombro filed a for summary judgment,seeking a determination that claim was not subject to subordination but rather was a general unsecured claim for compensation which should share pari passu with the class of general unsecured creditors.rombro argued for a literal reading of arising from under section b,requiring that the trustee show rombro damages flow from the actual purchase or sale of the debtor security in order for claim to be subordinated.in rombro view,his claim did not arise from damages flowing from the purchase or sale of debtor stock but from the purchase by the debtor of rombro primerx stock,which in any event never occurred.
in a,unpublished decision dated february,the bankruptcy court bernstein,bankr.granted summary judgment to the trustee and subordinated claim.judge bernstein determined,in accordance with case law broadly construing section b,that the claim need not flow directly from the securities transaction,but can be viewed as arising from the transaction if the transaction is part of the causal link leading to the injury,quoting in re communications.the court concluded that because rombro claim was based on the debtor alleged failure to issue rombro shares of its stock as required by the termination agreement,there was a causal link between the securities transaction and the injury.consequently,pursuant to section b,the bankruptcy court subordinated rombro claim and deemed it to have the same priority as the debtor common stock for purposes of distribution under the bankruptcy plan.
rombro appealed the bankruptcy court order to the district court seybert,which affirmed the order in an unpublished decision dated october.judge seybert likewise determined that section b is to be construed broadly because it is a remedial statute intended to prevent shareholders from changing their claims into creditors claims.importantly,the district court concluded 
section b covers rombro claim despite the fact that rombro never actually received any shares in debtor.rombro bargained for a position as shareholder and all its attendant benefits and risks,including debtor inability to fulfill its contractual obligations with creditors and its shareholders.rombro can not expect to both reap a shareholder benefits when the debtor was profitable and then avoid a shareholder risks by gaining creditor status when debtor went bankrupt.
emphases in the original.rombro again appealed the adverse judgment.
ii.discussion 
review of an order of a district court issued in its capacity as an appellate court is plenary.in re detrano,cir citation omitted.in a bankruptcy appeal,we review the bankruptcy court decision independently,accepting its factual findings unless clearly erroneous but reviewing its conclusions of law de novo.ball smith,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
the question before us is whether a claim for damages based on the debtor failure to issue shares of its common stock in exchange for the claimant stock in another company,pursuant to a termination agreement,is a claim for damages arising from the purchase or sale of a security of the debtor within the meaning of section b.facing similar questions,the third circuit subordinated claims when the debtor breached a contractual obligation to use best efforts to register the claimants stock,in re telegroup,cir,and the ninth circuit subordinated claims when the debtor failed to convey its stock as required by a merger agreement,in re betacom of phoenix,cir.the holdings of most prominent decisions of local bankruptcy courts also support the broad interpretation of section b.see,in re enron,subordinating claims arising from ownership of employee stock options concluding the broad applica tion of section b is now quite settled in re commc,at subordinating a claim based on failure of the debtor to issue securities.moreover,on very similar facts,the bankruptcy court for the district of delaware held that section b required the subordination of a former employee claim for damages arising from breach of a severance agreement to issue stock to the employee.in re worldwide direct.in this circuit,however,the scope of section b is a matter of first impression.rombro concedes relevant case law trends against him,but asks the court to consider whether this is a situation that extends the reach of section b beyond its legislative history and purpose.
rombro primarily raises three arguments against the mandatory subordination of his claim the phrase arising from in section b is unambiguous and plainly applies only to claims stemming directly from a purchase,sale,or rescission of the debtor security,none of which occurred here the exchange of rombro shares of primerx stock for debtor stock was not a purchase but rather a severance payment debt owed therefore the district court erred in concluding rombro was a purchaser,transferee,or holder of debtor common stock within the meaning of the statute and the policy ratio
