factual background 
against this backdrop for the issue presented by this case,we turn to a more detailed discussion of the underlying facts.larry miller was the president of miller holding investments,which in turn was the general partner of both el paseo partners,and el rancho partners,lp,both limited partnerships organized under california law.first community bank fcb is a california corporation,doing business in the state of california,with its principal place of business in sonoma county,california.
in december,fcb extended credit to paseo and rancho in exchange for a business loan agreement,a promissory note in the original principal amount of,and a commercial guaranty from miller that personally secured repayment of all obligations owed to fcb under the note and the loan agreement.all three of these contracts selected california local law as the governing law.the business loan agreement and the promissory note both stated on their face that they were accepted by fcb in california.indeed,the guaranty given by miller not only selected california as the governing law,it also provided that a ny married person who signs this guaranty hereby expressly agrees that recourse under this guaranty may be had against both his or her separate property and community property.unfortunately,paseo and rancho could not live up to their obligations on the loans,and miller defaulted on the guaranty.
procedural history 
on october,fcb sued larry and kari miller in the united states district court for the district of arizona.fcb moved for summary judgment as to liability and damages on larry miller breach of the commercial guaranty,and also requested a r uling that kari miller has received notice and due process in connection with this legal action,to the extent that any of the property subject or potentially subject to enforcement and execution upon the judgment,whether located in the state of arizona,the state of california or elsewhere,is asserted to belong in whole or in part to her marital community.complaint at,first community bank larry miller and kari miller,ecf.while the answer filed to the complaint alleged that neither the miller s marital community property,nor kari miller sole and separate property,is subject to the claims in first community bank complaint,answer at,ecf,the millers only legal opposition to fcb motion for summary judgment was that california law requires fcb first to execute on collateral securing the loan,before making their motion.order granting motion for summary judgment as to liability at,ecf.

as of the time that fcb registered its judgment in california,larry and kari miller held an ownership interest,to which reference was made earlier,in real property located at jackson street,san francisco,california,which consisted of their ownership share in seventy jackson street corporation and a leasehold in an apartment owned by the on june,consistent with the manner in which a judgment lien is obtained,fcb recorded the california judgment in the official records of the san francisco county recorder office.
several years later,larry miller filed a petition for reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy code in the district of arizona.miller proceeding was later converted to a chapter liquidation.in the course of administering the miller estate,the chapter trustee,maureen gaughan,sold the millers.fcb filed an adversary proceeding seeking a declaration that it held an enforceable judgment lien on the,thereby granting it priority over the proceeds of the sale.
the bankruptcy court held that,b ecause the miller judgment was registered in california,california law governs the enforceability of the miller judgment against debtors community property located in california,and under california law,debtors community property located in california is liable for satisfaction of the miller judgment.judgment in favor of first community bank at,first community bank miller,bankr,ecf.the millers appealed to the district court.
the district court decision 
the district court framed the issue presented as whether an arizona judgment against a husband on his sole and separate debt may be executed against the arizona couple community property in california.in re miller.answering this question in the negative,the district court held that the arizona federal judgment against the husband alone,later registered in a california federal court and recorded in california,does not lien their community real property in california.id.moreover,it continued that t his is the rule by arizona statute,and california choice of law principles yield to the arizona rule concerning arizona domiciliaries.id.presumably drawing upon those principles,the district court concluded that california has no interest in ousting arizona marital law concerning obligations between husband and wife and of persons contracting with one spouse,and the california community property statute by its terms does not purport to do so.id.
we reverse the judgment of the district court.while we agree that the apartment does not come within the definition of community property,as that term is defined in section of the california family code,it does come within the definition of a.see cal.civ.code.the interests of a in such tenancies,which are presumed to be held in equal shares,see caito united california bank,cal,are subject to the enforcement of a judgment lien.the issue,then,is whether california should yield to arizona community property law,and treat the millers as community property not subject to the enforcement of a judgment.applying california rules,we hold that california law governs,and that the would be treated as a,as defined in section of the california civil code,making larry miller interest in the subject to enforcement of the judgment lien 
discussion 
does not obviate the need for a analysis 
fcb principal argument on appeal is that the registration of the judgment against larry miller,pursuant to,in the northern district of california,was sufficient,by itself,to create an enforceable lien against the.while fcb is correct that requires the use of california lien creation rules,it does not do away with the task of conducting a analysis in the event that another state has an interest in application of its law.
a party may register and enforce a federal judgment in another district,and a judgment so registered shall have the same effect as a judgment of the district court of the district where registered and may be enforced in like manner.this system of enforcing federal judgments parallels the california and arizona systems for enforcing sister state judgments.in re miller,at.moreover,e nforcement measures do not travel with the sister state judgment as preclusive effects do such measures remain subject to the control of forum law.baker motors.
thus,under california enforcement procedures,when fcb registered the judgment rendered by the federal district court in arizona in the northern district of california,and formally recorded such judgment with the san francisco county recorder office,it acquired a judgment lien on the millers.see cal.civ.proc.code a.nevertheless,perfection of a lien alone does not ensure that such a lien can be enforced against a particular piece of property the property must be subject to enforcement of the money judgment.see lezine sec.pac,cal.under california law,e xcept as otherwise provided by law,all property of the judgment debtor is subject to enforcement of a money judgment.cal.civ.proc.code a emphasis supplied.
while we are not aware of any california case that construes the term except as otherwise provided by law in a comparable context,the most reasonable construction suggests that it refers not just to the local law of california,but also to the laws of other states that may apply as a result of the application of california rules.our construction of the term is informed by a comparison with a similar term,which appears in the same article of the california code of civil procedure enforcement of money judgments as does.california code of civil procedure a,which provides the rule on the creation of judgment liens,contains an exception for circumstances as otherwise provided by statute,rather than as otherwise provided by law.cal.civ.proc.code a emphasis supplied.this difference suggests to us that while the california legislature intended to limit the exception in a to certain express statutory,it intended to make the exception contained in a encompass california whole law,including its rules.restatement second of conflict of laws restatement as used in the restatement of this subject,the law of a state is that state local law,together with its rule of conflict of laws.
our discussion would end here if this case were being litigated in california.some additional discussion,however,is required.while california rules apply here,they do so as a result of a somewhat indirect path,which we now trace.in federal question cases with exclusive jurisdiction in federal court,such as bankruptcy,including this case,we apply federal rules.see in re lindsay,cir.federal rules are based on the restatement second of conflict of laws.see in re vortex fishing,cir.restatement provides that,w hether a lien creates an interest in land and the nature of the interest created are determined by the law that would be applied by the courts of the situs.moreover,if the court of the situs would have decided the particular question by reference to the local law of some other state,the forum will do likewise.restatement,cmt.b.as noted previously,california is the situs of the real property at issue,so we apply its rules to resolve the conflict in this case.
ii.analysis 
california applies the governmental interests mode of analysis to resolve problems.see mccann foster wheeler llc,cal.under this approach,we analyze three related questions does relevant law vary between the potentially affected jurisdictions if there is a difference in law,does a true conflict exist such that each of the states involved has a legitimate but conflicting interest in applying its own law if there is a true conflict,which state interest would be more impaired if its policy were subordinated to the policy of the other state see kearney salomon smith barney,cal,citations omitted.
we begin our analysis with arizona law,and more specifically its community property law,and then proceed to discuss california law.
community property rests on a notion that husband and wife are a marital partnership a community and should share accordingly.because it can exist only between husband and wife and can not be converted into separate property without the consent of both spouses,community property can be conveyed to a third person only as an undivided whole.prior to the,the husband was deemed to be manager of the community,but beginning in the late,all community property states enacted statutes giving the husband and wife equal management powers.these statutes,however,differ in many details.
jesse dukeminier,property ed.
although arizona and california both have community property laws,there is one difference between the two that gives rise to the necessity of a analysis.in arizona,a ny transaction of guaranty,indemnity or suretyship requires the joinder of both spouses a requirement that has been construed to mean the signature of both spouses on the guaranty contract.stat.c.thus,the statute bars collection of the guaranteed debt from the community property,unless both spouses sign the guaranty.see rackmaster,maderia.app.
california has no such requirement with respect to either community property,joint property,or a.cal.fam.code a cal.civ.proc.code.thus,all such property is subject to the enforcement of a money judgment,even where a guaranty underlying the judgment is signed by only one of two spouses.the difference between arizona and california law,however,does not compel the conclusion that there is a true conflict,as that term is understood in the context.the existence of such a conflict turns on whether the circumstances of the case implicate the policies underlying the ostensibly conflicting laws.
hamada valley national bank.app,contains a helpful discussion of the history and purpose of arizona requirement.in hamada,the arizona court of appeals explained that t he husband,as a member of the community,has no power under the law without the knowledge and consent of his wife,to use community assets to guarantee the payment of a debt of a stranger to the community,it deriving no benefit therefrom.id.at emphasis supplied.it continued,t his law has now been codified in c which requires both spouses to join in any transaction of guaranty,indemnity or suretyship.id.thus,hamada makes clear that the policy underlying arizona requirement is to ensure that a spouse who lacks knowledge of,and does not acquiesce to,a guaranty is not bound.see also koepnick.app.the purpose of such statutes is to protect one spouse against obligations undertaken by the other spouse without the first spouse knowledge and consent.
the absence of the signature of one spouse,however,does not necessarily indicate that the spouse did
