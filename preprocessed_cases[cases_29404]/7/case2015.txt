havoco of america,havoco appeals the denial of its objection to elmer hill hill claims in his chapter bankruptcy petition that the real property located at and calhoun avenue,destin florida,the destin property was exempt under article x,section of the florida constitution the homestead exemption and that the household furnishings in the destin property were exempt because he owns them in with his wife the exemption.havoco claims that hill converted assets into these exempt assets with the intent to hinder,delay,or defraud his creditors.the bankruptcy court found that under florida law hill was not prohibited from converting assets into a homestead,even if done with the intent to place those assets beyond the reach of his creditors.exh.vol.at the bankruptcy court further found that,although hill creation of a tenancy by the entireties with the intent to defraud creditors may be attacked under florida law,s uch attack must be made in the context of an adversary proceeding.id.accordingly,the bankruptcy court denied both of havoco objections,and the district court affirmed.although we agree with the district court that havoco may only challenge the exemption in an adversary proceeding,we believe that the applicability of the homestead exemption to this case raises an important issue of state law that would best be decided by the supreme court of florida.therefore,we affirm in part and certify a question of state law to the supreme court of florida.
background 
in,havoco filed suit against hill claiming damages for fraud,conspiracy,tortious interference with contractual relations,and breach of fiduciary duty.havoco alleged that hill conspired to eliminate havoco as a principal under its ten year contract to supply coal to the tennessee valley authority.after several appeals to the seventh circuit,havoco case finally came to trial nine years later.the jury found for havoco on all its claims against hill and awarded havoco in damages.the district court entered judgment in accordance with the jury verdict on december,and the judgment became enforceable on january,
hill purchased the destin property on december.although he was a resident of tennessee,hill claims that he intended to make the destin property his retirement home.he paid approximately in cash for the destin property.additionally,approximately of household furnishings were purchased for the destin property utilizing funds drawn from a florida bank account hill held jointly with his wife and from hill individual accounts in florida and tennessee.
on july,hill filed for chapter bankruptcy in the northern district of florida.in his petition,he claimed that the destin property was exempt under the florida constitution as his homestead.he also claimed that the furnishings were exempt as property held in with his wife.havoco objected to both exemptions.havoco claimed that hill engaged in improper planning in order to convert assets into exempt assets for the purpose of placing the assets beyond the reach of creditors,such as havoco.
the bankruptcy court held an evidentiary hearing on havoco objections.during the evidentiary hearing,havoco attempted to present evidence of the transfer of other assets by hill in order to demonstrate that the purchase of the destin property and home furnishings were part of a larger scheme to defraud hill creditors via bankruptcy.the bankruptcy court found that this evidence was irrelevant and did not allow havoco to present fully its evidence regarding hill alleged bankruptcy scheme.after the hearing,the bankruptcy court issued its findings of fact and conclusions of law overruling havoco objections.see exh.vol,in re hill.relying on similar cases,the bankruptcy court concluded that,although a debtor loses his entitlement to claim as exempt any asset converted with the specific intent to defraud creditors,exh.vol.at havoco had not proven by a preponderance of the evidence that hill had acted with the specific intent to defraud his creditors when he purchased the destin property and home furnishings.additionally,the bankruptcy court found that the home furnishings were held by hill and his wife as and,thus,were exempt from claims by hill individual creditors.
havoco appealed the bankruptcy court factual findings and legal conclusions.on february,the district court issued an order reversing the bankruptcy court conclusion that there was an exception to the homestead exemption when a debtor acted with the specific intent to defraud his creditors and its finding that havoco had failed to prove hill acted with the intent to defraud his creditors when he purchased the destin property and household furnishings.the district court found that florida state law governed questions regarding the homestead exemption and,therefore,that the bankruptcy court had erroneously relied upon the interpretations of federal bankruptcy courts sitting in florida the district court instructed the bankruptcy court on remand to determine whether and under what circumstances florida law prevented debtors in and from converting property to exempt property.exh.vol.at.the district court further instructed the bankruptcy court that,if it should determine that hill claim to the homestead and entireties exemption was limited under florida law,the bankruptcy court should conduct a new evidentiary hearing to determine whether hill purchased the destin property and home furnishings with the intent to defraud his creditors.the district court additionally found that,if a new evidentiary hearing was necessary,the bankruptcy court should consider havoco evidence of hill other transfers of assets as a relevant part of havoco claim that hill had purchased the destin property and furnishings with the intent to defraud his creditors.finally,the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court finding that the household furnishings for the destin property were owned by hill and his wife as.
on remand,the bankruptcy court,relying upon bank leumi trust of new york lang.and butterworth caggiano,so d,concluded that simply purchasing a home with clean funds,even done with the intent to hinder creditors,can not overcome the florida homestead exemption.exh.vol.at.further,the bankruptcy court concluded that florida fraudulent conveyance statute did not affect the debtor right to the homestead exemption.id.at.however,the bankruptcy court did find that florida fraudulent conveyance law has been properly applied to situations involving tenancies by the entireties.id.at citing valdivia valdivia,so d.thus,havoco did have a valid basis to challenge hill conversion of assets into assets exempt as jointly held property.however,the bankruptcy court further concluded that it would be improper to collapse the issue of the alleged fraudulent conveyance of assets into an objection to the exemption of assets,id.at,and that havoco should attack the creation of a in an adversary proceeding to avoid the transfer.id.at.
the district court,in an order dated february,affirmed the bankruptcy court decision.the court emphasized that havoco may not utilize an objection to challenge the conversion of assets into assets exempt as property,but must seek to avoid the transfer as a fraudulent conveyance in an adversary proceeding.at.havoco appeals this order.
ii.discussion 
we review the bankruptcy court factual findings,as accepted by the district court for clear error,and the district court determinations of law de novo.in re englander,cir.the primary focus of havoco appeal is the legal conclusions reached by the district court.on appeal,havoco argues that its objection to hill claim of a exception should be dealt with in the same manner as any other objection to exemption and that hill can adequately represent the interests of his wife in the objection proceeding or his wife could intervene in the objection proceedings.with regard to the homestead exemption,havoco argues that the principles and spirit of the florida constitution require that the homestead exemption not be used as an instrument of fraud.
a.the exemption 
havoco does not contest the bankruptcy court finding that the household furnishings in question are owned by hill and his wife as tenants by the entireties.a tenant by the entireties holds an indivisible right to own and occupy the entire property.united states,miami,cir holding that property used by its owner to facilitate a controlled substance transaction is exempt from forfeiture when held by the entireties with an innocent spouse.under florida law,n either spouse can sell,forfeit or encumber any part of the estate without the consent of the other,nor can one spouse alone lease it or contract for its disposition.id.at quoting parrish swearington,so d,per curiam.further c reditors can not levy on entireties property to satisfy the debt of an individual spouse.id.at.see also first nat.bank of leesburg hector supply,so d,refusing to allow a bank account held in to be garnished as a result of the individual debts of one tenant.
in accordance with these principles,property held by a debtor as a is exempt from the claims of individual creditors in bankruptcy under florida common law.see b b.see also in re hendricks.sumy schlossberg,cir interpreting maryland law.however,when property is created via a fraudulent conveyance,it may be avoided as such.see thomas konrad,mccoy,so d valdivia valdivia,so d.see also in re hendricks,at.
avoiding the transfer which created a will necessarily eliminate the property rights of one of the tenants.therefore,a court may not avoid such a transfer,and thereby make the property available to the creditors of one tenant,without affording both tenants their rights to due process.accordingly,a plaintiff seeking to avoid the creation of property on the basis that the estate resulted from a fraudulent transfer must join both tenants in the proceedings.ellis sarasota bank trust nevins,so d,requiring joinder of the debtor wife in proceedings before an entireties account can be made available to answer for the judgment debts of one of the tenants individually.havoco suggests that a exemption in bankruptcy can be adjudicated in the same manner as any other objection to an exemption and that joinder of hill wife is unnecessary because hill,by himself,can raise all the defenses in the objection proceeding which he or his wife could raise in an adversary proceeding.havoco further argues that hill wife could intervene in the objection proceeding or file her own declaratory proceeding in the bankruptcy court.however,havoco does not provide,nor are we able to find,any legal support for its suggestions.havoco further asserts that requiring it to challenge hill exception in an adversary proceeding merely exalts form over substance.havoco is correct that in its observation that the distinction between setting aside a transfer as fraudulent and declaring an otherwise exempt asset to be achieves,from their perspective,the same outcome.levine weissing,cir however,it is a very real distinction that is provided for by florida law.id.moreover,we do not believe that hill wife due process rights are adequately preserved in a proceeding to which she is not a party and in which her property rights may effectively be terminated see meyer faust,so d,see also logan zimmerman brush,d holding that the state may not finally destroy a property interest without first giving the putative owner an opportunity to present his claim.
additionally,bankruptcy rule requires a bankruptcy trustee to initiate adversary proceedings to avoid transfers by the debtor under section of the bankruptcy code.see.florida fraudulent conveyance statute is sufficiently similar to to expect federal bankruptcy courts to apply comparable procedures when considering whether to avoid a purportedly fraudulent transfer under florida law in re golden plan of california,cir emphasizing that the trustee initiation of adversary proceedings was a prerequisite to a legitimate exercise of its avoidance powers.therefore,we agree with the district court that havoco must seek to avoid the transfer by which hill transformed his individual property into home furnishings owned with his wife as through an adversary proceeding to which hill wife may be made a party.
b.the homestead exemption 
the exemption of a debtor homestead from process in florida is constitutionally protected.see.const.art.x,relying upon the interpretation of florida law provided in bank leumi,the bankruptcy court concluded that the homestead exemption would apply even if hill had purchased the destin property with the intent to hinder,delay,or defraud creditors.see exh.vol.at.this finding allowed the bankruptcy court to deny havoco objection without holding another evidentiary hearing to consider havoco evidence that hill had purchased the destin property as part of a larger scheme to defraud his creditors via bankruptcy.
we have previously considered the bank leumi case and,nonetheless,concluded that this is a significant question of florida law with respect to which the florida precedent is not clear.in re jost,cir stating that i f the bank leumi issue were necessarily presented in this case,we would certify the question to the florida supreme court the case at bar requires resolution of the question whether the florida homestead exemption applies when a debtor engages in planning and uses assets to purchase a homestead with the intent to hinder,delay,or defraud his creditors.because the homestead exemption is an important part of florida law,we will set out this question in some detail and certify it to the florida supreme court.
federal courts attempting to interpret florida law regarding this issue have reached contrary conclusions.compare in re mesa,imposing an equitable lien on homestead in re kravitz,denying the homestead exemption when debtor acted with actual fraudulent intent in re bandkau,denying the homestead exemption to the extent that it was purchased with money in re thomas,granting an objection to a claimed homestead exemption under.stat.in re coplan,at limiting the homestead exemption when the homestead was acquired in fraud of creditors in re grocki,imposing an equitable lien on homestead in re gherman,sustaining objection to homestead exemption where debtor used fraudulently converted funds to purchase a homestead with bank leumi.at refusing to create a exception to the homestead exemption based upon the fraudulent intent of the debtor in re hendricks,at allowing the homestead exemption in re young,holding that the homestead exemption could not be disallowed because nonexempt assets were used to acquire homestead even if debtor fraudulently converted nonexempt assets with the intent to defeat creditor claims in re lazin,finding that conversion of assets into homestead with the intent to hinder,delay,or defraud creditors is not an exception to the homestead exemption in re lee,finding debtor intent to defraud creditors did not constitute a basis for disallowing florida homestead exemption in re statner,allowing the homestead exemption in re clements,holding that a debtor is entitled to keep the homestead as exempt even if it was acquired in fraud of creditors in re miller,upholding a homestead exemption even though its purchase was a fraudulent transfer as to the creditors in re popek,allowing the homestead exemption in re lane,allowing the homestead exemption.
those courts which have found that the debtor is entitled to the homestead exemption even if the homestead was acquired using assets with the intent hinder,delay,or defraud creditors have relied primarily upon butterworth caggiano,so d at.see,bank leumi.at.in caggiano,the florida supreme court reasoned that a homestead was exempt from civil or criminal forfeiture under florida rico statute because forfeitures were not included in the three enumerated exceptions to the homestead exemption id.the court noted that it utilized a liberal,nontechnical interpretation of the homestead exemption and a strict construction of the exceptions.id.at.further,the court cited with approval the supreme court of kansas holding that the exceptions to the homestead provision of the kansas constitution were unqualified and particularly its finding that the exceptions create no personal qualifications touching the moral character of the resident nor do they undertake to exclude the vici
