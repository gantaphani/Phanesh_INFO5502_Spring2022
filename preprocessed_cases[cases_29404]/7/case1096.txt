background 
statutory background 
congress passed the mppaa as an amendment to the employee retirement income security act erisa.under erisa,the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc,a government corporation,protects covered employees by insuring their benefits against fund insolvency or premature termination.prior to,erisa contingent liability provisions gave employers an incentive to withdraw from financially weak plans to avoid liability if the plan terminated in the future.as a result,the pbgc reported to congress that the premiums paid to it were insufficient to cover its expected future liabilities.congress then passed the mppaa,seeking to discourage voluntary withdrawals from plans by imposing a mandatory liability on all withdrawing employers.see cent.states,se.and sw.areas pension fund ditello,cir.the act holds such employers liable for their proportionate share of unfunded vested benefits.
upon an employer withdrawal from a plan,the trustees of the fund must promptly determine the amount of an employer liability and create a payment schedule.within days of notification,the employer may request that the trustees review their determination.b a.if either party is dissatisfied with the outcome of the review,the mppaa mandates arbitration proceedings.a any dispute between an employer and the plan sponsor shall be resolved through arbitration.after arbitration,or if no arbitration proceeding has been initiated,either party may bring an action in federal district court to enforce,vacate,or modify the arbitrator award.b.
section b provides that all employees of trades or businesses whether or not incorporated which are under common control shall be treated as employed by a single employer and all such trades and businesses as a single employer.b.under this section,each trade or business under common control is jointly and severally liable for the withdrawal liability of the others.see ditello,at.

ii.discussion 
standard of review 
the initial question presented in this case is the standard by which we review the district court decision.we ordinarily review a district court grant of summary judgment in an erisa case de novo.santaella metro.life ins,cir.however,in central states,southeast and southwest areas pension fund slotky,cir,this court held that the clearly erroneous standard of review applies when the only issue before the district court is the characterization of undisputed subsidiary facts and where a party does not have the right to a jury trial.in slotky,the court stated that although the fact of whether or not an enterprise is a trade or business is not ordinarily resolved on summary judgment,delaying judgment does not make sense in a case in which the only factual issue is one of characterization,and the opponent of summary judgment claims no right to a jury trial.id.at.in that scenario,both the record and the are the same in the summary judgment proceeding as they would be in a trial.there is no more evidence to put in and no different trier to evaluate it.id.as we explain below,there is no dispute over the underlying facts in this case.thus,to determine the appropriate standard of review,we must analyze whether the defendants are entitled to a jury trial 
the seventh amendment provides that in suits at common law,where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars,the right of trial by jury shall be preserved.const.amend.vii.the supreme court has long understood suits at common law to refer not merely to suits that the common law recognized among its old and settled proceedings,but to suits in which legal rights were to be ascertained and determined,in contrast to those where equitable rights and remedies were recognized.feltner columbia pictures television,d quoting parsons bedford,pet.the general rule in erisa cases is that there is no right to a jury trial because erisa antecedents are equitable,not legal.mathews sears pension plan,cir.however,a permits plan fiduciaries,employers,participants,or beneficiaries to bring civil suits under title iv of erisa and seek appropriate legal or equitable relief with respect to a plan.a.though a provides for both legal and equitable remedies in the case of pension plan di
