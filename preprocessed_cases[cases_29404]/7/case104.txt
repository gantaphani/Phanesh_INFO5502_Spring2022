we recount only those underlying and procedural facts material to resolving the instant appeal,those facts related to appellate jurisdiction.appellant sued to recover monies she invested with defendants after several business ventures failed.see.concerned that defendants might not be able to satisfy a future judgment entered in her favor,appellant sought prejudgment attachment of defendants property to avoid attachment,defendants proposed,and appellant agreed,that defendant pvq would obtain a surety bond.accordingly,defendant pvq posted a bond issued by appellee newport,which the district court eventually approved.

defendant pvq later converted its chapter bankruptcy to a chapter bankruptcy.the chapter trustee trustee moved the district court to compel appellee newport to respond to several issues related to the bond,as it related to defendant pvq bankruptcy estate.in its response,appellee newport asserted that the dismissal of appellant claims against defendant pvq voided the prejudgment bond,after the principal obligation that the bond secured ceased to exist,the appellee newport deems an accessory was invalid.
the district court agreed and entered an opinion and order declaring the bond null.on appellant motion,the district court later entered an order and partial judgment certifying the earlier opinion and order as immediately appealable under.b.appellant appeals,contending that the district court ruling constituted reversible error because,regardless of defendant pvq bankruptcy and dismissal without prejudice from the case,the she contends is a joint and several valid and enforceable.
because federal courts are powerless to act in the absence of subject matter jurisdiction,we have an unflagging obligation to notice jurisdictional defects and to verify that appellate jurisdiction lies before addressing the merits of any appeal.see puerto rico,cir.here,appellant asserts that appellate jurisdiction exists pursuant to the district court rule b certification and in any event,the doctrine.we disagree.see itv direct,healthy solutions,cir w e review decisions to grant or deny b certifications under an abuse of discretion standard.rhode island envtl.prot.agency,cir doctrine only applies to district court orders that meet the doctrine stringent requirements.
