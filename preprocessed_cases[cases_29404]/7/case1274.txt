appellants james bender,roy hewitt,craig mataczynski,john noer,and david peterson collectively referred to as appellants are former nrg energy,nrg executives who filed an action under the employee retirement income security act erisa,a,against xcel energy,xcel,the successor of nrg parent corporation,northern states power company nsp.the appellants claimed that xcel denied benefits due to them under a deferred compensation plan following their terminations from nrg.appellants bender and mataczynski also claimed that they were denied stock benefits owed to them under a separate severance plan.the district court granted summary judgment to xcel,finding that the deferred compensation claims were discharged in nrg bankruptcy proceedings.it further concluded that the appellants had no cause of action against xcel under the plan documents.the district court granted summary judgment on appellants bender and mataczynski claims because they did not meet the contractual obligations contained in the severance plan that would entitle them to the claimed stock benefits.appellants appeal,and we affirm.
prior to june,nrg was the wholly owned subsidiary of nsp,which operated power plants and marketed and sold energy.each of the appellants except bender worked for nsp for several years before going to work for nrg at various times between and.bender began his employment directly with nrg in.in june,nrg was spun off in an initial public offering ipo.in august,nsp merged with new century energies,to form xcel,the appellee in this case.xcel retained approximately of the outstanding shares of nrg following the ipo.
nrg expanded rapidly following the ipo,becoming heavily leveraged in the process.following turmoil in the energy market in and,nrg experienced serious financial difficulties,and xcel made a tender offer to repurchase nrg stock in.as part of the tender offer,nrg stock was converted to xcel stock at a ratio,and nrg stock options were converted to xcel stock options.nrg was then merged with a subsidiary of xcel.each of the appellants employment was terminated in june following the merger.
there are two types of plans at issue in this case.the first is the nrg executive officer and key personnel severance plan severance plan,which became effective on may.among other benefits,the severance plan provided that stock options granted under the nrg energy.incentive and compensation plan would continue to vest for a period of two years following termination of employment.to receive the benefits provided under the severance plan,the participant was required to provide the company nrg with a release in a form to be provided by the company.appellants app.at.appellants bender and mataczynski objected to the broad release provided by nrg for them to sign,and instead submitted a substitute release that they asserted met all of the release requirements of the severance plan.
following their terminations in june,the appellants filed a federal complaint on october,against nrg for failure to pay benefits under the severance plan.shortly thereafter on november,appellants instituted involuntary bankruptcy proceedings in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of minnesota against nrg under chapter of the bankruptcy code.appellants settled their severance claims with nrg in february,accepting cash payments totaling some million in lieu of their claims for severance benefits related to their employment with nrg.the bankruptcy court approved the settlement agreement and granted nrg petition to dismiss the involuntary petition.nrg thereafter filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy in the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york.
the settlement agreement between the appellants and nrg specifically provided that it did not in any way alter or affect any contractual obligations arising out of or related to any appellant employment with any entity other than nrg,or any appellant participation in any deferred compensation,pension,or other employee benefit plan maintained or sponsored by either nsp or xcel.appellants app.at.it further provided that 
none of the terms of this agreement in any way constitutes a waiver or compromise of any claims or rights that any of the appellants may have with respect to nsp or xcel,including but not limited to,claims for deferred compensation,as well as any rights to stock or stock options under any stock plan or grant of stock,maintained by either of those two companies,including nrg stock or options that were previously converted to xcel energy,stock or options 
appellants app.at.it is this exclusion that appellants bender and mataczynski rely on to assert a continuing claim against xcel for the asserted stock benefits,particularly the posttermination vesting period for stock options.
the second plan is the nsp deferred compensation plan,also referred to as the top hat plan which was first established in by nsp.nsp was the original principal sponsor of the top hat plan and was replaced by xcel following nsp merger with new century energies in.the parties disputed which of several versions of the top hat plan covered payment of the appellants deferred compensation benefits.the top hat plan was restated in the restatement.the parties dispute whether a statement was a plan or whether it was a restatement of the restatement.following the energies merger,several plans,including both the restatement and the statement whether a restatement of the restatement or not were merged into a single plan in the restatement.the restatement and the restatement both included language that required participants to look only to the participating employer which last employed them for payment see id.at,a provision which would have precluded the appellants,who were all employed by nrg at the time of their terminations,from seeking deferred compensation benefits from xcel under the top hat plans.the statement did not contain the quoted language,but other language in the statement led to a dispute between the parties about whether,if covered by the statement,the appellants were similarly limited to looking only to the assets of nrg,their former employer,for payment under the plan.the retroactivity of the restatement,which was enacted in january but claimed an effective date of january,further clouded the issue of which plan covered the appellants claims for deferred compensation benefits.
during the time appellants were negotiating the involuntary bankruptcy settlement of their severance benefits with nrg,appellants sought their deferred compensation benefits under the top hat plan from xcel as the plan administrator.after nrg filed its voluntary bankruptcy petition in new york,in letters dated june,xcel denied in part each of the appellants demands for deferred compensation benefits,asserting that xcel had verified with both its accounting office and nrg accounting office that the obligation to pay deferred compensation benefits had been transferred to nrg pursuant to section of the restatement or section of the restatement at the time each appellant transferred his employment from xcel predecessor to nrg.appellants app.at.xcel further determined that both the restatement and the restatement required plan beneficiaries to seek benefits solely from their last employer,nrg.xcel acknowledged,however,for each of the appellants,except bender who never worked for nsp,that it had previously communicated to the appellants that it had an obligation based on the appellants prior employment with nsp,and that it would honor the obligation and pay certain amounts directly to the appellants.thus,xcel,as plan administrator,approved the claims in part in an amount that xcel itself had previously determined to be based on the appellants deferred compensation account balances at the time each appellant transferred employment to nrg.appellants sought administrative review of the denial,which was affirmed by the review committee throughout the administrative claim process,the parties referred to and quoted portions of the restatement and the restatement.none of the appellants sought benefits pursuant to the statement.
meanwhile,nrg filed a joint plan of reorganization in the new york bankruptcy proceeding,which included a proposed settlement between nrg and xcel referred to as the employee matters agreement.that agreement collectively referred to the xcel energy.nonqualified deferred compensation plan the restatement and the xcel energy.nonqualified pension plan a plan not at issue here as the nqrps,and allocated to xcel the obligations owed to nrg employees as of the date of the settlement december,that were legally allocable to xcel by virtue of the employees prior service with xcel or nsp.the employee matters agreement referred to this allocated portion as the xcel nqrp amount,and it specifically provided that t o the extent xcel has not previously satisfied such obligation,xcel will maintain responsibility for payment of the xcel nqrp amount.appellants app.at.
after the review committee denied the appellants claims for deferred compensation benefits,the appellants brought this federal action against xcel,both in its corporate capacity and as plan sponsor and administrator of the xcel energy.deferred compensation plan,seeking deferred compensation benefits.bender and mataczynski also sought redress for xcel denial of stock options,to which they claimed entitlement based on the extended vesting period contained in the severance plan.in the initial stages of the litigation,the parties referred to the,and plans as all restatements of the original top hat plan.on xcel motion for summary judgment,the district court initially determined that a fact dispute existed both concerning whether the appellants were covered by the statement,potentially making xcel liable,and whether the restatement applied retroactively to the appellants,thereby excluding xcel from liability.the district court denied xcel motion for summary judgment on this point.the district court granted summary judgment to xcel on bender and mataczynski claims related to stock options premised on the severance plan because they each had failed to provide the release required by the severance plan to be entitled to the vesting period 
after further discovery,the parties filed a second round of for summary judgment.xcel raised for the first time the notion that the statement was a plan that did not provide coverage to the appellants,none of whom were employed by nsp or xcel during the relevant period.the district court agreed.the district court also concluded that the undisputed evidence established that upon each appellant transfer of employment to nrg,nsp had made book entries,supported by cash payments,transferring nsp liability for the appellants deferred compensation to nrg.thus,the appellants settlement agreement and release of claims with nrg in the involuntary minnesota bankruptcy proceedings satisfied their entitlement to deferred compensation from xcel,because at that time any deferred compensation obligation was nrg alone.
appellants appeal,arguing that their claims for deferred compensation were not settled out in the nrg involuntary bankruptcy proceeding and that xcel,as plan administrator,erred in retroactively applying the restatement and denying their claims,which the appellants argue are governed by the statement.appellants bender and mataczynski also appeal the district court grant of summary judgment on their claims for stock options premised on the extended vesting period contained in the severance plan.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standard used by the district court and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the appellants as the nonmoving parties.see pralutsky metro.life ins,cir,cert.denied,d.appellants brought this civil action under of erisa to recover benefits allegedly due under an plan.see a b.while we generally give deference to plan administrators that are granted discretionary authority under the applicable plan,see pralutsky,at,we recently explained that the same deference is not owed to administrators of top hat plans.see craig,at t op hat plans should be treated as unilateral contracts and reviewed in accordance with ordinary contract principles because the policy considerations relied upon in firestone tire rubber bruch,d,to trigger review are simply not present in the case of a top hat plan.quoting goldstein johnson johnson,cir.
although we review the interpretation of a contract de novo,we note that each of the plans gives the administrator discretionary authority to interpret the plan.we construe that term as we do any other contract term and give effect to its meaning.ordinary contract principles require that,where one party is granted discretion under the terms of the contract,that discretion must be exercised in good requirement that includes the duty to exercise the discretion reasonably.id.internal marks omitted.we therefore review for reasonableness,a deferential standard,xcel determination that the appellants could seek deferred compensation benefits only from nrg under either the restatement or the restatement.
deferred compensation under the top hat plans 
the district court concluded that xcel,as plan administrator,appropriately denied deferred compensation benefits to the appellants because the clear language of each of the plans revealed that the appellants benefits were covered by either the restatement or the restatement,both of which required the appellants to seek benefits solely from their last employer,nrg.see appellants app.at,restatement payments shall be made only by the participating employer which last employed the participant before payments commence.id.at,restatement,payment of distributions from this plan shall be made only by the employer which last employed the participant before payments commence.appellants succinctly define t he only issue as whether the statement was a plan or one of a series of amendments to the underlying plan.appellants br.at.
in arguing that the statement was an amendment to the original top hat plan,the appellants rely admissions made by xcel in response to plaintiffs requests for admissions under federal rule of civil procedure.during discovery,xcel forwarded a copy of the statement to appellants along with the other plans in response to a request for documents.prior to this time,the statement had not been at issue in fact,the appellants alleged rights to recover under its terms was never raised in the administrative proceedings.in its responses to plaintiffs request for admissions,which asked xcel to a dmit the restatement signed on january,amended the statement appellants app.at,xcel object ed to this request because the restatement amended the top hat plan which was created in the,of which the statement was one of a series of amendments to the underlying plan id.subject to that objection,xcel admitted that the restatement amended the statement.in other admissions,xcel admitted the content of various sections of the statement to the extent that the request for admissions quoted directly from the plan language,but continually denied any request that sought to establish the statement as applicable to the appellants,asserting instead that the appellants claims were covered by the restatement.xcel did not assert that the statement was a plan until after the district court denied its first motion for summary judgment.that the statement was a plan formed the basis for xcel subsequent motion for summary judgment,which the district court granted.
we agree with the appellants that as a general rule,admissions made in response to a rule request for admissions are binding on that party.see.b any matter admitted under this rule is conclusively established unless the court on motion permits withdrawal or amendment of the admission.following the district court first denial of summary judgment on the deferred compensation claim,xcel submitted the affidavit of parker newcomb,iii,a senior attorney for nsp in when the statement was created,and later its vice president of total compensation and human resource operations,who left xcel in.newcomb stated in his affidavit that the statement was a newly created plan,that it was not a restatement of the restatement,and that none of the appe
