appellant yoji oyama filed an adversary proceeding to determine the debt of michael sheehan nondischargeable.sheehan moved to dismiss for failure to serve the complaint on the debtor within the period provided in rule m of the federal rules of civil procedure.
the bankruptcy court granted sheehan motion to dismiss,finding that there was no good cause under rule m to extend the time period and that the excusable neglect provision of bankruptcy rule b did not apply to a nondischargeability proceeding.the ninth circuit bankruptcy appellate panel bap affirmed,finding that the required motion was not made under rule b and,alternatively,holding that the excusable neglect provision of rule b did not apply under rule m.
we have jurisdiction under d,and we reverse.we hold that the bankruptcy court and the bap erred in refusing to apply the excusable neglect provision of rule b in determining whether to enlarge the time for service.

in,oyama,attempting to pierce the corporate veil,sued sheehan for his alleged failure to restore the car as promised.oyama first filed a complaint in orange county superior court.that case was removed to the united states bankruptcy court for the central district of california,and is proceeding in the separate bankruptcy case of european auto.in the instant proceeding,oyama timely filed a nondischargeability complaint under on november.
the original summons was issued on november.oyama served the summons and complaint on sheehan attorney by mail on november.that service was defective,however,because it failed to comply with the requirement that service by mail must be made within days following the issuance of the summons.see.e.oyama then timely served a second summons and complaint on sheehan attorney,but failed to serve the debtor individually,as required by rule b,until six days after the expiration of the period prescribed by rule m.sheehan filed a motion to dismiss for improper service under rule m.in opposition to that motion,oyama argued that there was good cause for the failure,and that the court was therefore required to extend the time for service

the time for service in an adversary proceeding may be extended under two different rules rule m of the federal rules of civil procedure and bankruptcy rule b bankruptcy rule a incorporates by reference rule m into the bankruptcy rules.
rule m requires a analysis in deciding whether or not to extend the prescribed time period for the service of a complaint.see.m petrucelli bohringer ratzinger,gmbh,cir.first,upon a showing of good cause for the defective service,the court must extend the time period.second,if there is no good cause,the court has the discretion to dismiss without prejudice or to extend the time period.id.
rule b gives the court discretion to extend any time period stated in the rules upon a showing of excusable neglect.after the time period has expired,however,an extension can be granted only upon motion.
the issue in this case is whether the excusable neglect provision of rule b applies to the time period stated in rule m,despite the fact that rule m contains its own good cause standard.because established rules of statutory construction require us to read these rules as supplementing,rather than contradicting,each other,we hold that the excusable neglect provision of rule b applies to rule m.
good cause under rule m 
oyama argues that the bankruptcy court abused its discretion by failing to find good cause to extend the service period.oyama asserted that his attorney busy schedule and seriously ill secretary amounted to good cause.we conclude that the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in holding that no good cause was shown under rule m.
when considering a motion to dismiss a complaint for untimely service,courts must determine whether good cause for the delay has been shown on a case by case basis.cartage,waldner in re waldner.we have recognized that a t a minimum,good cause means excusable neglect.boudette barnette,cir.in boudette,we stated that a plaintiff may be required to show the following factors in order to bring the excuse to the level of good cause a the party to be served received actual notice of the lawsuit b the defendant would suffer no prejudice and c plaintiff would be severely prejudiced if his complaint were dismissed.id.citing hart united states,cir.
the record indicates that oyama failed to show these factors.we therefore affirm the bankruptcy court holding that there was no good cause shown to extend the service period 
discretion under rule m 
oyama further argues that the bankruptcy court abused its discretion by failing to extend the time period under the discretionary component of rule m.we hold that the bankruptcy court properly refused to exercise its discretion to extend the service period.
courts have discretion under rule m,absent a showing of good cause,to extend the time for service or to dismiss the action without prejudice.petrucelli,at.although the rule does not contain the discretionary term may,it requires that,absent good cause,the court shall dismiss the action without prejudice as to that defendant or direct that service be effected within a specified time.m west supp.we have not addressed what factors a court should consider when deciding to exercise its discretion under rule m.see barr barr in re barr.
we find it unnecessary,however,to articulate a specific test that a court must apply in exercising its discretion under rule m.we note only that,under the terms of the rule,the court discretion is broad.cooter gell hartmarx,d adopting a deferential standard for reviewing rule sanctions based on factual determinations.the facts of this case clearly do not mandate the exercise of discretion to extend the service period under rule m.
excusable neglect under rule b 
in addition to rule m,the time for service may be extended under bankruptcy rule b upon a showing of excusable neglect.rule b allows a court on motion made after the expiration of the specified period to permit the act to be done where the failure to act was the result of excusable neglect.b west supp.subdivision b expressly excepts the time limits under certain rules from enlargement under this provision,and limits enlargement under other specific rules.b.rule m is not one of the provisions expressly excluded or limited by rule b.rule b must therefore apply to rule m.
the supreme court articulated the excusable neglect standard of rule b in pioneer.there,the court held that,in determining the existence of excusable neglect,a court must examine four factors the danger of prejudice to the debtor,the length of delay and its potential impact on judicial proceedings,the reason for the delay,including whether it was within the reasonable control of the movant,and whether the movant acted in good faith.pioneer,at.
both the bankruptcy court and the bap erroneously ruled that the excusable neglect provision of rule b was inapplicable to rule m.the bankruptcy court distinguished pioneer from the present case on the basis that pioneer involved the late filing of a proof of claim,while this case involves a proceeding to determine nondischargeability under.it reasoned that contains a much shorter limitation period than other types of filings under the bankruptcy code a creditor has only days within which to file a proceeding to determine a debt nondischargeable.the court therefore concluded that the pioneer test was inapplicable in the unique context of a proceeding.we disagree.nothing in pioneer or suggests that the excusable neglect provision would not apply in nondischargeability proceedings.
the bap similarly rejected oyama argument that the pioneer excusable neglect test is applicable to the failure to make timely service.the bap relied on broitman kirkland in re kirkland,cir,in stating that pioneer s balancing test is not applicable when analyzing whether there is good cause for failure to make timely service.the bap also cited united states ex rel.deloss kenner contractors,cir,for the proposition that after the period has expired,a trial court may grant an extension of time to serve a complaint only when a party has satisfied the good cause requirement of rule j 
the bap reliance on kenner and kirkland is problematic.these cases were decided before amended rule m was incorporated by reference into the bankruptcy rules.bankruptcy rule g specified that the provisions of rule in effect on january,apply,notwithstanding any subsequent amendment to rule.the version of rule j allowed for the extension of the service period only upon a showing of good cause.because rule b permitted an extension upon a showing of excusable neglect,while rule allowed an extension only upon a showing of good cause,the rules created a seeming incongruity.artificial intelligence casey in re casey.the amendment of rule m was an attempt to cure this incongruity.this amendment added a discretionary component to rule,so that the rule no longer required a showing of good cause to extend the time period.the amendment,however,only cured the conflict between rules and b of the federal rules of civil procedure.bankruptcy rule g continued to incorporate only the version of rule.in,rule g was abrogated and the discretionary component of rule m was incorporated by reference into the bankruptcy rules.thus,rules b and m can now be read congruently.
accordingly,if good cause is shown,a court shall extend the service period under rule.if good cause is not shown,the court has the discretion to extend the time period.in addition,the court may extend the time limit upon a showing of excusable neglect under b.
because it is possible to interpret rule b and rule m without conflict,while giving meaning to both rules,this is the correct interpretation.courts must interpret a congressional act,if possible,in a manner that gives each section its due effect without inconsistency or repugnancy.new lamp chimney ansonia brass copper.a construction that creates an inconsistency should be avoided when a reasonable interpretation can be adopted which will not do violence to the plain words of the act,and will carry out the intention of congress.united states raynor.
we thus hold that the excusable neglect standard of rule b applies to the service period prescribed by rule m.to the extent that kenner holds that rule b is inapplicable to rule,it has been superseded by the amendment of rule m and its incorporation by reference into the bankruptcy rules with the abrogation of bankruptcy rule g.
d.the b motion requirement 
sheehan argues that oyama can not avail himself of rule b because he never brought a separate motion,as required by the rule.we conclude,however,that the motion requirement was narrowly satisfied in this case.
rule b provides that,after the expiration of the time period,the court may excuse the delay only on motion made.no written rule b motion was filed in this case.instead,oyama attorney urged the court to consider the excusable neglect standard during the hearing on sheehan motion to dismiss.
normally,a bankruptcy court is not required to rule on an oral,motion.the local bankruptcy rules for the central district of california provide that u nless otherwise provided by rule or order of the court,no oral motions will be recognized except during trial.cal.local.in the present case,the bankruptcy judge admonished counsel at the hearing that it is improper to argue anything that not in your papers.the judge,nonetheless,then ruled on the oral motion despite its impropriety,ruling that the pioneer test was not applicable in the context of a nondischargeability proceeding under.thus,the court effectively recognized the motion and denied it on the merits 
furthermore,as oyama pointed out,all of the arguments for and against a rule b motion to enlarge would be identical to those made for and against sheehan motion to dismiss under rule.this suggests that the concerns of notice and opportunity to respond to the motion were satisfied in this case 
in light of the bankruptcy judge ruling that the pioneer standard did not apply to nondischargeability proceedings,it would have been futile for oyama to submit a formal motion to enlarge for excusable neglect.
we hold that the bankruptcy court,after recognizing an oral motion to enlarge the time for service,abused its discretion by failing to apply the excusable neglect standard articulated by the supreme court in pioneer in considering that motion 
reversed and remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
i respectfully dissent.
counsel for the creditor oyama failed to effectuate timely service under federal rule of civil procedure m.his explanation was that secretaries are often the ones who follow the rules or are supposed to follow the rules for service and the serious illness by the sole secretary and extended trial appearances and trial scheduling by both lawyers in the office caused the error.on appeal,counsel asks this court to find that the bankruptcy court abused its discretion when it dismissed his complaint due to ineffective service.
the bankruptcy court,the ninth circuit bankruptcy appellate panel,and the majority opinion of this court properly found that under the good cause standard of rule m the facts in this case clearly do not mandate the exercise of discretion to extend the service period under rule m.majority op.at.however,the majority opinion does not stop at ruling on the issue before this court.instead,the majority goes on to find that federal rule of bankruptcy b excusable neglect standard applies to this case.this issue is not properly before this court because counsel for the creditor never made the required motion to invoke rule b and this court should not consider an issue not decided upon by the lower court.moreover,i do not believe that counsel conduct rises to the level of excusable neglect.
failure to make a motion 
the majority finds that the bankruptcy judge recognized a rule b motion and denied it on its merits.this is baffling.there was no written motion presented to the court as required by the local bankruptcy rules.nowhere in the briefs to the bankruptcy court or during oral argument was the term b used.in fact,it was not until oral argument before the bankruptcy judge that the term excusable neglect was even mentioned.at that time,the bankruptcy judge admonished counsel that it is improper to argue anything that not in your papers and then went on to say that she did not think the excusable neglect standard applied to good cause and she was not going to consider it.
courts strictly adhere to the requirement that a motion be made to invoke a rule.there are numerous examples where failure to make a motion has denied a party the ability to pursue a particular course of action.see,cone.pulp paper.holding that the absence of a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict left the appellate court without power to require the district court to reverse its decision saman robbins,cir finding that failure to make a timely motion under federal rule of civil procedure b caused plaintiff sufficiency of evidence arguments t
