these appeals arise out of the chapter bankruptcy of mba poultry,mba poultry.at the time it declared bankruptcy,mba poultry owed debts to the money store money store,the united states small business administration sba,dapec,dapec,and the city of tecumseh,nebraska tecumseh,as well as to other creditors who are not parties to these appeals.the money store and the sba claim interests in advances made under two loan agreements,dapec claims an interest in construction materials it furnished to mba poultry,and tecumseh is trying to collect unpaid sewer and water bills.on appeal,we must determine whether the bankruptcy court was correct in determining the relative priorities of the claims of these parties.we affirm in part and reverse in part.
background 
the debtor,mba poultry,is the former owner of a chicken processing plant in tecumseh,nebraska.when mba poultry purchased the plant from the campbell soup company on june,it obtained financing from the money store.the money store made two loans to mba poultry on the date of the purchase.the first loan the a loan was a promissory note in the amount of,payable over a period of thirty years.the second loan the b loan was a promissory note for,payable over a period of one year.
the a loan and the b loan were each secured by a separate deed of trust filed in johnson county,nebraska,on june.in addition,as authorized by nebraska statutes on construction liens,a notice of commencement of renovations to the plant was also filed in johnson county on june.see.the notice of commencement was filed a few minutes after the money store recorded its trust deeds.
the money store began disbursing money under the two loans the day the promissory notes were signed.on june,the money store disbursed of the a loan and of the b loan.the balances of both loans were dispensed in installments,beginning on july,and ending on december.
mba poultry obtained additional financing from heller financial,heller.heller loan and security interest were executed on october,more than two months after heller filed a financing statement with the johnson county clerk.heller financing statement covered,among other things,all of mba poultry personal property,whether now owned or existing or hereafter acquired or arising.from the appellate record,it is unclear how much heller loaned mba poultry.when the bankruptcy petition was filed,mba poultry owed heller.
mba poultry business did not generate enough revenue to pay off the b loan in the repayment period.instead,mba poultry paid off the b loan by arranging a loan from the nebraska economic development corporation nedco.the nedco loan was secured by a deed of trust filed in johnson county on december.mba poultry president and ceo,mark haskins,also gave a personal guarantee for the loan.in january,nedco provided the money to repay the b loan by issuing debentures guaranteed by the sba.as part of this transaction,the money store assigned the b loan and the trust deed securing it to the sba 
shortly after purchasing the plant,mba poultry began renovations by installing an system.mba poultry bought the system from dapec for.on august,mba poultry gave dapec a security interest in all goods and fixtures it purchased from dapec,including renewals,additions,or replacements thereto.dapec claims it later provided additional materials worth.dapec did not file financing statements reflecting its security interest until november.on november,dapec recorded a financing statement with the nebraska secretary of state.on november,dapec recorded a financing statement in johnson county.both financing statements referred to all goods or fixtures which mba poultry purchased from dapec.dapec filed a construction lien for plus interest on january.
mba poultry filed for chapter bankruptcy on january.on february,the bankruptcy court entered a final order giving heller a interest in mba poultry personal property and authorizing the sale of the dapec air chill line.heller assigned its claim in bankruptcy to bird watchers,which then purchased all of mba poultry real and personal property at auction for.the sale was approved by the bankruptcy court on june.
after the sale was approved,the bankruptcy court had to determine priority among mba poultry creditors.with the exception of dapec,the creditors agreed on priority in the following order johnson county,city of tecumseh,the money store,and american national bank.these creditors also agreed that either dapec or the sba should occupy the fifth priority position.
dapec refused to join the agreement on priority.instead,it claimed that its construction lien has priority,to some extent,over the liens of the money store and the sba.dapec raised two arguments in support of this claim.first,it argued that its construction lien dates back to june,when the notice of commencement was filed,and that it trumps any advances made after that date.second,dapec argued that the frame of the stainless steel superstructure is a fixture,and that its perfected security interest in the superstructure trumps the security interest held by the sba.
the bankruptcy court rejected both of these arguments,finding that dapec construction lien did not attach before the money store made its cash advances and that the superstructure is not a fixture.the bankruptcy court then entered an order allowing the bankruptcy proceeds to be distributed in accordance with its rulings on these two issues.the district court affirmed all three of these decisions,but did not reach the merits of the fixture issue.instead,the district court held that dapec waived its fixture claim by failing to object to the bankruptcy court february,final order.
the bankruptcy court also had to settle an issue of priority between dapec and the city of tecumseh.on january,tecumseh certified mba poultry delinquent sewer and water bills to the johnson county clerk.on january,when it declared bankruptcy,mba poultry owed tecumseh for sewer service and for water service.the bankruptcy court held these unpaid bills were special assessments which automatically took priority over dapec construction lien.
the district court reversed the bankruptcy court decision on this issue,holding that tecumseh was not entitled to treat its sewer and water liens like special assessments with automatic priority over dapec construction lien.the district court remanded the case to bankruptcy court for a determination of whether tecumseh liens have priority if they are not treated like special assessments.
dapec and tecumseh now appeal the decisions of the district court.in its appeals,dapec asserts that its construction lien and its security interest in the superstructure have priority over the deeds of trust held by the money store and the sba.tecumseh,in its appeal,asserts that mba poultry sewer and water bills are special assessments with automatic priority over dapec claims.
ii.discussion 
in a bankruptcy appeal,this court sits as a second court of review and applies the same standards of review as the district court.in re cedar shore resort,cir.like the district court,we review the bankruptcy court findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.id.
priority under nebraska construction lien statutes 
the first issue on appeal pits dapec construction lien against the deeds of trust the money store took to secure the a loan and the b loan.the deed of trust for the a loan is still held by the money store,while the deed of trust for the b loan has been assigned to the sba.
under nebraska law,as a general rule,a construction lien has priority over subsequent advances made under a prior recorded security interest if the subsequent advances are made with knowledge that the lien has attached.in order to obtain priority under this statute,dapec must show that the money store made its cash advances with knowledge that dapec construction lien had attached.the bankruptcy court found that the money store did not know about dapec construction lien until after december,when it finished making future advances under the a and b loans.
in an attempt to overcome this finding,dapec relies on the notice of commencement filed on june.under nebraska law,i f a lien is recorded while a notice of commencement is effective as to the improvement in connection with which the lien arises,the lien attaches as of the time the notice is recorded.dapec argues that since section relates its lien back to june,when the notice of commencement was recorded,it also imputes knowledge of the lien to the money store as of that date.
dapec argument fails because the relevant requires actual knowledge of a competing lien.in the absence of anything to the contrary,statutory language is to be given its plain and ordinary meaning.rodriguez monfort.under section,the priority of a construction lien does not turn on imputed knowledge that a lien has attached or the knowledge that a lien might attach.it turns,rather,on the lender knowledge that the lien has attached.see.in its ordinary use,the term knowledge means being cognizant,conscious,or aware of something,webster third new international dictionary,and we see no reason why the nebraska legislature would have intended a different meaning here.as explained above,the money store did not actually know about dapec construction lien when it was making advances.accordingly,under the construction lien statutes,dapec construction lien is subordinate to the deeds of trust filed by the money store 
b.the fixture issue 
under certain circumstances,nebraska law gives a perfected security interest in a fixture priority over the conflicting interest of an encumbrancer of the related real estate.see.operative until july,a fixture is a chattel which is capable of existing separate and apart from a parcel of real property,but which has become a more or less permanent part of the real estate.see pick fordyce coop.credit ass n,citation omitted.dapec argues that its security interest in the stainless steel superstructure has priority over the trust deed held by the sba because the superstructure is a fixture 
the district court did not reach the merits of this argument,finding instead that dapec waived the argument by failing to object to the bankruptcy court february,final order.interpretation of the bankruptcy court order presents a question of law which we review de novo.see brady mcallister,cir.the final order of february,created a interest in certain personal property,including mba poultry overhead conveyor.however,it is not obvious to us that the bankruptcy court meant the term overhead conveyor to include the superstructure.in the purchase orders for the system,mba poultry and dapec distinguished the components of the conveyor from the superstructure.perhaps more important,the bankruptcy court apparently did not believe that dapec had waived the issue,because it ruled on the merits of dapec motion.under these circumstances,we find that the fixture issue was not waived,and we review the bankruptcy court decision on its merits.
the bankruptcy court determination that the superstructure is not a fixture was a finding of fact.see washington metro.area transit auth.precision small engines,cir per curiam first.bank of milwaukee fed.land bank of paul,cir.as such,it may be reversed only if it was clearly erroneous.fed.first.bank,at 
under nebraska law,a court must look to three factors in determining whether personal property has become a fixture.these factors are 
whether the article or articles are annexed to the realty,or something appurtenant thereto whether the article or articles have been appropriated to the use or purpose of that part of the realty with which it is or they are connected and whether the party making the annexation intended to make the article or articles a permanent accession to the freehold.
fed.land bank of omaha swanson,citation omitted.the first two factors,annexation and appropriation to the use of the realty,have value primarily as evidence of the owner intent,which is generally regarded as the most important factor.natural gas state bd.of equalization.
one piece of evidence before the bankruptcy court was the affidavit of mark haskins haskins,the president and ceo of mba poultry.in his affidavit,haskins states that although the superstructure is bolted to the floor or ceiling,the bolts can be taken out,and the superstructure can be removed from the premises with no damage to the equipment or to the premises.haskins also states that he always understood that the equipment could be removed at any time,without much difficulty or any damage to either the machinery or building.according to haskins,it was never his intention to have any of the equipment become a permanent part of or accession to the premises.
the president of dapec,peter goffe goffe,signed an affidavit that to some extent conflicts with the affidavit of haskins.in goffe affidavit,he states that it took approximately seven weeks of work,averaging hours a week,to complete the superstructure and the rest of the system.the entire system,he says,was custom designed and constructed in order to be integrated into the plant.goffe avers that the ceiling of the air chill rooms is laid upon and is supported by the support superstructure.according to goffe,the components of the superstructure are welded together and affixed to the building,and can not be removed and reused in any other location or otherwise broken down as reusable component parts.
the bankruptcy record also includes color photographs of the superstructure.the photos support much of goffe affidavit.the photos show the superstructure being constructed in a large room with walls of concrete block.the room appears to be approximately sixteen feet high,twenty feet wide,and at least feet long.the superstructure,which is composed of stainless steel beams,fills the dimensions of the room.at least five pairs of beams,spaced approximately eight feet apart,run vertically from the floor almost to the ceiling.each pair of vertical beams is connected by four horizontal beams.the highest level of these horizontal beams spans the tops of the vertical beams,and the other levels run successively lower in intervals of about four feet.the horizontal beams are reinforced in the center of the room by approximately long vertical beams.these shorter beams run vertically between the horizontal beams,from the topmost beams straight down,from one beam to the next,and from the lowest beams to the floor.although it is clear that most of the joints of the superstructure are welded together,it is not clear whether they all are,or whether a few of them are bolted together instead.
the record is inconclusive as to whether,as goffe claims,the ceiling of the processing plant has been laid upon the superstructure.the photographs,which were taken during construction of the superstructure,show a gap between the top of the superstructure and the ceiling.according to dapec,the ceiling was lowered after the photographs were taken,and it now rests on the ceiling.the appellees have not disputed this claim.
in analyzing the affidavits and the photographs,the bankruptcy court made three main points.first,it noted that the superstructure was only bolted down to the floor of the plant and not permanently attached to the walls or ceiling.second,while the bankruptcy court noted that the superstructure was specifically designed for use in mba poultry chicken processing plant,it observed that the building itself could be used for other purposes if the superstructure were removed.third,the bankruptcy court relied on haskins affidavit to show that the parties did not intend the superstructure to be a fixture.in summary,the bankruptcy court found,i t can be reasonably inferred from the evidence of the use,purpose,and method of construction of the superstructure that the parties intended it to be separate and distinct from the real estate.
reviewing the bankruptcy court decision,the first factor we address is the manner in which the superstructure is affixed to the real estate.in analyzing this factor,the bankruptcy court concentrated on the fact that the superstructure is only bolted down.in their briefs,the parties argue about the significance of this fact.
under nebraska case law,it is possible for an item that is merely bolted down to become a fixture.the sba cites swanson,at,in which the ne
