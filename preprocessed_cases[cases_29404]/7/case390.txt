background 
in the first months of,a network of banks located primarily in africa and controlled by mibl began to experience severe liquidity problems.on april,the supreme court of the bahamas placed mibl into involuntary liquidation and appointed alison treco and david patrick hamilton,both partners of kpmg peat marwick working out of its bahamas office,as mibl liquidators.
for several years prior to these events,mibl had enjoyed a close relationship with bny.bny acted as mibl correspondent bank in the united states,providing it and several of its subsidiaries account services,loans,and other financial accommodations.on june,bny and mibl entered into an agreement the mibl pledge agreement pursuant to which mibl pledged its account with bny and all its other present and future accounts on bny books as security for all of mibl present and future obligations and liabilities to bny.mibl also promised under the agreement to reimburse bny for costs and expenses,including attorneys fees and disbursements,incurred in protecting its security interest,and agreed that all proceedings relating hereto shall be brought in courts located within new york city.
the next year,mibl requested from bny certain financial in the form of overdrafts on certain of its operating accounts at the amount of million to be secured by funds newly deposited at bny by one of mibl subsidiaries,meridien biao bank tanzania limited meridien tanzania.bny agreed on the condition that meridien tanzania and mibl sign a second agreement the meridien tanzania agreement according to which meridien tanzania would pledge certain of its accounts to bny as security.this agreement was signed on november.
mibl subsequently defaulted on its obligation to repay the million.to satisfy this obligation,bny liquidated meridien tanzania pledged account in the amount of million between january and march.but in early april,the central bank of tanzania appointed a manager to operate meridien tanzania.the manager questioned the validity of the meridien tanzania agreement and demanded return of the million that bny had taken.
after mibl was placed in bankruptcy in the bahamas in late april,bny commenced a suit in june against mibl,meridien tanzania and several other subsidiaries of mibl,in the united states district court for the southern district of new york,seeking,inter alia,a declaratory judgment that bny,not meridien tanzania,had the right to the million that bny had liquidated,or,if it did not prevail with respect to the meridien tanzania accounts,an order permitting bny to retain approximately remaining in mibl accounts with bny.
on september,the liquidators initiated a separate proceeding,filing a petition on behalf of mibl in the bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york pursuant to a.section a authorizes a foreign representative in a foreign bankruptcy proceeding to commence a c ase ancillary to that proceeding in a united states bankruptcy court to protect the administration of the foreign proceeding.in re koreag,controle et revision,cir koreag quoting a alterations in original.among the forms of relief authorized by are an injunction prohibiting actions against the debtor and the turnover of property to a foreign representative.see b.in their petition,the liquidators requested,inter alia,that all judicial actions against mibl be enjoined and that all persons or entities possessing mibl assets turn over those assets,or the proceeds thereof,to the liquidators.
on march,the bankruptcy court preliminarily enjoined further proceedings involving mibl in bny district court action.that action proceeded to trial before judge sonia sotomayor as to the other defendants,however.then,on june,while the case was sub judice,bny entered into a settlement agreement pursuant to which bny agreed,inter alia,to pay million to meridien tanzania assignee,deposit insurance board dib,which had appeared and answered in the action.as part of the agreement,bny was assigned all dib rights of subrogation with respect to the mibl accounts.
in the bankruptcy court,meanwhile,the liquidators moved for partial summary judgment directing turnover of the remaining in mibl accounts at bny and being held by bny.bny opposed the motion on several grounds,asserting that it rightfully held the as security for two secured debts owed by mibl the million bny had agreed to pay dib as part of the settlement agreement,together with related attorneys fees and any of dib claims against mibl that had been assigned to bny pursuant to the settlement agreement.as of may,mibl estate contained approximately million.
the bankruptcy court granted the liquidators partial summary judgment motion in a january,decision holding,inter alia that bny purported status as a secured creditor would not bar turnover because bahamian law recognizes security interests in property,treco i,at that turnover under is not contingent on the provision of adequate protection to bny interest,that does not preserve any right of setoff bny might possess,id.at,and that the bahamian liquidation proceeding complies with the requirements for turnover set out in c,see id.at.
in a september,opinion and order,the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court order for substantially the same reasons.see treco ii.judge schwartz explicitly declined,however,to address whether any common law or contractual right of bny to is preserved,because any claim may be fully addressed by the bahamian court.id.at.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
turnover under.the statutory framework and standard of review 
section of the bankruptcy code,enacted as part of the bankruptcy reform act of,was intended to deal with the complex and increasingly important problems involving the legal effect the united states courts will give to foreign bankruptcy proceedings.cunard salen reefer servs.ab,cir.of particular relevance to this appeal,addresses situations in which a bankruptcy proceeding has been instituted in a foreign country and the debtor has assets in the united states.as the district court observed,see treco ii,at,courts and commentators have identified two general approaches to distributing assets in such proceedings.under the territoriality approach,or the grab rule,the court in each jurisdiction where the debtor has assets distributes the assets located in that jurisdiction pursuant to local rules.under the universality approach,a primary insolvency proceeding is instituted in the debtor domiciliary country,and ancillary courts in other in jurisdictions where the debtor has to the foreign proceeding and in effect collaborate to facilitate the centralized liquidation of the debtor estate according to the rules of the debtor home country.see id in re hourani,in re maxwell communication,aff,aff,cir collier on bankruptcy lawrence king,ed.jay lawrence westbrook,a global solution to multinational default,stuart krause,et,relief under section of the bankruptcy code clarifying the principal role of comity in transnational insolvencies,fordham,melissa rimel,american recognition of international insolvency proceedings deciphering section c,
the enactment of was a step toward the universality approach.see,koreag,at t he overriding purpose of is to prevent piecemeal distribution of a debtor estate.cunard,at s ection may be said to have been designed to accommodate the problems in which foreign bankruptcy proceedings have been instituted and creditors are attempting to seize assets of the debtor located in the united states.in re maxwell communication,at section embraces a modified form of universalism accepting the central premise of universalism,that is,that assets should be collected and distributed on a worldwide basis,but reserving to local courts discretion to evaluate the fairness of home country procedures and to protect the interests of local creditors.collier on bankruptcy jay lawrence westbrook,choice of avoidance law in global insolvencies,brook.int l,citing as t he leading example of modified universalism krause,et,supra,at rimel,supra,at.section allows a foreign representative,a,such as a liquidator in a foreign insolvency proceeding,to institute an ancillary proceeding in the united states to obtain an injunction prohibiting suits or enforcement of judgments against the debtor or its property,see,b a,b,turnover of the property of the debtor estate to the foreign liquidators,see,b,or other appropriate relief,b.these remedies are intended to ensure the economical and expeditious administration of the foreign debtor estate,c.
section does not implement pure universality,however.the statute expressly directs courts to consider several factors before deferring to the foreign court and granting relief in support of foreign proceedings 
in determining whether to grant relief under subsection b of this section which includes turnover,the court shall be guided by what will best assure an economical and expeditious administration of such estate,consistent with 
just treatment of all holders of claims against or interests in such estate 
protection of claim holders in the united states against prejudice and inconvenience in the processing of claims in such foreign proceeding 
prevention of preferential or fraudulent dispositions of property of such estate 
distribution of proceeds of such estate substantially in accordance with the order prescribed by this title 
comity and 
if appropriate,the provision of an opportunity for a fresh start for the individual that such foreign proceeding concerns.
the plain language of this provision,repeatedly using the term such estate to direct the bankruptcy courts to focus their analysis on the particular estate in bankruptcy being considered,requires the courts to conduct a balancing of the statutory factors.the house report accompanying the bill that included what later became confirms that t hese guidelines are designed to give the court the maximum flexibility in handling ancillary cases t he court should make the appropriate orders under all of the circumstances of each case,rather than being provided with inflexible rules,at.as the courts have subsequently recognized,by its terms requires an exercise of judicial discretion.see,koreag,at cunard,at in re manning,vesta fire ins.new cap reinsurance.
we therefore review the bankruptcy court analysis of the c factors and its decision to order turnover for abuse of discretion.see in re manning,at finanz ag zurich banco economico,cir noting,in a non proceeding,that w e review a district court decision to extend or deny comity to a foreign proceeding for abuse of discretion.to the extent that our decision turns on questions of statutory interpretation,however,our review is de novo.see koreag,at.in addition,with respect to the grant of partial summary judgment,the posture in which this appeal reaches us,we review de novo whether,viewing the record in the light most favorable to the,here bny,any genuine and disputed issue of material fact underlies the bankruptcy court decision.see in re blackwood,cir.
analysis of the c factors 
the primary dispute on appeal is whether the bankruptcy and district courts properly analyzed the factors under c in deciding whether to grant turnover.although bny contends that c,just treatment of all claim holders,and c,protection of united states claim holders against prejudice and inconvenience,militate against granting turnover,its most forceful argument rests on c,which directs the court to consider whether the distribution of proceeds of the debtor estate in the foreign proceeding would be substantially in accordance with the order prescribed by the united states bankruptcy code.
bny points out that its secured will be subordinated under bahamian law to,among other things the administrative expenses of liquidation.under united states law,by contrast,a secured creditor interest is generally not subject to diminution based on administrative expenses.in re blackwood,at.a bsent an agreement to the contrary,a secured creditor collateral may only be charged under c for administrative expenses,including attorney fees,to the extent these expenses directly benefitted that secured creditor.see also in re flagstaff foodservice,cir.
bny argues that in light of the extent to which the distribution of proceeds of mibl estate in the bahamian proceedings would depart from the order prescribed by the united states bankruptcy code,c bars turnover.bny further argues that the district court erred in treating the principle of comity set forth in c as the conclusive factor outweighing any discrepancy between united states and bahamian law regarding the priority of claims for administrative expenses and secured claims.
the liquidators do not dispute that secured claims are subordinated to administrative expenses under bahamian law.as stated in a declaration by mibl bahamian counsel,under of the bahamas companies act of,the bahamian law governing mibl liquidation proceedings,funds are distributed to secured creditors after the retention of such sums as may be necessary for the costs and expenses of the winding up.the liquidators argue,however,that comity is the most important factor under c and that comity therefore trumps bny claim that it will be materially disadvantaged by the relative priority of its secured claim under bahamian law.the liquidators also cite two cases in which relief under has been granted after a finding that the liquidation laws of the bahamas are in harmony with those of the united states and must be afforded comity.in re culmer,see also in re hackett,bahamian liquidation laws and procedures comport with section c of the bankruptcy code and the principle of equality of distribution.
in assessing these competing arguments,we note at the outset that we are not bound by the decisions affording comity to bahamian bankruptcy proceedings in in re culmer and in re hackett,not only because bankruptcy court decisions are not binding on us,but also because c calls for a exercise of discretion in light of all of the circumstances.see,at t he court must be permitted to make the appropriate orders under all of the circumstances of each case,rather than being provided with inflexible rules.although some of the considerations in determining whether to defer to a certain country bankruptcy proceedings may be constant from case to case,other factors vary.the case at bar,for example,involves an allegedly secured claim in re culmer and in re hackett,by contrast,did not.see also koreag,at holding that comity required turnover pursuant to of unsecured assets held by creditor in aid of swiss bankruptcy proceeding.
we do not quarrel with the view of the liquidators,shared by many courts that comity is the ultimate consideration in determining whether to provide relief under.the purpose of the section is to provide a statutory mechanism through which united states courts may defer to and facilitate foreign insolvency proceedings.as we observed in koreag,the overriding purpose of is to prevent piecemeal distribution of a debtor estate.at see also,at noting,even before comity was added to c as a factor,that p rinciples of international comity and respect for the judgments and laws of other nations underlie.but comity does not,as the liquidators suggest,automatically override the other specified factors.rather,a court function under is to determine whether comity should be extended to the foreign proceeding in light of the other factors.see in re koreag,controle et revision,t he other factors are inherently taken into account when considering comity,vacated on other grounds,cir.the statute plainly provides that the other factors may form the basis for denying relief,and thus denying comity,in some cases 
familiar principles of statutory construction support the rejection of the liquidators argument.were we to conclude that principles of deference categorically outweighed differences in the order of priority accorded various types of creditors,then c would be effectively eliminated from the statute,violating our duty to give effect,if possible,to every clause and word of a statute.united states gitten,cir quoting united states menasche.internal quotation marks omitted.
we therefore disagree with the liquidators premise that this case can be decided by determining,in the abstract,whether comity,as codified in c,is more important than the order of priority for creditors,as set forth in c.we think the proper question to ask is whether c,along with the other factors,requires the court to deny turnover in the circumstances of this particular case,despite the general universality approach favoring extension of comity that is meant to advance and despite its goal of assuring an economical and expeditious administration of foreign estates.c.
the principle of comity has never meant categorical deference to foreign proceedings.it is implicit in the concept that deference should be withheld where appropriate to avoid the violation of the laws,public policies,or rights of the citizens of the united states.see pravin banker assocs.banco popular del peru,cir comity should not be extended when doing so would be contrary to the policies or prejudicial to the interests of the united states victrix salen dry cargo,cir federal courts generally extend comity whenever the foreign court had proper jurisdiction and enforcement does not prejudice the rights of united states citizens or violate domestic public policy.cunard,at comity will be granted if the laws and public policies of the forum state and the rights of its residents will not be violated.in re schimmelpenninck,cir foreign laws must not be repugnant to our laws and policies.
the classic definition of comity was provided by the supreme court more than a century ago 
comity,in the legal sense,is neither a matter of absolute obligation,on the one hand,nor of mere courtesy and good will,upon the other.but it is the recognition which one nation allows within its territory to the legislative,executive,or judicial acts of another nation,having due regard both to international duty and convenience,and to the rights of its own citizens,or of other persons who are under the protection of its laws.
hilton guyot.in this case,of course,c supplants the federal common law comity analysis conducted by courts pursuant to hilton it directs courts instead to use the statutory factors to balance the reasons for and against affording comity.but the statutory factors reflect the considerations that have historically been considered within a court determination whether to afford comity to a proceeding in a foreign nation.in re culmer,at.and application of those factors requires that comity not be extended in some circumstances.
application of c to this case 
the first three factors of c instruct courts to consider refusing deference to the foreign proceeding if such proceeding does not provide for the just treatment of all claimholders if it prejudices or inconveniences american claimholders or if it inadequately protects against the risks of preferential or fraudulent disposition of the estate.see c.we agree with the liquidators and the district and bankruptcy courts that the first three factors present no bar to affording comity to the proceedings in the bahamas.first,c is satisfied because the applicable bahamian law provides for a comprehensive procedure for the orderly and equitable distribution of mibl assets among all of its creditors.treco i,at.second,bahamian law complies with c because it protects claimholders from prejudice and inconvenience in the processing of their claims.id.at.and third,bahamian law prevents preferential and fraudulent dispositions of property and thus satisfies c.see id.at.see also in re hackett,at bahamian liquidation laws and procedures comport with section c of the bankruptcy code and the principle of equality of distribution.in re culmer,at holding that bahamian law satisfies c.there being no reason to doubt that the insolvency proceeding in the bahamas will be fair,impartial,procedurally sound,and free from fraud,there is no question that comity would be extended and the turnover order issued if our scrutiny of bahamian bankruptcy law were limited to these considerations.
but congress,by including subsection in c,has directed the courts to look beyond these macro systemic concepts.collier on bankruptcy b at.section c represents a legislative choice to require courts to consider differences between american priority rules and those applicable to the foreign proceeding in determining whether affording comity will be repugnant to american public policies.
in assessing the impact of c here,we begin by recognizing that the priority rules of a foreign jurisdiction need not be identical to those of the united states.see in re schimmelpenninck,at interpool,certain freights of the venture star,in re axona int l credit commerce,in re culmer,at.the plain language of c directs the court to consider whether the priority rules are substantially in accordance with united states law.emphasis added.because the same foreign priority rules may be substantially in accordance with united states law as applied in some circumstances but not as applied in others,a comparison of the priority rules can not be conducted in the abstract.a court must consider the effect of the difference in the law on the creditor in light of the particular facts presented.an unsecured creditor could not,for example,oppose turnover on the ground that the foreign jurisdiction treats secured claims dramatically less favorably than does united states law.
the district court relied on the abstract observation that bahamian law recognizes a distinction between secured and unsecured claims.but that distinction does not change the fact that united states law and bahamian law treat administrative expenses difference that would apparently have a substantial impact on bny claim.the district court acknowledged that the prioritization of administrative expenses over secured claims ultimately may be detrimental to the interests of a secured claimant under bahamian law,treco ii,at,but found that this factor was not sufficient to render turnover inconsistent with c,id.at.we disagree.the difference in prioritization under and bahamian law is particularly acute in this case because of the strong possibility that mibl estate will have little or no funds after payment of administrative expenses.the liquidators testified in depositions that as of may they had collected approximately million in receivables,but only million remained in the estate because nearly million had been used to pay administrative expenses.such expenses consisted of the liquidators a premium rate fifty percent above their usual staff fees,their attorneys fees,and travel and other expenses.what is more,these payments are apparently disbursed as a matter of bureaucratic routine by the registrar without notice to creditors,rather than pursuant to the approval of a judge.meanwhile,no money has yet been paid to creditors.
the liquidators were unable to estimate when there would be distribution to creditors,how much creditors would receive,or when the mibl bankruptcy proceeding would conclude.it is clear,however,that as of may the liquidators fees will continue depleting the estate because only thirty percent of the approximately million in claims against the estate had been resolved,admitted or rejected.viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to bny,it appears probable that bny would recover only a fraction,if any,of the it holds as a secured creditor if it were ordered to turn over those funds.this is in stark contrast to american law,which would diminish bny claim only by those administrative expenses that directly benefitted bny.blackwood,at.as far as we can tell,then,the distribution of proceeds of mibl estate in the bahamian proceedings would thus not be substantially in accordance with the order prescribed by united states law.c.
one consideration that informs our analysis of c and weighs against turnover is the special protected status that secured creditors enjoy under united states law see collier on bankruptcy at as a general matter,the code recognizes and prescribes a number of special rights and protections for the holders of secured claims.indeed,security interests have been recognized as property rights protected by our constitution prohibition against takings without just compensation.see const.amend.v united states security indus.bank,d louisville joint stock land bank radford.id.at.t he position of a secured creditor,who has rights in the specific property,differs fundamentally from that of an unsecured creditor,who has none.in re george ruggiere,cir.we do not mean to suggest that turnover under of property subject to a security interest is an unconstitutional taking,a subject we discuss in part,below.but our observation that security interests enjoy constitutional protection supports our conclusion that united states law affords strong protection to secured creditors and treats those protections very seriously,a conclusion that,in turn,amplifies the significance of the difference in the way secured claims are treated under bahamian law.
the liquidators cite no we are aware of turnover of assets under from a creditor with a secured claim.to the contrary,several bankruptcy courts have refused to grant relief under where the priority of secured creditors was not recognized under the law of the foreign jurisdiction.see in re hourani,at denying turnover where jordanian law failed,among other things,to distinguish between secured and unsecured claims in re papeleras reunidas,denying relief under because,inter alia,a judgment lien creditor,a secured creditor under united states law,would be treated as an unsecured creditor under spanish law and would therefore receive nothing in the spanish proceeding because there were no funds in the estate for unsecured creditors in re toga,denying turnover and injunctive relief where a judgment lien creditor would be treated as an unsecured creditor under canadian law koreag,at observing that the deprivation of a valid security interest or other benefit of domestic law might render a turnover unfair or otherwise improper dictum cunard,at affirming,in a non proceeding,vacatur of creditor attachment of swedish debtor united states property on the ground of comity,in part because the creditor claim was not secured and that there was therefore no compelling policy reason for a general creditor to receive preference over other creditors.
the bahamian rule that secured creditors do not have priority over administrative expenses threatens to destroy bny claim.we therefore conclude that the bankruptcy court abused its discretion by ordering turnover without first determining that in the discrete context of bny claim against mibl estate,the order of distribution under bahamian law was substantially in accordance with the order prescribed by the united states bankruptcy code 
we pause to underscore what should be clear from the preceding discussion.first,of course,we are not announcing a rule that whenever c is implicated,turnover or other relief should be denied.second,we are not creating a presumption against affording comity to bahamian bankruptcy proceedings.we expect that the analysis required by will in many or most cases support the granting of the requested relief.see,in re hackett,at in re culmer,at.
whether bny claim is secured 
we have thus far assumed that bny claim is secured,an assumption upon which resolution of this case may depend.the bankruptcy court explicitly declined to resolve this question on the theory that even if bny did possess a secured interest,turnover was appropriate under.see treco i,at.the district court appears to have shared this view.see treco ii,at.because this question was not decided by the district court or the bankruptcy court and has not been fully briefed to us on appeal we decline to address it.we remand the case to the district court for resolution of this issue in the first instance.see schonfeld hilliard,cir.
ii.bny other arguments 
bny makes three additional arguments that turnover violates bny rights under the takings clause,that the bankruptcy and district courts improperly failed to preserve bny right of setoff and that turnover would violate a forum selection clause contained in the mibl pledge agreement.because of our disposition of the issue,these alternative arguments are significant only if bny claim is unsecured.
a.the takings clause 
the fifth amendment takings clause prohibits the taking of private property for public use,without just compensation.const.amend.bny asserts that turnover would violate the takings clause by depriving it of adequate protection for the value of its secured claim.the bankruptcy court rejected this argument on the ground that,the section of the bankruptcy code providing for adequate protection of secured claims,does not apply to proceedings.see treco i,at.the district court also rejected this argument on the ground that the value of bny security interest has never been absolute,but has always been limited as provided by the law in effect at the time of the signing of the mibl pledge agreement.treco ii,at.
whatever the merits of bny argument,it is clear that it rests on the premise that bny claim is in fact secured.if the claim is unsecured,it is not property for purposes of the takings clause.see,radford,at.and if bny claim is secured,turnover would be barred under and we would not need to reach the constitutional issue.we therefore decline to address it.see horne coughlin,cir i n addressing a constitutional question whose answer would have no effect on the outcome of the case,we would have violated the fundamental and longstanding principle of judicial restraint that requires courts to avoid reaching constitutional questions in advance of the necessity of deciding them.quoting lyng northwest indian cemetery protective ass n,d alterations in horne.
right of setoff 
bny also argues that turnover is barred by a,which preserves rights of setoff in bankruptcy proceedings.bny contends that by ordering that the pledged funds be paid and turned over to the foreign liquidators,the district court destroyed bny right of offset by taking away from bny the ability to effectuate the offset.appellant br.at.as the supreme court has explained,
the right of setoff also called offset allows entities that owe each other money to apply their mutual debts against each other,thereby avoiding the absurdity of making a pay b when b owes although no federal right of setoff is created by the bankruptcy code,a provides that,with certain exceptions,whatever right of setoff otherwise exists is preserved in bankruptcy.
citizens bank strumpf,d citation omitted.
the bankruptcy court rejected bny argument that its setoff rights bar turnover,concluding,inter alia,that does not apply in ancillary proceedings under.see treco i,at.the district court also rejected bny argument,on the ground that whether bny possesses a right of setoff is an issue that can be determined in the bahamian liquidation proceeding.see treco ii,at.neither court decided whether bny actually has a right of setoff and the parties have not addressed this question in their appellate briefs.
we disagree with the district court conclusion.if bny has a right of setoff,then its claim is deem
