plaintiffs baker holdings,and american public automotive group,filed for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code.shortly thereafter,the plaintiffs initiated an adversary proceeding against ernst young llp and charles roach ernst young,asserting various claims.ernst young then objected to provisions of the plaintiffs chapter plan of reorganization,arguing that provisions within the proposed plan would infringe upon ernst young ability to bring an action or assert a defense against third parties in the adversary proceeding.the plaintiffs then modified their proposed plan to ernst young apparent satisfaction,and the bankruptcy court confirmed the plan as modified.as described in both the plan and the plan confirmation order,the bankruptcy court expressly retained jurisdiction for the purpose of a djudication of any pending adversary proceeding,or other controversy or dispute.after the plan confirmation,ernst young filed a motion to dismiss the adversary proceeding or to stay the proceeding pending arbitration based on prior contractual language between the parties.the plaintiffs objected,asserting that in light of their confirmed plan,the bankruptcy court retained jurisdiction to adjudicate the merits of the adversary proceeding.the bankruptcy court agreed,denying ernst young motion,and the district court affirmed.for the reasons stated herein,we affirm.
american public automotive group is a wholly owned subsidiary of baker holdings.together,they employed the services of ernst young from to,working closely with charles roach,a partner at ernst young.in october and again in august,ernst young entered into engagement letters with the plaintiffs.the terms of the engagement letters included a provision that required the parties to resolve any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the services covered by this letter or hereafter provided by ernst young through arbitration.
the plaintiffs filed for civil bankruptcy relief on october.on december,they initiated adversary proceedings against ernst young and charles roach,seeking to avoid and recover fraudulent transfers of property,and to recover damages.in addition to professional misconduct,the plaintiffs alleged that charles roach assisted james,baker holdings former president and chief executive officer,in obtaining a million loan from baker holdings.
on december,the plaintiffs filed a proposed plan of reorganization and ernst young filed an objection to that plan on january.the objection stated that a settlement agreement and release in the plan would limit ernst young ability to bring an action or assert a defense against patrick baker,the sole shareholder of baker holdings and the chairman of the board of directors,or his wife penny.on february,the plaintiffs modified the settlement agreement and release in the plan,excluding ernst young from any limitation in pursuing an action or asserting a defense against the bakers.the modification apparently satisfied ernst young,as they withdrew their objection to the plan.the plan was then confirmed on february,by the bankruptcy court.
under the terms of both the plan and the confirmation order,the bankruptcy court retained jurisdiction for the purpose of a djudication of any pending adversary proceeding,or other controversy or dispute.on march,ernst young filed a motion to dismiss or stay the adversary proceeding pending arbitration,citing the terms of the engagement letters.the plaintiffs objected.the bankruptcy court denied ernst young motion,and the district court affirmed,finding that arbitration was precluded by the terms of the confirmed plan and that ernst young,in any event,had waived its right to arbitrate.
on appeal,ernst young argues,inter alia,that the district court erred in ruling that confirmation of the plan altered the parties prior arbitration agreement.citing language in the plan and the confirmation order,ernst young claims that the documents merely confirm the bankruptcy court ability to retain control over the case and do not supersede the arbitration provisions of the engagement letters.ernst young also disputes the lower court conclusion that its actions in the bankruptcy proceeding were sufficient to waive its right to arbitrate.ernst young contends that its actions were defensive in nature and therefore should not constitute waiver of the right to proceed in another forum.
ii.analysis 
terms of the plan 
denial of a motion to stay proceedings pending arbitration is reviewed de novo,see adamovic metme,cir.in their engagement letters,the parties provided for arbitration of any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the services covered by this letter or hereafter provided by ernst young.however,the plaintiffs subsequent confirmed plan of reorganization provides that the bankruptcy court retains jurisdiction to adjudicate any pending adversary proceeding,other controversy or dispute.
a confirmed plan of reorganization is in effect a contract between the parties and the terms of the plan describe their rights and obligations.see in re chicago,milwaukee,paul and pacific,cir.ernst young argues that the focus of our analysis should be on the words retains jurisdiction and that the bankruptcy court can satisfy its obligation to retain jurisdiction over the pending adversary proceeding by simply hearing arguments on the motion to compel arbitration or to stay the proceedings.we disagree.the plaintiffs plan expressly provides for the bankruptcy court to retain jurisdiction to adjudicate pending adversary proceedings,controversies,and disputes.while,as the district court explained,the terms of the plan could have called for the bankruptcy court to retain jurisdiction over a dispute while its merits are arbitrated,the terms of this plan specifically called for the bankruptcy court to retain jurisdiction to adjudicate such disputes.see barron law dictionary ed defining adjudication as the determination of a controversy and a pronouncement of a judgment based on evidence presented,implies a final judgment as opposed to a proceeding in which the merits of the cause of action were not reached.consequently,we believe that the bankruptcy court retention of jurisdiction to adjudicate pending adversary proceedings,controversies and disputes should not be read to limit the bankruptcy court jurisdiction to a ruling on ernst young motion to compel arbitration.see merit ins.leatherby ins,cir a motion to stay proceedings and to compel arbitration focuses judicial scrutiny upon the arbitrability of the controversy,not upon the controversy itself it has no effect on the merits themselves.
had ernst young wished to protect its right to arbitrate,it certainly could have done so in the same manner in which it sought to protect its rights against the bakers.see,in re gwi,finding that because the parties expressly adopted arbitration provisions of agreements into a plan of reorganization,the prior arbitration provisions were enforceable and not superceded by generalized language in the confirmed plan conferring jurisdiction on the bankruptcy court.we believe that in this instance,ernst young right to arbitrate is superseded by the terms of the confirmed plan.
waiver of rights of arbitration 
regardless of how we interpret the term adjudication in the plan,ernst young waived any right to arbitrate.the factual determinations that a district court predicates a finding of waiver upon are reviewed for clear error,while the legal question of whether the conduct amounts to waiver is reviewed de novo.see iowa grain brown,cir.reviewing for clear error means that the court of appeals will reverse only if it reaches a firm and definite conviction that the district court made a mistake.see mary medical center of evansville,disco aluminum prods,cir.
a contractual right to arbitrate may be waived expressly or implicitly,and a party that chooses a judicial forum for the resolution of a dispute is presumed to have waived its right to arbitrate.see cabinetree of wisconsin,kraftmaid cabinetry,cir.courts must examine the totality of the circumstances and determine whether based on all the circumstances,the party against whom the waiver is to be
