glenn allen duncan debtor declared bankruptcy after transferring his fee interest in property he used for a home and office property to himself and to his wife so as to create a tenancy by the entirety debtor claimed a homestead exemption,and no objections to his claim were filed.tracy lynne zubrod trustee then recovered the property for the bankruptcy estate by avoiding the transfer as fraudulent.when trustee put the property up for sale,debtor moved for turnover of his homestead exemption proceeds at the conclusion of the sale.
the united states bankruptcy court for the district of wyoming and the bankruptcy appellate panel bap for the tenth circuit ruled in favor of debtor,reasoning that trustee actually recovered only that portion of the property owned by debtor wife.trustee appeals,claiming that debtor is not entitled to the exemption proceeds because he voluntarily transferred the property.our jurisdiction arises under d and fed.b.for the following reasons,we reverse and remand.
debtor is a wyoming attorney.in,he began representing michael gallegos,the personal representative of the estate of castulo gallegos,deceased,to prosecute a wrongful death action.in,he purchased the property and took title solely in his own name,although he paid part of the purchase price by borrowing funds with his fiancee based on her credit rating.after their marriage,the couple resided in the property,and debtor used the property as his law office as well.
debtor filed the wrongful death action on behalf of the gallegos family in.the defendant moved to dismiss,arguing that the complaint was barred by the applicable statute of limitations.the court set a hearing on the motion,but before the date of the hearing,debtor transferred title to the property to himself and his wife as tenants by the entirety.the transfer rendered debtor insolvent.the court dismissed the wrongful death action a few months later based on the defendant argument that it was.
in,michael gallegos sued debtor for professional negligence.the judge entered summary judgment for the gallegos estate and submitted the question of damages to a jury.a jury awarded damages in the amount of on march.debtor filed a voluntary petition for chapter relief on march,prior to the entry of a final judgment in the legal malpractice action.he listed the worth of the property as,with a mortgage against it,leaving approximately equity in the property.he claimed that the property was completely exempt under b b because he and his wife held title as tenants by the entirety he also claimed a homestead exemption under wyoming law no objection was filed within the statutory period for filing objections,and debtor was discharged on june.
trustee filed an adversary proceeding on july,seeking to avoid the transfer as fraudulent and recover the property for the benefit of the estate.the bankruptcy court granted summary judgment in trustee favor on june.when trustee filed a notice of intent to sell the property and sought the court approval for the sale,debtor objected because the notice did not include reference to debtor homestead exemption,and he moved for turnover of the exemption proceeds at the time of the sale.debtor argued that trustee failure to object to his claim for the homestead exemption within the period prescribed by law entitled him to the exemption proceeds after sale of the property.trustee argued that the debtor claim to a homestead exemption was invalid under g because he voluntarily transferred the recovered property.
the property ultimately sold pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court,but the parties agreed to hold approximately in proceeds from the sale pending a decision on debtor motion for turnover.on june,the bankruptcy court ruled that debtor was not prevented by g from claiming his homestead exemption.the bankruptcy court reasoned 
debtor ownership and other rights in the property,including the right to possession and occupancy,were rights which were never transferred.those interests became property of the estate at filing.construing the exemption laws in the debtor favor,the court concludes the transfer avoided by the trustee did not include the rights of ownership and possession to which the homestead exemption attaches,interests in property debtor enjoyed on the date he filed the bankruptcy petition.the homestead exemption is valid on those rights.
appellant appendix.at.the bankruptcy court also mentioned trustee failure to object to the exemption claim under fed.b as a possible alternative basis for its ruling.the order required trustee to disburse the homestead exemption proceeds in the amount of to debtor.
trustee timely appealed to the bap,and the bap affirmed on january.zubrod duncan in re duncan,cir.bap.the bap rationale for its decision was that debtor and his wife each held a separate,undivided interest in the property,and debtor interest passed to the estate when he filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter.according to the bap,the judgment avoiding the transfer resulted in a recovery of property from debtor from debtor.thus,section g was not applicable to the exemption claimed by debtor.trustee timely appealed to this court.
we review the bap decision de novo because t here are no factual disputes and the issues on appeal pertain to the proper application of bankruptcy statutes and interpretation of case law in re albrecht,cir see also in re annis,cir.in this review,we independently review the bankruptcy court decision.in re albrecht,at.further,s ince there is no federal law of property,it is necessary to look to state law to determine the nature,extent,and effect of the debtor interest in a tenancy by the entirety in re anselmi,citations omitted.in particular,bankruptcy courts must resort to state law for interpretation of state exemption rights in homesteads.in re barnhart,
the parties initially framed the issue in terms of whether the debtor claim to a homestead exemption was invalid notwithstanding the trustee failure to object within the statutory period of fed.b.first the bankruptcy court,and then the bap,rephrased the issue in terms of whether the homestead exemption was valid notwithstanding the avoided transfer.in so doing,the bankruptcy court and the bap shifted the focus of the inquiry to the character of the property transferred.
the statutory provision at the center of this controversy is section g of the bankruptcy code,which provides as follows 
g notwithstanding sections and of this title the debtor may exempt under subsection b of this section property that the trustee recovers under sections c,or of this title,to the extent that the debtor could have exempted such property under subsection b of this section if such property had not been transferred,if 
a such transfer was not a voluntary transfer of such property by the debtor and 
b the debtor did not conceal such property 
the plain language of section g provides that a debtor can not assert any exemption in property a trustee recovers after the debtor voluntary transfer of the property.redmond tuttle,cir.the term transfer is broadly defined.id.at.to avoid the import of redmond,the bankruptcy court and bap focused on the term recovers.in their analysis of what the trustee recovered,however,they semantically negated the effect of the debtor transfer.
in particular,the bap emphasis on the phrase property that the trustee recovers in section g led to its ultimate conclusion that the section was inapplicable.the bap reasoned that the trustee recovered only the interest in the property held by the debtor wife because the debtor undivided interest in the property passed to the estate when he filed for bankruptcy,and his wife continued to hold a separate,undivided interest in the property.the bap repeated use of the oxymoronic phrase separate,undivided interest is unfortunate because,while each tenant by the entirety may have separate rights in entirety property,it is clear that,under wyoming law,they do not have separate interests in the property.see talbot united states,peters dona.this distinction is critical to the debtor right to claim an exemption.
relying on in re ford,for the general proposition that a debtor interest in property as a tenant by the entirety is property of the estate,the bap disregarded the ford court specific remarks explaining that the unities of time,title,identity of interest,and possession necessary to preserve the estate by the entireties,was not severed when the debtor interest passed to the estate.the court observed 
the trustee merely obtains and retains custody of the debtor undivided interest consisting of the same unities,intact and unaltered as they existed immediately prior to the filing of the petition,until such time as that interest,still intact and unaltered,is exempted from the estate under b b,provided such exemption is available and properly taken by the debtor.
the ford decision did not address a situation in which fraudulent conduct is involved.the court generally recognized that a debtor is entitled to convert property into exempt property up until the filing of the bankruptcy petition,and that this practice is not fraudulent per se.id.at.however,when the conversion is intended to defeat the interests of creditors,such exemptions may be denied to the extent of any fraudulent conduct.in re elliott.in this matter,the bap ignored the effect of the debtor fraudulent,voluntary transfer on his right to claim any exemption in the property,whether or not his interest could be characterized as separate,yet undivided.the bap thus erred in finding section g inapplicable.
the two wyoming decisions,in re wenande,and in re anselmi,cited by the bap as supportive of the ford general proposition,do not support the bap overall analysis.wenande concluded that entireties property which was not exempt could be used to satisfy all of a creditor claims,including claims against only one of two joint debtors.at.in so holding,the wenande court cited to anselmi for the proposition that a wyoming debtor may exempt property held as tenants by the entireties.id.at.bankruptcy courts and appellate courts have been nearly unanimous in holding that the debtor interest in the entirety property is property of the estate under section a,but o nce all property of the debtor comes into the estate under,the debtor may then exempt certain property under b,including any interest in property held as a tenant by the entirety.in re anselmi,at footnote citations omitted.here,however,the property is subject to execution because it was fraudulently transferred.
absent the bankruptcy court avoidance of the transfer,debtor claimed exemption in all of the property,not just the homestead exemption.if his fraudulent act does not permit him to claim the tenancy by the entirety exemption under section b b,it should not permit him to claim the wyoming homestead exemption.section g precludes either exemption.the decisions of the bankruptcy court and the bap,however,permit the latter but not the former.
debtor,being a wyoming lawyer,presumably knew that property held as a tenancy by the entireties is not subject to execution or other creditor process for the separate debts of one of the spouses.talbot.at quoting colorado bank miles.he transferred the property to himself and his wife during the legal malpractice action,apparently to keep the property beyond the reach of creditors in the event he were found liable.the transfer was deemed fraudulent for that reason.see decision on cross motions for summary judgment.at if debtor had not transferred the property,or if the transfer had been involuntary,he could have claimed the homestead exemption.he can not claim the exemption for a voluntary transfer.
essentially,the bap analysis blurs the distinction between two legal concepts tenancy by the entireties and joint tenancy.under wyoming law,a n estate by the entireties involves the unities of time,title,interest,and possession,as well as the husband and wife unity of ownership.ward terry hensen,emphasis added.this contradicts the assertion by the bankruptcy court that the debtor held the rights of ownership and possession separate from the interests in the property held by his wife.see.at.
debtor transferred his sole rights to ownership and possession of the property to himself and his wife so as to share those rights with his wife.as the trustee argues,these rights can not be unbundled from the bundle of sticks represented by a tenancy in the entirety.see united states craft,d explaining that the common bundles of sticks idiom refers to a collection of individual rights which,in certain combinations,constitute property.the ward terry court explained,
entirety in this connection means indivisibility.the estate is owned not by one but by both as an indivisible entity and has the characteristics of a joint tenancy by reason of the fact that the survivor takes all.but the estates differ in the fact that joint tenants may divide the estate,but tenants by the entirety can not do so except by the joint act of husband and wife.
at.the principles of ward terry have consistently been upheld by the wyoming supreme court and federal courts in wyoming,talbot.at the rule in wyoming is that in an estate by the entireties,the husband and wife together take the whole estate as one person,and neither has a separate estate or interest in the land,but each has the whole estate.quoting peters,at in re anselmi,at quoting ward terry for its emphasis on the unity of interest see also witzel witzel,wambeke hopkin,the bap and bankruptcy court orders undermine this law in wyoming.by virtue of the unity of interest,when the trustee recovered the property,the trustee recovered the interest of the debtor and his wife.
the bap and bankruptcy court orders also undermine the policy underlying section g.as set forth in hitt glass in re glass,cir,aff,cir,t he purpose of section g is to prevent a debtor from claiming an exemption in recovered property which was transferred in a manner giving rise to the trustee avoiding powers,where the transfer was voluntary or where the transfer or property interest was concealed.id.at citation omitted.a debtor should not be afforded any benefit from fraudulent conduct that necessitates additional proceedings for a trustee to secure the assets for the debtor creditors.id.at.debtor injured the creditor with the largest claim on his assets when he failed to file a lawsuit within the applicable statute of limitations.he should not be permitted to cause additional injury by claiming an exemption that would significantly diminish the funds from which that creditor may obtain some measure of relief.
the trustee argues that affirming the bap order would create an incentive for a debtor to fraudulently transfer property to a tenancy by the entirety because the property could be entirely exempt from creditor claims if the trustee fails to bring an avoidance action,and the debtor will be no worse off if the trustee manages to avoid the transfer.the trustee also points out that affirmance could have other adverse implications because section g embraces all recoveries under sections c,which incorporates sections,b and a,and of the bankruptcy code.in essence,affirmance would encourage debtors to transfer to others the rights in their property that have economic value to their creditors,while retaining limited interests,and thus open the floodgates to further litigation.
we find these policy arguments particularly strong.the orders of the bap and the bankruptcy court foster the general policy of giving a debtor an unencumbered fresh start.however,the opportunity for a fresh start is available only to the honest debtor.see grogan garner,d village of san jose mcwilliams,cir in re glass,at schieffler beshears in re beshears.section g is applicable to the homestead exemption claimed by debtor.he is not entitled to the exemption proceeds.
the bankruptcy court stated that a lternative grounds may be in the debtor favor as well,in reference to the trustee failure to object to the homestead exemption under fed.b but the opinion did not rest on that ground.at.the bap also mentioned the trustee failure to object but did not rely on that failure as a basis for its affirmation.the bap specifically stated we are not holding that the trustee objection to the debtor exemption
