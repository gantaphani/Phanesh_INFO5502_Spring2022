opinion of the court 
introduction 
this is an appeal from an order of the district court,which set aside an order of the bankruptcy court authorizing a creditors committee the committee to sue on the estate behalf to avoid a fraudulent transfer in a chapter proceeding.before seeking derivative standing,the committee had unsuccessfully petitioned the to pursue the avoidance claim.in granting derivative standing,the bankruptcy court determined that such a suit would be in the estate best interest.the question on appeal is whether the decision of the united states supreme court in hartford underwriters ins.union planters bank,d,a chapter case which interpreted the text of c to foreclose anyone other than a trustee from seeking to recover administrative costs on its own behalf,operates to prevent the bankruptcy court from authorizing the suit described above.
we conclude that it does not.while the question in hartford underwriters was one of a nontrustee right unilaterally to circumvent the code remedial scheme,the issue before us today concerns a bankruptcy court equitable power to craft a remedy when the code envisioned scheme breaks down.we believe that sections b,c,and b b of the bankruptcy code evince congress approval of derivative avoidance actions by creditors committees,and that bankruptcy courts equitable powers enable them to authorize such suits as a remedy in cases where a unreasonably refuses to pursue an avoidance claim.our conclusion is consistent with the received wisdom that n early all courts considering the issue have permitted creditors committees to bring actions in the name of the debtor in possession if the committee is able to establish that a debtor is neglecting its fiduciary duty.collier on bankruptcy a ed.
accordingly,we will reverse the judgment of the district court and remit the case to the original panel so that it may consider the other grounds for the district court reversal of the bankruptcy court order,which were not argued before the en banc court.
ii.facts and procedural history 
scott chinery founded research corporation in,with chinery as its sole shareholder,marketed nutritional food supplements for bodybuilding and weight loss under the brand name cybergenics.in,lincolnshire management,lincolnshire initiated negotiations with chinery to buy,and the parties reached an agreement for an aggregate consideration of approximately million lincolnshire established cybergenics acquisition,an equity investment affiliate,which later became cybergenics corporation cybergenics,to acquire substantially all of assets.lincolnshire equity investment affiliate provided the largest equity stake and became the majority shareholder in cybergenics,although several banks and various other lenders the lenders helped to finance the asset purchase.these financiers also agreed to provide working capital for cybergenics after the acquisition.the buyout was memorialized in a writing dated october.
cybergenics financial outlook soon worsened.despite increased equity investments by lincolnshire and the lenders,in august,cybergenics filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code.as is customary in chapter reorganizations,the bankruptcy court allowed cybergenics to remain in control of its assets as a,so that no bankruptcy trustee was appointed.as is also customary,the united states trustee appointed a creditors committee the committee to represent the interests of cybergenics unsecured creditors.
although the traditional chapter case involves a business reorganization rather than a liquidation,cybergenics soon determined that its situation was unsalvageable,and it chose to sell its assets through a auction.at the auction,a third party successfully bid million for all of cybergenics assets,and the bankruptcy court approved the sale in october.cybergenics then moved to dismiss the bankruptcy case,but the committee objected,asserting that certain transactions relating to the leveraged buyout could give rise to substantial fraudulent transfer actions and that a has a fiduciary duty to maximize the value of the estate.
in june,cybergenics notified the bankruptcy court that it would not pursue any fraudulent transfer claims,arguing that the probability of recovery was sufficiently low that the costs of litigation would likely outweigh any benefits.the committee responded by volunteering to bear all of the costs so that the avoidance action would go forward,but when cybergenics still refused to pursue the claims,the committee sought leave from the bankruptcy court to bring a derivative action to avoid the transfers for the benefit of the estate.after a hearing,the bankruptcy court concluded that the fraudulent transfer claims were colorable and that cybergenics refusal to prosecute them was unreasonable given the committee offer to bear the litigation costs.it therefore authorized the committee to proceed derivatively.the committee filed its complaint in march under b,seeking to avoid fraudulent transfers to the lenders,lincolnshire,l s,and chinery.
the defendants filed motions to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b,arguing,inter alia,that the fraudulent transfer claims that the committee asserted had been sold in the bankruptcy asset sale.the district court granted the defendants motions and dismissed the committee complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.it held that the fraudulent transfer claims were assets of the debtor,and that because the bankruptcy asset sale disposed of all of cybergenics assets,the claims were no longer property of the bankruptcy estate,so the committee could not raise them on the estate behalf.on appeal,we reversed and remanded,holding that while sections and combine to give a debtor the power to pursue these remedies normally reserved for creditors,these causes of action are not assets of the debtor,and therefore were not transferred in a sale of the debtor assets.in re cybergenics,cir.
on remand,the defendants again moved to dismiss.they raised several grounds for dismissal that they had asserted in their previous motions to dismiss and that we had declined to reach in cybergenics.at.they also argued for the first time that,while fraudulent transfer claims technically belong to creditors,b states only that the trustee may avoid fraudulent does not mention creditors committees.they further argued that pursuant to the supreme court reasoning in hartford underwriters ins.union planters bank,d interpreting the trustee may in c of the bankruptcy code to exclude all parties except the trustee,b grant of standing is exclusive and does not extend to creditors committees.
on october,the district court granted the defendants renewed motions to dismiss and held that the committee could not bring suit under b.it concluded that the supreme court interpretation of the trustee may in hartford underwriters governed the meaning of the same language in b.in so doing,it rejected the committee argument that the holding in hartford underwriters did not extend to analysis of derivative standing,even though the supreme court had explicitly noted that derivative standing was not at stake in that case.see hartford underwriters,at.whatever the validity of derivative standing,it has no analogous application here petitioner asserted an independent right to use c,which is what we reject today.the district court also provided several alternative grounds for dismissal 
the committee timely appealed,and in an opinion dated september,a panel of this court affirmed the district court holding that b did not authorize derivative standing for creditors committees to sue to avoid allegedly fraudulent transfers.official committee of unsecured creditors of cybergenics corporation chinery,cir.the panel analysis did not reach the district court alternate grounds for dismissal,as those rationales assumed the existence of derivative standing.
on november,we granted the committee timely motion for rehearing en banc and accordingly vacated the panel decision.we have since accepted extensive supplemental briefing,including a number of amicus briefs,and heard oral argument by the parties and amicus curiae.
iii.how does hartford underwriters affect this case 
the district court conclusion that the code does not permit creditors committees derivatively to prosecute fraudulent transfer claims was grounded in its determination that the language in b vests exclusive standing in the trustee.section b states that 
except as provided in paragraph,the trustee may avoid any transfer of an interest of the debtor in property or any obligation incurred by the debtor that is voidable under applicable law by a creditor holding an unsecured claim that is allowable under section of this title or that is not allowable only under section e of this title.
b emphasis added.the district court determination of exclusivity relied critically on hartford underwriters,d,in which the supreme court determined that identical language in c of the code foreclosed the right of any nontrustee to prosecute that particular action.the district court concluded that there is no principled basis under which the court can apply different meanings to the words the trustee may in separate sections of the code,so it considered hartford underwriters dispositive.
a.what happened in hartford underwriters 
in hartford underwriters,debtor hen house interstate,obtained workers compensation insurance from petitioner hartford underwriters as part of its chapter reorganization strategy.although hen house repeatedly failed to pay its monthly premiums,hartford,which knew nothing of hen house bankruptcy,continued to provide insurance.when the reorganization attempt fell through,hen house converted its case to a chapter liquidation and a trustee was appointed.hartford,alerted to the bankruptcy,sought to recover approximately in overdue premiums from the bankruptcy estate but found it almost entirely without unencumbered assets.
section b a of the bankruptcy code provides that the actual,necessary costs and expenses of preserving the estate are treated as administrative expenses,and a provides that such administrative expenses are entitled to priority over unsecured claims.hartford and hen house agreed that the overdue premiums constituted administrative expenses,but hartford was nevertheless stymied,for virtually all of hen house assets were held by secured creditors,whose claims are superior to administrative claims.see.hartford then looked to c,which provides an important exception to that priority.it states that t he trustee may recover from property securing an allowed secured claim the reasonable,necessary costs and expenses of preserving,or disposing of,such property to the extent of any benefit to the holder of such claim.c emphasis added.hartford argued that this provision entitled it to recover the premiums even though it was an administrative claimant rather than a trustee.the bankruptcy court ruled in favor of hartford,and the district court and an eighth circuit panel affirmed.in re hen house interstate,cir.the panel decision was subsequently vacated,and the eighth circuit,sitting en banc,held c unavailable to an administrative claimant like hartford.cir en banc.
a unanimous supreme court affirmed the en banc decision.it began with the understanding that congress says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there,hartford underwriters,at.quoting connecticut nat.bank germain,d,and reiterated the longstanding maxim that,when the statute language is plain,the sole function of the least where the disposition required by the text is not to enforce it according to its terms.id.citations omitted.turning to c,the court found that it appears quite plain ly to mean that only the trustee may recover administrative expenses ahead of secured claims.id.although it acknowledged that the statute does not expressly bar from recovery,it had little difficulty in inferring that exclusivity is intended.id.
the court first rationale was contextual.a bankruptcy trustee role in chapter liquidation proceedings is central by design,and this unique role makes it entirely plausible that congress would provide a power to him and not to others.id.at.the court further reasoned that,had no particular parties been specified in c,the trustee is the most obvious party who would have been thought empowered to use the provision.id.the court therefore found little reason to doubt the maxim that a situation in which a statute authorizes specific action and designates a particular party empowered to take it is surely among the least appropriate in which to presume nonexclusivity.id.citing singer,sutherland on statutory construction,ed.buttressing this conclusion was the logic that,had congress intended the provision to be broadly available,it could simply have said so,as it did in describing the parties who could act under other sections of the code.id.
having determined from its textual inquiry that by far the most natural reading of c is that it extends only to the trustee,the court declared that hartford burden of persuading us that the section must be read to allow its use by other parties is exceptionally heavy.id.at quoting patterson shumate,d.it then turned to hartford arguments based on practice and policy considerations.regarding practice,the court found that section c provision for the charge of certain administrative expenses against lienholders continued a practice that existed under the bankruptcy act of.id.citations omitted.even then,however,i t was the norm that recovery of costs from a secured creditor would be sought by the trustee,rather than by an administrative claimant.id.citations omitted.still,hartford cited a number of lower court cases in meaningful discussion of the other than the trustee were permitted to pursue such charges under the act of,sometimes simultaneously with the trustee pursuit of his own expenses,id.citing cases,and the court recognized that some of its early decisions had allowed individual claimants to seek recovery from secured assets.see,louisville,wilson.
the court nevertheless concluded that i t is questionable whether these precedents establish a bankruptcy practice sufficiently widespread and well recognized to justify the conclusion of implicit adoption by the code.we have no confidence that the allowance of recovery from collateral by nontrustees is the type of rule that congress was aware of when enacting the code.id.quoting united states ron pair enterprises,d.kelly robinson,d giving weight to practice that was widely accepted and established.indeed,the court strongly implied that even a more convincing historical showing would not have carried the day for hartford where the meaning of the bankruptcy code text is itself clear its operation is unimpeded by contrary prior practice in this case,we think the language of the code leaves no room for clarification by practice,for it can not transform c reference to the trustee to the trustee and other parties in interest.id.at.citations omitted.
finally,the court engaged hartford contention that its interpretation was necessary as a matter of public policy.hartford argued that in some cases the trustee may lack an incentive to pursue payment for administrative expenses,so that if the code is to encourage such lenders to finance a corporation administrative needs throughout its bankruptcy,it must allow those lenders later to bring their own actions to recover their investments.hartford also suggested that affording standing to administrative claimants might encourage the provision of services to debtors on more favorable terms,since such claimants would presumably always be willing vigorously to defend their financial interests whereas a trustee might be more reluctant.id.at.the court,however,determined that it is far from clear that the policy implications favor petitioner position,and even suggested that hartford interpretation might itself lead to results that seem undesirable as a matter of policy.id.at.it ultimately declined to weigh the competing concerns,explaining that we do not sit to assess the relative merits of different approaches to bankruptcy problems.it suffices that the natural reading of the text produces the result we announce.achieving a better policy what petitioner urges is a task for congress,not the courts.id.at.
b.did hartford underwriters take place in an analogous context 
based on the above reasoning,the hartford underwriters court interpreted the trustee may in c to mean that only the trustee may bring an action.in the case at bar,the district court concluded that,faced with the same language in b,the same conclusion must there obtain.but the hartford underwriters court expressly reserved the question before us today.in a footnote critical to understanding the scope of that decision,the supreme court stated 
we do not address whether a bankruptcy court can allow other interested parties to act in the trustee stead in pursuing recovery under c.amici american insurance association and national union fire insurance draw our attention to the practice of some courts of allowing creditors or creditors committees a derivative right to bring avoidance actions when the trustee refuses to do so,even though the applicable code provisions,see,b,a,a,mention only the trustee.see,in re gibson group,cir.whatever the validity of that practice,it has no analogous application here,since petitioner did not ask the trustee to pursue payment under c and did not seek permission from the bankruptcy court to take such action in the trustee stead.petitioner asserted an independent right to use c,which is what we reject today.
id.at.the district court nevertheless concluded that the committee failed sufficiently to distinguish hartford underwriters s method of interpretation,which it found to yield equally compelling results when applied to b.
we agree that hartford underwriters is most useful for the interpretive methodology it offers,but it is critical to note the context in which that decision arose,for it is materially unlike the one before us today.the petitioner in hartford underwriters was an insurer who,by continuing coverage despite hen house failure to pay its premiums,became an administrative lender with claims subordinate to those of the secured creditors.when it learned of hen house bankruptcy,it attempted to use c to recover the premiums it was owed,but it did so in a strikingly unilateral fashion.the insurance premiums were not costs incurred by the trustee that,if recovered,would have yielded a common benefit.instead,they would have satisfied only hartford outstanding claim.nor did hartford seek the court or the trustee permission to recoup the expense,but rather it sued in its own name and for its own direct benefit.
the situation at bar is markedly different.when the committee discovered that certain transfers made by cybergenics were potentially avoidable as fraudulent,it first petitioned the cybergenics management to file an avoidance action under b but management refused to file that action,claiming that the costs would likely outweigh the benefits,and it maintained this position even after the committee volunteered to bear all litigation costs.the committee,finding management stance unreasonable,petitioned the bankruptcy court for permission to prosecute a b avoidance action in cybergenics name and on its recovery would go not to the committee,but to the estate itself.the bankruptcy court concluded that the fraud claims were colorable,and that the committee offer to bear the litigation costs insulated the estate from risk.noting that the has a duty to maximize the value of the estate,the court concluded that management refusal to act was unreasonable even given the usual judicial deference to business judgment,and it authorized the committee to sue in cybergenics name.
this difference in contexts is crucially important,for while the question in hartford underwriters was one of a nontrustee right unilaterally to circumvent the code remedial scheme,the issue before us today concerns a bankruptcy court equitable power to craft a remedy when the code envisioned scheme breaks down.with this perspective in mind,we turn to the question whether derivative suits may be maintained under b after hartford underwriters.
iv.do derivative suits under b survive hartford underwriters 
a.the code itself 
as did the court in hartford underwriters,we begin with the understanding that congress says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.hartford underwriters,at.quoting connecticut nat,at.when the statute language is plain,the sole function of the least where the disposition required by the text is not to enforce it according to its terms.id.citations omitted.chinery and lincolnshire lincolnshire contend that,as the same language is used in b and c,there is a presumption that it means the same thing in each instance undoubtedly,there is a natural presumption that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning.atlantic cleaners dyers,united states.that presumption may be overcome only when there is such variation in the connection in which the words are used as reasonably to warrant the conclusion that they were employed in different parts of the act with different intent.id.lincolnshire therefore submits that the committee burden of persuading us that the section must be read to allow its use by other parties is exceptionally heavy.hartford underwriters,at.citation omitted.
the committee does not dispute this concedes that,as in hartford underwriters,the trustee may can not be read to mean the trustee and other parties in interest may.but it submits that this point is neither here nor there,for it does not seek to use b in that sense.in its estimation,b is important only insofar as it does not preclude the bankruptcy court from authorizing the committee to sue derivatively when the trustee,the party explicitly empowered to use b,improperly refuses to exercise its power.of course,even under this view we must determine whether such an equitable remedy is consistent with the bankruptcy code statutory scheme,of which b is a part.we are satisfied that it is.
the need to interpret chapter as a whole 
as the supreme court has often noted,s tatutory construction is a holistic endeavor,united savings of timbers of inwood forest associates,d,and this is especially true of the bankruptcy code.in kelly robinson,a case interpreting,the court stated that we must not be guided by a single sentence or member of a sentence,but look to the provisions of the whole law,and to its object and policy,d citations omitted.the hartford underwriters court interpreted the code holistically in determining that the trustee may in c is exclusive,but in that case,there was no whole law to interpret,for c is effectively.this is evident in two ways.first,there is no other provision in chapter of the code that even arguably authorizes a party to recover administrative expenses from property securing an allowed secured claim,so the court saw no need to look beyond c to understand the mechanics of the cause of action.second,the court concluded that the fact that the sole party a unique role in bankruptcy proceedings makes it entirely plausible that congress would provide a power to him and not to others.hartford underwriters,at.it therefore saw no reason to look beyond c to determine standing to bring that cause of action.
in contrast,reading b in isolation leads immediately to incoherence.while,as the court explained,the trustee serves a unique role in chapter,nothing could be further from the truth in chapter,where trustees rarely exist.see in re sharon steel,cir it is settled that appointment of a trustee should be the exception,rather than the rule.collier on bankruptcy ed.noting that appointment of a trustee in a chapter case is an extraordinary remedy.reading b alone would lead to the fatuous conclusion that congress vested its cause of action exclusively in a party that usually does not exist.only by looking beyond c can one make sense of this situation,in that a gives a chapter here,cybergenics the rights and powers of a trustee in the event that no trustee is appointed.
it is therefore clear that b must be viewed as merely a part,albeit an important part,of the chapter framework that is designed to help debtors reorganize while continuing as viable concerns the committee submits that,just as one must read a in conjunction with b to understand who the trustee is for b purposes,one must consider three other chapter sections b,c,and b b to determine whether derivative standing is a permissible equitable remedy in cases where the court determines that the trustee has unreasonably refused to bring an avoidance claim under b.these sections shed light on the role congress intended creditors committees to play in the reorganization process,and we will examine each in turn.
section b provides that 
a party in interest,including the debtor,the trustee,a creditor committee,an equity security holder committee,a creditor,an equity security holder,or any indenture trustee,may raise and may appear and be heard on any issue in a case under chapter.
b emphasis added.the committee submits that,a lthough would not provide an independent right for the committee to initiate a suit,absent bankruptcy court approval,it does support the authority of bankruptcy courts to permit creditors committees to bring claims on behalf of the debtor in possession for the benefit of the estate.committee reply brief at.there is precedent for this view.collier explains that,consistent with the broad right of participation conferred by b,the court may authorize a party in interest to commence litigation on behalf of the estate if certain conditions are satisfied.collier on bankruptcy citing fogel zell,cir if a trustee unjustifiably refuses a demand to bring an action to enforce a colorable claim of a creditor,the creditor may obtain the permission of the bankruptcy court to bring the action in place of,and in the name of,the trustee.
lincolnshire contends that,whatever the theoretical appeal of this position,it does not survive hartford underwriters,where hartford argued that b evidences the right of a nontrustee to recover under c.hartford underwriters,at.while noting that b was by its terms inapplicable because it applied only to chapter reorganizations,and the debtor had previously converted its case to chapter,the court nonetheless stated in dictum that we do not read b general provision of a right to be heard as broadly allowing a creditor to pursue substantive remedies that other code provisions make available only to other specific parties.id.king,collier on bankruptcy ed.in general,section does not bestow any right to usurp the trustee role as representative of the estate with respect to the initiation of certain types of litigation that belong exclusively to the estate.in lincolnshire view,b allows a committee to intervene in an adversary proceeding initiated by a trustee,but it does not allow a committee to initiate or prosecute an action independent of the trustee.
the committee responds that b must mean something more than a right to intervene,for a general right to be heard would be an empty grant unless those who had such right were allowed to act when those who should act did not.committee brief at quoting collier on bankruptcy ed.it submits that we should not give great weight to the supreme court interpretation in dictum of a provision that the court itself noted was by its terms inapplicable,especially since the committee here does not assert an independent right of the sort the hartford underwriters court considered.
although the committee is doubtless correct that the supreme court dicta are not binding on us,we do not view it lightly.as we have stated 
w e should not idly ignore considered statements the supreme court makes in dicta.the supreme court uses dicta to help control and influence the many issues it can not decide because of its limited docket.appellate courts that dismiss these expressions in dicta and strike off on their own increase the disparity among tribunals for other judges are likely to follow the supreme court marching orders and frustrate the evenhanded administration of justice by giving litigants an outcome other than the one the supreme court would be likely to reach were the case heard there.
in re mcdonald,cir brackets in original quoting united states bloom,cir.nevertheless,we are satisfied that the case at bar is not the situation the court dictum anticipated.the court clear concern was that a party might use b to usurp the trustee role as representative of the estate,hartford underwriters,at,thus defeating congress intention that the trustee act as a gatekeeper,weighing the potential benefits of litigation against the costs it might incur.no risk of usurpation exists here,for the committee took no unsanctioned action.instead,it petitioned the bankruptcy court for permission to sue in the estate name,and that court conferred such authority only after it determined that the debtor was neglecting its statutory duty to act in the estate interest.this exercise of judicial power does not implicate the usurpation concerns expressed in hartford underwriters.yet it is precisely because the issue at bar involves judicial power that b can not,alone,provide a definitive resolution.read fairly,b addresses only a committee direct rights it says nothing whatever about a court power to allow derivative standing to remedy a violation of those rights.
section b is helpful to the committee insofar as it evinces congress intent for creditors committees to play a vibrant and central role in chapter adversarial proceedings.amicus eric brunstad offers an etymological perspective on that intent.section b derives from section of the former bankruptcy act,and former chapter x rule a.see in re amatex,cir.these two provisions were designed to broaden creditor participation in reorganization proceedings in order to remedy the deficiencies of prior procedures,which were deemed to be unduly restrictive.see in re marin motor oil,cir.significantly,however,b is broader than either of those they authorized creditors to be heard on all matters,neither authorized creditors to raise issues.given our conclusion infra that derivative standing for creditors committees was common in the days of section and chapter x rule a,it would be odd to conclude that congress abolished derivative standing at the same time as it broadened committees adversarial role through b.
the committee next turns for support to section c,which states a committee appointed under section of this title may perform such other services as are in the interest of those represented.c.because the bankruptcy court found that the assertion of fraudulent transfer claims would benefit the estate,the committee submits that it should be able to represent the estate for the purpose of prosecuting those claims.
lincolnshire has several responses.it first represents that the committee interpretation of c would amount to a power for the committee to do whatever it considers to be in the estate interest,a role that would eviscerate the role as gatekeeper.it next notes that the powers granted to committees in c are very specific,including the power to consult with the debtor concerning the case investigate the debtor acts and financial condition participate in the formulation of a plan and request the appointment of a trustee or examiner.linconshire suggests that interpreting the c provision to allow committees to take any action in the debtor interest would render superfluous the specific grants in to,and would also violate the interpretive canon ejusdem generis,which states that where general words follow specific words in a statutory enumeration,the general words are construed to embrace only objects similar in nature to those objects enumerated by the preceding specific words.circuit city stores,adams,d quoting singer,sutherland on statutes and statutory construction.insofar as the grants of power in to are quite narrow and,it concludes,the power should be similarly confined.
we agree that c does not confer the sort of blanket authority necessary for the committee independently to initiate an adversarial proceeding,including one under b.like b,however,c suggests that congress intended for creditors committees to perform services on behalf of the estate,and that congress consciously built a measure of flexibility into the scope of those services.as the question before us today is whether a bankruptcy court can authorize a creditors committee to represent the estate when the usual representative is delinquent,the flexible representation role evidenced in c militates in the affirmative.
section b b 
while sections b and c provide clear evidence that congress envisioned a central role for creditors committees in chapter proceedings,their focus on creditors committees themselves provides at best indirect evidence that congress granted bankruptcy courts the power to confer derivative standing upon those committees.a third code section,however,provides far more direct insight into bankruptcy courts powers.section b b allows for the priority payment of the expenses of a creditor that recovers,after the court approval,for the benefit of the estate any property transferred or concealed by the debtor.b b.brunstad argues that the only explanation for this provision is that it rewards monetarily the practice of permitting creditors,with court authorization,to pursue causes of action on behalf of bankrupt debtors.it would make little sense,he urges,to provide for the reimbursement of a creditor that recovers,if standing to recover is limited exclusively to the interpretation would render b b entirely superfluous.
amicus official committee of unsecured creditors of the committee agrees,and it provides an historical perspective on b b.derivative standing for creditors was recognized judicially as early as.see chatfield,fed,cir james moore et,collier on bankruptcy ed.in,congress allowed for reimbursement for such services by adding section a to the bankruptcy act of 
the debts to have priority,in advance of the payment of dividends to creditors,and to be paid in full out of bankruptcy estates,and the order of payments shall be where the property of the bankrupt,transferred or concealed by him either before or after the filing of the petition,is recovered for the benefit of the estate of the bankrupt by the efforts and at the cost and expense of one or more creditors,the reasonable costs and expenses of such recovery 
a redesignated from in repealed emphasis added.courts interpreted as not only allowing for recovery of expenses incurred while suing derivatively,but also as authorizing derivative standing in the first instance.see,in re eureka upholstering,cir allowing the bankruptcy court to authorize derivative standing under in re stearns salt lumber,fed,cir stating that a trustee could authorize derivative standing under.a creditor ability to sue derivatively was,however,limited by the requirement that a creditor obtain permission either from the trustee or the court before acting,the rationale being that those entities served a salutary gatekeeping function.see,in re eureka,at.
when congress enacted the bankruptcy code in,it made clear its intent for the new b b to continue the policies of a regarding the reimbursement of expenses incurred while recovering property for the benefit of the estate.see doc,cong,pts i and ii,available in collier ed.at app.pt.c explaining that the proposed b b continues the policy of a and allows a creditor to recover expense incurred which actually benefits the estate.the committee submits that the only substantive modification contained in b b is a clarification that only the bankruptcy the bankruptcy authorize derivative suits.committee brief at citing in re godon.
lincolnshire,however,strongly disputes the notion that b b authorizes derivative standing.it observes that f ederal courts have consistently held that b b does not confer standing to creditors to sue on behalf of the bankruptcy estate.lincolnshire response to amici at quoting surf n sun,dempsey,citing cases.lincolnshire instead contends that the provision merely allows the recovery of expenses incurred in actions that a creditor has a direct right to bring.for example,a creditor might assist a debtor in locating assets owed to the estate by conducting a bankruptcy rule examination of a transferee,a step available to any party in interest that obtains court approval.see fed.amicus professor keith sharfman agrees,and offers by way of example the situation where a creditor brings a state law fraudulent transfer claim against a party to whom the debtor had transferred the creditor collateral.he submits that such an action would need the court approval,the grant of a motion to lift the automatic stay that would otherwise block the action from proceeding.see d and f.any surplus value recovered would presumably be for the benefit of the estate,as it would have to be turned over to the estate pursuant to.
lincolnshire also asserts that,even if section does recognize derivative standing,it does not address,even inferentially,the power of a creditors committee.it addresses only the ability of a a creditor,not a creditors committee,to recover certain expenses.congress obviously knew the difference.lincolnshire reply to amici at.for example,in b,discussed at length supra,congress granted the right to appear and be heard to a party in interest,including the debtor,the trustee,a creditors committee,an equity security holders committee,or a creditor.b emphasis added.this contention is not merely semantic,for the supreme court presumes that congress acts intentionally and purposely when it includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another.bfp resolution trust,d.
although lincolnshire arguments are not without force,we conclude that the most natural reading of b b is that it recognizes and rewards monetarily the practice of permitting creditors committees,with court authorization,to pursue derivative actions.we are convinced that the provision is not limited to direct causes of action,for property recovered in a direct action is not recovered for the benefit of the estate.the offered examples are not to the contrary.while a creditors committee may certainly assist a debtor in locating property under bankruptcy rule,that investigative assistance would not implicate b b because the committee would not itself recover the property.more promising is professor sharfman suggestion of a creditor who independently pursues a state law fraud claim and relinquishes to the estate any surplus recovery.yet this hypothetical fails as well,for no surplus recovery is possible.relevant law provides that a transfer or obligation may be avoided only to the extent necessary to satisfy the creditor claim.see uniform laws annotated,uniform fraudulent transfer act uniform laws annotated,uniform fraudulent conveyance act.because an oversecured creditor can not directly recover any property beyond that necessary to satisfy its own claim,it can not recover property for the benefit of the estate unless it sues derivatively.
generalizing from these examples,we can not conceive of a situation in which a creditor has independent standing which would allow it to pursue the recovery of property transferred or concealed by the debtor.in re blount.while it is possible that such a situation exists,we are at all events unwilling to interpret b b as anticipating obscure possibilities when a far more natural interpretation is apparent.especially given the statutory history,we are satisfied that congress intended b b to allow bankruptcy courts to reward derivative suits prosecuted by creditors committees 
of course,that determination does little to help the committee if only individual creditors may bring derivative actions.lincolnshire is correct in its observation that b b speaks only of a creditor that recovers,and says nothing about creditors committees.amicus brunstad submits that this is a mere technicality,for under section of the bankruptcy act,the singular includes the plural.he reasons that,if all of the creditors could simultaneously bring an identical action,there is no reason to disallow the simpler step of allowing a representative committee to bring that same action,especially given the flexible authority in c for committees to perform such other services as are in the interest of those represented.transcript of oral argument at.
to be sure,several code provisions identify both creditors and creditors committees as parties with authority to take action,see,b,and this lends some weight to linconshire suggestion that the absence of committees in b b is meaningful.but we are realists,and we recognize that if we disallow the committee derivative suit but sanction derivative suits by individual creditors,the individual creditors could simply substitute themselves as plaintiffs under fed.civ.proc.a and move forward with litigation.forcing that step would be a,for those individual cases would likely be consolidated into one substantively identical to that at bar.given the flexible role of committees evidenced in c and the code general presumption that the singular means the plural,we are satisfied that the purpose of b b is served by allowing the committee to recover expenses incurred in pursuing a derivative suit.any other result would render that provision superfluous,for absent a judicial power to authorize derivative suits by creditors,it makes no sense to speak of rewarding a creditor who sues,with court permission,to recover property for the benefit of the estate.
a textual conclusion 
for all of the foregoing reasons,we are satisfied that the most natural reading of the code is that congress recognized and approved of derivative standing for creditors committees.sections b and c,taken together,evince a congressional intent for committees to play a robust and flexible role in representing the bankruptcy estate,even in adversarial proceedings.several cases decided after hartford underwriters have concluded that these two sections alone are sufficient to confer upon creditors committees the right to sue derivatively.in in re commodore int l,cir,the second circuit outlined its requirements for derivative standing,stating 
w e hold that a creditors committee may sue on behalf of the debtors,with the approval and supervision of a bankruptcy court,not only where the debtor in possession unreasonably fails to bring suit on its claims,but also where the trustee or the debtor in possession consents.
id.at.lincolnshire submits that commodore has no bearing on the present issue with regard to standing because neither that court nor the lower court even acknowledged the hartford underwriters decision.lincolnshire brief at.the implication is that the second circuit court of appeals,and the parties before it,somehow failed to notice an supreme court decision issued less than a year earlier.we doubt that explanation more plausible is that the second circuit thought hartford underwriters to be irrelevant insofar as it did not address indeed,it eschewed derivative standing.any doubt on that score is erased by the second circuit subsequent decision in term loan holder comm.ozer group,in re caldor,cir.there,the court mentioned hartford underwriters after stating its belief that sections c and b impl y a qualified right for creditors committees to initiate adversary proceedings where the trustee or debtor in possession unjustifiably failed to bring suit.id.at citing in re stn enterprises,cir.the second circuit clearly believes that sections c and b authorize derivative standing even after hartford underwriters.
the seventh circuit reached a similar decision in fogel,at,a underwriters case in which it stated that 
if a trustee unjustifiably refuses a demand to bring an action to enforce a colorable claim of a creditor,the creditor may obtain the permission of the bankruptcy court to bring the action in place of,and in the name of,the trustee in such a suit,the creditor corresponds to the shareholder,and the trustee to management,in a shareholder derivative action.
id.at citations omitted.again,although fogel does not mention hartford underwriters,we doubt that it escaped the court notice.
at all events,after an exhaustive examination of hartford underwriters,we agree with the second and seventh circuits,except insofar as the second circuit in term loan implied that the power to initiate derivative suits flows entirely from sections c and b.we do not read those two sections so broadly,but when they are paired with b b,it becomes unmistakably clear that congress approved of creditors committees suing derivatively to recover property for the benefit of the estate.avoiding fraudulent transfers through b is a perfect application of that function.
yet a piece of the puzzle is missing.the code clearly demonstrates that congress approved of derivative standing,but none of the three sections b,c,or b b seems directly to authorize such standing.section comes closest,but read fairly,that provision merely empowers bankruptcy courts to reimburse creditors committees for the expenses they incur while suing derivatively.it does not authorize derivative actions in the first instance.to be sure,that section would be meaningless unless authority existed,but such reasoning by negative implication is less than satisfying.we believe that the missing link is supplied by bankruptcy courts equitable power to craft flexible remedies in situations where the code causes of action fail to achieve their intended purpose.
bankruptcy courts as courts of equity 
the supreme court has long recognized that bankruptcy courts are equitable tribunals that apply equitable principles in the administration of bankruptcy proceedings.see local loan hunt.c ourts of bankruptcy are essentially courts of equity,and their proceedings inherently proceedings in equity.the enactment of the code in increased the degree of regulation congress imposed upon bankruptcy proceedings,but it did not alter bankruptcy courts fundamental nature.see,at,reprinted in,stating that,under the bankruptcy code,t he bankruptcy court will remain a court of equity citing local loan,at.any lingering doubt on that point is dispelled by a string of supreme court young united states,d b ankruptcy courts are courts of equity and apply the principles and rules of equity jurisprudence.quoting pepper litton.united states energy resources,d b ankruptcy courts,as courts of equity,have broad authority to modify relationships.and by the code itself.see a the court may issue any order,process,or judgment that is necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this title.no provision of this title providing for the raising of an issue by a party in interest shall be construed to preclude the court from,sua sponte,taking any action or making any determination necessary or appropriate to enforce or implement court orders or rules,or to prevent an abuse of process.
the concept of derivative standing arose when,despite a lack of express statutory authorization,courts of equity allowed shareholders to pursue valuable actions when the nominal plaintiff the corporation unreasonably refused to do so.see generally bert prunty,the shareholders derivative suit notes on its derivation,tracing the historical development of derivative suits.in ross bernhard,d,the supreme court explained the utility of derivative standing as a means of providing equitable redress,not only from faithless officers and directors,but also directly from third parties who had damaged or threatened the corporate properties and whom the corporation through its managers refused to pursue.at.it also addressed the doctrine standards,including the requirement that the corporation itself must have refused to proceed after suitable demand,unless excused by extraordinary conditions.at.
we believe that the ability to confer derivative standing upon creditors committees is a straightforward application of bankruptcy courts equitable powers.in b,congress made clear that it intended for the estate to recover property fraudulently transferred by the debtor.the mechanism congress designed to ensure this recovery was to vest in the trustee or the both the power to bring an avoidance action and the duty to bring one if it would likely benefit the estate.see,in re cybergenics,at a paramount duty of a trustee or debtor in possession in a bankruptcy case is to act on behalf of the bankruptcy estate,that is,for the benefit of the creditors.congress clearly envisioned that the trustee or debtor would avoid fraudulent transfers,thus maximizing the value of the estate and allowing creditors to recover their claims from that estate.
the problem at bar is that the intended system broke down.the debtor refused to bring an action that the bankruptcy court found would benefit the estate,and thereby violated its fiduciary duty to maximize the estate value.it is in precisely this situation that bankruptcy courts equitable powers are most valuable,for the courts are able to craft flexible remedies that,while not expressly authorized by the code,effect the result the code was designed to obtain.as the supreme court has noted,e quity eschews mechanical rules it depends on flexibility,holmberg armbrecht,and there is inherent in the courts of equity a jurisdiction to give effect to the policy of the legislature.mitchell robert demario jewelry,d quoting clark smith,pet.
the policy concern evident in b is the need to channel avoidance actions through the trustee,who acts as a gatekeeper and prevents independent avoidance actions by creditors that might prejudice the estate and rival creditors.the supreme court stated as much in hartford underwriters when it expressed concern about parties usurp ing the trustee role as representative of the estate.at.this representative role explains why b allows the trustee,but not a creditors committee,to bring an avoidance action on its own authority,without court permission.but that provision does not foreclose a bankruptcy court equitable power to substitute itself as gatekeeper when the trustee is delinquent,and to allow a creditors committee to pursue an avoidance action for the estate direct benefit rather than its own.the end result of this equitable remedy the estate recovery of fraudulently transferred property is precisely what congress envisioned,and code sections b,c,and b b anticipate the court means of achieving that result.
we are therefore satisfied that the bankruptcy court acted within its power in conferring derivative standing upon the committee.as further evidence that its decision was provident,however,we observe that there is a lengthy history of bankruptcy courts conferring derivative standing in analogous situations.
in hartford underwriters,hartford urged that administrative claimants have a right to bring direct actions under c.as evidence of this power,it cited a string of cases purporting to demonstrate that such actions were common in the years before the bankruptcy code,and noted the supreme court declaration that,w hen congress amends the bankruptcy laws,it does not write on a clean slate.dewsnup timm,d.see cohen de la cruz,d we will not read the bankruptcy code to erode past bankruptcy practice absent a clear indication that congress intended such a departure.citations omitted.see also midlantic national bank new jersey department of environmental protection,d relying on clear practice.after surveying hartford cases,however,the court concluded that 
it is questionable whether these precedents establish a bankruptcy practice sufficiently widespread and well recognized to justify the conclusion of implicit adoption by the code.we have no confidence that the allowance of recovery from collateral by nontrustees is the type of rule that congress was aware of when enacting the code.
hartford underwriters,at.quoting ron pair enterprises,at.it also explained that,at all events,the text of c was so clear as to leave no room for clarification by practice.id.at.
compared to the evidence offered in hartford underwriters,the tradition of allowing courts to confer derivative standing upon creditors is compelling.indeed,it is precisely the sort of practice of which congress would have been aware when drafting the code.of course,as was true in hartford underwriters,even the most compelling practice can not overcome clear text,but we do not look to it for that explained supra,we believe that the most natural reading of the code itself is that it allows bankruptcy courts equitably to confer derivative standing on creditors in this situation.while that favorable text is alone sufficient,we believe that it is instructive to explore the prevalence of derivative standing in years,for it confirms that the bankruptcy court decision was not only proper,but also prudent.
the concept of derivative standing was first applied in the bankruptcy context in the case of chatfield,cir,where the eighth circuit explained 
w e recognize the right of a creditor to apply to the bankrupt cy court for an order permitting him to prosecute an appeal in the name of the trustee,when he has called upon the trustee to take an appeal from the allowance of a claim against the bankrupt estate,and the latter has declined to appeal.as the trustee is an officer of the bankrupt cy court,and subject to its orders,that court has an undoubted power either to direct the trustee to appeal when it entertains doubts of the verity of its judgment,or to make an order permitting a creditor who so desires to appeal from the allowance in the name of the trustee when the latter declines to appeal.
id.at.in,the sixth circuit recognized a trustee power to confer derivative standing upon creditors,see in re stearns salt lumber,cir,and in,the second circuit recognized the bankruptcy court power to do so.see in re eureka upholstering,cir.as judge hand explained 
the receiver is responsible for the collection of the assets and he alone can authorize any charges against them.if any creditor,petitioning or other,learns facts which lead him to suppose that property has been concealed,he may,and indeed he should,advise the receiver,and if the receiver prove slack,he may apply to the referee the bankruptcy judge to stir him to action.the referee or the district judge may then authorize the creditor to proceed,and he will be entitled to his reward under,but not otherwise.
id.at.cases adhering to this view are legion,and we set forth further examples in the margin 
we also place great weight on the fact that the version of the authoritative collier on bankruptcy,in summarizing practice under the bankruptcy act,references in six different volumes creditors ability to obtain court permission to pursue actions on behalf of the estate.see collier on bankruptcy ed.if the creditors then believe that a suit or other proper proceeding should be commenced for avoidance or recovery,they have the right to petition the bankruptcy court wherein the proceedings are pending for an order compelling the trustee to act,or for leave to prosecute the suit in the name of the trustee and on behalf of the estate.collier on bankruptcy ed.the right of creditors to maintain an action for the recovery of a preference prior to the appointment of a trustee is impliedly recognized in of the act.collier on bankruptcy ed if the creditor is permitted to act in the name of the trustee,it will be noted that the trustee,in whom the right vests under the act,will be plaintiff and any recovery would inure to the estate.in the case of recovery this would be a proper situation for the application of.collier on bankruptcy ed if the trustee fails to do his duty,any interested creditor may make demand on him for appropriate action,and if he fails to act promptly,the creditor may,with permission of the court,act on behalf of the estate and in the name of the trustee.collier on bankruptcy ed after appointment of a trustee,a condition upon the creditor right to sue and receive reimbursement therefor is an application to him or to the court.until the trustee appointment,however,and in the absence of a receiver or if the trustee has refused or is unable to act this provision entitles creditors to initiate proceedings without any condition precedent.collier on bankruptcy ed.creditors may ask the court to compel the trustee to act,or for leave to prosecute the action in the trustee name.collier view is persuasive on such matters,for the supreme court has itself cited to it as evidence that a particular practice was widely accepted under the bankruptcy act.see kelly,at.determining that criminal penalties under the act were.
amicus professor keith sharfman submits,however,that later caselaw rejected derivative standing for creditors.for example,in klebanow new york produce exchange,the court held that limited partners of a bankruptcy debtor are more like shareholders,who may maintain derivative suits,than like mere creditors,who may not sue derivatively,cir.given the dictum in that case,professor sharfman contends that it would be inaccurate to suggest that the bankruptcy code was enacted in an environment where derivative standing was a norm.sharfman brief at.interestingly,however,in,the second circuit in in re stn enterprises cited practice in recognizing the qualified right of creditors committees to initiate avoidance suits,with the approval of the bankruptcy court,when the trustee or unjustifiably failed to bring suit to avoid a transfer.in re stn enterprises,at.see also mediators,manney in re the mediators,cir.if the second circuit meant what it said in dictum in klebanow,it changed its mind thereafter.
at all events,complete doctrinal uniformity in caselaw is hardly to be expected where powers of equity are concerned.especially given collier sense of the law,we are satisfied that the overwhelming balance of opinion supports courts power to confer derivative standing upon creditors.see midlantic bank,at.finding that three cases constituted clear practice.the historical record here is far more compelling than it was in hartford underwriters,a relatively easy case in which,at most,the cases supporting hartford ability to sue under c slightly outnumbered those rejecting that ability.therefore,to the extent that we do not read the bankruptcy code to erode past bankruptcy practice absent a clear indication that congress intended such a departure,cohen,at,we believe a presumption exists in favor of courts power to confer derivative standing in this instance.
our decision today,however,does not depend on this presumption,for the code itself anticipates the existence of derivative standing.we believe that the historical acceptance of derivative standing is most valuable for the accumulated experience it evidences,that derivative standing is a prudent way for bankruptcy courts to remedy lapses in a trustee execution of its fiduciary duty.the bankruptcy court decision in this case is in perfect harmony with that received wisdom.
vi.does derivative standing for creditors committees advance congress goals 
lincolnshire submits that the bankruptcy code provides many explicit remedies for situations where,as here,a debtor unreasonably refuses to pursue an action on behalf of the estate.its implication is that,by providing bankruptcy courts with a range of remedies,congress intended for that range to be comprehensive,and it notes that it is not for courts to substitute their policy judgment for congress.see hartford underwriters,at.w e do not sit to assess the relative merits of different approaches to various bankruptcy problems achieving a better policy outcome if what petitioner urges is that is a task for congress,not the courts.we agree,at least insofar as policy rationales can not override contrary text.but as explained supra,there is no text to override because the code itself anticipates derivative standing.
the critical question is thus whether bankruptcy courts equitable powers are sufficient to allow them to confer the derivative standing that the code anticipates.for the reasons set forth above,we believe that they are.indeed,the very fact that equitable powers are at issue renders public policy concerns more important than they were in hartford underwriters,for as the supreme court has said,there is inherent in the courts of equity a jurisdiction to give effect to the policy of the legislature.mitchell,at.emphasis added.see also a empowering a bankruptcy court to issue any order,process,or judgment that is necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this title.put another way,although we concluded above that bankruptcy courts have equitable power to confer derivative standing upon creditors committees to avoid fraudulent transfers in this situation,it is important to support that conclusion by assessing the public policy concerns underpinning chapter.
despite the existence of other potential remedies,we are satisfied that derivative standing in this instance achieves congress policy goals.we will proceed first by exploring those goals,and then by assessing the adequacy of the other remedies lincolnshire identifies.
a.the salutary effects of derivative standing for creditors committees 
before bankruptcy,a debtor management and its most powerful creditors typically try to work out the debtor financial distress.in this process,managers frequently experience pressure to take extreme measures to protect the company.brief of amicus law professors at.they may make extraordinary concessions to providers of critical services,such as granting new lines on unencumbered property,agreeing to an excessive rate of interest,committing to lavish retention bonuses,or doing virtually anything else to avoiding filing for bankruptcy.see,eduardo porter mitchell pacelle,judge increases severance pay to former enron employees,wall,at discussing dollar retention bonuses paid by enron insiders before bankruptcy.whether or not these radical actions are ultimately successful,they often reduce the assets available to the debtor creditors.
the bankruptcy code avoidance powers are intended,inter alia,to deter this kind of managerial overreaching and to encourage creditors to allow a debtor a measure of breathing room.see,at by permitting the trustee to avoid prebankruptcy transfers that occur within a short period before bankruptcy,creditors are discouraged from racing to the courthouse to dismember the debtor during its slide into bankruptcy.fraudulent avoidance actions,such as those provided for in b,are intended to afford unsecured creditors peace of mind,for those creditors are usually the principal victims of managerial misfeasance.
although fraudulent transfers are of concern in many chapters of the bankruptcy code,including in chapter liquidations,they present a particularly vexing problem in reorganizations conducted under chapter.the premise of a reorganization is to ensure that the debtor emerges from bankruptcy as a viable concern.this explains why trustees are a fixture in chapter liquidations,but they are exceptional in chapter is thought that a debtor existing management will be more familiar with the company than would be a trustee,and that it would therefore be better able to guide the debtor back into solvency.see sharon steel,at it is settled that appointment of a trustee should be the exception,rather than the rule.collier on bankruptcy ed.noting that appointment of a trustee in a chapter case is an extraordinary remedy.in chapter cases where no trustee is appointed,a provides that the,the debtor management,enjoys the powers that would otherwise vest in the bankruptcy trustee.along with those powers,of course,comes the trustee fiduciary duty to maximize the value of the bankruptcy estate.
this situation immediately gives rise to the proverbial problem of the fox guarding the henhouse.if no trustee is appointed,the,the debtor a fiduciary duty to avoid fraudulent transfers that it itself made.one suspects that if managers can devise any opportunity to avoid bringing a claim that would amount to reputational,they will seize it.see,louisiana world exposition fed.ins,cir.for that reason,courts and commentators have acknowledged that the often acts under the influence of conflicts of interest.canadian.forest prod.irving,in re gibson group,cir.these conflicts of interest can arise even in situations where there is no concern that a debtor management is trying to save its own skin.for example,a debtor may be unwilling to pursue claims against individuals or businesses,such as critical suppliers,with whom it has an ongoing relationship that it fears damaging.id.at.finally,even if a bankrupt debtor is willing to bring an avoidance action,it might be too financially weakened to advocate vigorously for itself.in any of these situations,the real losers are the unsecured creditors whose interests avoidance actions are designed to protect.
the possibility of a derivative suit by a creditors committee provides a critical safeguard against lax pursuit of avoidance actions.amicus law professors explain that parties to bankruptcy workouts are typically sophisticated,and that they understand that their actions will likely be scrutinized after the fact.law professors brief at.they also understand that,even though a debtor management may be reluctant to pursue an avoidance action,a creditors committee will not be so hesitant.therefore,the mere threat of a creditors committee suit is often a potent deterrent to overreaching by creditors and insiders.see in re pac.airlines,discussing a creditors committee watchdog role.this deterrent effect remains important even after commencement of the bankruptcy case itself 
potential drawbacks of derivative standing for creditors committees 
might derivative suits dissipate the value of the estate 
despite these clear benefits stemming from derivative standing,amicus professor sharfman identifies reasons why it might be harmful from a policy perspective.he first argues that,although the purpose of derivative suits is presumably to maximize the value of the estate,academic research has shown that such suits frequently result in awards only large enough to pay the litigants legal bills.see roberta romano,the shareholder suit litigation without foundation,journal of law,economics and organization jonathan macey geoffrey miller,the plantiffs attorney role in class action and derivative litigation economic analysis and recommendations for reform,chi.sharfman submits that creditors derivative suits are even less likely to add value than are shareholders derivative suits,for the possibility of setting aside transfers as fraudulent would make it riskier for financially distressed firms to persuade potential lenders and suppliers to do business.sharfman brief at.the supreme court recognized this concern in hartford underwriters,where it stated that t he possibility of being targeted by various administrative claimants could make secured creditors less willing to provide postpetition financing.at.
we are untroubled by this argument.to be sure,there are situations where derivative suits recover only enough to pay the lawyers,but that concern is lessened by the need to obtain bankruptcy court approval before pursuing an action.there is no inherent reason why a debtor would be able to prosecute an avoidance claim more cheaply than a creditors committee could,so there is no reason why a creditor suing derivatively would dissipate more value than would a debtor suing directly.likewise,although the possibility of an avoidance action might trouble a prospective supplier or lender,that is an argument not against derivative standing,but against avoidance actions generally.congress,however,has clearly decided that such actions are valuable to the chapter process,and we will not that judgment.the concern that derivative suits might be is adequately served by affording a debtor the deference normally accorded pursuant to the business judgment rule.when a debtor action is beyond the scope of that deference,however,congress intent is best served by ensuring that an action is filed,even if by a creditors committee.at all events,the bankruptcy court in this case concluded that the estate ought to have brought the avoidance claim in question.
might bankruptcy courts be unable to identify meritorious claims 
professor sharfman also takes issue with the idea that a bankruptcy court can serve as a competent gatekeeper for the purpose of deciding when to authorize derivative standing.he submits that the idea that judges in bankruptcy cases will permit only value enhancing derivative litigation to go forward rather than all litigation that is merely colorable is more wishful thinking than serious argument.it is often hard to tell at the outset when permission to prosecute derivative litigation is sought whether a claim is meritorious,and judges understandably can make mistakes.sharfman brief at citing frank easterbrook daniel fischel,the economic structure of corporate law.from this observation,he concludes that creditors could well recover more in the aggregate if creditor derivative suits were impermissible across the board.id.at.
it is doubtless true that judges,like trustees or debtors,sometimes lack sufficient information to determine ex ante whether a claim is or merely colorable.but it does not follow that creditors would likely recover more if derivative suits were impermissible.first,this assumes that the would be better able to identify valuable claims than a bankruptcy court would be.there is no reason this should be true,for,as discussed above,conflicts of interest can often cloud debtors is difficult objectively to determine whether a potential action is meritorious when one would be a defendant in that action.
second,this argument assumes that creditors committees are rather unsophisticated,for it predicts that the estate,and hence its creditors,would be better off if no avoidance actions took place.if that were true,presumably creditors committees would know it,and would not seek to bring the sort of action at issue today.third,this critique overlooks the fact that the choice at hand is not between derivative actions and no actions.instead,if a bankruptcy court can not authorize a derivative suit when it concludes that a debtor is unreasonably refusing to pursue an action,it will likely take the alternative step of ordering the debtor itself to pursue that action.that step is unlikely to yield a vigorous prosecution of the claim,yet it would incur all of the costs of a derivative suit.
most fundamentally,however,the problem with the courts can not identify meritorious claims critique is that it is one of futility.the proposition that a bankruptcy court can not reliably determine when a debtor is not maximizing value is,at bottom,an argument that bankruptcy courts are not capable of doing many of the things we depend on them to do.they are,for example,instrumental in approving the bankruptcy plan itself and determining whether to appoint an examiner or trustee,and they are frequently called upon to weigh the merits of proposed orders.it seems to us that we have no choice but to presume the competency of bankruptcy courts throughout the process,and we are therefore unwilling to place much stock in the claim that they are unable to determine when a debtor is unreasonably refusing to pursue an avoidance action.
might derivative suits consume judicial resources 
lastly,amicus professor sharfman warns that determining whether a derivative suit should be maintained and,if so,who should maintain it,takes time and effort on the part of the court.the court in hartford underwriters was concerned about this cost,observing that the possibility of multiple claimants created by a llowing recovery to be sought at the behest of parties other than the trustee could impair the ability of the bankruptcy court to coordinate proceedings,as well as the trustee to manage the estate.at.professor sharfman points out that in the case at bar,the issue of whether the committee could pursue a derivative claim consumed significant judicial time and effort that would not have been necessary if creditors lacked derivative standing.we disagree.rather,we believe that the cost that sharfman laments arises from uncertainty regarding the propriety of derivative suits,a matter resolved by this appeal.if derivative standing is unambiguously permissible,it is not unduly burdensome to determine whether any particular creditor or committee should have that standing.
in general,although we agree that derivative standing does not come without costs,we are satisfied that on the whole it is an immensely valuable tool for bankruptcy courts and creditors alike.it helps to deter fraudulent transfers in the first instance,and it provides courts with a viable remedy when those transfers nonetheless occur.
possible substitutes for derivative standing for creditors committees 
lincolnshire does not deny that derivative standing for creditors committees is potentially beneficial,but it contends that such standing is not as critical as the committee suggests because bankruptcy courts,and committees themselves,have many other remedies available.we explore these in turn.
appointment of a bankruptcy trustee 
lincolnshire first argues that,although the usual chapter case proceeds without a bankruptcy trustee,a creditors committee can move to appoint one pursuant to.that provision allows any party in interest including a creditors committee to request appointment of a trustee for cause,or if the appointment would be in the interests of creditors.a.cause to appoint a trustee may include fraud,dishonesty,incompetence,or gross mismanagement either before or after commencement of the case.id.a.lincolnshire posits that a trustee independent nature would allow it to pursue avoidance claims without the conflicts of interest that can affect.
amici law professors aptly respond that disallowing derivative suits and forcing creditors committees to move to appoint trustees would amount to replac ing the scalpel of derivative suit with a chainsaw.law professors brief at.appointing a trustee in a chapter case is an extraordinary remedy,collier on bankruptcy ed,and there is a corresponding strong presumption that the debtor should be permitted to remain in possession.in re marvel entertainment group,cir.the problem is that appointing a trustee amounts to replacing much of a debtor management,and that creates immense costs in two ways.first,there is a statutory fee which can be substantial to which trustees are entitled for their services.see a setting forth fee schedule,a setting forth trustee right to compensation a providing that are not entitled to statutory trustee fees more important,however,is the cost implicit in replacing current management with a team that is less familiar with the debtor specifically and its market generally.the idea that existing management is best positioned to rescue a debtor from bankruptcy is precisely the reason why the appointment of a trustee is exceptional in chapter reorganizations,but occurs immediately in chapter liquidations.see kenneth klee john shaffer,creditors committees under chapter of the bankruptcy code,observing generally that the incremental costs of a trustee usually outweigh the benefits,and that maximization of value rarely lies down this path.
in short,we believe that appointing a trustee is too drastic a step to constitute a serious alternative to allowing derivative suits by creditors committees.indeed,because much of chapter is premised on allowing current management to remain in control of the debtor,it is unlikely that congress intended to force a court to displace that management in the relatively commonplace event that a debtor makes a questionable decision not to prosecute a fraudulent avoidance claim.
appointment of an examiner with authority to sue 
amicus corporation submits that,if appointing a trustee is too radical an alternative,a creditors committee might instead move the court to appoint an examiner under c.that provision states that a party in interest may request the appointment of an examiner to conduct such an investigation of the debtor as is appropriate,and that the court may order an appointment after notice and a hearing.an examiner duties include investigation of the debtor,the debtor business,and any other matter relevant to the case or to the formation of a plan.see b.observes that a debtor management remains in place when an examiner is appointed.perhaps most important,however,is the fact that an examiner has all of the duties of a trustee that the court orders the debtor in possession not to perform.b.at least one court has interpreted this language to mean that an examiner may initiate and pursue causes of action on behalf of the debtor.see in re carnegie international.
although this alternative is less drastic than the appointment of a trustee,we nevertheless harbor doubts about its ability to substitute for derivative suit.one concern is that,like a trustee,an examiner would incur direct costs through its fees,so to that extent this remedy is inferior to the alternative of derivative suit by a creditors committee.the more serious problem,however,is that it is less than obvious that b actually does permit examiners to initiate actions on the debtor behalf.the full text of that section states 
an examiner appointed under section d of this title shall perform the duties specified in paragraphs and of subsection a of this section,and,except to the extent that the court orders otherwise,any other duties of the trustee that the court orders the debtor in possession not to perform.
b.although this language is expansive,it is subject to the interpretive canon ejusdem generis,which states that where general words follow specific words in a statutory enumeration,the general words are construed to embrace only objects similar to those enumerated by the preceding specific words.circuit city stores,at.citation omitted.sections and allow the examiner to investigate the acts,conduct,assets,liabilities,and financial condition of the debtor,the operation of the debtor business and the desirability of the continuance of such business,and any other relevant matter,and also to file a statement of investigation.a.critically,these sections permit only investigating and reporting on that investigation they stop far short of authorizing examiners to litigate based on their findings.
therefore,although an examiner proper role in chapter proceedings is hardly at issue in this case,we conclude that b broad grant is most naturally interpreted to authorize only acts relating directly to investigation.this conclusion comports with congress evident understanding of the examiner role,for the sponsors of the code stated the investigation of the examiner is to proceed on an independent basis from the procedure of the reorganization under chapter in order to ensure that the examiner report will be expeditious and fair.cong.rec.daily ed,reprinted in.this independent role would likely be jeopardized by an examiner litigation against a debtor,and we therefore do not believe that an examiner can serve as a substitute for either a trustee or a creditors committee for the purpose of avoiding fraudulent transfers.
moving the court to order the to sue 
the third option advanced is that a creditors committee could move the bankruptcy court to order the debtor to file an avoidance action.in the case at bar,the bankruptcy court would no doubt have granted the committee motion to compel that action,for it made a finding of fact that the debtor refusal to bring suit was unreasonable.but this solution is not management sometimes severe conflicts of interest,a court order to file an avoidance action would frequently amount to instructing management to sue itself.to put it mildly,that is unlikely to result in vigorous prosecution of the claim.
converting the bankruptcy case to chapter 
the district court observed that if the committee could not bring a derivative avoidance action,it might instead convert the case to a chapter liquidation or dismiss the petition pursuant to.these solutions are far more radical than even the appointment of a trustee.converting the case to chapter would cause the immediate appointment of a trustee,the option rejected supra,and would cause dissolution of the committee.more importantly,though,chapter proceedings are liquidations,and this option would amount to instructing management pursue this action,or we will move to dissolve your company.while that might yield results,such coercion is unlikely to yield a zealous prosecution of the claim.it also washes out the baby with the bath water,for the principal purpose of chapter is to avoid liquidating viable businesses.
moving to dismiss the bankruptcy petition makes no more sense.bankruptcy brings with it many advantages for a debtor,such as the power to avoid union contracts and to defer or even avoid financial commitments.dismissing a bankruptcy petition might therefore be the equivalent of forcing a company to close its doors.that,of course,is hardly an alternative to derivative standing.
moving the bankruptcy court to authorize a committee to bring a avoidance action 
finally,amicus notes that a creditors committee might be authorized to bring a avoidance action in a plan of reorganization.see b b.it submits that this would give a creditors committee the ability to protect its interest in a variety of ways.first,although b provides a with days of exclusivity in which to file a plan of reorganization,any extension of that period requires leave of court.see d.suggests that a committee might object to any motion to extend that period unless the agrees to pursue the action itself,or to file a plan permitting the committee to pursue the action.alternatively,a committee may safeguard its interests by filing its own plan of reorganization once the exclusivity period expires.finally,the committee might move to terminate the exclusivity period in order to expedite the filing of its own plan.
these are indeed options open to committees,but like the other alternatives discussed supra,they would be far more disruptive to the reorganization process than the simple step of allowing a creditors committee to sue derivatively.the problem with ending exclusivity,either by moving immediately or objecting to an extension of the initial window,is that it would lead immediately to a sea of direct claims that were previously channeled through the debtor.in other words,although a particular creditor might be able to sue to recover its fraudulently conveyed property,so too might every other creditor and claimant.to the extent congress has determined that exclusivity is valuable to a reorganization,this would be a highly disruptive substitute.there is no reason to suppose that congress intended to leave only this option available to creditors committees when a debtor unreasonably refuses to pursue an avoidance action.
we conclude that,on balance,derivative standing is a valuable tool for creditors and courts alike in chapter proceedings,and we do not believe that any of the proffered alternatives could serve as a realistic substitute for that standing.because it helps to ensure that creditors claims are not frustrated by fraudulent transfers,derivative standing seems clearly to give effect to the policy of the legislature.mitchell,at,and bankruptcy courts equitable powers therefore allow them to confer such standing upon creditors committees.
vii.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we are satisfied that bankruptcy courts can authorize creditors committees to sue derivatively to avoid fraudulent transfers for the benefit of the estate.we will therefore reverse the district court decision denying the committee derivative standing.we will remit to the original panel of this court the issues whether the committee was required to identify a present creditor in order to sustain its fraudulent transfer claims cybergenics had at least one unpaid creditor at the time of the alleged fraudulent transfer the heightened pleading standard of fed.civ.proc.b is applicable to the committee complaint the committee was entitled to amend its complaint under fed.civ.proc.a and the committee has abandoned its claim of equitable subordination.
in this case,the majority interprets the phrase the trustee may,in b of the bankruptcy code,to mean that the trustee and a creditors committee may seek recovery under the statute.although the majority does not conclude that the phrase is ambiguous or that its meaning is in any way obscure,it has,nonetheless,broadened the statute to add a party that congress specifically omitted.the majority reasons that,while no specific statutory authority grants a creditors committee standing,several code provisions,practice,public policy,and the bankruptcy court equitable powers all combine to afford a creditors committee derivative standing under b.i respectfully disagree.the majority view is inconsistent with the plain and natural reading of,is not supported by the code provisions it cites,is not adequately grounded in prior practice and,perhaps more importantly,is inconsistent with the supreme court plain meaning analysis of the identical phrase in hartford underwriters.accordingly,i respectfully dissent.
the central question here is whether the committee has standing to seek relief under b.i begin,as did the supreme court in hartford underwriters,with the observation that congress says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there,d quoting connecticut nat.bank germain,d.i note as well that the analysis of any statute,including the bankruptcy code,must not begin with external sources,but with the text itself.bank of america nat.trust and sav.ass north lasalle street partnership,d thomas,concurring citing germain,at.union bank wolas,d.
section b contains no textual ambiguity.the statute,by its express terms,provides for specific action and authorizes only the trustee to act.in hartford underwriters,the supreme court recognized that,w here a statute names the parties granted the right to invoke its provisions,such parties only may act.at.quoting singer,sutherland on statutory construction,ed.the court also observed that a situation in which a statute authorizes specific action and designates a particular party empowered to take it is surely among the least appropriate in which to presume nonexclusivity.id.at.that is precisely the circumstance here.section provides for the avoidance of any transfer of an interest of the debtor property and it designates the trustee,and only the trustee,as the party who may act under the statute.we should not,therefore,presume that we have a free hand to broaden a right which congress has made exclusive.
clearly if congress had wanted to authorize a party other than the trustee to invoke the remedies of,it could simply have done so as it has in many other provisions of the bankruptcy code since congress has specifically authorized a creditors committee to act in various other provisions of the code,but has not done so with regard to,we should presume that congress act ed intentionally and purposely in the disparate exclusion.duncan walker,d quoting bates united states,d.indeed,as the court noted in hartford underwriters,the fact that the sole party a unique role in bankruptcy proceedings makes it entirely plausible that congress would provide a power to him and not to others.at.
as the supreme court stated,when the language of a statute is plain,as it is here,the sole function of the courts at least where the disposition required by the text is not absurd is to enforce it according to its terms.hartford underwriters,at.quoting united states ron pair enterprises,d quoting caminetti united states.the plain text of makes clear that only the trustee may invoke the remedies under the statute.
ii.other code provisions 
the majority does not contend that enforcing as written would produce an absurd result.nevertheless,the majority looks beyond the text of to determine whether a creditors committee has derivative standing.specifically,the majority asserts that b and c of the bankruptcy code,paired with b b,make it unmistakably clear that congress approved of creditors committees suing derivatively to recover property for the benefit of the estate.i respectfully disagree.the majority also contends that must be considered in light of the equitable powers of the bankruptcy courts,practice,and policy concerns.i address these arguments in turn.
section b states that a party in interest,including the debtor,the trustee,a creditors committee,an equity security holders committee,a creditor,an equity security holder,or any indenture trustee,may raise and may appear and be heard on any issue in a case under chapter.b emphasis added.this court has liberally construed b to grant a creditors committee a broad right to be heard,including among other powers,an unconditional right to intervene in a chapter adversary proceeding that has been initiated by a trustee.see,coopers lybrand,cir matter of marin motor oil,cir,cert.denied,d.
however,this provision does not confer authority upon a creditors committee to initiate an action when the trustee or declines to bring suit.section b only establishes a right to be heard by way of intervention as a party plaintiff when a proceeding has already been brought by the statutorily authorized party.courts that have found authority for creditors to bring avoidance actions under this provision have noted that a general right to be heard would be an empty grant unless those who had such a right were allowed to act when those who should act did not.coral petroleum,banque,cir quoting collier on bankruptcy ed.yet b,read in light of hartford underwriters,grants an exclusive right of action to the trustee,and a broad right to be heard provision may not expand the intent evidenced by the plain,specific language used by congress in b.
any doubt on this question is eliminated by the supreme court statement in hartford underwriters,albeit in dicta,indicating that the court would not read b to allow a to bring suit under a provision stating only that the trustee may.after acknowledging that b was by its terms inapplicable in hartford underwriters because the case arose under chapter rather than chapter,the court stated,i n any event,we do not read b general provision of a right to be heard as broadly allowing a creditor to pursue substantive remedies that other code provisions make available only to specific parties.at.citing king,collier on bankruptcy ed.in general,section does not bestow any right to usurp the trustee role as representative of the estate with respect to the initiation of certain types of litigation that belong exclusively to the estate.this is consistent with our prior interpretation of b,and it strengthens my view of the statute.
section c of the bankruptcy code provides that a committee appointed under section of this title may perform such other services as are in the interest of those represented.c.this section does not,as the majority acknowledges,confer express authority for the committee independently to initiate an adversary proceeding,including one under b.nonetheless the majority argues that such authority may be found in the flexible representation role of a creditors committee evidenced by c.i do not read c to suggest,in any way,a committee authority to file a lawsuit.
the powers granted to committees under c are very specific.they include the power to consult with the trustee or debtor,investigate the debtor acts and financial condition,participate in the bankruptcy plan,and request the appointment of an examiner.
none of these provisions support the authority to initiate a lawsuit.since the grants of power in to are quite narrow and,the power should be similarly confined.see federal maritime comm seatrain line,d see also norfolk and western ry.american train dispatchers ass n,d under the principle of ejusdem generis,when a general term follows a specific one,the general term should be understood as a reference to subjects akin to the one with specific enumeration.because congress authorized only limited,discrete rights of participation for a committee in c,we should not read c to grant a broad,implied power to initiate a suit under general language regarding other services as are in the interest of those represented.
section b b 
the majority argues that,while and provide at best indirect evidence that congress granted bankruptcy courts the power to confer derivative standing upon creditors committees,a third section,b b,provides far more direct insight into bankruptcy courts powers.i disagree on this point as well.
federal courts have consistently held that b b does not itself confer standing.instead,this section merely authorizes the recovery of certain administrative expenses incurred by a creditor that recovers,after the court approval,for the benefit of the estate any property transferred or concealed by the debtor.b b.thus,this section only authorizes recovery of expenses to a creditor who successfully recovered property,which is to say,a creditor who had standing in the first place.in re srj enterprises.see also in re vogel van storage,surf n sun,dempsey.if a creditor does not have standing to prosecute a claim under b b,there would seem to be even less support for the idea that this section confers derivative standing on a committee of creditors.
nevertheless,the majority argues that the most natural reading of b b is that it recognizes and rewards monetarily the practice of permitting creditors committees to pursue derivative actions.i again disagree.the plain reading of b b is that it permits a creditor,not a creditors committee,to recover expenses.indeed,the most prevalent use of b b,based on my review of the cases citing this provision,is to compensate individual creditors who object to discharge and then successfully locate and bring into the estate assets that had been transferred or concealed by the debtor.see,in re george,in re antar,in re spencer,in re rumpza,in re humphreys pest control,wl,at,aff,wl.july.see also judy simmons henry,recovery of creditors costs from the bankruptcy estate reasonable,necessary,and uncertain.little rock,discussing cases in which individual creditors have been allowed to recover their expenses under b b gregg johnson,recovering a creditor expenses and legal and accounting fees as an administrative claim,bankr.dev,same.in light of the plain language of the statute and its prevalent use,the majority view that b b rewards creditors committees for pursuing derivative actions is unpersuasive.
in fact,committees recover expenses under a different code provision.that is because creditors committees are typically represented by an attorney and of the code specifically provides compensation for fees and expenses of the committee representative.sections a a and b allow for reasonable compensation as well as reimbursement for actual,necessary expenses incurred by the committee representative.a a,b.in sum,b b is not the proper provision for awarding creditors committees expenses and is not an appropriate basis from which to infer that congress authorized creditors committee derivative actions under.see in re realty associates,ii,explaining that creditors committees eligibility for compensation is based on a,not b b in re unr industries,cir stating that provides for reimbursement of expenses incurred by professional persons hired by the committee with court approval.
neither b,c,or b b,taken separately or together,provide sufficient statutory authority for the practice invoked by the committee and approved by the bankruptcy court in this case.because these chapter provisions granting significant authority to creditors committees do not go as far as to allow such committees to initiate avoidance actions,no matter whether the trustee fails to act the creditors secure court approval,i can not distinguish hartford underwriters,as the majority does,simply on the basis that hartford underwriters was a chapter case while here we consider a case under chapter.the committee urges this court to go beyond a cursory reading of b and examine other provisions of the code.i have done so,and can find no provision which grants the committee the authority denied to it in b.
iii.reliance on equity to confer standing 
the majority writes that while none of the three sections b,c,or b b seems directly to authorize standing w e believe that the missing link is supplied by bankruptcy courts equitable power to be sure,bankruptcy courts are equitable tribunals that apply equitable principles.but courts of equity must still follow the law.see magniac thomson,how.w herever the rights or the situation of parties are clearly defined and established by law,equity has no power to change or unsettle those rights or that situation,but in all such instances the maxim equitas sequiter legem is strictly applicable.the code is the law here and equity can not be used to change the clear and plain language of a code provision.this is especially true regarding a provision in which congress explicitly specified the party authorized to act.as the supreme court has observed,whatever equitable powers bankruptcy courts have,they must and can only be exercised within the confines of the bankruptcy code.norwest bank worthington ahlers,d.in this regard,this court has noted that equity does not give the court the power to create substantive rights that would otherwise be unavailable under the code.united states pepperman,cir quoting in re morristown erie,cir see also in re jamo,cir stating that equity may be invoked
