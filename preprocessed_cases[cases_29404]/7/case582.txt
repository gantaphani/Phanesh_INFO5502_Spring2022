lvnv funding,llc lvnv appeals from orders of the united states bankruptcy court for the district of south carolina,which disallowed its claims as an unsecured creditor in two proceedings under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code the bankruptcy code.see generally ch.on appeal,lvnv contends that the bankruptcy court chapter plan confirmation orders the confirmation orders barred the objections to lvnv claims because those objections were filed after entry of the confirmation orders.for the reasons set out below,we disagree with lvnv and affirm the judgments of the bankruptcy court.
this appeal arises out of two separate chapter bankruptcy proceedings that followed a similar pattern.on july,jeffrey rhodes rhodes filed in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of south carolina a voluntary petition for relief under chapter.rhodes chapter plan was confirmed on october.on june,derrick and teresa harling the harlings collectively with rhodes,the debtors filed in that same court their own chapter bankruptcy petition.the bankruptcy court confirmed the harlings chapter plan on august.
the debtors used form chapter plans,which are utilized by the bankruptcy courts in the district of south carolina.in their respective plans,the debtors scheduled their secured debts individually,naming each of their secured creditors,the value of each secured creditor claim,the value of the lien each secured creditor held in the collateral securing the debtors particular obligation,and the amount of each secured creditor claim that was unsecured by operation of.in contrast to the specific provisions for secured creditors,each plan provided for treatment of unsecured creditors as a single class,so that general unsecured creditors shall be paid allowed claims pro rata by the trustee to the extent that funds are available after payment of all other allowed claims.in addition,the debtors plans contained a provision reserving the right to object to claims after plan confirmation confirmation of this plan does not bar a party in interest from objecting to a claim,a reservation of rights clause.
lvnv filed proofs of claim in each case before entry of the confirmation orders.in rhodes case,lvnv filed proof of an unsecured claim in the amount of on august.in the harlings case,lvnv filed proof of an unsecured claim in the amount of on july.neither the debtors,nor their trustees,took any action regarding lvnv claims before the respective confirmation orders were entered.
as is typical in chapter proceedings,the claim bar date in each case was later than the date of plan confirmation.under the bankruptcy code timeline in a chapter bankruptcy proceeding,plan confirmation and the deadline to file proofs of claim are set relative to the meeting of creditors.fed.bankr.a.federal rule of bankruptcy procedure a sets the meeting to fifty days after the debtor petition for relief.under,the plan confirmation hearing follows twenty to days after the meeting,b,while the claim bar date is ninety days after the creditor meeting,fed.bankr.c.as a consequence,it is common in a chapter proceeding that the bar date to file claims by unsecured creditors occurs after plan confirmation.in rhodes case,the claim bar date was november,almost a month after his confirmation order was entered.in the harlings case,the bar date was october,more than two months after the confirmation order was entered.
rhodes filed his objection to lvnv proof of claim under on october,contending that claim was barred by the relevant statute of limitations.likewise,on august,one week after the confirmation order in their case was entered,the harlings objected to lvnv proof of claim on the same ground.
lvnv conceded in the bankruptcy court,as it does here,that its claims would ordinarily be barred by the statute of limitations.however,lvnv interposed the defense that the debtors objections were invalid and of no effect under the doctrine of res judicata.according to lvnv,the confirmation orders were final judgments on the validity of lvnv claims and,therefore,res judicata precluded the debtors later objections.the bankruptcy courts disagreed with lvnv and sustained the debtors objections to lvnv claims in reliance on the reservation of rights clauses in the respective chapter plans.as a consequence,lvnv claims were barred by the applicable state statute of limitations,and it will not receive any distribution from the debtors chapter estates.
lvnv now appeals from both decisions.in rhodes case,the parties jointly moved the bankruptcy court for leave to bypass the district court and appeal directly to this court under d a,representing the case presented a question of law as to which there was no controlling decision and that resolution of the issue presented would materially advance the progress of rhodes individual case.the bankruptcy court granted the motion,and we accepted jurisdiction see fed.app.fed.bankr.
meanwhile,lvnv appealed the harlings case to the united states district court for the district of south carolina under a.shortly after filing its notice of appeal in the district court,however,lvnv and the harlings filed a joint motion for leave to appeal directly to this court under d a.the district court granted the motion,and again we accepted jurisdiction.see fed.app.fed.bankr.
we consolidated the debtors cases for purposes of this appeal,over which we have jurisdiction pursuant to d a.
on appeal,lvnv contends that the bankruptcy court erred in approving the debtors objections to its unsecured claims,thereby disallowing those claims,because the debtors objections came after entry of the confirmation orders.lvnv maintains that confirmation of a chapter bankruptcy plan has a res judicata effect on all creditor claims filed prior to issuance of the confirmation order.we find that lvnv position does not satisfy the requirements for the application of res judicata and contradicts the plain language of the bankruptcy code and the plan set out by congress governing chapter proceedings.
we review the bankruptcy court application of res judicata de novo.first union commercial nelson,mullins,riley scarborough in re varat,cir.
a debtor bankruptcy case involves an aggregation of individual controversies,many of which would exist as lawsuits but for the bankrupt status of the debtor.bullard blue hills bank,internal quotations omitted.in view of this unique status,a bankruptcy case may contain many final decisions that do not necessarily fit squarely into the conventional formulation of res judicata,which is a product of ordinary civil litigation.see id.at.nonetheless,chapter confirmation orders have a preclusive effect on those issues litigated by or determined at confirmation,as the plan confirmation order is a final determination as to those matters it actually addresses.see a the provisions of a confirmed plan bind the debtor and each creditor,whether or not the claim of such creditor is provided for by the plan,and whether or not such creditor has objected to,has accepted,or has rejected the plan.in re varat,at t he confirmation order constitutes a final judgment on the merits with res judicata effect.
in bankruptcy,w e look to res judicata principles developed in our own case law to determine whether an earlier federal judgment,including the judgment of a bankruptcy court,bars a claim asserted in a later action.grausz englander,cir.under the doctrine of res judicata,a prior judgment between the same parties can preclude subsequent litigation on those matters actually and necessarily resolved in the first adjudication.in re varat,at.res judicata applies where three conditions are met there is a prior judgment,which was final,on the merits,and rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the requirements of due process the parties to the second matter are identical to,or in privity with,the parties in the first action and the claims in the second matter are based upon the same cause of action involved in the earlier proceeding.covert lvnv funding,llc,cir.internal quotations omitted.a judgment satisfying those three factors is both claim and issue preclusive.see in re varat,at see also united states,stating that res judicata embraces both claim and issue preclusion.lvnv contends the confirmation orders meet the three requirements of res judicata so that the debtors objections,coming after the confirmation orders were entered,are thus barred.the query before us in this case is what issues were determined by the confirmation orders,and,specifically,did the bankruptcy court adjudicate the merits of any individual unsecured creditor claim it is to that question that we now turn.
the determination of the application of res judicata begins with the bankruptcy code statutory scheme.that scheme reflects a careful and structured framework set out by congress.section lays out the requirements for plan confirmation.under that statute,the bankruptcy court shall confirm a debtor chapter plan if it meets the specific requirements therein and complies with the other provisions of chapter.a.consequently,chapter plans must comply with the plan content requirements set forth in,meaning the plan must be proposed in good faith must not discriminate unfairly between different classes of unsecured creditors and must be in the best interest of the debtor creditors.see,id,a.these requirements are statutory mandates,and the bankruptcy court lacks the authority to impose additional requirements.see petro mishler,cir.b y creating a finite list of affirmative requirements necessary for a plan confirmation,we assume that congress intended to exclude other requisites from being grafted onto section a.
section allows a debtor chapter plan to treat unsecured creditors as a single class see b allowing the plan to designate a class or classes of unsecured claims.when the plan does so,as do the debtors plans here,the bankruptcy court examines only the pool of funds available to the class as a whole during plan confirmation.see id.a stating that a debtor proposed chapter plan must provide the same treatment for each claim within a particular class.most chapter plans propose to pay the class of unsecured creditors only to the extent the funds of the bankruptcy estate are available after the plan obligations to secured or priority creditors are satisfied.accordingly,in confirming a chapter plan,the bankruptcy court need only determine that the funds available to the class of unsecured creditors are equivalent to or greater than the amount that class would be paid in the course of a chapter proceeding.see,in re cole,bankr.section a requires that creditors receive payments having a present value at least equal to what they would receive in a c hapter case.
in other words,the bankruptcy code requires the proposed plan to address at plan confirmation only the collective amount that all the chapter debtor unsecured creditors as a class will receive after satisfaction of any secured or priority debts.no provision of the bankruptcy code provides for the determination of the merits of an individual unsecured claim within the class of unsecured claims as part of plan confirmation.to the contrary,as discussed below,that function is reserved by statute for the claims allowance procedure,which stands separate and apart under the bankruptcy code from plan confirmation.see.
chapter plan confirmation as to unsecured creditors contrasts with the treatment and determination of secured claims.unlike the general provision for the class of unsecured creditors,a chapter plan must address the rights of each secured creditor individually by setting out the mode of satisfying that claim in relation to the secured creditor collateral.id.a requiring an analysis for each allowed secured claim provided for by the plan.of significance is that chapter plan confirmation requires that the holder of such secured claim has accepted the plan.id.a a.no parallel provision exists for unsecured creditors claims,so whether an unsecured creditor consents to a chapter plan is irrelevant for purposes of plan confirmation.thus,as a matter of statutory direction,the treatment of each individual secured creditor claim is bound up in plan confirmation,while an individual unsecured creditor claim is not.
as noted above,the bankruptcy code sets out a specific claim determination process for adjudicating contested claims.upon filing,a claim is deemed allowed under a.at that point,the debtor,trustee,or other interested party may file an objection,and the bankruptcy court proceeds under to adjudicate the validity and amount of the claim vel non.nothing in either,or elsewhere in the bankruptcy code ties adjudication of the allowance of an unsecured creditor claim to the process or event of chapter plan confirmation.
an unsecured creditor claim,if filed before plan confirmation,has already been deemed allowed under a without any action of the bankruptcy court.thus,there is nothing under the bankruptcy code for the bankruptcy court to adjudicate at plan confirmation regarding an individual unsecured creditor claim.that matter can only arise should an objection be made under,which sets in motion a determination process under that statute and the bankruptcy rules with no relation to plan confirmation.
with this statutory structure of the bankruptcy code in mind we now turn to the application of res judicata based on the effect of a chapter plan confirmation order.
for res judicata to apply,there must be an initial final judgment involving the same parties as are present in a later proceeding that is based upon the same cause of action as in the first proceeding.in re varat,at.the debtors and lvnv agree that the confirmation orders are final judgments as to their subject matter and that the debtors and lvnv were before the bankruptcy court when the confirmation orders were entered.thus,the first two elements of res judicata are met a prior final judgment with the same parties as now contest an issue in a later proceeding.the question to resolve is whether the objections to lvnv claims by the debtors raise the same cause of action as before the bankruptcy court in plan confirmation.the plain language of the bankruptcy code and clear structure of the bankruptcy process set out by congress confirm that they do not.
when the bankruptcy court entered the confirmation orders,it was required to determine whether the respective plans met the requirements of and.if so,the bankruptcy court was required to confirm the plans.see a.thus,the cause of action in the first proceeding was whether the debtors plans met the requirements for plan confirmation.they did.indeed,lvnv did not contend before the bankruptcy court,and does not contend now,that the debtors plans failed to meet any of the requirements for plan confirmation.accordingly,the issue for res judicata purposes is whether the cause of action in the later proceeding the validity of the debtors objections to lvnv claims was any part of the cause of action in the first proceeding,plan confirmation.as to unsecured creditors,it was not.all the bankruptcy court adjudicated in the confirmation orders as to unsecured creditors was whether,as a class,that class would be paid to the extent that funds we re available after payment of all other allowed claims.
as foreshadowed in the earlier discussion,this conclusion is compelled by the plain language of the bankruptcy code and rules,which govern the allowance of claims and contested matters.upon filing,a claim or interest is deemed allowed,unless a party in interest objects.a.thus,lvnv claims were already deemed allowed by the bankruptcy code when they were filed before plan confirmation.this deemed allowance was subject to statutory divestiture under b if an objection was filed and then sustained by the bankruptcy court.only when an objection to a claim is filed does the bankruptcy court determine the amount of such claim and allow that claim in such amount.see id.b.the filing of an objection to claim begins a contested matter,governed by federal rules of bankruptcy procedure and.see,gentry siegel,cir.observing that a contested matter arises once an objection to a claim has been interposed.see generally fed.bankr.a establishing the procedure for filing objections to claims id.establishing the procedure for the adjudication of c
