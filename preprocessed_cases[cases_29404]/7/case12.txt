the bankruptcy court confirmation order is not void under rule b.
a that order was a final judgment from which united did not appeal.such finality ordinarily would stan d in the way of challenging the order enforceability,travelers indemnity bailey.however,rule b allows a party to seek relief from a final judgment that is void,but only in the rare instance where a judgment is premised either on a certain type of jurisdictional error or on a violation of due process that deprives a party of notice or the opportunity to be heard.united alleged error falls in neither category.conceding that the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction to enter the confirmation order,united contends that the judgment is void because united did not receive adequate notice of espinosa proposed discharge.espinosa failure to serve the summons and complaint as required by the bankruptcy rules deprived united of a right granted by a procedural rule.united could have timely objected to this deprivation and appealed from an adverse ruling on its objection.but this deprivation did not amount to a violation of due process,which requires notice reasonably calculated,under all the circumstances,to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections,mullane central hanover bank trust.here,united actual notice of the filing and contents of espinosa plan more than satisfied its due process rights.thus,espinosa failure to make the required service does not entitle united to relief under rule b.
b contrary to united claim,the confirmation order is not void because the bankruptcy court lacked statutory authority to confirm espinosa plan absent an undue hardship finding under a.such failure is not on par with the jurisdictional and notice failings that define void judgments qualifying for rule b relief.section a does not limit a bankruptcy court jurisdiction over student loan debts or impose requirements that,if violated,would result in a denial of due process.instead,it requires a court to make a certain findings before confirming a student loan debt discharge.that this requirement is tennessee student assistance corporation hood,means only that the bankruptcy court must make an undue hardship finding even if the creditor does not request one it does not mean that a bankruptcy court failure to make the finding renders its subsequent confirmation order void for rule b purposes.although the bankruptcy court failure to find undue hardship was a legal error,the confirmation order is enforceable and binding on united because it had actual notice of the error and failed to object or timely appeal.
the ninth circuit erred in holding that bankruptcy courts must confirm a plan proposing the discharge of a student loan debt without an undue hardship determination in an adversary proceeding unless the creditor timely raises a specific objection.a chapter plan proposing such a discharge without the required determination violates a and a.failure to comply with this requirement should prevent confirmation even if the creditor fails to object,or to appear in the proceeding at all,since a bankruptcy court may confirm only a plan that,inter alia,complies with the applicable provisions of the code.a.neither the code nor the rules prevent parties from stipulating to the underlying facts of undue hardship or prevent the creditor from waiving service of a summons and complaint.
expanding the availability of rule b relief is not an appropriate prophylaxis for discouraging unscrupulous debtors from filing chapter plans proposing to dispense with the undue hardship requirement in hopes that the bankruptcy court will overlook the proposal and the creditor will not object.such efforts should be deterred by the specter of penalties that d ebtors and their attorneys face under various provisions for engaging in improper conduct in bankruptcy proceedings,taylor freeland kronz.and congress may enact additional provisions to address any difficulties should existing sanctions prove inadequate.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice thomas delivered the opinion of the court.
under chapter of the bankruptcy code code,a debtor may obtain a discharge of certain student loan debts only if failure to discharge that debt would impose an undue hardship on the debtor and his dependents.a.the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure require bankruptcy courts to make this undue hardship determination in an adversary proceeding,see rule,which the party seeking the determination must initiate by serving a summons and complaint on his adversary,see rules.the debtor in this case filed a plan with the bankruptcy court that proposed to discharge a portion of his student loan debt,but he failed to initiate the adversary proceeding as required for such discharge.the creditor received notice of,but did not object to,the plan,and failed to file an appeal after the bankruptcy court subsequently confirmed the plan.years later,the creditor filed a motion under federal rule of civil procedure b asking the bankruptcy court to rule that its order confirming the plan was void because the order was issued in violation of the code and rules.we granted certiorari to resolve a disagreement among the courts of appeals as to whether an order that confirms the discharge of a student loan debt in the absence of an undue hardship finding or an adversary proceeding,or both,is a void judgment for rule b purposes.
between and,respondent francisco espinosa obtained four federally guaranteed student loans for a total principal amount of.in,espinosa filed a bankruptcy petition under chapter.that chapter permits individual debtors to develop a plan to repay all or a portion of their debts over a period of time specified in the plan.see nobelman american savings bank,see also a,fed.rule bkrtcy.proc.b.a proposed bankruptcy plan becomes effective upon confirmation,see,and will result in a discharge of the debts listed in the plan if the debtor completes the payments the plan requires,see a.
espinosa plan listed his student loan debt as his only specific indebtedness.app.the plan proposed to repay only the principal on that debt,stating that the remainder the accrued interest would be discharged once espinosa repaid the principal,at.
as the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure require,the clerk of the bankruptcy court mailed notice and a copy of espinosa plan to petitioner united student aid funds,united,the creditor to whom espinosa owed the student loan debt,at see rules b,g,d.in boldface type immediately below the caption,the plan stated warning if you are a creditor your rights may be impaired by this plan.at.the plan also noted the deadlines for filing a proof of claim or an objection to the plan,at.
united received this notice and,in response,filed a proof of claim for,an amount representing both the principal and the accrued interest on espinosa student loans,at.united did not object to the plan proposed discharge of espinosa student loan interest without a determination of undue hardship,nor did it object to espinosa failure to initiate an adversary proceeding to determine the dischargeability of that debt.
in may,the bankruptcy court confirmed espinosa plan without holding an adversary proceeding or making a finding of undue hardship.one month later,the chapter trustee mailed united a form notice stating that t he amount of the claim filed differs from the amount listed for payment in the plan and that y our claim will be paid as listed in the plan.at.the form also apprised united that if united wishe d to dispute the above stated treatment of the claim,it had the responsibility to notify the trustee within days.ibid.united did not respond to that notice.
in may,espinosa completed the payments on his student loan principal,as required by the plan.shortly thereafter,the bankruptcy court discharged espinosa student loan interest 
in,the united states department of education commenced efforts to collect the unpaid interest on espinosa student loans in response,espinosa filed a motion in asking the bankruptcy court to enforce its discharge order by directing the department and united to cease all efforts to collect the unpaid interest on his student loan debt.
united opposed that motion and filed a under federal rule of civil procedure b seeking to set aside as void the bankruptcy court order confirming espinosa plan.united made two arguments in support of its motion.first,united claimed that the provision of espinosa plan authorizing the discharge of his student loan interest was inconsistent with the code,which requires a court to find undue hardship before discharging a student loan debt,a,a,and with the bankruptcy rules,which require the court to make the undue hardship finding in an adversary proceeding,see rule.second,united argued that its due process rights had been violated because espinosa failed to serve it with the summons and complaint the bankruptcy rules require as a prerequisite to an adversarial proceeding.see rules.
the bankruptcy court rejected both arguments,granted espinosa motion in relevant part,denied united,and ordered all claimants to cease and desist their collection efforts.united sought review in the district court,which reversed.that court held that united was denied due process because the confirmation order was issued without service of the summons and complaint the bankruptcy rules require.
espinosa appealed to the court of appeals for the ninth circuit,which issued an initial per curiam opinion remanding the case to the bankruptcy court to consider correcting an apparent clerical error in its discharge order.the bankruptcy court corrected the error,after which the court of appeals resubmitted the case and reversed the judgment of the district court.the court of appeals concluded that by confirming espinosa plan without first finding undue hardship in an adversary proceeding,the bankruptcy court at most committed a legal error that united might have successfully appealed,but that any such legal error was not a basis for setting aside the confirmation order as void under rule b,in addition,the court of appeals held that although espinosa failure to serve united with a summons and complaint before seeking a discharge of his student loan debt violated the bankruptcy rules,this defect in service was not a basis upon which to declare the judgment void because united received actual notice of espinosa plan and failed to object.see,at 
we granted certiorari.
a discharge under chapter is broader than the discharge received in any other chapter.collier on bankruptcy,ed.chapter nevertheless restricts or prohibits entirely the discharge of certain types of debts.as relevant here,a provides that when a debtor has completed the repayments required by a confirmed plan,a bankruptcy court shall grant the debtor a discharge of all debts provided for by the plan or disallowed under section of this title,except,inter alia,any debt of the kind specified in a.a.section a,in turn,specifies certain student loan debts unless excepting such debt from discharge would impose an undue hardship on the debtor and the debtor dependents.as noted,the bankruptcy rules require a party seeking to determine the dischargeability of a student loan debt to commence an adversary proceeding by serving a summons and complaint on affected creditors.see supra,at.we must decide whether the bankruptcy court order confirming espinosa plan is void under federal rule civil procedure b because the bankruptcy court confirmed the plan without complying with these requirements 
the bankruptcy court order confirming espinosa proposed plan was a final judgment,see in re optical technologies,from which united did not appeal.ordinarily,the finality of a bankruptcy court orders following the conclusion of direct review would stan d in the way of challenging their enforceability.travelers indemnity bailey,slip,at.rule b,however,provides an exception to finality,gonzalez crosby,that allows a party to seek relief from a final judgment,and request reopening of his case,under a limited set of circumstances,at.specifically,rule b the provision under which united brought this motion authorizes the court to relieve a party from a final judgment if the judgment is void.
a void judgment is a legal nullity.see black law dictionary ed.see also,at ed.although the term void describes a result,rather than the conditions that render a judgment unenforceable,it suffices to say that a void judgment is one so affected by a fundamental infirmity that the infirmity may be raised even after the judgment becomes final.see restatement second of judgments see generally.the list of such infirmities is exceedingly short otherwise,rule b exception to finality would swallow the rule.
a judgment is not void,for example,simply because it is or may have been erroneous.hoult hoult,moore et,moore federal practice a,to ed.hereinafter moore.similarly,a motion under rule b is not a substitute for a timely appeal.kocher dow chemical,see moore a,at.instead,rule b applies only in the rare instance where a judgment is premised either on a certain type of jurisdictional error or on a violation of due process that deprives a party of notice or the opportunity to be heard.see united states boch oldsmobile,moore a wright,miller,kane,federal practice procedure,ed.and supp.chicot county drainage dist.baxter state bank,stoll gottlieb.the error united alleges falls in neither category.
federal courts considering rule b motions that assert a judgment is void because of a jurisdictional defect generally have reserved relief only for the exceptional case in which the court that rendered judgment lacked even an arguable basis for jurisdiction.nemaizer baker,see,boch oldsmobile,supra,at t otal want of jurisdiction must be distinguished from an error in the exercise of jurisdiction,and only rare instances of a clear usurpation of power will render a judgment void brackets and internal quotation marks omitted.
this case presents no occasion to engage in such an arguable basis inquiry or to define the precise circumstances in which a jurisdictional error will render a judgment void because united does not argue that the bankruptcy court error was jurisdictional.reply brief for petitioner.such an argument would fail in any event.first,a statutory requirement that a bankruptcy court find undue hardship before discharging a student loan debt is a precondition to obtaining a discharge order,not a limitation on the bankruptcy court jurisdiction.see,arbaugh y h.second,the requirement that a bankruptcy court make this finding in an adversary proceeding derives from the bankruptcy rules,see rule proc,which are procedural rules adopted by the court for the orderly transaction of its business that are not jurisdictional.kontrick ryan,internal quotation marks omitted.
although united concedes that the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction to enter the order confirming espinosa plan,united contends that the court judgment is void under rule b because united did not receive adequate notice of espinosa proposed discharge of his student loan interest.specifically,united argues that the bankruptcy court violated united due process rights by confirming espinosa plan despite espinosa failure to serve the summons and complaint the bankruptcy rules require for the commencement of an adversary proceeding.we disagree.
espinosa failure to serve united with a summons and complaint deprived united of a right granted by a procedural rule.see fed.rule bkrtcy.proc.b.united could have timely objected to this deprivation and appealed from an adverse ruling on its objection.but this deprivation did not amount to a violation of united constitutional right to due process.due process requires notice reasonably calculated,under all the circumstances,to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.mullane central hanover bank trust,see also jones flowers,d ue process does not require actual notice here,united received actual notice of the filing and contents of espinosa plan.this more than satisfied united due process rights.accordingly,on these facts,espinosa failure to serve a summons and complaint does not entitle united to relief under rule b.
unable to demonstrate a jurisdictional error or a due process violation,united and the government,as amicus,urge us to expand the universe of judgment defects that support rule b relief.specifically,they contend that the bankruptcy court confirmation order is void because the court lacked statutory authority to confirm espinosa plan absent a finding of undue hardship.in support of this contention,they cite the text of a,which provides that student loan debts guaranteed by governmental units are not dischargeable unless a court finds undue hardship.a emphasis added.they argue that this language imposes a limitation on the effect of a discharge order that renders the order legally unenforceable,and thus void,if it is not satisfied.brief for petitioner brief for united states as amicus curiae quoting tennessee student assistance corporation hood.in addition,united cites a,which instructs bankruptcy courts to confirm only those plans that comply with the applicable provisions of the code.reading these provisions in tandem,united argues that an order confirming a plan that purports to discharge a student loan debt without an undue hardship finding is doubly beyond the court authority and therefore void.brief for petitioner.
we are not persuaded that a failure to find undue hardship in accordance with a is on par with the jurisdictional and notice failings that define void judgments that qualify for relief under rule b.as noted,a does not limit the bankruptcy court jurisdiction over student loan debts supra,at see hood,at noting that b ankruptcy courts have exclusive jurisdiction over a debtor property nor does the provision impose requirements that,if violated,would result in a denial of due process.instead,a requires a court to make a certain finding before confirming the discharge of a student loan debt.it is true,as we explained in hood,that this requirement is at but that means only that the bankruptcy court must make an undue hardship finding even if the creditor does not request one it does not mean that a bankruptcy court failure to make the finding renders its subsequent confirmation order void for purposes of rule b 
given the code clear and requirement for an undue hardship determination,the bankruptcy court failure to find undue hardship before confirming espinosa plan was a legal error.see part iii,infra.but the order remains enforceable and binding on united because united had notice of the error and failed to object or timely appeal.
united response that it had no obligation to object to espinosa plan until espinosa served it with the summons and complaint the bankruptcy rules require,brief for petitioner is unavailing.rule b does not provide a license for litigants to sleep on their rights.united had actual notice of the filing of espinosa plan,its contents,and the bankruptcy court subsequent confirmation of the plan.in addition,united filed a proof of claim regarding espinosa student loan debt,thereby submitting itself to the bankruptcy court jurisdiction with respect to that claim.see langenkamp culp,per curiam.united therefore forfeited its arguments regarding the validity of service or the adequacy of the bankruptcy court procedures by failing to raise a timely objection in that court.
rule b strikes a balance between the need for finality of judgments and the importance of ensuring that litigants have a full and fair opportunity to litigate a dispute.where,as here,a party is notified of a plan contents and fails to object to confirmation of the plan before the time for appeal expires,that party has been afforded a full and fair opportunity to litigate,and the party failure to avail itself of that opportunity will not justify rule b relief.we thus agree with the court of appeals that the bankruptcy court confirmation order is not void.
in issuing its judgment,however,the court of appeals looked beyond the narrow question whether the bankruptcy court order confirming espinosa plan was void under rule b.it canvassed other bankruptcy court decisions within the circuit that presented a different question whether a bankruptcy court presented with a debtor plan that proposes to discharge a student loan debt,in the absence of an adversary proceeding to determine undue hardship,should confirm the plan despite its failure to comply with the code and rules.the court of appeals noted that some bankruptcy courts had declined to confirm such plans even when the creditor fail ed to object to the plan.at.the court disapproved that practice and overruled those cases,stating that bankruptcy courts must confirm a plan proposing the discharge of a student loan debt without a determination of undue hardship in an adversary proceeding unless the creditor timely raises a specific objection.ibid.this,we think,was a step too far.
as espinosa concedes,tr.of oral arg,a chapter plan that proposes to discharge a student loan debt without a determination of undue hardship violates a and a.failure to comply with this requirement should prevent confirmation of the plan even if the creditor fails to object,or to appear in the proceeding at all.see hood,at that is because a instructs a bankruptcy court to confirm a plan only if the court finds,inter alia,that the plan complies with the applicable provisions of the code.a providing that a bankruptcy court shall confirm a plan if the plan complies with the provisions of chapter and with other applicable provisions of this title see johnson home state bank,see also a authorizing b
