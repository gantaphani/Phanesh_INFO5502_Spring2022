adrian and zubin mathai were once business associates of daniel and kathleen warren.after they had a falling out,the mathais sued the warrens and vice versa.before the litigation got very far,the warrens filed for bankruptcy under chapter of the bankruptcy code.their filings indicated that they had essentially no assets available for creditors.skeptical,the mathais filed a complaint to prevent the warrens from obtaining a discharge in bankruptcy on the grounds that the warrens had transferred and concealed property to hinder,delay,or defraud creditors,a a,and had made a false oath or account in the bankruptcy proceeding,id.a a.the bankruptcy court agreed with both grounds and denied a discharge.the warrens appealed to the tenth circuit bankruptcy appellate panel bap,which affirmed the denial of a discharge under a a and did not reach the a a claim.the warrens now seek relief in this court,but we agree with the bap.on the record before it the bankruptcy court could properly find that the warrens had engaged in a variety of unreported or otherwise deceitful transactions whose overriding purpose was to prevent the mathais from recovering any money from the warrens bankruptcy estate.
background and proceedings below 
we begin with a brief history of the warrens business relationship with the mathais,which suggests the warrens motivation for their actions.and warren are both certified public accountants.he was licensed in and has years experience with big five accounting firms.she was licensed in.in warren,through his company,general business services,began performing accounting services for sypro,llc,owned and operated by brothers adrian and zubin mathai.sypro helped webmasters charge customers for internet usage through billings.it processed the transactions through a merchant account,an account with a bank that provides a business with the means to handle transactions.the customer paid sypro after deducting its share of the payment,sypro would remit the balance to the website owner.
in march sypro lost its merchant account,and sypro and adrian mathai were placed in mastercard terminated merchant file.this halted all sypro business activity.warren proposed the creation of a new company,llc.as the bankruptcy court observed,globill was formed with the purpose of carry ing on sypro business,resolv ing the merchant account issue,and conceal ing the mathai brothers affiliation with the merchant account process.mem.decision.at.vol.at.citations to the.vol.at,will refer to pages of the decision rather than pages of the appendix.warren was managing member and chief executive officer,warren was chief financial officer,adrian mathai was director of operations,and zubin mathai served as senior programmer.on paper warren associates owned globill.but according to the mathais,warren had advised them that they were the true owners,that all invested funds were subject to adrian oversight,and that the warrens involvement was solely for administrative purposes.the mathais were granted a permanent option to acquire of globill.
although globill customer base was growing,by august warren notified the mathais that it was experiencing severe cash shortages.the mathais claimed that warren demanded that they make cash contributions to cover operating expenses and repeatedly threatened to take globill into bankruptcy if the deposits were not made.the mathais became suspicious of the warrens management of globill and hired a private investigator to pose as a prospective purchaser of the company.based on the investigator report,the mathais concluded that the warrens were embezzling money from globill,including million that belonged to webmasters for whom globill processed online payments.
on september,the mathais filed suit in pennsylvania state court,asserting various claims apparently including fraud,conversion,and breach of contract against the warrens.also,as globill administrators they began to redirect its revenues to an account,effectively stopping globill cash flow.although the mathais allege that on september,they exercised their option to purchase globill,warren caused globill to sue the mathais in october in federal court in california for,among other things,damages and an injunction barring them from diverting globill revenue.the mathais voluntarily dismissed their complaint in pennsylvania,choosing instead to assert their claims as claims against the warrens in the california litigation.
on march,about four months before the california trial was set to begin,the mathais and warrens met with a magistrate judge for a settlement conference.the warrens had already incurred substantial legal expenses and anticipated that they would not be able to continue to pay for the litigation.they offered to pay the mathais and drop all their claims in return for the dismissal of all claims against them.the mathais rejected the offer warren was frustrated and upset.
perhaps at the suggestion of the magistrate judge,the warrens met with bankruptcy counsel two or three days later.the lawyer explained that if they filed for bankruptcy,certain assets would be surrendered to a trustee for liquidation to pay creditors and certain assets would be exempt and thus not seized.according to the bankruptcy court,warren did not believe that the warrens owed the mathai brothers and she did not want any of their assets liquidated by the chapter trustee to pay the disputed claim.at.by the time the warrens filed their chapter petition on april,it appeared that this goal had been accomplished.during the prior months they had sold various assets,spent about,acquired assets exempt from creditors claims,and left themselves with cash on hand.we now describe the warrens relevant financial transactions in more detail.
in late december,before the settlement conference and the meeting with bankruptcy counsel,the warrens refinanced their home about went directly to companies,and they received in cash.the warrens testified that they used most of the cash to pay the california attorneys,leaving them with.on march,the warrens purchased a more modest home for under a contract with the seller,brooke roney.they made a cash down payment and received a credit toward the purchase price by transferring a portion of the warrens collection of coins to roney brother,burke more on the coin collection later.as part of the agreement,brooke agreed to spend on repairs.the warrens also spent to in repairs.
after meeting with bankruptcy counsel in march,the warrens obtained additional cash by selling various personal property in transactions not questioned by the mathais.on march they sold a gmc truck for.eight days later they sold two more vehicles for.between april and they sold jewelry for,a piano for,and miscellaneous property for.
what the warrens did with the cash from the above transactions plus essentially all their cash from bank accounts appears less innocent.in particular,during the month preceding their bankruptcy filing they prepaid about in expenses.the prepayments included in property taxes and for four months of payments on their new home over in health insurance premiums for a family policy for dental insurance in health insurance premiums for warren mother for home and auto insurance and in prepaid malpractice premiums.the warrens also prepaid creditors including questar,provo utilities,qwest,and chase manhattan bank.such prepayments were unusual for the warrens.although the warrens,as cpas,surely knew that the prepayments were assets at trial they both acknowledged that they knew that prepayment of insurance was an asset,the prepayments were not listed on their original schedules filed with the bankruptcy court on may.the prepayments were uncovered in late june when the mathais conducted an examination of the warrens finances,see fed.and not until july the mathais had filed their complaint seeking denial of the warrens the warrens amend their schedules to reflect payments to creditors even then,the prepayments were not reported as assets but only as payments to creditors and the prepayment of health insurance for warren mother a gift,not an asset and prepayment of property taxes were still not reported in any fashion.the warrens were later refunded some of the prepayments,including in refunded property taxes when they returned their new home to brooke roney for in september.
much of the cash obtained by the warrens was used to acquire assets that they then apparently undervalued so that they would come within the statutory limits for exempt property.utah law permits a debtor to claim an exemption for a motor vehicle,but only up to.see utah code ann.the warrens may,bankruptcy schedule listed two vehicles one for each of them as exempt,one valued at and the other at.yet they purchased the vehicle on march for and spent on april for vehicle repairs and improvements.likewise,they bought the vehicle on march for and between march and april spent an additional for repairs and improvements.thus,they valued the two vehicles at a total of despite having spent on them in the prior seven weeks.it is also worth noting that the warrens used some of their accumulated cash to purchase items protected from creditors by utah uncapped exemption for provisions sufficient for months actually provided for individual and family use.id.a viii.during the month before filing their bankruptcy petition they spent on groceries,on clothes,and on a mattress.
the warrens apparent undervaluing of assets to keep them under the statutory caps extended to assets acquired before the warrens met with bankruptcy counsel.for example,utah code ann.provides a exemption for implements,professional books,or tools of the trade.under this provision the warrens claimed as exempt computers,which they valued at in total despite having paid for the used computers seven months earlier.section d provides a exemption for heirlooms or other items of particular sentimental value.under this exemption they claimed wedding rings valued at,a pearl necklace valued at,a gold ring valued at,a chair from spain valued at,and five paintings valued at a total of.section a provides a exemption for sofas,chairs,and related furnishings reasonably necessary for one household.under this exemption the warrens claimed over items,including tvs valued at total,china valued at,crystal valued at,a stereo valued at,and a treadmill and stairmaster valued at total.as a result,the warrens only nonexempt tangible property consisted of sports,camping,and yard equipment household tools a third automobile and a few pieces of furniture.
the conduct on which the bankruptcy court ruling most relied related to the warrens coin collection.warren testified at trial that he had collected coins all his life and began selling them at the end of.according to the schedules submitted by the warrens,in he sold coins for,at a profit of,and in he sold coins for,at a profit of.apparently he had bought many of the coins on.in,however,during the four months before filing for bankruptcy he sold the remainder of the collection including coins purchased for in february for only,at a loss of.one of those sales occurred about two weeks after first consulting with bankruptcy counsel warren transferred coins to burke roney for a credit toward the purchase of the new home from burke brother brooke.although warren told burke that the coins were worth,he had spent to acquire them.warren testified that she had maintained a quickbooks register to record coin transactions and the revenue generated,but the warrens failed to describe,in their bankruptcy schedules or other documents,when,where,for what amount,or to whom the coins were sold.at.warren testified that he kept no inventory or bill of sale for the coin transaction with burke roney.
at trial the warrens denied any intent to conceal property or to hinder or defraud creditors.as summarized by the bankruptcy court,they explained that when they made various sales and purchases just before filing they were simply trying to position themselves to support their family and grow their new business.id.at.they excused the errors on their forms on the grounds that warren was busy because it was tax season and they both were busy preparing bankruptcy filings for two entities and contemplating a third.and they argued that in any event their july amendments to their schedules cured any previous errors.
the bankruptcy court was not persuaded.rejecting the warrens explanation for their various transactions,it said t he warrens readily obtained employment just after filing for bankruptcy protection at wages more than sufficient to meet their family expenses.this tends to prove that their alleged panic about being able to provide for their family was not credible.id.at.and the bankruptcy court saw no innocent explanation for the warrens failure to report their transactions properly in their bankruptcy schedules.the court said that their excuses do not ring true and that there was significant evidence that the omissions were intentional and designed to defraud.id.at.it explained 
warren excuses the omissions by explaining that the bankruptcy documents were prepared during tax season,yet warren failed to offer any evidence that he was,in fact,busy preparing tax returns and consequently could not focus on the accuracy of his bankruptcy papers.his accountancy specialty lies in tax compliance and planning but he testified he billed his clients on a flat monthly fee for accounting work.warren indicated she simply was not thinking of some of the payments that had been made and the omissions were inadvertent.neither debtor made an excuse for the omissions of the coin transactions 
the debtors testified that warren met numerous times with their attorney and that warren made multiple calls to discuss the schedules with their attorney,so they can not argue they did not understand what information to include in the schedule of assets and the schedules.the warrens have technical training as accountants and as such,admit that they understand that prepaid insurance is an asset unlike a debtor who is inexperienced with financial affairs or one who relies on incorrect advice or information in preparing his statements and schedules,the warrens are sophisticated with degrees in accounting and significant finance experience.
the warrens keep meticulous records including detailed paper and computer records of their financial affairs that should have provided the answers necessary to accurately complete their bankruptcy documents.a simple sort of the computer data will indicate payments made within days of filing.for those numerous transactions made by the warrens in cash and allegedly not recorded in their computer program an odd circumstance for transactions involving large sums of money,they eventually produced a large quantity of cash register receipts and other data including items so small as a cash receipt for for the purchase of nose hair trimmers.the evidence indicates the information was available to assist the warrens in compiling their papers.they prepared a list of creditors which amounts to four and a quarter inches thick stack of paper so that all possible contingent debt would be included in their discharge.the debtors knew how to be inclusive and were quite accurate when it suited them.
the assertion that the debtors were either too busy or just forgot to list their coin transactions or the payments to creditors is simply not credible.they sold their coin collection at a drastic loss,unlike the transactions in prior years.the sale was made,in part,to fulfill their desire to purchase a new home with equity for a homestead exemption.just prior to filing,the warrens converted almost every asset they could into cash and spent significant amounts in a calculated effort to maximize every exemption to which they were entitled.in just one day,three days prior to filing,they made purchases at eight different stores.they prepaid insurance,mortgage payments,taxes,and utilities in a manner they had never done before.all in all,these were extraordinary transactions in every respect.the warrens can not credibly argue that the matters were so routine they forgot to list them.nor can they argue that the transactions were so remote in time that they forgot.
id.at footnotes omitted.the court also rejected the claim that the amen
