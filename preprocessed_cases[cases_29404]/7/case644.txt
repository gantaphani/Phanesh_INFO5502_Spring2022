these consolidated cases demonstrate,unfortunately,how the good and useful ends of the bankruptcy process can be badly abused.the chapter petition filed by the debtor,premier automotive services,pressed a variety of claims intended,not for the legitimate purposes of bankruptcy,but to invoke the automatic stay and other bankruptcy code protections in order to forestall eviction on an obviously expired lease.the bankruptcy court dismissed the petition,finding that premier had filed it in bad faith,solely to prevent the state from evicting the debtor from the state property,and as a means to the end of tying up the state in endless,fruitless litigation.the district court affirmed,noting that while premier constitutional claims abound in legal creativity,they generally lack legal merit.we agree with both courts and affirm the judgment.
this dispute arises out of a commercial lease of approximately six and one half acres of land lot owned by the maryland port administration mpa and located on dundalk marine terminal on the baltimore waterfront.premier automotive services premier is an motor vehicle company which processes trucks,as well as heavy military,agricultural,and construction equipment through dundalk marine terminal.premier has been operating on lot for over forty years under a variety of leases and is the current possessor of lot.at the beginning of its occupancy,premier constructed a building on lot which contains an office,body shop,paint shop,and washline.
defendant mpa is an agency of the state of maryland which oversees and operates port facilities,transp.f lexisnexis.mpa purpose is to increase the waterborne commerce of maryland ports,and,by doing so,to benefit maryland residents.id.c.in this,the agency is granted statutory authority to lease port facilities to private parties like premier.id.i.
premier automotive services most recent lease for lot was executed in july and expired on june.before the july lease expired,mpa met with premier to discuss lease renewal,and tendered to premier a lease.premier objected to a vehicle throughput requirement,which required premier to guarantee that it would move vehicles per acre per year through lot,and the lease was never executed.premier did not,however,quit the premises after the old lease expired.instead,premier remained in possession of lot as a holdover tenant on a basis.
in february,following a year and a half of unsuccessful negotiations over a lease,mpa offered premier a lease.the february lease did not contain a throughput requirement.premier again rejected mpa proposal,deeming the lease unacceptable because it would not provide stability.
in april of,after further lease negotiations,mpa offered premier a lease with two renewal options.in response to premier throughput objection,mpa informed premier that it had committed every vehicle tenant at the dundalk marine terminal and other facilities to a throughput that makes the most efficient and effective use of our limited terminal land.in mpa view,the vehicle per acre per year requirement allocated to premier was more than achievable since the acreage used to calculate the guarantee is less than of lot.mpa requested that premier execute the lease by april.
on april,mpa wrote to premier expressing frustration over the parties failure to come to terms on a new lease.the april letter informed premier that the maryland port administration was extending the signing deadline for the april lease until may,but noted that the lease must be signed by that date.the parties,however,failed once again to reach agreement.
on january,mpa entered into a lease with pasha automotive services pasha for acreage on the dundalk marine terminal,and,on june,lot was designated for pasha.pasha committed to a minimum throughput of vehicles per acre on each of lot acres and also agreed to a relocation clause,which gave mpa the discretion to move pasha to another location on the dundalk marine terminal at mpa expense.
in march,the maryland department of transportation advised premier that mpa had entered into a long term lease with another lot.and,on march,mpa sent premier a letter which terminated premier tenancy effective may.mpa subsequently offered premier a extension until june,in exchange for premier waiving any objection the company had to vacating lot.premier declined the offer.
on april,premier filed a chapter bankruptcy petition in federal bankruptcy court in the district of maryland.premier invoked the automatic stay provisions of a,and alleged,in a related adversary proceeding,a variety of constitutional violations against mpa,of the maryland department of transportation robert flanagan,and mpa executive director brooks royster,iii.the bankruptcy court held two evidentiary hearings,and then granted mpa motion for summary judgment in the adversary action,ordered the automatic stay lifted,and dismissed premier chapter petition.more specifically,the bankruptcy court held that premier had filed the bankruptcy petition in bad faith for the sole purpose of halting delaying premier ultimate eviction from the terminal by mpa.the court also dismissed the petition on the grounds that an expired lease was not property of the estate under b a bankruptcy court has no authority to resuscitate a lease of real property that expired by its own terms prepetition,the court wrote.premier appealed to federal district court.
while the bankruptcy proceedings were pending,premier filed a complaint with the federal maritime commission fmc based upon the same facts underlying the bankruptcy case.premier alleged a number of violations of the federal shipping act.see app.d,now codified at c.the administrative law judge dismissed the petition on sovereign immunity grounds.premier appealed that decision to the fmc,where it remains pending.following dismissal of its fmc petition,premier filed its second action in federal district court seeking injunctive relief pending final judgment on the fmc appeal pursuant to.h.
the district court consolidated the bankruptcy appeal and the fmc complaint.the district court then affirmed the bankruptcy court grant of summary judgment against premier finding that premier constitutional claims are unsupportable.the court then concluded that,because these unsupportable claims were the only property of the bankruptcy estate claimed by premier,the petition must be dismissed and the automatic stay lifted.finally,the district court dismissed premier shipping act complaint for injunctive relief based in part on its conclusion that premier clear ly could not demonstrat e its entitlement to an injunction.premier now appeals.
we must determine as an initial matter whether the bankruptcy court properly dismissed premier chapter petition as a bad faith filing and an abuse of the bankruptcy process.we review the bankruptcy court ultimate finding that the filing was not in good faith as one of fact subject to the clearly erroneous standard.carolin miller,cir.
the right to file a chapter bankruptcy petition is conditioned upon the debtor good absence of which is cause for summary dismissal.id.at.bank charfoos in re charfoos,cir.indeed,the ability of a bankruptcy court to conduct a threshold inquiry into the good faith of a petitioner is indispensable to proper accomplishment of the basic purposes of chapter protection.carolin,at.as this court has explained,a good faith requirement prevents abuse of the bankruptcy process by debtors whose overriding motive is to delay creditors without benefitting them in any way or to achieve reprehensible purposes.id.quoting in re little creek dev,cir.the good faith standard also protects the jurisdictional integrity of the bankruptcy courts by rendering their powerful equitable weapons,avoidance of liens,discharge of debts,marshaling and turnover of assets available only to those debtors and creditors with clean hands.id.quoting in re little creek dev,at.
in this circuit,a lack of good faith in filing a chapter petition requires a showing of objective futility and subjective bad faith.id.at.the objective test focuses on whether there exists the realistic possibility of an effective reorganization.see carolin,at quoting in re albany partners,cir id.at see also in re coleman,cir.the subjective test asks whether a chapter petition is motivated by an honest intent to effectuate reorganization or is instead motivated by some improper purpose.carolin,at.subjective bad faith is shown where a petition is filed to abuse the reorganization process,or to cause hardship or to delay creditors by resort to the chapter device merely for the purpose of invoking the automatic stay.id.
premier contends that the bankruptcy court erred in dismissing its petition as a bad faith filing under the criteria set forth in carolin miller,cir.in premier view,its litigation strategy presents a clear path towards reorganization of its,a reasonable and fair offer of a lease.and,premier asserts,it is clear that premier filed for protection under chapter in good faith because premier needs lot and the building,or their functional equivalent,in order to be in business.
we disagree.there is substantial evidence in the record that supports the bankruptcy court findings of both objective futility and subjective bad faith.with respect to carolin objective futility inquiry,premier clearly had no realistic possibility of an effective reorganization.carolin,at.premier in fact never filed a proposed plan of reorganization.instead,premier maintains that its plan for reorganization is this litigation.quite apart from the fact that premier had no cognizable property interest in its expired lease of lot,see chesapeake bank monro,and no right to judicially compelled negotiations,see infra part,its strategy was,as the bankruptcy court found,wholly illusory.indeed,even if premier were somehow to get the relief it requests,that relief would not lead to an effective reorganization.thus,the bankruptcy court concluded that premier lease dispute belonged in the state of maryland courts and there is no possible mechanism in bankruptcy by which the debtor can achieve a legitimate reorganization.
with respect to carolin second prong of subjective bad faith,the record also supports the bankruptcy court finding that premier filed its petition for an impermissible purpose.premier had no demonstrable need to reorganize when it filed the petition it was not,the bankruptcy court found,even experiencing financial difficulties.indeed,premier bankruptcy filings reveal a solvent business entity with no unsecured creditors and few,if any,secured creditors.this fact alone may justify dismissal of premier chapter petition.as one of our sister circuits has noted,courts have consistently dismissed chapter petitions filed by financially healthy companies with no need to reorganize under the protection of chapter.in re sgl carbon,cir citing cases.
beyond premier solvency,other circumstances support the bankruptcy court finding of subjective bad faith.the bankruptcy court found that premier only nemesis was mpa and that it was not the failure of the state to negotiate in good faith that created the impasse between the parties,but the inability of the parties to come to terms on a new lease.the court further found that premier adversary claims against mpa were dependent upon its right to a lease of lot matter of state contract law.premier did not,however,choose to avail itself of the obvious state law remedies before bringing its chapter petition,providing further evidence of bad faith.the filing of premier bankruptcy petition also supports the bankruptcy court ruling.premier filed its petition on april,one day before the company was legally obligated to quit the premises.
in light of all this evidence,the bankruptcy court concluded that premier filed the instant bankruptcy case for the sole purpose of halting delaying its ultimate eviction from the terminal by mpa,to compel the maryland port administration to execute a new lease to the debtor on terms more favorable than those the state found acceptable,and as a means to the end of tying up the state in endless,fruitless litigation.holding an asset hostage is not a permissible use of the bankruptcy process,however.chapter is not a procedural vehicle which may be commandeered solely for the purpose of invoking its automatic stay.carolin,at.the bankruptcy court properly assessed premier chapter filing under the carolin criteria and properly found it wanting.
aside from this general deficiency,premier bankruptcy petition was properly dismissed on the particular grounds that property of the estate does not include,and the automatic stay does not apply to,an expired lease of nonresidential property.a mere possessory interest under an expired lease is insufficient to trigger an automatic stay under a.see b.section excludes from its protections nonresidential real property leases that expire before the commencement of or during a case.the statute provides,in part 
the filing of a petition does not operate as a stay of any act by a lessor to the debtor under a lease of nonresidential real property that has terminated by the expiration of the stated term of the lease before the commencement of or during a case under this title to obtain possession of such property.
here,premier lease expired on june,and premier remained as a holdover tenant,whose tenancy was terminable at the will of the state of maryland as landlord.see,real property lexisnexis.on march,mpa informed premier that its tenancy would end effective may.thus any leasehold interest that premier had in lot expired on that day.since b excludes nonresidential real property leases that expire before the commencement of or during a case from section a automatic stay provisions,premier lot lease is not subject to those provisions.
moreover,b excepts from property of the estate any interest a debtor has in a nonresidential lease that has terminated at the expiration of the stated term of such lease.b.it provides that 
property of the estate ceases to include any interest of the debtor as a lessee under a lease of nonresidential real property that has terminated at the expiration of the stated term of such lease during the case.
id.here,because premier tenancy expired on may,the bankruptcy estate cease d to include any interest that premier had in the lot lease on that day.in sum,since an expired lease is neither property of the estate nor subject to section a automatic stay provisions,see b,b,we must affirm the district court dismissal of the bankruptcy petition and its order lifting the automatic stay.
premier contends that it may nonetheless maintain its bankruptcy lot interests the constitutional claims asserted in its adversary action are property of the bankruptcy estate.the courts below,however,properly recognized premier constitutional claims as unsupportable attempts to circumvent the bankruptcy law various bars to premier filing.
the first count of premier adversary complaint alleges that mpa denied it a property interest without due process of law in violation of the fourteenth amendment.premier no longer argues that it has a property interest in the expired lease or the building located on lot.instead,premier now claims a constitutional property interest in the right to fair negotiations with the state in the leasing of property and in the right to do business.it is elementary that p roperty interests are not created by the constitution.bd.of regents roth,d.rather,they must arise from an independent source such as state or understandings that secure certain benefits and that support claims of entitlements to those benefits.id.
it is anything but clear that maryland would recognize a right to fair negotiation in the absence of an existing contract.see,abt,jhpiego,d,parker columbia bank,motz,holding that although a duty of good faith and fair dealing may be implied in certain contracts,this duty only requires a party to the contract to exercise good faith in performing its contractual obligations.in all events,there is no property right in one negotiating party to have another agree to contract on commercially disadvantageous terms.the essence of premier claim is simply that mpa would not agree to what it,at most,is a unilateral expectation which the supreme court has held does not create a constitutional property interest.
