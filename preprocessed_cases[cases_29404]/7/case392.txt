this appeal raises the question whether the conversion of a bankruptcy case from chapter to chapter triggers a new period for filing objections to property claimed as exempt during the chapter proceeding.we hold that it does not.this is a question of first impression in the courts of appeals 
wayne bell,the debtor appeals from the judgment of the united states district court for the district of vermont garvan murtha,affirming an order of the united states bankruptcy court for the district of vermont francis conrad.on conversion of the debtor case from chapter to chapter,the chapter trustee filed an objection to certain assets previously claimed as exempt by the debtor,on the ground that,in claiming the exemption,the debtor had undervalued them.the bankruptcy court sustained the trustee objection,rejecting debtor argument that,because the objection was not filed within days after the conclusion of the meeting of creditors in the chapter proceeding,it was untimely under fed.b.on review,the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court order,holding that the conversion of a case from chapter to chapter triggers a new period for objections to exemptions,running from the conclusion of the meeting of creditors.we disagree.
because the rules require not only that objections be filed within days of the conclusion of the meeting of creditors,see rule b l,but also that the meeting of creditors itself be convened within days of the order for relief,see rule b,rule a,and because conversion does not change the date of the order for relief,see a,we conclude that conversion does not reset the limitations period for filing objections to a debtor claimed exemptions.a new period for objections furthermore would be incompatible with the debtor substantive property rights in property timely exempted under l.we,therefore,hold that the conversion of a case from chapter to chapter does not initiate a new period for objections to exemptions claimed during the chapter proceeding 
applying this rule of law to the undisputed facts of this case we conclude the last date for timely objection to debtor claimed exemptions was june,the chapter trustee objection to debtor exemption,filed on november,was untimely as of june,by operation of l,the property claimed as exempt was exempt therefore,it no longer formed part of the estate and had revested in the debtor,free of claims.
accordingly,we vacate the district court judgment and remand.
background 
a.the facts and proceedings below 
the facts are straightforward and not in dispute.on june,wayne bell,the debtor filed a petition for bankruptcy under chapter.the debtor elected to take his state law exemptions pursuant to b.among the assets that he claimed as exempt on his schedule c filing were shares in rockwell quality,rockwell,a vermont corporation,of which he is the principal officer and director,and which operates a small restaurant in manchester,vermont,known as the quality.the debtor valued these shares at and claimed the whole as exempt under vermont catchall exemption.see.stat.ann.tit,
on august,the united states trustee convened a meeting of creditors pursuant to a the original meeting.the representative of the united states trustee examined the debtor and the meeting was then adjourned to november.the meeting was never reconvened but on may,when the debtor filed his plan and disclosure statement the clerk entered on the docket sheet the notation terminate deadline re first meeting.it is undisputed that no objection was raised to the exemptions claimed by the debtor during these chapter proceedings.
on september,the case was converted to a chapter proceeding,pursuant to b,and an interim chapter trustee was appointed,pursuant to.on october,another meeting of creditors was convened the meeting.this meeting was adjourned to november.
on november,is,days after the conclusion of the original chapter trustee filed an objection to the debtor claimed exemption of the shares of rockwell stock on the ground that the debtor had underestimated their value.at a hearing on january,the bankruptcy court sustained the trustee objection to the exemption the court rejected the debtor argument that,because the objection had not been filed within thirty days of the original meeting of creditors,it was untimely the bankruptcy court entered a written order to this effect on january.on review,the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court,holding that when a bankruptcy proceeding is converted from a chapter proceeding to a chapter proceeding,a new objection period begins to run from the conclusion of the meeting of creditors.see bell obuchowski in re bell,slip op.at.june.debtor appealed 
relevant law 
when an individual debtor petitions for bankruptcy he is entitled to claim certain property as exempt from the estate.see b allowing debtor to elect to take exemptions provided by state or federal law id.l requiring debtor to file list of property claimed as exempt fed.a.any creditor and the bankruptcy trustee may file objections to the debtor list of property claimed as exempt.see fed.b however,absent special circumstances,these objections must be filed within days after the conclusion of the meeting of creditors held pursuant to rule a.id.if no objections are made,then the property claimed as exempt is exempt.l.
the bankruptcy code provides that w ithin a reasonable time after the order for relief in a case under this title,the united states trustee shall convene and preside at a meeting of creditors.a.rule a of the rules of bankruptcy procedure requires a meeting of creditors to be held no fewer than and no more than days after the order for relief.the commencement of a voluntary case under chapter constitutes an order for relief.see.the conversion of a case initially brought under one chapter of the bankruptcy code to a case under another chapter also constitutes an order for relief under the chapter to which the case is converted,but generally does not effect a change in the date of the order for relief.a.
on conversion,the bankruptcy rules expressly provide that a new time period shall commence for the filing of claims,pursuant to fed,for the filing of a complaint objecting to discharge,pursuant to fed,and for the filing of a complaint to obtain a determination of dischargeability,pursuant to fed.see fed.however,rule includes no reference to a new period for the filing of objections to a debtor claimed exemptions,pursuant to fed.b.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
in an appeal from a district court review of a bankruptcy court ruling,our review of the bankruptcy court is independent and plenary.see fcc nextwave personal communications,in re nextwave personal communications,cir per curiam.we accept its factual findings unless clearly erroneous,but review its conclusions of law de novo.see id.
the debtor argues that the plain meaning of l read together with rule b controls the outcome of this case unless timely objections are filed,property claimed as exempt is exempt.here,there is no dispute that no objections were filed within days of the original meeting of creditors and no extension of that time limit was sought or obtained.see fed.b.therefore,he argues the property was exempt.see l.
if the case had been in chapter or chapter since its inception and had involved no conversion,this argument would be unassailable.the bankruptcy rules expressly limit a bankruptcy court from extending the time period for objections,except as provided in rule b itself.see fed.b the court may enlarge the time for taking action under rule b only to the extent and under the conditions stated in that rule.by its terms rule b allows an extension of the time period for filing objections only if the extension is granted within the period itself in taylor freeland kronz,d,the supreme court interpreted l and rule b strictly,holding that a chapter trustee could not contest the validity of a claimed exemption once the period for objections had run and no extension had been obtained within that period,notwithstanding that the debtor had no colorable basis for claiming the exemption.the supreme court opined deadlines may lead to unwelcome results,but they prompt parties to act and they produce finality.taylor,at.were this a simple chapter case,therefore,the trustee objections would be barred as untimely under the bankruptcy rules themselves and binding precedent.
however,the appellee and the dissent argue that conversion from chapter to chapter produces a different result.see appellee br.at.because taylor did not concern a conversion between two chapters of the bankruptcy code,they argue that its holding does not compel any particular result in this case.see dis.op.post at see also in re de kleinman,the taylor case,however,did not address the effect of a conversion and the holding in taylor does not dictate the outcome of this case.in re havanec,taylor does not purport to determine which meeting of creditors determines the period for objections in a conversion case.while we concede that taylor does not directly control this case,both it and the strictures of rule counsel that courts should be wary of modifying the operation of rule b for policy reasons they deem expedient.in re brown.
appellee contends that conversion gives rise to a new period for objections.textually,the argument for a new period for objections begins with fed.b,which provides that objections may be filed within days after the conclusion of the meeting of creditors held pursuant to rule a.in turn,fed.a requires that a meeting of creditors shall be held no fewer than and no more than days after the order for relief.see also a providing that united states trustee shall convene a meeting of creditors w ithin a reasonable time after the order for relief.the conversion of a case from chapter to chapter constitutes an order for relief.a.appellee,therefore,argues that because the conversion is an order for relief,it requires the convening of a new meeting of creditors,and because the time period for objections is counted from the conclusion of the meeting of creditors,the text of the bankruptcy code and rules plainly requires a new time period for objections when a case converts.put simply,because there is a new meeting of creditors there is a new period to object.
we do not deny the superficial appeal of this reasoning.it was adopted by the lower courts and the dissent argues vigorously that we affirm it on appeal.see dis.op.post at.the same reasoning has been endorsed by several bankruptcy courts.see,in re havanec,at in re de kleinman,at matter of bergen,larossa leydet in re leydet.we reject it because we find it incompatible with both the language and the purposes of the code.
the bankruptcy code presents three significant bars to appellee reading the meeting was not a meeting of creditors held pursuant to rule a,fed.b,in that it was not convened within days of the order of relief the period for objections is not within the specifically enumerated exceptions to the general rule that the date of the order for relief is unaffected by conversion,see a,b,therefore this limitations period remains unaffected by conversion and allowing a new objections period is incompatible with the previously effected exemption of the debtor property under l and impermissibly allows a procedural rule to abridge a substantive right,see.we develop each of these arguments below.
we,therefore,can not agree with the dissent that this case presents a choice between two policy positions,both with strong textual support.dis.op.post at.we hold that when a case is converted from chapter to chapter there is no new period to object to previously claimed exemptions.while we reach this conclusion on the basis of statutory construction alone,we also find unpersuasive those lower courts that have held that our conclusion ignores the policy of the code and the practicalities of its administration.
statutory construction 
the meeting was not a meeting of creditors held pursuant to rule a 
read l iterally,in re havanec,at,neither rule b nor rule a supports the appellee argument.see also dis.op.post at.although it is true that a conversion constitutes an order for relief under a,that very section also states that a conversion does not effect a change in the date of the order for relief.id.emphasis added.here,debtor voluntary filing of a petition under chapter on june,constituted an order for relief.see.the date of that order for relief was the date of the commencement of the voluntary case.see id.under section a,conversion leaves that date unchanged accordingly,all provisions of the code that are keyed to that date are also unaffected by conversion.see f m marquette bank richards,cir collier on bankruptcy,at lawrence king,ed.the time periods for holding a meeting of creditors established by section a and rule a are keyed to the order for relief.hence,a meeting of creditors convened pursuant to rule a is convened within days subject to extension to of the order for this case,within or days of the commencement of the voluntary case under chapter,on june.the meeting of creditors was not convened until october,sixteen months after the order for relief.in this case,the meeting of creditors held pursuant to rule a referred to in rule b was the original meeting,convened on august,shortly after the commencement of the chapter case,and not the meeting convened over a year later after the conversion to chapter.
we therefore reject the construction that r ead literally,rule permits two periods during which objections may be made to exemptions claimed by a debtor.in re havanec,at.because there is one date of the order for relief regardless of conversion,see a,there can be only one deadline or days from that date for the meeting of creditors held pursuant to rule a.any appeal to rule b is therefore unavailing,because rule b allows as timely filed only those objections filed within days after the conclusion of the meeting of creditors held pursuant to rule a.see in re halbert,holding that meeting of creditors required to elect chapter trustee,pursuant to,is not meeting of creditors pursuant to rule a.here,the only meeting convened within that time period was the original meeting.therefore,rule b time period for objections began to run from the date of the conclusion of that meeting,from may.any objection to exemptions filed after june,was therefore untimely.because the chapter trustee objection was not filed until november,it was untimely 
appellee reading is not authorized by any of the specifically enumerated exceptions to the general rule that the date of the order for relief is unaffected by conversion 
rule expressly provides that conversion triggers new time periods for filings under rules,and.it does not provide for a new time period for filing objections to exemptions under rule b.debtor and appellee dispute the significance of this silence.debtor argues that the exclusion of rule b from rule precise listing of new time periods must be taken to be intentional and to preclude any similar treatment of the time period for objections under rule b.debtor argues that such an extension would be an unwarranted expansion of the exclusive list provided in rule.appellee responds that not to allow the extension is an unwarranted restriction of the plain meaning of rule b,in that disallowing the extension limits the meaning of meeting of creditors to only the first meeting of creditors in a converted case.see in re leydet,at.according to this argument,rule makes no reference to extending the time periods under rule b because the meaning of meeting of creditors so plainly embraces any meeting of creditors that the reference was unnecessary.in re leydet,at see also in re havanec,at for all that appears,the draftsmen of rule might well have concluded that the language of rule b was sufficiently clear to assure that the trustee could object to claims following the conclusion of the chapter creditors meeting after the case had been converted.accord dis.op.post at.
we reject appellee argument.first,as noted above,the text of rule b does not refer to any meeting of creditors but rather the meeting of creditors held pursuant to rule a.as explained above,that restriction limits the time period for objections to days following the conclusion of a meeting of creditors convened within or days of the order for relief.second,rule is intended to implement and can not be construed independently of that section.to understand rule we must look to section.
the purpose of section is to preserve actions already taken in the case before conversion.see kepler independence bank matter of ford,the express intent of bankruptcy rule which implements section is to preserve any action taken in the case prior to conversion collier on bankruptcy,at id.app,at reproducing advisory committee note to rule this rule implements of the code the rule is not intended to invalidate any action taken in the superseded case before its conversion to chapter.
in short,section is designed to avoid precisely the resetting of deadlines and the reopening of limitations periods that the appellee advocates.to effect this purpose,section a establishes the general rule that,in a converted case,the dates of the filing,the commencement of the case and the order for relief remain unchanged by the conversion,except as expressly provided in subsections b and c.as to the order for relief,subsections b and c enumerate specific exceptions to the general rule,setting out those sections where in a converted case the date of the conversion shall serve as the date of the order for relief under this chapter.in turn,rule can give effect only to these enumerated exceptions to the general rule neither section nor section b providing for the election of the chapter trustee a t the meeting of creditors held under section is among these enumerated exceptions.moreover,subsection c set out in the shows that congress knew how to draft precisely the language necessary to apply a general administrative rule section in the special context of a converted case,such that deadlines keyed to the meeting of creditors were reset to run from the date of conversion.we can not regard it as accidental or unintentional that congress omitted section from its precisely drafted list of circumstances as to which conversion triggers a new date for the order for relief.unable to point to a provision that supports her position,the appellee implicitly asks us to redraft the code to include a provision that is conspicuously absent.it would be inappropriate to do so 
the reach of rule is circumscribed by.rule fails to mention rule b not because the language of rule b is so clear that it need not be expressly listed among the rules with deadlines extended on conversion,see dis.op.post at,but because there is no statutory authorization under section for extending the time to object to claimed exemptions 
a new objections period is incompatible with the substantive effect of l and impermissibly allows a procedural rule to abridge a substantive right 
united savings ass timbers of inwood forest associates,d,teaches that s tatutory construction is a holistic endeavor.even if the code and rules left it ambiguous as they do not whether conversion resets the deadline for objections under rule b,only the conclusion that it does not produces a substantive effect that is compatible with the rest of the law.timbers of inwood forest,at.because the result advocated by the appellee and the dissent conflicts with law on the effect of l on the debtor property rights,we must reject it 
the voluntary,joint,or involuntary filing of a petition under an applicable chapter of the code constitutes a commencement of the case and creates an estate comprised,except as otherwise provided,of all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.a.thereafter,the property of the estate is distinct from the property of the debtor.property acquired by the estate after the commencement of the case,see a,together with p roceeds,product,offspring,rents,or profits of or from property of the estate,id.a,is property of the estate.but property acquired by the debtor does not enter the estate it remains the separate property of the debtor.see casey hochman,cir stating general rule that acquisitions are property of the debtor accord in re winom tool die,see also collier on bankruptcy,at to in general,property subsequently acquired by the debtor does not become property of the estate,but,rather,becomes the debtor personal property,clear of all claims that are discharged in the bankruptcy case.
such property includes property that exits the estate and revests in the debtor through the exemption process.as already noted,the code provides that u nless a party in interest objects to the debtor claim,the property claimed as exempt is exempt.l emphasis added.it is law that the effect of this exemption is to remove property from the estate and to vest it in the debtor.see owen owen,d when property becomes exempt,it is withdrawn from the estate and hence from the creditors for the benefit of the debtor redfield peat,marwick,mitchell in re robertson,the effect of the automatic allowance of a claim of exemption due to expiration of the period is,under case law,to revest the property in the debtor and end its status as property of the estate internal quotation marks and citation omitted accord in re halbert,at collecting cases in re brown,at collecting cases see also turner ermiger in re turner,cir friendly,where a debtor has already reclaimed exempted property from the estate,a dispute over such property is not sufficiently related to the bankruptcy case to sustain federal jurisdiction under the identical predecessor to b.c in chapter,if the debtor does not propose a reorganization plan and the court approves a plan proposed by a creditor,such plan may not provide for the use,sale,or lease of exempted property unless the debtor consents.quite simply,property that has been exempted belongs to the debtor.the subsequent conversion of the bankruptcy case from chapter to chapter does nothing to disturb the debtor rights in that property.
where property has otherwise left the chapter estate and revested in the debtor,courts have had no difficulty in recognizing that conversion to a chapter case does nothing to recapture the property.in re brown,at.under b,the confirmation of a plan vests all of the property of the estate in the debtor.once the property has so vested it does not reenter the chapter estate in the event of conversion.in re winom tool die,at see also carter peoples bank trust in re bnw,once property has vested in reorganized entity pursuant to b it is beyond the bankruptcy court jurisdiction conversion to chapter can neither confer jurisdiction nor vacate the confirmation order and recapture property within the estate.there is no reason why property that has left the estate by virtue of being exempted by the operation l should be treated differently from property that has left the estate by virtue of confirmation of the plan under b.both are now the property of the debtor,form no part of the bankruptcy estate,and are beyond the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court.
in short,for creditors to have a new opportunity to object upon conversion,property previously exempted and revested in the debtor must somehow be restored to the estate.but the appellee identifies no provision in the code that effects the recapture by the estate of previously exempted property upon conversion of a case from chapter to chapter.section does not effect such a reversal.see robb lybrook in re lybrook,section should not be read as a nullification act.it is not designed to change what has gone before but,rather,to leave matters as they exist on the date of conversion,aff,aff cir matter of ford,at the express intent of bankruptcy rule which implements section is to preserve any action taken in the case prior to conversion.collier on bankruptcy,at id.app,at reproducing advisory committee note to rule this rule implements of the code the rule is not intended to invalidate any action taken in the superseded case before its conversion to chapter.
while the general rule is that property acquired by the debtor belongs to the debtor,not to the estate,congress has elsewhere provided exceptions.under some chapters of the bankruptcy not chapter has expressly provided for an expanded definition of property of the estate which includes property acquired by the debtor.thus,chapter providing for family farm reorganizations defines the property of the estate to include in addition to the property specified in section all property of the kind specified in such section that the debtor acquires after the commencement of the case but before the case is closed,dismissed,or converted to a case under chapter of this title.a emphasis added.under this provision,courts held that the estate under chapter included the property acquired by the debtor after filing the petition under chapter but before conversion.see,phillips white in re white,cir upon conversion of a chapter case to a chapter case,the debtor property becomes property of the estate in the chapter case in re mutchler,matter of brownlee.property so acquired would,of course,include any exempt property revested in the debtor.
chapter contains a substantively identical provision.see a accordingly,before most courts of appeals also held that upon conversion from chapter to chapter all property of the chapter property that is part of the chapter estate pursuant to a was included in the chapter estate.see calder job in re calder,cir matter of lybrook,cir posner,armstrong lindberg in re lindberg,cir.but see bobroff continental bank in re bobroff,cir suggesting in dicta that property should not be part of the chapter estate because that would deter the use of chapter.in the bankruptcy reform act of,congress resolved this circuit split,but greatly mitigated the potential impact of,by enacting f.under f,on conversion of the chapter proceeding,property does not form part of the converted the case was converted in bad faith,see f.in cases of bad faith conversion,the converted estate includes all chapter estate property,as defined in,the bad faith converter receives act treatment 
congress has not included in chapter a provision comparable to sections a and a that could include in the estate property acquired by the debtor after the initial petition.see koch myrvold,cir property obtained by the debtor after the original petition in chapter but before conversion to chapter does not belong to the estate.while the provisions of chapter or those of chapter may have lent support to the appellee position had the debtor conversion arisen under one of those chapters,the absence of comparable provisions in chapter compels the contrary result 
therefore,we conclude not only does the appellee position have little foundation in the text of the code,it advocates a result that directly conflicts with the substantive effect of l.moreover,inasmuch as it relies on a procedural b in derogation of the debtor substantive property rights,her argument is expressly barred.see bankruptcy rules shall not abridge,enlarge,or modify any substantive right.
because rule b requires that objections be filed within days of the conclusion of the meeting of creditors held pursuant to rule a,see rule b,and because the meeting of creditors held under rule a must be held within days of the order for relief,see rule a,objections made six months after the conclusion of that meeting of creditors are untimely.and because conversion does not change the date of the order for relief,see a,that conversion does not reset the limitations period for filing objections to a debtor claimed exemptions.further,a new period for objections would derogate a debtor substantive property rights in property timely exempted under l.we therefore hold that the conversion of a case from chapter to chapter does not give rise to a new period to object to the debtor claimed exemptions 
applying this rule of law to the undisputed facts of this case we conclude the last date for timely objection to debtor claimed exemptions was june,the chapter trustee objection to debtor exemptions,filed on november,was untimely as of june,by operation of l,the property claimed as exempt became exempt it no longer formed part of the estate but revested in the debtor,clear of all claims that are discharged in the bankruptcy proceedings.
policy considerations 
while we rest our holding on statutory construction,courts that have ruled that conversion from chapter to chapter gives rise to a new period for objections have been troubled primarily by their perception of the adverse policy consequences of our interpretation in their view our holding urges an impractical and unrealistic interpretation of the bankruptcy process.in re de kleinman,at.because we find that this precisely drafted statute and the rules promulgated under it unambiguously foreclose a new period for objections,we may not be governed by policy considerations see,estate of cowart nicklos drilling,d in a statutory construction case,the beginning point must be the language of the statute,and when a statute speaks with clarity to an issue judicial inquiry into the statute meaning,in all but the most extraordinary circumstance,is finished.unless it leads to absurd or futile results,united states american trucking ass ns,we must enforce what congress has commanded whether or not we agree with its policy choices.nevertheless,we have considered the policy arguments advanced by the dissent and by those courts that have reached the contrary result.we do not find their arguments compelling.
does our ruling encourage abusive conversions from chapter to 
courts concluding that policy considerations compel a finding that conversion gives rise to a new period for objections fear that our contrary holding invites abusive filings under chapter solely for the purpose of claiming baseless exemptions and immunizing them from challenge in the chapter proceedings.see,in re havanec,at a contrary holding would increase the potential for abuse matter of bergen,at dis op.post at.under this the words of judge conrad below many debtors could file a chapter,have their a hearing,claim their exemptions,and then convert to chapter,and the trustee would be forever barred from objecting.we find these fears overstated for several reasons first,individual exemptions are rarely at issue in chapter filings,because few individuals file under this chapter.second,the argument is premised on a belief that only trustees have the expertise and the incentive to raise objections.
first,we note that exemptions are only available to individual debtors.see b stating in pertinent part an individual debtor may exempt from property of the estate.they are not available to partnerships or corporations.see,matter of sa,holding that corporations are not entitled to claim exempt property defining person to include the mutually exclusive categories of individual,partnership and corporation.while it is now settled that individuals may file their petitions under chapter,whether or not they are engaged in business as sole proprietors,see toibb radloff,d,chapter was primarily intended for business reorganizations,see id.at.citing legislative history.in turn,chapter is simply not an attractive vehicle for individual consumer bankruptcies.its procedures are complex,requiring greater disclosure and reporting to court and creditors.see,at reprinted in.chapter filing fees are higher than those in chapters and.compare a filing fee of in chapters and with id.a filing fee of in chapter.and debtors must pay additional fees each quarter until dismissal or conversion,ranging from to depending on size of disbursements.see id.a.further,the bankruptcy reform act of significantly increased the limits on the debts of those eligible to file under chapter,raising the limit on unsecured debt from to and the limit on secured debt from to.see e as a consequence,many more individual debtors may file under chapter who previously would have had to file under chapter if they sought bankruptcy relief but wished to avoid the liquidation proceedings of chapter in short,individuals filing under chapter are likely to be a small and shrinking class.
we note that the data confirm the hypothesis that individual,chapter filings are an uncommon occurrence.of the bankruptcy petitions filed in this circuit in the period ending september,only or less than were chapter filings and an insignificant or less than were,individual filings under chapter.see judicial business of the united states courts annual report of the director tbl.the number of cases that subsequently convert to chapter is necessarily a subset of this already insignificant group 
because only individuals may claim exemptions and because very few individuals file chapter petitions,we do not share the fears of those courts that have anticipated a rush of abusive filings under chapter inasmuch as these courts have been really concerned about abuse in chapter to chapter conversions,these concerns are beyond the scope of our holding.finally,as the supreme court noted in taylor,the code and rules already provide significant deterrents against such abuse of bankruptcy proceedings.see taylor,at.see also a b allowing denial of discharge for presentations of fraudulent claims rule requiring filings to be verified or contain an unsworn declaration under penalty of perjury rule b providing for sanctions for signing certain documents not warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension,modification,or reversal of existing law or lacking or unlikely to have evidentiary support imposing criminal penalties for fraud in bankruptcy cases.
second,the argument that our holding creates the opportunity for abusive filings is premised on the belief that only trustees will object to improperly claimed exemptions.while a trustee as a party in interest is entitled to object to a debtor claimed exemptions,so too are the creditors.unlike the trustee primary responsibilities under,which are exclusive to the trustee,see matter of perkins,cir,the right to object can be exercised by creditors.were the right to object to exemptions exclusively the trustee,the appellee fears if not her textual argument would be better our holding would indeed remove the debtor claim of exemptions from any effective scrutiny.but this is not the case.
we also find unpersuasive the argument that chapter creditors lack either the sophistication or the incentives to exercise their right to object.see,in re havanec,at chapter creditors are likely to have neither the interest nor expertise to object to claimed exemptions in re bergen,at without a trustee,objections must be made by creditors,and i n fact,the exemptions may be of little importance to a creditor in the earlier stages of a chapter case.as to lack of sophistication,chapter is premised on the assumption that the parties are sophisticated enough to negotiate freely the terms of the reorganization plan subject to the statutory safeguards of.whatever the limitations on the sophistication of individual creditors,creditors form committees to protect their common interests and frequently hire experienced counsel to advance their common goals.we are not persuaded by the argument that these same creditor their sufficient sophistication to appreciate the significance of failing to file timely objections.further,the code puts creditors on notice that conversion is in many cases the debtor right.see.as to lack of incentive,because the reorganization plan may not provide that any creditor absent consent receive a distribution with a present value less than that it would receive were the debtor liquidated under chapter,see a,creditors have a direct financial interest in challenging objections in the chapter proceeding.
does our ruling render the role of the chapter trustee purposeless 
we are similarly unpersuaded by the argument that our holding renders the role of the chapter trustee meaningless in a case converted from chapter.this argument is premised on the mistaken assumption that objecting to a debtor claimed exemptions is the primary role of the chapter trustee.
the duties of a chapter trustee are set out in detail in the nine subsections of.the duty to review and,if necessary object to,claimed exemptions is nowhere specifically it is subsumed within the general duty to investigate the financial affairs of the debtor.our holding merely precludes one component of a single duty among nine enumerated duties of the trustee.it is hard to see how this renders the trustee purposeless.in fact,of course,the primary purpose of the collect,liquidate and distribute estate property thereby closing the estate as expeditiously as is compatible with the best interests of the parties clearly survives our holding.see yadkin valley bank trust co mcgee in re hutchinson,cir noting duty to close the estate expeditiously is the trustee main duty citation omitted estes hoyt crake in re inv,cir describing section duty to close estate expeditiously as overriding responsibility of chapter trustee.
having considered the policy objections,we can not conclude that our construction of the code leads to an impractical and illogical holding that ignores the realities of the bankruptcy process,in re leydet,at.for certain,we can not conclude that the result we reach through statutory construction is absurd or futile.while reasonable people may disagree over the balance congress has struck between countervailing interests under the current statutory scheme,because we find that statutory directive to be clear and because it does not lead to an absurd result,under principles of statutory interpretation we must enforce it.
iii.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we hold that conversion of a bankruptcy case from chapter to chapter does not create a new period to object to the debtor previously claimed exemptions.the judgment of the district court is reversed and the case is remanded with instructions to vacate the order of the bankruptcy court and remand for further proceedings.
the majority holds today that the trustee and creditors in a chapter case have fewer rights if the case was initiated by an individual under chapter and then converted voluntarily or involuntarily to chapter than they would have if the case had been originally filed under chapter.relying on the debatable maxim of statutory construction,expressio unius est exclusio alterius,the majority concludes that congress and the bankruptcy advisory committee have considered the situation before us and rejected an opportunity for a meeting of creditors and an opportunity for the newly appointed chapter trustee to object to the debtor claimed exemptions.
the majority overstates its case.it concludes that the contrary,the position adopted by the majority of bankruptcy courts and the lower court in this only superficial appeal and rests solely on policy considerations.op.at.there is,however,a clear ambiguity in the code with respect to the procedures appropriate in a chapter to chapter conversion.there is strong textual support for both positions,the closest supreme court decision does not compel either result and there are policy considerations weighing in favor of both interpretations.the issue is ripe for a clarifying amendment or decision by the supreme court.
i.a objections period is required.
the argument in favor of a new objections period following a meeting of creditors has been on numerous occasions.see,in re alexander,cir.bap chapter to chapter in re wolf,chapter to chapter in re havanec,same in re bergen,same in re de kleinman,same in re leydet,same weissman carr in re weissman,chapter to chapter in re jenkins,same.
briefly,the logic is as follows the conversion of a bankruptcy case from one chapter to another constitutes an order for relief.a.within a reasonable time after the order for relief in a bankruptcy case,the united states trustee must convene and preside at a meeting of creditors.a see also fed.a establishing time limits.thus,when a case brought under chapter is converted to a chapter proceeding,a new meeting of creditors is convened.this new meeting is not a continuation of the creditors meeting in the case,but is a separate meeting for which a new trustee must be selected.f m marquette bank richards,cir citing e.federal rule of bankruptcy procedure b provides that the trustee or any creditor may file objections to the list of property claimed as exempt within days after the conclusion of the meeting of creditors held pursuant to rule a thus,read together,the provisions establish that a second objections period begins following the creditors meeting.
this result makes sense.because the goal of a chapter proceeding is reorganization,the trustee generally plays a more limited role than would a trustee appointed to oversee a chapter liquidation.the majority approach will leave the new chapter trustee without an opportunity to object to claimed exemptions which received little or no scrutiny when reorganization was the focus.as the havanec court observed,t hat job will necessarily be left to chapter creditors who are likely to have neither the interest nor expertise to do so.at see also in re bergen,at in re de kleinman,at.
ii.the alternative position 
the majority has two principal reasons for concluding that a second objections period is prohibited by the code the limited lists of extended time periods enumerated in and bankruptcy rule,and the resulting recapture of previously exempted property if a second objections period is allowed.although i concede that neither position is particularly tidy,i do not find the majority reasoning sufficiently persuasive to overcome the obvious advantages of affording the chapter trustee an opportunity to object to the debtor claimed exemptions.
enumerated exceptions and extensions 
section of title provides,in relevant part,that 
a within a reasonable time after the order for relief in a case under this title,the united states trustee shall convene and preside at a meeting of creditors.
b the united states trustee may convene a meeting of any equity security holders.
rule b,calling for the commencement of a objection period after the meeting of creditors,does not specify whether it applies to both meetings in a converted case or just the first one after the initial order of relief.rule addresses the extension of certain time periods upon the conversion of a case,but it does not mention rule b.this intentional omission,the majority argues,follows from congress decision to omit from the list of enumerated circumstances in which the date of the order of relief is reset to the date of the conversion order.
the debtor here filed his petition under chapter on june.the commencement of a voluntary case constitutes an order for relief under such chapter.the case was converted from chapter to chapter on september.according to a,that conversion also constitutes an order for relief under the chapter to which the case is converted.section a,however,goes on to state that except as provided in subsections b and c of this section,the conversion does not effect a change in the date of the filing of the petition,the commencement of the case,or the order for relief.id.emphasis added.therefore,according to the majority,for the purpose of the objections deadline,the meeting of creditors convened pursuant to section and rule a was solely the meeting convened within or days of the commencement of the voluntary case,within or days of june.see op.at.
f m marquette bank richards,cir,cited by the majority in support of this position,actually rejected an analogous argument while considering the time period for dischargeability complaints the court held that a new meeting of creditors is required upon conversion from chapter to chapter.f m,at citing e and the advisory committee note to rule a meeting of creditors may have been held in the superseded case as required by a of the code but that would not dispense with the need to hold one in the ensuing liquidation case.
f m is also instructive as to the soundness of the majority reliance on a questionable canon of construction.paragraph of rule used to be paragraph,until was deleted in to eliminate redundancy.the advisory committee note to the amendments indicates that 
paragraph of the rule is expanded to include the effect of conversion of a chapter or case to a chapter case.on conversion of a case from chapter or to a chapter case,parties have a new period within which to file claims or complaints relating to the granting of the discharge or the dischargeability of a debt.this amendment is consistent with the holding and reasoning of the court in f m marquette bank richards,cir.
the note suggests that the committee simply approved of the f m decision regarding dischargeability and sought to codify it in the rules.nothing in the advisory notes indicates that the committee considered and rejected provisions to deal with a host of other possible effects of conversion.see in re leydet,at in re havanec,at t his omission is not compelling for all that appears,the draftsmen of rule might well have concluded that the language of rule b was sufficiently clear to assure that the trustee could object to claims following the conclusion of the chapter creditors meeting after the case had been converted.
there are other logical problems with the majority reliance on the enumerated exceptions in b and c.for example,section a calling for a meeting of creditors holding unsecured claims and allowing a meeting of equity security holders is on the list in section b,but does not contain the phrase the order for relief under this chapter.it does say that a s soon as practicable after the order for relief under chapter of this title,the united states trustee shall appoint a committee of creditors presumably and notwithstanding inexact drafting,the inclusion of this section in b intends that a meeting of creditors be called as soon as practicable after conversion to chapter.for cases converted to chapter,the majority argues,there is to be no meeting because an analogous provision did not make the list 
that in turn creates further problems.section a is included among the enumerated provisions and provides,in those circumstances,that promptly after conversion the trustee shall appoint an interim trustee.that is all well and good until one tries to replace the interim trustee in the converted case.section b provides that the services of the interim trustee conclude when the trustee duly elected under qualifies under.section,however,provides that the creditors may elect one person to serve as trustee at the meeting convened pursuant to.and as the majority repeatedly insists,there is no meeting after conversion.the result under the majority logic is that the interim trustee appointed in cases converted to chapter may not be replaced by one elected by the creditors.the term interim is now meaningless.
or consider the application of the majority rule to g,which allows the court in an involuntary liquidation case to appoint an interim trustee to take possession of the debtor property and to operate any business of the debtor pending trial on the involuntary petition.the provision is keyed to the first order of relief and is not included in the list of enumerated exceptions.it reads 
at any time after the commencement of an involuntary case under chapter of this title but before an order for relief in the case,the court,on request of a party in interest,after notice to the debtor and a hearing,and if necessary to preserve the property of the estate or to prevent loss to the estate,may order the united states trustee to appoint an interim trustee under section of this title to take possession of the property of the estate and to operate any business of the debtor.before an order for relief,the debtor may regain possession of property in the possession of a trustee ordered appointed under this subsection if the debtor files such bond as the court requires,conditioned on the debtor accounting for and delivering to the trustee,if there is an order for relief in the case,such property,or the value,as of the date the debtor regains possession,of such property.
g.without the time period being reset by conversion,the court in a case involuntarily converted to chapter from chapter would not have the authority to preserve certain fragile assets.
from these few examples,it is clear that expressio unius is simply not a trustworthy guide through this tangle 
practicalities of the to conversion 
thus,it becomes necessary to set aside the competing code interpretations and focus on the crux of the dispute what rights do the trustee and creditors have after learning that the estate will now be liquidated,and,more difficult,what is the status after conversion of property successfully exempted during an earlier phase of the bankruptcy case 
one commentator has concluded that the argument for a new objections period is strongest when the conversion is from chapter to chapter or from chapter to chapter,because property acquired by the debtor now explicitly becomes property of the estate in the ongoing case pursuant to a and a.see thomas ray,the effects of conversion to chapter on selected time periods,am.because there is no analogous augmentation provision for a case converted from chapter,the commentator,like the majority,believes a objections period is prohibited.the bankruptcy courts considering this result,however,point to the potential for abuse under such a regime because it would encourag e debtors to increase their exemptions simply by filing chapter and converting to chapter after the period.in re havanec,at.
the abstract procedural debate comes sharply into focus when there is property successfully exempted during the first phase of the case and,after conversion,the trustee seeks the opportunity to object.the bankruptcy appellate panel for the eighth circuit in alexander in re alexander,cir.bap,had no problem requiring a meeting of creditors and a corresponding objections period in light of the fact that the chapter trustee had successfully objected to the same homestead exemption claim prior to conversion.the court gave no indication whether it would have allowed the second objection if the first had been unsuccessful or had there been no objection at all.
in the context of the more frequent to conversion,congress has considered an analogous question to the one presented here.two lines of thought had developed on the appropriate date for determining what would be considered property of the estate when a case is converted.several circuits held that the filing date of the original petition should be the date for measuring the contents of the estate,see,in re bobroff,cir,while another held that the date of conversion would be used,see in re lybrook,cir.congress resolved the split when it passed the bankruptcy reform act on october,which specified that the converted estate consists only of property of the estate,as of the date of filing of the petition,that remains in the possession of or is under the control of the debtor on the date of conversion f a emphasis added.congress purpose in enacting this section was to eliminate the disincentive that section a placed on a party that wanted to file under chapter but also wanted the option to convert to chapter.see,at,and.without the amendment,the converted chapter estate would include property acquired by the debtor after he filed the original chapter petition,even though the property rule did not apply to cases originally filed under chapter.
under that section second clause,however,property owned by the debtor at the time the petition is filed,even if previously listed as exempt,would be part of the converted estate,provided that it remains in the debtor possession on the date of conversion.congress reasonably chose to distinguish between and exempt property in to cases,and the distinction makes just as much sense if the case begins under chapter if the debtor chooses to alienate exempt property before conversion,so be it.but for the purpose of overseeing the liquidation of an estate once the case has been converted to chapter,the trustee and creditors should have the opportunity to evaluate and object to previously claimed exemptions if the property remains in the debtor possession.
we note that the bankruptcy appellate panel for the eighth circuit has recently held that where a case was converted from chapter to chapter,the chapter trustee had a new day period to object to debtor claimed exemptions.see alexander in re alexander,cir.bap.quite apart from the differences between a chapter to chapter and a chapter to chapter conversion,we find that case factually distinct in that an objection to the exemption had been timely raised in the chapter proceeding and previously sustained by the bankruptcy court.we underscore that our ruling applies only to conversions from chapter to chapter.see note,infra,and accompanying text.
leading bankruptcy commentators support this holding.see collier on bankruptcy,at lawrence king,ed.william norton,norton bankruptcy law practice supp.
stat.ann.tit,provides an exemption for the debtor aggregate interest in any property,not to exceed in value,plus up to of any unused amount of certain other specified exemptions.
it is settled law that a bankruptcy court has the authority to conclude an indefinitely adjourned meeting.see,in re havanec.in any event,neither party argues that the original meeting was not concluded for purposes of commencing the objection period under fed.b.we therefore do not address this issue,and treat the meeting as properly concluded.see fed.a,b losacco city of middletown,cir.
neither party having argued on appeal that the trustee objection should be treated differently because it was directed only at the value of the exemption,we do not address that issue,on which commentators appear split.compare collier on bankruptcy,at t he debtor valuation of the property for exemption purposes must be accepted once the deadline for objections has passed.otherwise,that deadline would be meaningless.with robert ginsberg robert martin,ginsberg and martin on bankruptcy f,at ed.supp.an objection to the valuation of debtor property claimed as exempt differs from an objection to an exemption and need not be raised within days of the meeting.
during the pendency of this appeal the chapter trustee sold all of its interest in the shares of stock to deborah bell,the appellant former wife,who was substituted as the appellee on november.
in pertinent part,rule b reads the trustee or any creditor may file objections to the list of property claimed as exempt within days after the conclusion of the meeting of creditors held pursuant to rule a or the filing of any amendment to the list or supplemental schedules unless,within such period,further time is granted by the court.
writing for the majority,justice thomas in taylor freeland kronz,d,did not discuss rule b.in expressly and narrowly limiting the power of courts to extend the period for filing objections,the rule provides an identifiable reason precluding the equitable arguments advanced by justice stevens in dissent.see id.at.stevens,dissenting t here is no identifiable reason why ordinary tolling principles that apply in other contexts should not also apply in bankruptcy proceedings.zidell,forsch in re alaska coastal lines,cir no equitable power exists to depart from the mandate of rule b.further,circuit courts have uniformly construed strictly the power of courts under rule b to extend the deadline within the period motions for the extension must be granted,not merely filed,within the period.see clark brayshaw in re brayshaw,cir there simply is no room in the wording for construing rule b or rule b to permit granting an extension of time to file objections outside the original time limit.accord rogers laurain in re laurain,cir stoulig traina matter of stoulig,cir.
in turn,the time periods of rule a are strictly enforced t he court may not enlarge the time for taking action under rule a.fed.b.in the bankruptcy code may not is prohibitive,and not permissive.rules of construction.
we note that the original meeting of creditors,on august,was convened days after the order for relief.rule a allows a meeting to be convened up to days from the order for relief where the place designated for the meeting is not regularly staffed by the united states trustee or an assistant who may preside at the meeting.while the record is silent on this matter,we infer that this must have occurred in the present case,because rule b prohibits any extension of the time periods established under rule a.in any event,neither party argues that the original meeting of creditors was itself untimely.
we do not hold that objections first filed at or following a meeting can never be timely.where the conversion between chapters happens swiftly after entry of the original order of relief,objections filed in the converted case may still be time
