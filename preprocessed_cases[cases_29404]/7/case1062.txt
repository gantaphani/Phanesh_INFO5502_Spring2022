john bartle owes the united states millions in unpaid taxes.in december,he filed a voluntary bankruptcy petition under chapter of the bankruptcy code.two and a half years after bartle sought chapter protection,the united states moved to dismiss the bankruptcy on the ground that bartle debts dwarfed his financial resources and he realistically could not effectuate a reorganization.the district court granted the motion without conducting a hearing and subsequently denied bartle motion to alter or amend the dismissal order.bartle appeals,contending that dismissal of the bankruptcy on less than twenty days notice and without the opportunity to be heard requires reversal.but because bartle has not articulated what evidence or argument he would have presented in opposition to the government motion,we find any error to be harmless.
bartle has been in litigation with the government over his tax obligations for ten years.the government filed suit against bartle in to reduce to judgment bartle liability for employment tax penalties assessed against him as a responsible person pursuant to internal revenue code section for income and fica taxes that had been withheld from the wages of workers employed by three different employers with which he was associated but that had not been paid over to the government.see united states sotelo,d.the district court subsequently entered an agreed judgment in the amount of,plus interest,in the government favor.when the government then sought an order under establishing an installment plan pursuant to which bartle would satisfy that judgment,the parties consented to an order obligating him both to make regular payments toward his debt and to submit sworn reports as to the amounts and sources of his income.three years into that arrangement,the government concluded that bartle was not fully complying with either obligation and asked that he be held in contempt.at the hearing on that request,the possibility of appointing a receiver to disentangle bartle financial affairs was discussed.the court ultimately reserved judgment on the subject of contempt and ordered the parties to explore a modification of the payment plan to provide for greater court oversight of bartle financial affairs and to submit either a modified agreement or a status report within thirty days.before the thirty days were up,bartle filed his chapter bankruptcy petition on december.
at the government request,the bankruptcy court modified the automatic stay to allow its collection action in the district court to proceed.the district court then appointed charles greer as a receiver to handle bartle finances in that action.bartle appealed that order,which we affirmed in an unpublished decision.united states bartle.cir.
meanwhile,the government had another case pending in which it sought to foreclose federal tax liens that pursuant to had attached to the stock that bartle held in two different corporations inverness corporation and first health corporation.the court in that suit had entered summary judgment in the government favor,foreclosing the tax liens against a majority of both corporations stock and appointing greer as the receiver for both corporations.first health turned out not to own assets of any significant value.inverness,on the other hand,held membership interests in no less than fifteen different limited liability companies.but it also had liabilities for unreported and unpaid employment taxes which,by the government account,totaled in excess of million.the government believed that the company assets were not sufficient to satisfy its delinquent tax obligations.
on april,the district court,over bartle objection,withdrew the reference of bartle chapter petition to the bankruptcy court.the court took this action at the behest of the government,which pointed out that the district court was already handling both the judgment proceeding and the lien foreclosure proceeding and had previously handled other suits involving bartle and was well familiar with bartle financial affairs.the court also appointed greer as the chapter trustee.after assuming oversight of the bankruptcy proceeding,the court granted bartle permission to borrow up to million to pay a portion of the government tax claim.bartle obtained a loan from delaware county investors,llc and in july conveyed just under million to the internal revenue service,satisfying the judgment entered against him in the judgment collection suit.bartle debt to the lender then became an allowed claim for a administrative expense pursuant to the c.bartle and the government were able to agree on the amounts of his remaining federal tax liabilities,and on september,may,and june,the court entered final judgments reflecting the validity and amounts of bartle outstanding liabilities to the united states for his own unpaid federal income taxes and for additional penalties assessed against him for unpaid employment taxes.
with the amounts of bartle liabilities resolved,the government on june,filed a motion seeking the dismissal of the chapter proceeding pursuant to b.the government pointed out that in light of the judgments the district court had entered,the united states had a total secured claim of and total unsecured priority claims of as of the petition date.any plan of reorganization would have to provide for full payment of both categories of claims,and the priority claims would have to be paid within six years pursuant to the applicable version of a c.the plan would also have to include repayment of the million loan bartle had obtained from delaware county investors.all told,then,the plan would have to make provision for payments totaling approximately million.yet,bartle had few resources from which he could pay these debts.although a schedule of assets bartle had filed in february reported personal property with a purported value in excess of million,the government contended that the property was actually worth no more than.bartle also claimed a percent stake in the stock of inverness corporation that he valued at million,but inverness was in receivership and because its liabilities exceeded its assets,the government pegged the value of bartle interest in the company at zero.the only other asset that bartle had reported was a potential fee of in connection with a loan financing.that fee had yet to materialize,and there was no evidence that it ever would.that left bartle income.available monthly operating reports reflected gross receipts of only for and for the first eight months of.in view of bartle relatively modest reported assets and income,the government believed he did not have the wherewithal to put together a viable plan to repay these debts.it saw no point in converting the proceeding to a chapter liquidation,given bartle paucity of assets and the discharge he had received in a chapter proceeding less than six years earlier,which pursuant to the applicable version of a would preclude a second discharge in a successive chapter proceeding.dismissal,in the government view,was the sole appropriate course of action for the court to take.
ten days after the government filed its motion,on june,the district court issued a brief order granting the motion.as of this time,bartle had not filed a written response to the motion,and the district court did not conduct any sort of hearing on the motion before acting.
on july,bartle filed a timely motion to alter or amend the order of dismissal pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure and bankruptcy rule.in relevant part,bartle contended that the court had improperly granted the motion without conducting a hearing as envisioned by section b.bartle did not articulate what opposition he would have offered to the government motion at such a hearing he simply argued that it was improper for the court to grant the motion without a hearing.at.he also asked that the court reinstate the reference to the bankruptcy court.at.
the government opposed bartle motion.the government noted its understanding that the court summary action in granting the motion to dismiss took place after the court staff had contacted bartle counsel and determined that bartle had no objection t
