charles gugliuzza appeals the district court order reversing a bankruptcy court grant of summary judgment and remanding for further.we conclude that we lack jurisdiction and therefore dismiss the appeal.
the federal trade commission ftc successfully brought an enforcement action against charles gugliuzza and his former company,commerce planet,alleging violations of section of the ftc act,a.see ftc commerce planet,supp.cal.in assessing gugliuzza liability,the district court relied on the test set forth by the ftc in in re cliffdale,which we have generally adopted,see ftc pantron i,cir.under this test,an act or practice is deceptive if,first,there is a representation,omission,or practice that,second,is likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances,and third,the representation,omission,or practice is material.id.quoting cliffdale,at.applying this standard,the district court held that commerce planet had engaged in deceptive acts and further determined that gugliuzza could be held individually liable for those violations.see commerce planet,supp.at in addition to enjoining gugliuzza from further violations of the ftc act,the district court awarded the ftc million in restitution id.at.
in the wake of this restitution award,gugliuzza filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under chapter in november.generally,a debtor is permitted to discharge all debts that arose before the filing of his bankruptcy petition,hawkins franchise tax,cir.citing b,but the bankruptcy code provides for certain exceptions to that general rule,id.citing.one such exception is that debts obtained by false pretenses,a false representation,or actual fraud are not dischargeable.a a to establish nondischargeability under a a,a creditor must prove five elements misrepresentation,fraudulent omission or deceptive conduct by the debtor knowledge of the falsity or deceptiveness of his statement or conduct an intent to deceive justifiable reliance by the creditor on the debtor statement or conduct and damage to the creditor proximately caused by its reliance on the debtor statement or conduct.turtle rock meadows homeowners ass slyman in re slyman,cir.
in bankruptcy court,the ftc commenced an adversary proceeding,which is essentially a full civil lawsuit carried out under the umbrella of the bankruptcy case,bullard blue hills bank,seeking a determination that gugliuzza restitution debt was nondischargeable under a a.the ftc moved for summary judgment,contending that commerce planet determination that gugliuzza had engaged in deceptive practices for purposes of the ftc act foreclosed him from relitigating the five elements necessary to establish that the debt was obtained by false pretenses,a false representation,or actual fraud such that it was not dischargeable under a a.see sasson sokoloff in re sasson,cir.c ollateral estoppel principles apply in discharge exception proceedings pursuant to a.quoting grogan garner.the bankruptcy court granted the ftc motion and entered judgment in the ftc favor.
on appeal,the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court in part,reversed in part,and remanded.see ftc gugliuzza in re gugliuzza,cal.it held that the bankruptcy court correctly concluded that gugliuzza was collaterally estopped from relitigating four of the five elements necessary to prove nondischargeability under a a specifically,the elements of misrepresentation,knowledge,justifiable reliance,and damages,but had erred in holding that gugliuzza was collaterally estopped from relitigating the issue of his intent to deceive consumers.accordingly,the district court remanded the case to the bankruptcy court for further on the issue of gugliuzza intent to deceive.gugliuzza timely appealed this order.he contends on appeal that the district court and bankruptcy court erred in holding that collateral estoppel precluded him from litigating the elements of misrepresentation,justifiable reliance,and damages.
we must first consider whether we have jurisdiction to entertain gugliuzza appeal.see sahagun landmark fence in re landmark fence,cir.we have jurisdiction to determine our jurisdiction,bunyan united states in re bunyan,cir,and consider the question de novo,silver sage partners,city of desert hot springs in re city of desert hot springs,cir.
we have authority to hear appeals in bankruptcy cases under three different provisions,and d.
first,provides t he courts of appeals other than the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the united states,except where a direct review may be had in the supreme court.this section gives us jurisdiction over appeals from final decisions by the district courts acting in any capacity.bank germain.
in the bankruptcy context,we have jurisdiction under over appeals from rulings made by a district court when it presides directly over a bankruptcy case.see,klenske goo in re manoa fin,cir.we also have jurisdiction under over appeals taken from final decisions made by a district court when it sits in a capacity.see germain,at.while district courts normally do not act as appellate bodies,they may do so in the bankruptcy context.congress gave district courts original jurisdiction over bankruptcy proceedings,see,but also authorized them to refer bankruptcy cases to bankruptcy judges in the first instance,see id.in fact,all districts have adopted a general order of reference to send all bankruptcy cases to the bankruptcy judges for the district.schulman cal.state water res.control bd.in re lazar,bankr.cal.after making such a reference,district courts may hear appeals from final judgments,orders,and decrees of bankruptcy judges entered in cases and proceedings.a.section a also gives district courts,sitting in an appellate capacity,jurisdiction over interlocutory orders and decrees.
the scope of our jurisdiction under is the same for all district court rulings.see klestadt winters,llp cangelosi,cir.regardless of context,in determining whether the district court decision is final under,we ask whether the decision presented for review ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the district court to do but execute the judgment.congrejo,llc mann in re bender,cir.quoting firestone tire rubber risjord.
a second source of jurisdiction is provided by,which authorizes appellate courts to hear appeals taken from all interlocutory orders of specified types,a,as well as appeals of interlocutory orders that are certified by the district court to meet specified criteria,id.b.this jurisdiction includes the authority to hear appeals from a district court interlocutory orders issued in a capacity.see germain,at so long as a party to a proceeding or case in bankruptcy meets the conditions imposed by,a court of appeals may rely on that statute as a basis for jurisdiction.
in contrast to the grants of general jurisdiction under and,d gives us jurisdiction specific to bankruptcy decisions of district courts and decisions of bankruptcy appellate panels or baps under d,t he courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions,judgments,orders,and decrees entered under subsections a defining the district courts jurisdiction and b defining the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy appellate panels of this section.this language limits our appellate jurisdiction under d to decisions,judgments,orders,and decrees that are final we have no authority under section d to consider interlocutory orders and decrees.see germain,at holding that did not confer jurisdiction on the court of appeals over an interlocutory order entered by a district court,as neither d nor any other part of mentions interlocutory orders entered by the district courts in bankruptcy 
the supreme court has recently provided guidance on how to interpret the scope of jurisdiction granted by.see bullard.in bullard,a bankruptcy court declined to confirm a debtor proposed plan of reorganization in a chapter case.id.at.the debtor appealed the denial to the first circuit bap,which concluded that the order denying plan confirmation was not final because the debtor was free to propose an alternate plan.id.quoting bullard hyde park sav.bank in re bullard,cir.bap.the bap therefore held that it did not have jurisdiction under a,which grants jurisdiction over only final judgments,orders,and decrees of bankruptcy judges entered in cases and proceedings.nonetheless,the bap granted the debtor leave to appeal an interlocutory order under a and affirmed the bankruptcy court.id.
the debtor then appealed to the first circuit,which dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.id.the first circuit reasoned that the denial of a plan confirmation was not a final order,so it lacked jurisdiction under d,and the bap had not certified the interlocutory order for review,so it also lacked jurisdiction under d.id.
on appeal to the supreme court,the debtor contended that the first circuit had jurisdiction under d because orders denying confirmation should be considered final orders.the supreme court rejected this argument.according to the court,the bankruptcy court order denying plan confirmation was not a final order entered in a proceeding.therefore,the first circuit lacked jurisdiction to consider it.bullard explained that in ordinary civil litigation,a case in federal district court culminates in a final decisio n,a ruling by which a district court disassociates itself from a case.id.alteration in original quoting swint chambers cty.comm n.as a general rule,a party can appeal as of right only from the final decision that ends the case.id.this rule reflects the conclusion that p ermitting piecemeal,prejudgment appeals undermines efficient judicial administration and encroaches upon the prerogatives of district court judges,who play a special role in managing ongoing litigation.id.at alterations in original quoting mohawk,carpenter.
the court acknowledged that the rules are different in bankruptcy,but clarified that this difference arises because a bankruptcy case involves an aggregation of individual controversies,many of which would exist as lawsuits but for the bankrupt status of the debtor.id.at quoting alan resnick henry sommer,collier on bankruptcy b,at ed.that is,because bankruptcy cases generally involve multiple parties asserting a range of different claims,many of which are litigated in discrete proceedings including adversary actions,congress has long provided that orders in bankruptcy cases may be immediately appealed if they finally dispose of discrete disputes within the larger case.id.quoting howard delivery,zurich am.ins.
bullard then provided guidance on how to discern whether a particular order was immediately appealable under by virtue of being final within a proceeding.id.according to the court,the relevant proceeding is one that results in a final order that alters the status quo and fixes the rights and obligations of the parties.id.plan confirmation satisfies this definition w hen the bankruptcy court confirms a plan,its terms become binding on debtor and creditor alike with preclusive effect,often resulting in the vesting of property in the debtor and the distribution of funds to creditors.id.at see id.at holding that a plan confirmation order is appealable because it alters the legal relationships among the parties.denial of confirmation followed by dismissal of the case also satisfies this definition,as the consequences are similarly significant it dooms the possibility of a discharge and lifts the automatic stay.id.at.by contrast,a n order denying confirmation is not final,so long as it leaves the debtor free to propose another plan.id.at.unlike the dramatic consequences flowing from either confirmation or dismissal,denial with leave to amend changes little,as t he automatic stay persists and t he possibility of discharge lives on.id.at.
the supreme court then addressed the debtor argument that a distinct proceeding was conducted e ach time the bankruptcy court reviews a proposed plan such that the bankruptcy court order denying confirmation was therefore a final order within a proceeding for purposes of a,regardless whether the plan was confirmed or rejected.id.at.rejecting this argument,bullard reasoned that such an approach did not make much sense because it defined the pertinent proceeding so narrowly that the requirement of finality would do little work as a meaningful constraint on the availability of appellate review.id.at.by vastly expanding the class of immediately appealable orders,the debtor proposal gave rise to an unacceptable risk of piecemeal appeals,given that debtors may often view the prospect of appeals as important leverage in dealing with creditors.id.judicial efficiency would also suffer under the debtor proposal.given that each climb up the appellate ladder and slide down the chute can take more than a year,expanding the class of appealable orders would create precisely the delays and inefficiencies that finality rules sought to prevent in the first instance.id.
for the same reason,the court rejected the government argument that an order resolving any contested matter is final and immediately appealable.id.at emphasis omitted.bullard explained that the list of contested matters is endless and covers all sorts of minor disagreements.id.quoting resnick sommer,collier on bankruptcy,at.the concept of finality can not stretch to cover,for example,an order resolving a disputed request for an extension of time.id.the asymmetry produced by the court analysis plan confirmation is appealable as a final order while plan denial is not was of little import.as bullard explained,it is of course quite common for the finality of a decision to depend on which way the decision goes.id.at.for instance,a n order granting a motion for summary judgment is final an order denying such a motion is not.id.
the court acknowledged that sometimes a question will be important enough that it should be addressed immediately.id.at.indeed,the court noted that the issue in bullard could well fit the bill because it presented a pure question of law that had divided bankruptcy courts in the first circuit and would make a substantial financial difference to the parties.id.but neither the significance of the issue nor its purely legal nature warranted a more flexible finality standard the availability of interlocutory review,such as that provided under d and,was sufficient to address this concern.id.
in sum,bullard concluded that an order ending a proceeding in a bankruptcy case is immediately appealable if the order alters the status quo and fixes the rights and obligations of the parties,id.at,or alters the legal relationships among the parties,id.at.this interpretation of finality in bankruptcy cases determines the scope of the district court and bap authority to hear appeals from final judgments,orders,and decrees under a as well as our authority to hear appeals from all final decisions,judgments,orders,and decrees of bankruptcy judges entered by the district court and bap under d,which are governed by the same constraints.see powerex reliant energy,i dentical words and phrases within the same statute should normally be given the same meaning gustafson alloyd,o perative words have a consistent meaning throughout.
our approach to determining jurisdiction under d is generally consistent with bullard,as we have explained in our decisions.see eden place,llc perl in re perl,cir.in re landmark fence.just as bullard held that t he rules are different in bankruptcy because a bankruptcy case involves an aggregation of individual controversies,at,we have long recognized that certain bankruptcy orders are appealable even if they do not conclude the entire bankruptcy case,and thus are technically interlocutory,in re perl,at quoting alexander compton in re bonham,cir.see also four seas,davres,in re four seas,cir.citing an order entirely terminating an adversary proceeding as an example of an immediately appealable order consistent with bullard ruling that provides jurisdiction over orders in bankruptcy cases that alter the legal relationships among the parties,at,we have looked to whether the bankruptcy court decision resolves and seriously affects substantive rights and finally determines the discrete issue to which it is addressed in determining whether a particular bankruptcy court order is final,in re perl,at quoting ss farms,llc sharp in re sk foods,cir.when the district court or bap affirms or reverses such a decision,we have considered it to be final and immediately appealable.id.
by contrast,when an appeal is taken from a district court or bap ruling that remands the case for further proceedings in the bankruptcy court,we have applied a test,considering the need to avoid piecemeal litigation judicial efficiency the systemic interest in preserving the bankruptcy court role as the finder of fact and whether delaying review would cause either party irreparable harm.id.at quoting in re landmark fence,at.as in bullard,these factors direct us to avoid piecemeal appeals and multiple climb s up the appellate ladder and slide s down the chute and the delays and inefficiencies that result.at.applying this standard,we have held that a district court order that includes a remand to the bankruptcy court with explicit instructions to engage in further is not immediately appealable.in re landmark fence,at.
in landmark fence,our leading decision,a district court held that a bankruptcy court had applied an incorrect legal standard for assessing an element of damages and remanded for additional fact finding.id.at.on appeal,we concluded that we lacked jurisdiction over the district court order.id.at.most important,we held that the first factor,the risk of piecemeal litigation weighed heavily in favor of the conclusion that the district court order was not final when an intermediate appellate court remands a case to the bankruptcy court,the appellate process likely will be much shorter if we decline jurisdiction and await ultimate review of all the combined issues.id.at quoting stanley crossland,crossland,chambers,macarthur lastreto in re lakeshore vill.resort,cir.with respect to the second factor,we rejected the appellants argument that judicial efficiency would be enhanced by asserting jurisdiction because our review of the merits had the potential to end the litigation.id.rather,we held that we should eschew a jurisdictional inquiry that requires us to decide the merits of the appeal.id.quoting vylene,naugles,in re vylene enters,cir.landmark fence articulation of this test is consistent with a long line of cases holding that when a district court remands for factual determinations on a central issue,its order is not final and we lack jurisdiction to review the order.in re vylene,at determining that a district court remand to the bankruptcy court for factual determinations on a central issue was not final after considering the four factors applied in landmark fence see also bank vill.at lakeridge,llc in re vill.at lakeridge,llc,cir.t he bap decision as issued was not final,because it also remanded for discovery to allow factual determinations on a central issue.king stanton in re stanton,cir.noting that when the bap remands for further factual findings related to a central issue raised on appeal,that order is not final,and we lack jurisdiction dental capital leasing martinez in re martinez,cir.holding that because the finality standards apply to remands for factual determinations in the bankruptcy context,and only final decisions of baps can be appealed to the appellate court,we lack jurisdiction over a remand to the bankruptcy court for clarification of a central issue of the case.
we have departed from this general rule in situations where the district court remand order is limited to purely mechanical or computational task s such that the proceedings on remand are highly unlikely to generate a new appeal.in re landmark fence,at alteration in original quoting saxman educ.credit mgmt.in re saxman,cir.see also farm credit bank of spokane fowler in re fowler,cir.holding that where the district court remanded to the bankruptcy court only for the ministerial function of applying the correct interest rate,the district court order was sufficiently final to be immediately appealable.
gugliuzza argues that in evaluating whether the district court order qualifies as a final order,we are not bound by bullard and landmark fence,but should apply a different line of cases beginning with bonner mall partnership bancorp mortgage in re bonner mall partnership,cir.in bonner mall,a creditor moved for relief from the automatic stay in order to foreclose on secured property owned by the debtor,who had filed a proposed reorganization plan.id.at.the debtor argued that relief from the automatic stay was not warranted,as its reorganization plan was confirmable based on the theory that the owners of the company could retain some of their equity in the company under an exception called the new value exception to a bankruptcy rule that would have otherwise prohibited such treatment of equity holders.id.the creditor argued that the new value exception had not survived the enactment of the bankruptcy code in,and that even if the exception had survived,the plan was unconfirmable.id.agreeing with the creditor,the bankruptcy court held that the enactment of the bankruptcy code had eliminated the new value exception and accordingly granted the creditor motion for relief.id.the district court reversed,holding that the new value exception remained in force,and therefore remanded to the bankruptcy court for further proceedings as to the confirmability of the debtor plan.id.at.
straying from our long line of cases holding that an order remanding for factual determinations on a central issue is not final,see in re vylene,at,we announced the new rule that we have jurisdiction even though a district court has remanded a matter for factual findings on a central issue if that issue is legal in nature and its resolution either could dispose of the case or proceeding and obviate the need for fact finding or would materially aid the bankruptcy court in reaching its disposition on remand.in re bonner mall,at citing in re stanton,at.applying this rule to the case at hand,we determined that t he central question is a legal one that is clearly potentially dispositive.id.accordingly,we held that the first prong of our new test applied and asserted jurisdiction over the appeal.id.at.
we subsequently asserted jurisdiction over interlocutory remand orders under the second prong of the bonner mall test whether the remand would materially aid the bankruptcy court in considering a factual issue.in dawson washington mutual bank,in re dawson,for instance,two debtors filed an adversary action against a creditor claiming that the creditor had violated the automatic stay by foreclosing on property owned by the debtors relatives,cir.the debtors claimed they had an interest in the property pursuant to a written agreement with those relatives,and sought emotional distress damages caused by the foreclosure.id.the bankruptcy court held among other things that the agreement did not give the debtors any interest in the property and therefore the creditor did not violate the automatic stay.id.the district court affirmed part of the bankruptcy court order,but reversed on one issue it held that the agreement might have given the debtors an interest in the property,and remanded to the bankruptcy court for factual findings necessary to make that determination,including whether the conditions precedent in the property agreement had been fulfilled.id.at.
in considering whether we had jurisdiction to hear an appeal from the district court order,we acknowledged that the district court reversed the bankruptcy court on a central issue in the case and remanded the case for further factual findings.id.at.nevertheless,we noted that the case raised a legal question when,if ever,are damages for emotional distress recoverable under h for a violation of the automatic stay id.while recognizing that o ur answer will not obviate the need for all further,we concluded that our resolution of this question would materially aid the bankruptcy court in reaching its disposition on remand the second prong of the bonner mall test,and therefore asserted jurisdiction.id.at see also meyer trustee in re scholz,cir.citing in re dawson,at.
we went even further in price lehtinen in re lehtinen,in which we indicated that we may assert jurisdiction over an appeal of an interlocutory bap order whenever the appeal concerns primarily a question of law,cir.quoting demarah united states in re demarah,cir.in lehtinen,a bankruptcy court imposed sanctions on the debtor counsel,including disgorgement of attorneys fees and suspension from practicing before the bankruptcy court for three months.id.the bap held that the bankruptcy court had not abused its discretion in deciding to impose sanctions,but the sanction order did not clearly reflect that the court had considered the relevant factors.id.therefore,the bap vacated the suspension and remanded to the bankruptcy court for consideration of the american bar association standards.id.on appeal,we acknowledged that there is some question as to the finality of the bap decision,but nevertheless summarily concluded that b ecause this is a purely legal question,we have jurisdiction.id.
in sum,under bonner mall and its progeny,we have determined that final decisions,judgments,orders,and decrees for purposes of our jurisdiction under d include district court or bap decisions remanding a central issue to the bankruptcy court for further so long as the appeal raises a purely legal question or our decision on appeal could materially aid the bankruptcy court in its decisionmaking process.
bullard and landmark fence clearly limit the applicability of the bonner mall line of cases.bullard provides that orders that are technically interlocutory are final for purposes of only when they finally dispose of a discrete dispute within the larger case,at quoting howard delivery,at.a decision that remands a case for further will rarely have this degree of finality,unless the remand order is limited to ministerial tasks,see,in re fowler,at.further,bullard expressly rejected the argument that a decision should be deemed final because it presented a pure question of law that was important to the parties,reasoning that there are several mechanisms for interlocutory review to address such cases.at see also in re landmark fence,at rejecting the contention that the issues in the appeal are purely matters of law based on the language of the order on appeal,which included explicit directions for the bankruptcy court to engage in further.
finally,although the supreme court gave weight to considerations regarding the efficiency of the judicial process,it chose not to adopt a approach to this issue.rather than evaluate whether the appeal of a specific ruling would be efficient in a particular case,the court adopted the general principle that only decisions that alter the status quo or fix the parties rights and obligations could be appealed bullard,at.the court focused on ensuring a meaningful constraint on the availability of appellate review as opposed to expanding the universe of appealable interlocutory orders.id.at.to the extent bonner mall suggests we may peek at the merits in order to determine whether we have jurisdiction,because we have determined that our resolution of the legal issue would dispose of the case without a need for further,or would correct an error by the district court and thus assist the bankruptcy court on remand,it is inconsistent with bullard and our precedent.as landmark fence put it,we must eschew a jurisdictional inquiry that requires us to decide the merits of the appeal.at quoting in re vylene,at.regardless whether it would be judicially efficient to consider a reversal of a summary judgment order,a n order granting a motion for summary judgment is final an order denying such a motion is not.bullard,at.bullard made clear that our analysis of whether an order is final is different in bankruptcy only to the extent a final order under may terminate a discrete proceeding in bankruptcy,rather than the entire bankruptcy case.see at.
accordingly,to the extent bonner mall holds that we have jurisdiction over an interlocutory order in a bankruptcy case because ruling on a legal issue could dispose of the case or aid the bankruptcy court in reaching its disposition,in re bonner mall,at,or merely because the appeal involves a purely legal question,in re lehtinen,at,it is inconsistent with bullard and therefore no longer binding.see miller gammie,cir.en banc where a prior decision may have been undercut by higher authority to such an extent that it has been effectively overruled by such higher authority,it is no longer binding on district judges and panels of this court see also in re vylene,at when a district court remands for factual determinations on a central issue,its order is not final and we lack jurisdiction to review the order.gugliuzza reliance on bonner mall and its progeny is therefore unavailing.
we now apply these principles to this case,and consider whether we have jurisdiction over the district court order reversing in part and remanding to the bankruptcy court to determine whether gugliuzza had an intent to deceive.
we have no difficulty concluding that we lack jurisdiction under and.we do not have jurisdiction under because the district court order did not end the litigation on the merits and leave nothing for the district court to do but execute the judgment.in re bender,at quoting firestone tire,at.we also lack jurisdiction under because the district court did not certify its decision for interlocutory review.
we next turn to the question whether we have jurisdiction under d.the district court decision did not end the bankruptcy case as a whole,but as noted in bullard,a technically interlocutory ruling can be deemed to be a final order in a bankruptcy case.see in re perl,at.but here,the district court ruling did not end the discrete proceeding before it,namely the ftc adversary action.the main issue raised in the ftc adversary action is whether gugliuzza restitution debt to the ftc can be discharged in gugliuzza bankruptcy,or whether that debt is nondischargeable under a a.rather than resolving this issue,the district court remanded the case to the bankruptcy court for on a central issue.as a re
