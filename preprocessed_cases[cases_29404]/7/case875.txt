under m,an approved sale of chapter bankruptcy estate property generally can not be challenged on appeal if the sale has already been consummated in good faith without an intervening stay.this statutory mootness provision not only protects the buyer,but also increases the ability of the bankruptcy estate to get a good price.the issue in this case is whether the same statutory provision extends to approved sales of property in which both the bankruptcy estate and have an undivided interest,such as a tenancy in common.only a cramped reading of the statutory mootness provision would lead to the anomalous result that the provision does not extend to such sales.instead,the bankruptcy appellate panel correctly read the provision to apply to sales of property in which the bankruptcy estate has an undivided interest in common with other.
the appellant below,the official committee of unsecured creditors,represents the interests of approximately thirty tenants in common who seven properties with the debtors,who initiated the chapter bankruptcy proceedings that underlie this appeal.the bankruptcy court authorized the debtors to sell not only their interests in the seven properties,pursuant to b,but also the undivided interests of the tenants in common,pursuant to h.the committee appealed the bankruptcy court authorization of the sale and then moved the bankruptcy court for a stay pending appeal.after the bankruptcy court denied a stay,the committee waited more than one week before seeking similar relief from the bankruptcy appellate panel.before the bankruptcy appellate panel could decide whether to grant a stay,however,the sale of the properties had closed.the debtors then moved to dismiss the committee appeal as moot pursuant to m,and the bankruptcy appellate panel ultimately granted that motion.because m,fairly read,applies to a sale authorized under both b and h,the committee appeal was properly dismissed as statutorily moot.
the following facts,as recounted by the bankruptcy appellate panel,are not disputed on appeal 
prior to filing voluntary petitions for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code,each of the debtors owned a parcel of real property improved with a facility for the elderly.four of those properties were located in north carolina and three others were located in south carolina collectively the properties.the debtors acquired the properties in conjunction with a december transaction pursuant to which tenancy in common interests in the properties were sold to investors.a group of approximately thirty investors the tenants in common,or tic purchased tenant in common interests in the properties pursuant to the december transaction reflected in the tenants in common agreement the tic agreement.under the tic agreement,the tic had various rights,including the right to partition the properties and to require unanimous approval of any sale,transfer,or exchange of the properties.the debtors own approximately a undivided interest in the properties and the tic own.
in conjunction with the tic agreement,the tic signed a debt assumption and indemnification agreement pursuant to which the tic obligated themselves to merrill lynch capital,apparently the predecessor in interest to ge business financial services,ge,for a specified portion of the debt and agreed that their fee interest was subordinate to ge.the debtors defaulted on their payment obligations to ge,and ge accelerated the loan.in july,ge commenced foreclosure proceedings.
on august,the debtors filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code.after filing their petitions for relief,the debtors sought authority pursuant to to sell the properties to the highest and best bidder.following the marketing of the properties by the debtors broker,five star quality care,five star eventually emerged as the highest and best bidder.the debtors and five star entered into an agreement regarding the sale of the properties.on october,the debtors filed a motion seeking approval of bidding procedures for the sale of the properties,recognition of five star as the stalking horse,and authority to sell the properties pursuant to b to the highest and best bidder the sale motion.the official committee of unsecured creditors committee,which was formerly known as the official committees of tenants in common investors,and which is comprised of the tic,opposed the sale motion.the debtors also filed adversary proceedings against the tic in which the debtors sought permission to sell the tic interest s in the properties pursuant to h.the debtors filed motions for summary judgment in each of those proceedings,and the tic opposed those motions.
on october,the bankruptcy court held a hearing at which it approved the proposed sale procedures over the objections of the committee and set november,as the date for the hearing on the approval of the sale of the properties to the highest and best bidder.

after taking testimony and reviewing evidence at the november,hearing,the bankruptcy court granted in all respects the debtors motion to sell the properties.the bankruptcy court summarized the testimony,including that of one of the debtors experts to the effect that the sale of only the debtors interest in the property would be difficulty sic at best and would most likely not result in a higher return.the bankruptcy court then found that the debtors had proved,as required by sixth circuit precedent,that a sound business purpose justified the sale of the debtors property interests,other than in the ordinary course of business,under b.the bankruptcy court noted that,if the sale were not approved,ge would likely foreclose upon the properties and that any further delay in approving the sale would harm the assisted living facilities elderly residents.
when the committee counsel asked the bankruptcy court for its decision with respect to the proposed sale of the tic interests pursuant to h,the bankruptcy court responded that it had stated its opinion.i mean,if you wish to appeal it,you welcome to appeal it.later in the hearing,when addressing a distinct but related issue,a representative from the office of the united states trustee again mentioned the need for approval of the sale of the tic interests under h.the bankruptcy court stated 
right.was subsumed in the court decision,quite frankly,about whether it was going to be sold.do think you can partition this.
do think you mean,going through know,h i think the expert met all of those criteria.i do think we get much of a sale of any kind if we sold it piecemeal,or half and half,or whatever.
the court probably should have said,you know,findings of the sale equally applied to subsection h.
on november,the bankruptcy court issued an order approving the sale of the properties and the disbursement of the sale proceeds.in this order,the court found,in relevant part,that the transactions at issue had been negotiated at,in good faith and are in the best interests of the debtors estates,their creditors,and the residents of the assisted living facilities.moreover,the court found that five star was a good faith purchaser and was therefore entitled to the protections of bankruptcy code section m.the court further found that,based on the pleadings and filings in the adversary proceedings,
the debtors have demonstrated that i partition in kind of each property among the applicable debtor and the tics is impracticable ii a sale of the debtors undivided interests in the properties would realize significantly less for the debtors and their estates than the sale of the properties free of the interests of the tics iii the benefit to the debtors and the estates of the sale of the properties free and clear of the interests of the tics outweighs the detriment,if any,to the tics iv the debtors properties are not used in the production,transmission,or distribution,for sale,of electric energy or of natural or synthetic gas for heat,light,or power and v overall,the debtors have satisfied the requirements of bankruptcy code section h and it is appropriate for the debtors and estates to sell their respective interests and any and all of the tic interests in the properties.
accordingly,the bankruptcy court authorized the debtors to sell the tic property interests to five star free and clear of all claims and interests.
later in the day on november,the committee filed a notice of appeal from the bankruptcy court authorization of the sale and an expedited motion for stay pending appeal.the committee characterized its stay motion as urgent because under the purchase and sale contract approved by the court,closing may occur as soon as three days after entry of the orders authorizing the sale.the debtors opposed a stay,arguing that if the sale to five star were not closed before the end of the year,the debtors would almost certainly lose the sale.the debtors also asked that,if the court were to impose a stay,it require a bond of at least million.
not long thereafter,on november,the bankruptcy court entered a final judgment in favor of the debtors,authorizing the sale of the tic interests,in each of the seven adversary proceedings.on november,the committee appealed each judgment.
also on november,the bankruptcy court denied the committee expedited motion for a stay,finding that the tic would face only financial harm,which is not irreparable,if the sale to five star were consummated.the court concluded that the committee had also failed to show that the harm to the tic absent a stay was greater than the harm to others if a stay were imposed.nor had the committee shown a likelihood of success on the merits of its appeal.
eight days later,on december,the committee sought a stay from the,characterizing the situation as a bona fide emergency and asserting its likely success on appeal because the bankruptcy court had completely disregarded the protections provided to the tic owners by h.the debtors filed their opposition later that same day and emphasized the detrimental effect of imposing a stay the facilities are deteriorating and losing occupancy,the debtors are having difficulty funding operating costs,and piecemeal foreclosures with relief from stay by ge are the likely result of any delay.
even later in the day on december,the sale to five star closed.in a telephonic hearing with the on december,the debtors counsel represented that he had told the clerk at around on december that the debtors had been trying to close the sale for some time and that it could possibly close that same day or the next.counsel had filed the debtors opposition to the committee stay motion at approximately on december.the sale had closed at however,counsel had not notified the of the closing until approximately.one of the judges was of the opinion that the panel and the opposing party should have been advised that the actions sought to be stayed were going to occur he was deeply disturbed by and concerned about the sequence of events.
nonetheless,the denied the motion because the committee had delayed in seeking a stay and the sale to five star had closed.the noted that the committee counsel could not articulate a reason for having waited an entire week after the bankruptcy court had denied a stay to seek a stay in this court.and,because the committee had waited so long,the could no longer take any effective action.
the day after the sale had closed,the debtors moved to dismiss the committee appeal as moot pursuant to m.section m,the statutory mootness provision at issue on this appeal,provides that,absent a stay,a sale to a good faith purchaser under b or c,once consummated,can not be reversed or modified on appeal.sections b and c provide for a bankruptcy trustee sale of property of the estate both other than in the ordinary course of business b and in the ordinary course of business c.in response,the committee argued that m,by its terms,does not apply to a sale of property under h,the provision that permits in some circumstances the sale of property in which both the debtor and s own undivided interests as tenants in common,joint tenants,or tenants by the entirety.
after responding to the debtors motion to dismiss,the committee moved the to reconsider its denial of a stay.the committee renewed its request for a stay,despite the closing of the sale,so that no further prejudicial action could be taken.in support of its motion for reconsideration,the committee referred the to the committee response to the motion to dismiss.the committee did not otherwise provide any support for its motion.
