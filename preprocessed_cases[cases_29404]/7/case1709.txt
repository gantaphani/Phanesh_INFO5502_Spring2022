discussiona.is within congress article i powers 
article i,section,clause of the united states constitution grants congress the authority to establish uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies,art.i,cl.congress is also bestowed the power to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution its granted authority,art.i,cl.
section was added to the bankruptcy code to create a set of standards and accompanying penalties to regulate bankruptcy petition preparers,who are not employed or supervised by attorneys and who had proliferated across the country,often taking advantage of poor and speaking debtors.cong.rec.october.
scott contends that exceeds the scope of congress enumerated power under the bankruptcy clause.scott relies on language from the supreme court decision in northern pipeline construction marathon pipe line,d,which states that the restructuring of relations is at the core of the federal bankruptcy power however,scott reliance on northern pipeline is misplaced.that case dealt with the constitutionality of granting bankruptcy judges the power to hear cases generally within the ambit of article iii courts,and not with congress power under the bankruptcy clause to enact bankruptcy laws.see northern pipeline,at.
the quoted statement was made in the context of resolving whether the bankruptcy reform act of broad grant of jurisdiction to bankruptcy courts unconstitutionally conferred article iii judicial power upon iii judges.id.at.in holding the bankruptcy reform act unconstitutional,the supreme court characterized the act as containing unwarranted encroachments upon the judicial power of the united states,which our constitution reserves for article iii courts.id.at.the encroachment conclusion flowed from the jurisdictional grant of authority to bankruptcy courts to decide suits to recover accounts,controversies involving exempt property,actions to avoid transfers and payments as preferences or fraudulent conveyances,and causes of action owned by the debtor at the time of the petition for bankruptcy including claims based on state law as well as those based on federal law.id.at.citation omitted.critical to the court conclusion was that the bankruptcy court jurisdiction was with that of a district court.id.at.
nowhere in northern pipeline did the court limit congress substantive power under the bankruptcy clause to the restructuring of relations.in fact,the scope of congress power under the bankruptcy clause has been recognized as broad.see blanchette.insur,d.from the beginning,the tendency of legislation and of judicial interpretation has been uniformly in the direction of progressive liberalization in respect of the operation of the bankruptcy power.continental.bank trust of chicago chicago,ry.
use of the expansive power is targeted toward affording debtors a fresh start.see sliney battley in re schmitz,cir.before a debtor can seek that fresh start,however,the debtor must first file a petition with the clerk of the court.the filing of the petition in bankruptcy is significant because it triggers an automatic stay of actions against the debtor,the creation of an estate,and the appointment of a trustee.leonard rose dominican
