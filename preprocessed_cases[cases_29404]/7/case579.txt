opinion of the court 
this appeal involves two separate legal malpractice actions filed after the commencement of the bankruptcy case.the parties do not dispute that the first of the two actions constitutes property of the bankruptcy estate.the principal issue presented by this appeal is whether the second,successive malpractice action is also property of the estate.the appellant,anne,claims that since the second malpractice action did not accrue until four years after the bankruptcy filing,it is personal property and does not belong to the bankruptcy estate.the district court disagreed.
because second malpractice action is based on alleged pleading errors committed in the first malpractice action,and it is the bankruptcy estate that was harmed by the alleged malpractice that is the subject of the second action,we conclude that it constitutes an interest in property acquired by the bankruptcy estate pursuant to a.accordingly,we will affirm the order of the district court.
factual and procedural background 
in,anne purchased an apartment building for approximately million.milton sevack,a local attorney,represented her in the transaction.contends that,after the closing,she learned that the building contained structural flaws and that the seller had exaggerated the rental income.she claims that the investment placed her in a dire financial situation,ultimately leading to her filing a chapter bankruptcy petition on march,in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of new jersey.
thereafter,hired howard trueger to represent her in the bankruptcy proceedings.she also retained trueger to commence a lawsuit against sevack to recover damages arising from his mishandling of several matters including the purchase of the apartment building.in,trueger commenced a legal malpractice action against sevack in state court,asserting claims solely with respect to the apartment building purchase the sevack action according to,trueger omitted various other claims she had against sevack.there is no dispute that when the sevack action was filed,it became property of her bankruptcy estate.
on august,the bankruptcy court converted chapter reorganization proceeding into a chapter liquidation proceeding,and a trustee was named for the estate the trustee.the bankruptcy court then discharged on december.soon thereafter,because of impending ethics charges unrelated to the instant case,trueger withdrew as counsel.to replace trueger,retained the law firm of biunno,commisa taormina,
in may,the trustee proposed to settle the sevack action for.formally objected to what she believed was a low settlement figure.in an order dated july,the bankruptcy court denied the trustee proposed settlement and allowed to proceed with the sevack action in state court.in return,the trustee was to be entitled to the first of any net proceeds.the order also provided that the balance of any recovery may be retained by the debtor,as having been abandoned by the trustee after the bankruptcy court decision,dismissed biunno and retained hilton stein to represent her in the sevack action.in,stein settled the suit for an undisclosed amount.
shortly after the settlement,allegedly discovered that trueger had left out a number of her claims in the sevack action,but that the claims were now under the applicable new jersey statute of limitations.thus,in november,brought a second legal malpractice action against both trueger and biunno in the new jersey superior court the action.in her complaint,alleged that trueger had failed to plead all of her potential claims against sevack.she also contended that if biunno had properly informed her of trueger pleading mistake,she could have purchased the omitted claims from the trustee along with the apartment building claims further asserted that she settled the sevack action for substantially less than what she could have recovered had trueger and biunno properly raised and pled all of the claims against sevack.
biunno filed a motion in state court to dismiss complaint on the ground that the action constituted property of the bankruptcy estate and therefore lacked standing to prosecute the matter.the state court ordered to seek a determination in the bankruptcy court as to whether that malpractice action constituted estate property.in december,applied to the bankruptcy court for a ruling on that issue.
on july,the bankruptcy court issued a written opinion concluding that the action constituted property of the bankruptcy estate.relying on the supreme court decision in segal rochelle,d,the bankruptcy court held that the malpractice claims were sufficiently rooted in past to be considered property of the estate pursuant to a.
under an alternative analysis,the court also held that the claims constituted property of the estate pursuant to a,which includes a ny interest in property that the estate acquires after the commencement of the case.finally,the court held that was barred under from bringing the action in the first instance because she had failed to request that the trustee assert the malpractice claims on her behalf.
appealed the bankruptcy court decision to the united states district court for the district of new jersey.by order entered may,the district court rejected the bankruptcy court a analysis,but upheld the inclusion of the action in the estate under a on appeal from this order,argues that the district court incorrectly determined that the action constituted property of the estate under a.in response,appellees trueger and biunno argue that the lower court determination should be upheld under both a and a 
the bankruptcy court exercised jurisdiction over this proceeding pursuant to.the district court exercised jurisdiction to hear the appeal under.we have jurisdiction to hear this appeal pursuant to and d.our review of the district court decision to affirm the bankruptcy court order is plenary.
ii.discussion 
under title of the united states code the bankruptcy code,the filing of a voluntary petition in bankruptcy court commences a bankruptcy proceeding and creates an estate.a.the estate 
is comprised of all the following property,wherever located and by whomever held 
except as provided in subsections b and c of this section,all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.
any interest in property that the estate acquires after the commencement of the case.
accordingly,with limited exceptions none of which apply here,the estate encompasses everything that the debtor owns upon filing a petition,as well as any derivative rights,such as property interests the estate acquires after the case commences.see,united states whiting pools,d term estate refers to the grouping of the debtor assets which are subject to the claims of creditors.
we have previously emphasized congress intent to delineate in broad terms what constitutes property of the estate.see integrated solutions,service support specialties,cir.as the legislative history for states,i t includes all kinds of property,including tangible or intangible property,causes of action and all other forms of property currently specified in section of the bankruptcy act,at,reprinted in.the legislative purpose of this section was to move away from the complicated melange of references to state law and to determine what is property of the estate by a simple reference to what interests in property that debtor has at the time of the commencement of the case.id.at,at footnotes omitted.
while federal law defines what types of property comprise the estate,state law generally determines what interest,if any,a debtor has in property.congress talcott gruber,cir citing aquilino united states,d in re roach,cir quoting butner united states,d.as the supreme court has instructed 
p roperty interests are created and defined by state law.unless some federal interest requires a different result,there is no reason why such interests should be analyzed differently simply because an interested party is involved in a bankruptcy proceeding.uniform treatment of property interests by both state and federal courts within a state serves to reduce uncertainty,to discourage forum shoppi
