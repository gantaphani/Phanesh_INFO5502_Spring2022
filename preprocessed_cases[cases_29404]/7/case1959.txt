the asbestos settlement trust was uniquely created to resolve and liquidate thousands of personal injury and property damage claims against the celotex corporation and carey canada.this appeal involves one subset of those claims asbestos property damage claims by the city of new york that the claims administrator allowed but the trustees refused to pay.the city of new york and the trustees dispute the scope of the trustees power to overrule the administrator determinations,whether the administrator decisions or the trustees decisions are entitled to deference,and ultimately whether the city of new york claims must be paid.the bankruptcy court granted summary judgment in favor of the city of new york,and the district court affirmed.we affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.
the celotex corporation celotex was a major manufacturer and nationwide distributor of building materials containing asbestos.carey canada carey canada,a subsidiary of celotex,mined and distributed asbestos fiber until it ceased operations in.in october,celotex and carey canada collectively debtors filed petitions for chapter bankruptcy protection after being named as defendants in thousands of asbestos personal injury pi lawsuits filed by individuals and hundreds of asbestos property damage pd lawsuits filed by property owners injured by the presence of materials in their buildings.in re celotex,findings of fact and conclusions of law supporting confirmation of the plan of reorganization.the city of new york was one of those pd plaintiffs.
producing an acceptable and workable chapter reorganization plan ultimately required multiple proposals by interested parties,modifications,and extensive negotiations,settlements and compromises over the course of six years.id.at.a major point of contention involved how to ensure that pi and pd claimants would be paid in substantially equivalent proportions despite inherent class differences.the number of pd claims was fixed approximately claims from claimants,but the number of pi claimants over at last count continues to expand as new individuals manifest injuries.
the reorganization plan initially proposed by the debtors in march contemplated a segregated and fixed fund for pd claims,with pi claims being paid out of the remaining assets.the debtors proposal was supported by the asbestos property damage claimants committee however,other interested groups challenged the segregated fund as allegedly too large and therefore unfair to pi claimants,whose fractional recovery against the remaining assets might prove proportionately smaller than that of pd claimants.after lengthy and unsuccessful negotiations,the debtors proposed plan was withdrawn.the bankruptcy court denied confirmation,terminated the exclusive period under b,and opened the doors to interested parties to file proposed plans by july.id.at.
competing reorganization plans were filed by parties on both sides of the segregated fund dispute,with the debtors shifting alliances.the debtors,in cooperation with those who had opposed the debtors initial proposal collectively,the plan proponents,proposed one plan.the asbestos property damage claimants committee proposed another.id.at.
this time the competing factions successfully negotiated their differences.by agreement,the committee proposed plan was withdrawn and the plan proponents plan was modified and october.id.at.after subsequent modifications and a hearing on confirmation,the modified joint plan of reorganization under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code for the celotex corporation and carey canada the plan was confirmed by bankruptcy court in a written decision issued december.id.at.among many other things,the bankruptcy court found the settlements and compromises contained in the plan are fair,reasonable,equitable and in the best interest of the debtors creditors and their estates.id.at.
a principal feature of the plan is the creation of the asbestos settlement trust the trust,which was established in accordance with section g of the bankruptcy code,a provision specifically applicable to chapter reorganizations involving asbestos tort liabilities.g b i.the trust is also intended to be a qualified settlement fund under section of the internal revenue code.see plan,trust.it was executed under and is governed by florida law.trust.
the purposes of the trust are essentially to receive and manage the trust assets over billion,to assume the debtors current and future liabilities from asbestos pi and pd claims estimated at over billion,and to address,liquidate,resolve,and disallow or allow and pay asbestos claims.in re celotex,at see also g b i plan trust.in contrast to the original proposal of segregated funds,the trust adopts more of a hybrid approach by segregating the processing but not the payment of pi and pd claims.to ensure substantially equal treatment among both classes,all allowed claims are to be paid out of the trust as a unified fund,with the distribution of payments administered by a panel of trustees.see plan a,trust.the claims are processed in the first place,however,under separate procedures administered by different entities.pi claims are administered by the trustees under the asbestos personal injury claims resolution procedures apicrp.trust c viii,b iii.pd claims are administered by the property damage claims administrator the administrator under the asbestos property damage claims resolution procedures apdcrp.plan a trust,c.as the administrator is but one person,he is charged with the establishment and supervision of a claims facility the pd facility to conduct the processing and disposition of pd claims under the apdcrp.apdcrp iv a.the apicrp and the apdcrp,collectively known as the asbestos claims resolution procedures crp,are annexed to and incorporated by reference within the trust agreement collectively,the trust documents,and along with the trust agreement are in turn incorporated within the plan collectively,the plan documents plan,trust.in the event of inconsistencies,the plan controls.see trust.
the apdcrp set forth,among other things,the legal prerequisites for allowing or disallowing pd claims,the standard of proof,the documentation requirements for each category of pd claims,and the procedures for processing,investigating and officially resolving pd claims,including procedures for reconsideration and binding arbitration in the event the claimant is unsatisfied by the pd facility determination.apdcrp iv b e.although generally taking into account basic principles and laws of the tort system,the apdcrp relax the usual standards of proof by requiring only reasonable evidence or evidence sufficient to present a jury issue under the tort system of one of the applicable jurisdictions.apdcrp iii,iv a,b.a major tradeoff is that allowed claims are not paid in full.because the trust current and future liabilities for asbestos claims greatly exceed the trust assets,the plan directs the trustees to pay all allowed pi and pd claims according to a payment percentage,which the trustees may adjust from time to time to ensure substantially equal treatment of all present and future claims.see plan.historically,allowed claims have been paid at approximately to percent of the allowed amount.
in the event of disputes under the plan,the bankruptcy court retains jurisdiction for the purposes of,among other things,assuring performance of obligations under the trust and enforcing and interpreting the terms and conditions of the plan documents.see plan c e see also in re celotex,at.
the city of new york is one of pd claimants but the only claimant in this appeal.in,nyc filed approximately pd claims relating to asbestos in its public buildings.the pd facility initially allowed and disallowed of nyc claims.of those initially disallowed,claims were subsequently allowed by independent arbitrators under the apdcrp provisions for binding dispute resolution.thus,of nyc original claims,a total of were allowed and were disallowed under the apdcrp.
when submitted by the administrator to the trust for payment,however,the trustees agreed to pay only a small fraction of nyc allowed claims.the trustees refused to pay most,asserting that the administrator claim allowance decisions were,in the trustees judgment,erroneous under the apdcrp substantive standards.trustees did not once overrule the administrator,however,with regard to nyc claims that had been disallowed.
in september,nyc and the trustees turned to the bankruptcy court to resolve their emerging dispute,which largely centered on the trustees authority to refuse to pay allowed pd claims.in opposing motions,each party sought an order from the bankruptcy court upholding their respective interpretation of the plan documents,with nyc also requesting an order directing prompt payment of its allowed claims.the litigation proceeded pursuant to an agreed order permitting the trustees to review some of nyc disputed claims and providing that each party could present any issues,including claim disputes,to the bankruptcy court on a group basis in the interests of efficiency and judicial economy.after further review,the trustees ultimately paid of nyc allowed claims in an amount exceeding million.but the trustees continued to refuse payment of of nyc allowed claims,prompting nyc to again move to compel payment of all allowed pd claims.
in accordance with the agreed order,the trustees presented to the bankruptcy court demonstrative examples of their various grounds for nonpayment of the disputed claims.the trustees identified six illustrative claims,five of which numbers,and are at issue in this appeal.as noted by the district court,the illustrative claims were the trust best examples to prove its litigation position.both parties subsequently filed multiple cross motions for summary judgment.
addressing the parties fundamental dispute regarding the relative powers of the administrator and trustees over the allowance and payment of pd claims,the bankruptcy court held 
t he documents do not provide authority for the trust to review the administrator allowance of specific claims.this conclusion is based on the findings that the trust agreement and the apdcrp specifically delegate to the administrator the power to determine and allow claims the plan documents do not contain any procedures to resolve disputes involving claims that have been allowed by the administrator and the absence of a procedure for the trust review of allowed claims is consistent with the low transaction cost method of resolving claims that was fully negotiated prior to confirmation.
review by the trust of determinations by the administrator is limited to evaluating whether the administrator abused his discretion.this conclusion is consistent with the overall structure of the trust agreement and the apdcrp,which expressly delegate the function and responsibility for the analysis of property damage claims to the administrator.the conclusion is also based on prior decisions of the court,as well on certain provisions of the plan documents that confer limited oversight functions on the trust.
accordingly,in considering the trustees theories for nonpayment of the illustrative claims,the bankruptcy court reviewed the administrator not the trustees decisions under the apdcrp for an abuse of discretion.finding none,the court directed the trustees to pay the illustrative claims and all of nyc allowed claims that were similar.the parties subsequently stipulated that the bankruptcy court judgment would require payment of nyc disputed claims in an amount exceeding million plus interest.
reviewing the bankruptcy court decision de novo,the district court affirmed in total.the trustees,as representatives of the trust,now appeal to this court,which has jurisdiction under d.
as the second court of review of a bankruptcy court judgment,this court examines independently the bankruptcy court factual and legal determinations and employs the same two review standards used by the district court.in re club associates,cir internal quotation marks,footnote and citation omitted.specifically,we review a bankruptcy court factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.in re sublett,cir.of course,this being a summary judgment proceeding which by definition involves no findings of fact,only one of those standards is appropriate de novo review.in re optical,cir.in adversary proceedings in bankruptcy cases,we apply the usual and summary judgment standards.see.in re optical,at.
like the bankruptcy and district courts before us,before analyzing the validity of nyc disputed asbestos claims,we must first resolve the more fundamental issues of the relative powers of the administrator and the trustees over the resolution and payment of pd claims and whether either decisions are entitled to deference.the trustees claim they possess the discretionary authority to overrule the administrator and deny payment of claims they determine to be invalid under the apdcrp.accordingly,the trustees argue that the bankruptcy court should have reviewed their decisions for an abuse of discretion,not the administrator decisions which allegedly do not warrant deferential review.nyc responds that the trustees actions are ultra vires under the trust and apdcrp,which properly assign to the administrator exclusive authority and discretion to resolve pd claims and to direct payment by the trustees.
to determine the respective powers of the trustees and the administrator,we must independently interpret the terms of the plan documents,especially the trust agreement and the incorporated apdcrp.see firestone tire rubber bruch,d as they do with contractual provisions,courts construe terms in trust agreements without deferring to either party interpretation.the extent of a trustee duties and powers is determined by the trust instrument and the rules of law which are applicable,and not by his own interpretation of the instrument or his own belief as to the rules of law.restatement second of trusts cmt.b.from the trust,the trustee derives the rule of his conduct,the extent and limit of his authority,the measure of his obligation.jones first bank in fort lauderdale,so d,see also.stat.ann.t he trustee can properly exercise such powers and only such powers as a are conferred upon him in specific words by the terms of the trust,or b are necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of the trust and are not forbidden by the terms of the trust.restatement second of trusts see also id.the extent and limit of the administrator powers are similarly determined by the terms of the trust agreement.plan,b apdcrp iv a see also restatement second of trusts t he settlor may grant powers to the trustee,a beneficiary,or a third person otherwise unconnected with the trust.
with regard to the particular question of whether the trustees may be duty bound to comply with the administrator determinations,the general rule is 
if under the terms of the trust a person has power to control the action of the trustee in certain respects,the trustee is under a duty to act in accordance with the exercise of such power,unless the attempted exercise of the power violates the terms of the trust or is a violation of a fiduciary duty to which such person is subject in the exercise of the power.
restatement second of trusts see also herman nationsbank trust georgia,cir applying cmt.b as the black letter law of trusts.the trustees concede the general proposition that a trust instrument can delegate a power of control to a third party however,they contend in this case that the plan documents assign no such power to the administrator.we disagree.
as discussed below,the plan documents establish a clear separation of powers between the trustees and the administrator.the trust assigns to the administrator virtually exclusive authority to implement the apdcrp and to manage the processing and ultimate allowance or disallowance of pd claims.although the power to pay allowed pd claims is reserved to the trustees,the plan documents grant them no authority to independently review or overrule the administrator determinations.instead,the trustees ordinarily must pay claims as allowed by the administrator,whose determinations are binding on the trust.
the trust agreement defines the administrator as the officer responsible for implementation of the apdcrp and processing of pd claims.trust.more specifically,the administrator is responsible for t he allowance of pd claims,which must be done exclusively in accordance with the apdcrp.trust c.the apdcrp are in accord,providing that the administrator is responsible for implementing these apdcrp,which establish the exclusive procedures for evaluating,liquidating,paying and disposing of asbestos property damage claims pursuant to the plan.apdcrp i emphasis added.
the apdcrp do not provide any role for the trustees.in fact,the trust agreement expressly prohibits the trustees involvement,directing that the trustees shall not interfere with the independence of the administrator in administering the apdcrp.trust c.the only entity authorized to assist the administrator in processing property damage claims under the apdcrp is the pd facility,which is established by the administrator for the disposition and payment of claims pursuant to these apdcrp.apdcrp iv a.
under the apdcrp detailed procedures for processing claims,the property damage facility shall review the claim form to determine whether the necessary documentation has been submitted and will determine whether the claim will be allowed,including the allowed dollar amount.apdcrp iv e see also plan defining allowed amount.the pd facility even may negotiate and compromise claims.apdcrp iv e.the apdcrp provide for review beyond the pd facility determination only if a claim is disallowed in full or in part,in which case the claimant may request reconsideration and ultimately binding dispute resolution before an independent arbitrator.apdcrp iv e.at both levels of appeal,the apdcrp expressly provide for de novo review.id.the apdcrp do not provide for any further review by any other entities.if at any time in this process a claim is allowed in full or in part and the claimant accepts that determination or exhausts both levels of review,review proceedings under the apdcrp conclude and the administrator submits the allowed claim to the trustees for payment.
deeming a claim allowed is not just a procedural formality it also affects the claim enforceability.if the claimant accepts the determination of the property damage facility as to the amount of such claimant allowed claim,that decision will be final and binding on both parties and may not be reopened.apdcrp iv e.moreover,a n allowed claim shall be,and be deemed to be,a judgment against the trust as successor for all purposes to the liabilities of celotex and carey canada in respect of asbestos claim,in the allowed amount of such claim,subject only to the payment percentage applicable thereto.apdcrp iv a emphasis added accord in re celotex,at.the plan itself is even more explicit,providing that an allowed claim shall constitute a final,judgment against the trust.plan emphasis added.
accordingly,once a claim is allowed by the administrator and submitted to the trustees,there is little for the trustees to do beyond applying the payment percentage and paying the claim.see plan a each asbestos property damage claim against celotex shall be addressed,allowed or disallowed and,if allowed,paid by the trust pursuant to and in accordance with the apdcrp.the trust agreement directs that the trustees shall promptly pay both asbestos personal injury claims and pd claims under the terms of both the apicrp and the apdcrp,as applicable.trust a.payment of pd claims shall be made by the trustees in the amount determined by the administrator pursuant to the apdcrp,subject only to the payment percentage.trust c,a see also plan.
taken together,the plan,the trust agreement,and the apdcrp assign to the administrator virtually exclusive authority over the processing and the allowance or disallowance of pd claims under the apdcrp.additionally,they assign to the administrator the power to bind the trust and,correspondingly,mandate payment by the trustees in accordance with the administrator determinations.we construe such terms as effectively granting to the administrator the power to control the trustees actions in regard to the payment of pd claims.see restatement second of trusts if under the terms of the trust a person has power to control the action of the trustee in certain respects,the trustee is ordinarily under a duty to act in accordance.
we reject the trustees contention that the plan documents should be read as granting only advisory powers based on the administrator relationship to the trust.their arguments that the administrator is a mere trust advisor,not a trust officer,and is tainted with conflicts of interest are of doubtful merit.see trust defining the administrator as the officer responsible for implementation of the apdcrp in re celotex,at finding this administrator is disinterested and that his compensation package is fair,reasonable and necessary under the circumstances and will help to ensure the successful operation of the trust.
more fundamentally,however,the trustees arguments are misplaced under the plan and applicable principles of trust law.first and foremost,the plan documents express terms are controlling regarding the respective powers of the administrator and the trustees,including any assignment of power to control the trustees actions.see restatement second of trusts cmt.b see also plan trust.because such a power of control is expressly assigned to the administrator,his otherwise designated relationship to the trust is of only collateral relevance.the holder of a power of control may be a,the settlor,a beneficiary,or a third person otherwise unconnected with the trust.the relationship of the holder of the power is unimportant,except in so far as it may be a factor in determining the nature or extent of the power.restatement second of trusts cmt.a see,pounds pounds,so d,upholding a trust provision that expressly empowered a third party to vote stock held by the trust,regardless of the fact that he had been removed as a due to a conflict of interest,as the trust did not require that he be a trustee to exercise the power.
with regard to the nature and extent of the administrator power of control,the trustees put the cart before the horse in first declaring the administrator to be a and deducing therefrom that the trust agreement can not be read as assigning any power of control to the administrator.in the absence of an express provision,the nature of the administrator relationship and powers with respect to the trust beneficiaries determines whether he is a fiduciary.see restatement second of trusts cmt.h,cmt.c see,united states mitchell,d inferring a fiduciary relationship between the united states and indian allottees based on the nature of the obligations imposed on the government through statutory and regulatory provisions,despite the absence of an express fiduciary provision.here,because the administrator power to allow or disallow claims and to direct payment by the trustees is for the benefit of asbestos claimants rather than himself,the administrator is subject to a fiduciary duty in the exercise of the power and has discretion as the exercise of it to the extent to which such discretion is conferred upon him by the terms of the trust.restatement second of trusts cmts.c,e see also firestone,at.o ne is a fiduciary to the extent he exercises any discretionary authority or control.thus,the trustees must ordinarily comply with the administrator exercise of his power of control absent notice that the administrator is violating his duty as a fiduciary.restatement second of trusts cmt.
the trustees correctly point out that the plan documents impose procedural and substantive limitations on the administrator authority to allow claims.see,trust c granting authority to allow claims in accordance with the apdcrp apdcrp iv b setting forth the prerequisites to allowing claims.but such provisions are hardly inconsistent with the administrator express authority to bind the trust and the trustees ordinary duty to comply with the administrator directives.these provisions are certainly relevant to our inquiry,but only in determining the extent of the administrator discretion in the exercise of his power of control and whether the administrator has exceeded that authority.see restatement second of trusts cmt.c,cmt.d setting forth factors that may be relevant in determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion,including the existence or,the definiteness or indefiniteness,of an external standard by which the reasonableness of the decision maker conduct can be judged.
turning our attention to the trustees powers,the trustees have failed to cite,and we have been unable to find,a single provision in the plan,the trust agreement,or the apdcrp expressly or impliedly granting the trustees the broad supervisory authority over the administrator they claim to possess.as illustrated above,the apdcrp set forth the exclusive procedures for the allowance or disallowance of property damage claims,leaving little for the trustees to do except pay the allowed claims.the trust agreement is consistent,providing the trustees with broad authority over the trust generally but only limited authority in regard to paying pd claims.
the trust agreement provides that the trustees are fiduciaries to the trust and empowered to take any and all actions that,in the judgment of the trustees,are necessary or proper to fulfill the purposes of the trust,including,without limitation,each power expressly granted in this article,and any power reasonably incidental thereto.trust a.however,the trustees powers are also s ubject to the limitations set forth in this trust agreement.id.
among other things,the trustees are expressly empowered to establish,supervise and administer the trust in accordance with the crp and to administer,amend,supplement or modify the apicrp.trust c viii.similarly,the article governing claims administration directs the trustees to administer the processing and payment of asbestos personal injury claims in accordance with the apicrp.trust b iii.noticeably absent from any of these provisions,however,is any authority to supervise or administer the apdcrp or the resolution of pd claims thereunder.quite the opposite,the trust agreement expressly limits the trustees ability to exercise any such supervisory authority and commands the trustees to pay pd claims as allowed by the administrator.
the trustees shall not interfere with the actions and decisions of the administrator that are consistent with the apdcrp nor shall the trustees interfere with the independence of the administrator in administering the apdcrp payment of pd claims shall be made by the trustees in the amount determined by the administrator pursuant to the apdcrp.
the trustees point out that the prohibition against interference with the administrator decisions applies only insofar as they are consistent with the apdcrp.true enough,but to interpret this qualifier as an implied grant of authority to independently review and overrule the administrator decisions goes too far.this provision indeed acknowledges that the administrator does not have unlimited discretion and implies that the trustees may have some role if the administrator actions or decisions are not consistent with the apdcrp.this provision does not,however,contain any affirmative grant of authority to the trustees to unilaterally determine that the administrator has exceeded his authority or to expropriate the authority to allow or disallow pd claims.the trustees interpretation would allow the exception to swallow the rule.independence from the trustees interference would have little,if any,meaning if the trustees had the discretion to review the administrator decisions to determine whether they may or may not interfere.effectively,the trustees would supplant the administrator as the decision maker in all cases and contravene the plain meaning of the restriction.see johannssen dist.coast,meba pension plan,cir.the extent of the trustees implied authority to interfere with the administrator decisions must be far more limited.see discussion infra part 
the trustees exclusive authority to pay pd claims also does not imply the power to independently review those claims.disbursing trust assets is a classic example of a trustee duty that may be subject to a third party control.see restatement second of trusts cmt.here,the plan instructs quite simply that each property damage claim shall be allowed or disallowed and,if allowed,paid.plan a see also apdcrp iv a allowed for payment.again,property damage claims are allowed or disallowed only under the apdcrp,which provide no role for the trustees.trust c apdcrp i,iv a,a,e.also,an allowed claim shall constitute a final,judgment against the trust.plan accord apdcrp iv a,e.finally,the trustees shall promptly pay allowed pd claims in the amount determined by the administrator pursuant to the apdcrp.trust c.the strict procedures established by these provisions leave the trustees no leeway to independently reassess pd claims before payment.indeed,these provisions make the trustees payment responsibility mandatory,not discretionary.the trustees payment of claims as allowed by the administrator is required by the terms of the trust and by the principles of law applicable to the duties of trustees specifically,the trustees duty to comply with the administrator power of control regarding the allowance of pd claims.restatement second of trusts cmt.a citing id.
article of the trust agreement sets forth the trustees only express functions in the course of paying allowed claims,none of which include the power to independently review and overrule the administrator determinations.subsections a and b require the trustees to determine the fractional recovery for each allowed claim from the limited trust assets by calculating and applying the payment percentage to the allowed amount.see trust a,b.the trustees are granted no power,however,to adjust the allowed amount,which is determined by the administrator.see plan trust c apdcrp iv e.
subsections c and e further provide that,subject to certain restrictions,t he trustees shall have complete discretion to determine the timing and the appropriate method for making payments,as installments,as well as discretion to alter the order of processing or to temporarily limit or suspend payments,in the event of limited liquidity.trust c,e.however,nowhere is it mentioned that the trustees may entirely refuse to pay allowed claims.see trust a,c providing that the trustees shall pay pd claims as allowed see also restatement second of trusts cmt.a recognizing that a trustee duty may be mandatory even though the trustee has discretion as to the time,manner and extent of its exercise.
finally,subsection d empowers the trustees to conduct limited audits to verify information in the course of paying allowed claims.the trustees argument that this provision contains no such express or implied limitation is belied by its express terms the trustees shall conduct random or other audits to verify information submitted in connection with the crp in a manner consistent with the crp.trust d emphasis added.the plan documents must be construed as a whole,with each provision given reasonable meaning and effect.golden door jewelry creations,lloyds underwriters ass n,cir applying florida law.we therefore can not interpret the trustees narrowly defined audit power as encompassing the far broader powers they seek to conduct a de novo,substantive review of allowed pd claims and to entirely refuse payment in their discretion.such an interpretation would not only render superfluous the express limitations in article it also would be inconsistent with the provisions granting virtually exclusive authority to the administrator to resolve pd claims and bind the trust,prohibiting interference by the trustees,and directing the trustees to promptly pay pd claims as allowed by the administrator.see,plan trust a,c apdcrp i,iv e.
in determining the extent and limits of the trustees powers with regard to allowed pd claims,we are also guided by another principle of contract construction.the doctrine of expressio unius est exclusio alterius instructs that when certain matters are mentioned in a contract,other similar matters not mentioned were intended to be excluded.plumbers steamfitters local pension fund vertex constr,cir accord shumrak broken sound club,so d.here,the plan documents repeatedly manifest the drafters ability to clearly and precisely delegate and limit authority over the resolution of asbestos claims.notably,the plan documents expressly authorize and provide procedures for two levels of de novo review of the pd facility determinations,but only by individuals other than the trustees.apdcrp iv e.also,oversight authority over the apdcrp is vested in the administrator,not the trustees,and a pd claim allowed under the apdcrp is deemed to constitute a final,judgment.plan trust c apdcrp iv a,e.by contrast,there are no provisions expressly empowering the trustees to conduct their own de novo review of and overrule the judgment presented to them for payment,let alone issue their own rulings having similar effect.instead,the plan documents enumerate only certain narrowly defined duties related to the trustees payment of claims and otherwise command that the trustees shall promptly pay allowed pd claims in the amount determined by the administrator.trust a,c.the proposition that the trust agreement was intended to imply,through vague and ambiguous provisions,a balance of power antithetical to that reflected in its express provisions is simply untenable.
the trust assignment to the administrator of the power to issue binding determinations of pd claims,and the corresponding lack of provisions for the trustees independent review of those determinations,are consistent with the purposes of the trust and the apdcrp.in particular,this system does much to advance the stated goal of providing a low transaction cost method of resolving and liquidating property damage claims.apdcrp iii.given the trust limited resources to process and pay claims,the low transaction cost method is intended to strike a proper balance between the sometimes conflicting goals of efficiency and accuracy,while also ensuring that all valid claims are paid in a fair and substantially equivalent manner.see see also in re celotex,at finding that the plan is designed and intended,among other things,to ii provide a simple,economical procedure for obtaining and encouraging the prompt,efficient and equitable resolution of all asbestos claims,iii provide fair and equitable compensation to holders of claims,and iv resolve disputed issues in a complete and fair manner 
the low transaction cost method is evident in many terms of the trust agreement and the apdcrp.for instance,the administrator shall use his best efforts to complete the processing of all claims within two years of the effective date,apdcrp i there is an incentive bonus if the administrator keeps expenses under percent of the allowed amount of claims,trust a,apdcrp iv a the standard of proof is reduced to reasonable evidence,or evidence sufficient to present a jury issue,apdcrp iv a,b given the historical payment percentages of to percent,allowed claims are essentially settled,not litigated,trust a settlement of claims is favored over more expensive and time arguably more of dispute resolution,while litigation is least favored,trust b i,apdcrp iv e and the apdcrp incentivize the final resolution of claims without further levels of review by providing that claimants shall pay the costs of arbitration unless it results in an award of at least percent of the pd facility determination,apdcrp iv e.the provisions of the plan documents making the administrator determinations final and binding on the trust,as well as the corresponding lack of provisions for further review by the trustees,are also consistent with this low transaction cost method.
the trustees nevertheless contend that depriving them of supervisory authority over the administrator is inconsistent with the additional trust purposes of paying only valid claims and treating all pi and pd claims in a substantially equivalent manner.see trust apdcrp iii.we disagree.the plan documents are designed to achieve these goals through means other than centralizing all authority over pi and pd claims.for instance,the apicrp and the apdcrp set forth detailed procedures and standards for determining the validity of claims.in confirming both sets of crp along with the plan,the bankruptcy court found that they are fair and reasonable and provide mechanisms for substantially similar treatment of the holders of asbestos claims.in re celotex,at.similarly,the trust agreement requires parity in the timing and manner of payments,trust a,and uniform application of the payment percentage,which is expressly intended t o ensure substantially equivalent treatment among all claims,trust a.
we reject the trustees arguments that the express terms of the trust agreement and the apdcrp are inadequate and that supervisory powers over an allegedly unruly administrator must have been granted to the trustees as indispensable to ensuring the trust purpose of paying only valid claims.the confirmed plan documents are the result of extensive arms length negotiations among the interested parties and embody various settlements and compromises.in re celotex,at.even according to the trustees,many of the issues they now raise existed and were known when the plan was confirmed and s ome are created by the structure of the trust agreement itself.were such issues intended to be addressed by granting the trustees supervisory powers over the administrator,the plan documents should have expressly so provided.instead,they make the administrator determinations final and binding and direct the trustees to pay claims as allowed.the plan documents set forth the entire agreement of the interested parties,and n o entity shall be bound by any terms other than as expressly provided for t herein.plan accord trust.to borrow from the bankruptcy court,the parties are bound by the agreement that they reached.
given our interpretation of the plan documents thus far,the trustees are left with only limited means to block an alleged violation of the apdcrp,as they have sought to do in this case.we agree with the bankruptcy court conclusion that the administrator actions and decisions in resolving pd claims are subject to review only for an abuse of his discretion under the apdcrp.
in attempting to arrogate supervisory authority over the administrator,the trustees contend that their decisions to allow or disallow claims under the apdcrp are entitled to deference and are subject to review by the bankruptcy court only for an abuse of discretion.we agree with the trustees statement of the standard of review of claims determinations under the apdcrp.we simply disagree as to whose decisions are entitled to such deference in this case.the trustees citation of firestone does not help their cause.the court indeed recognized trust principles make a deferential standard of review appropriate when a trustee exercises discretionary powers.firestone,at.citing restatement second of trusts.but the court went on to hold firestone can seek no shelter in these principles of trust law,however,for there is no evidence that under firestone termination pay plan the administrator has the power to construe uncertain terms or that eligibility determinations are to be given deference.id.the trustees are similarly situated.as we have already determined,nothing in the plan documents grants the trustees discretion to independently determine the validity of pd claims under the apdcrp.
in fact,such authority is reserved to the administrator,who can seek shelter in the principles of trust law set forth in firestone,at.although such principles are stated in relation to the powers of a trustee,see,restatement second of trusts,they are equally applicable in this case to the administrator,whose determinations of pd claims are binding on the trust and the trustees.a third party with authority to control the actions of a trustee may have discretion and be owed deference with respect to the exercise of that authority according to the same legal principles that apply to a trustee exercise of discretionary authority.see restatement second of trusts cmt.c.
