these appeals challenge several rulings of the bankruptcy court in lengthy chapter proceedings involving resource technology corporation rtc.prior to its involuntary placement in bankruptcy,rtc was in the business of developing conversion systems at landfills.other aspects of this bankruptcy have been addressed in several earlier appeals.see.inv.trust am.grading,cir in re res.tech,cir in re res.tech,cir.we have consolidated these two cases for decision because they are procedurally interrelated and share a common factual background.
section of the bankruptcy code allows a bankruptcy trustee to assume certain executory contracts of the debtor and assign them to a third party as long as the bankruptcy court has received adequate assurance of future performance.a,f b.rtc had contracts with four illinois landfills for the exclusive right to develop conversion projects at the landfill sites.during the course of the bankruptcy,rtc key officers assumed managerial positions in two,and scattered then had these companies designated as beneficiaries of a investment trust known as illinois investment trust the investment trust or the trust.the idea was to have the trustee assume and assign rtc contracts to the trust.
the plan ran into trouble,however,when the bankruptcy trustee applied to the court for permission to assume and assign the contracts,as f b requires.the owners of the four landfills objected they did not believe the investment trust could demonstrate adequate assurance of future performance because it had not explained how it would obtain the million necessary to perform rtc obligations under the contracts.the bankruptcy court agreed with the landfill owners and rejected the proposed assignments.the district court affirmed,and the investment trust appealed to this court.
the second case is an appeal by chiplease,and it challenges several orders made in connection with a settlement requiring chiplease to pay rtc chapter operating expenses in exchange for the assignment of certain rtc contracts.while the dispute involving the trust was working its way through the lower courts,a group of administrative claimants challenged chiplease failure to comply with a court order requiring it to deposit in an escrow account as security for rtc ongoing operating expenses.chiplease claimed it was excused from the requirement because it had independently paid about million in rtc operating expenses.the bankruptcy court disagreed and ordered chiplease to make the deposit.chiplease appealed to the district court,which affirmed and also found chiplease in contempt for failing to comply with the order.chiplease appealed.
we affirm in both cases.the bankruptcy court carefully evaluated the proposal under f b,and its decision to deny the trustee motion was sound.we likewise see no reason to disturb the bankruptcy judge determination that chiplease failed to comply with the court order requiring an escrow deposit.finally,the district court contempt finding is fully supported by the record the court thoroughly considered and properly rejected chiplease defense to contempt.
background 
in the rtc was in the business of collecting gas emitted from garbage landfills and either selling it or converting it into electricity.rtc had contracts with the owners of several illinois landfills that gave it the exclusive right to develop and install conversion projects at the landfills.four of these agreements are at issue in this appeal.rtc never collected enough revenue from its operations to offset the expense of capturing the gas,and by the company became the subject of an involuntary chapter petition.for a time during the course of the lengthy bankruptcy proceedings,rtc case proceeded under chapter as a reorganization,but as the prospects for rtc recovery grew increasingly dim,the bankruptcy court converted the case back into a chapter proceeding.
the bankruptcy trustee eventually entered into a settlement agreement with some of rtc creditors,including chiplease and scattered,the two companies whose principals are former owners and directors of rtc.leon greenblatt and andrew jahelka owned rtc greenblatt owned chiplease,and greenblatt and jahelka together owned scattered.as part of this agreement,the trustee was to assume some of rtc landfill contracts and assign them to chiplease and scattered,and chiplease was to pay rtc operating expenses while rtc remained in bankruptcy.the agreement also required chiplease to establish a escrow as security for these expenses.the bankruptcy court approved the settlement agreement.
a.the investment trust appeal 
pursuant to f b,the bankruptcy trustee asked the court for permission to assume four rtc landfill agreements and assign them to chiplease and scattered,which would then reassign to the investment trust.the trust had been organized under illinois law in to engage in dividend reinvestment plans but remained dormant for more than a decade and did not engage in any business operations.while the rtc bankruptcy was ongoing,however,scattered and chiplease had been made the beneficiaries of the trust,and intended to use it to receive certain rtc assets and the business.with this in mind,john connolly,rtc president,was appointed as the trustee of the investment trust.
at the time of the bankruptcy trustee f b motion,the city of peoria and allied waste industries allied owned the landfills that were the subject of the underlying agreements.they objected to the proposed assignment of their contracts to the investment trust they did not believe the trust could demonstrate adequate assurance of future performance as required by f b.after lengthy discovery and a trial on the objections,the bankruptcy judge agreed with peoria and allied and rejected the proposed assignments.the parties had stipulated that it would cost about million to perform the obligations under the agreements,and at the time of the trial,the trust had less than cash on hand and no operating history.greenblatt and jahelka testified that chiplease and scattered would lend the required million to the trust,but the judge was unconvinced.he concluded that the trust was not financially capable of performing under the agreement,and scattered and chiplease had their own financial problems.the judge also doubted that the trust had any effective way of requiring scattered and were the trust lend it the money it needed to perform the contracts.
two weeks later scattered and chiplease moved the court to reconsider.the motion proposed assigning the same contracts to a new entity called illinois generating station.the judge denied the motion for two reasons.first,interpreting the motion as an entirely new proposal,the court held that it was untimely.alternatively,if the motion was properly interpreted as a motion to reconsider based on new evidence,the judge concluded that the evidence was not newly discovered.the investment trust appealed to the district court,the district court affirmed,and the trust appealed to this court.
chiplease appeal 
as the proposal involving the investment trust moved from the bankruptcy court to the district court,two administrative claimants complained to the bankruptcy judge that chiplease had not complied with its obligations under the settlement agreement to establish a escrow as security for rtc operating expenses.paragraph of the settlement order set forth chiplease obligations in detail 
as more fully set forth in paragraph of the settlement agreement i chiplease shall deposit the sum of to be held in escrow by its counsel for the payment of all unpaid chapter operating expenses above and any expenses incurred while the estate continues to operate rtc business 
paragraph of the settlement agreement,in turn,stated 
chiplease shall pay all unpaid chapter operating expenses above and any expenses incurred while the estate continues to operate rtc business expenses.the estate shall pay the first of these expenses.on or before the closing date,chiplease shall deliver to its counsel the sum of to be used to pay the expenses adequate security.
paragraph also established a detailed procedure setting forth how chiplease was required to pay rtc operating expenses it said expenses would be paid upon submission of an expense request by the bankruptcy trustee.when the settlement order was entered,the parties had estimated that the operating costs would be between and.chiplease claims that it directly paid more than million in operating expenses between to,but it is undisputed that it never complied with the express terms of paragraph payment particularly,it did not comply with its obligation to deposit into escrow and follow the payment procedures specifically established in the settlement agreement.
accordingly,the administrative claimants asked the bankruptcy court to order chiplease to post the security required by paragraph of the settlement order.chiplease objected,claiming that its failure to establish the escrow account should be excused because it had already directly paid more than twice that amount in rtc operating expenses.the bankruptcy trustee supported the administrative claimants motion,arguing that the payment procedures prescribed by the agreement prohibited chiplease from unilaterally deciding what expenses to pay.the trustee also argued that the escrow requirement was designed to ensure the existence of an adequate fund from which approved operating expenses could be paid.the bankruptcy court agreed with the trustee and ordered chiplease to make the escrow deposit of,as required by the settlement order.chiplease appealed to the district court and asked for a stay of the bankruptcy court order.the district court denied the stay and on july,specifically ordered chiplease to make the escrow deposit.with an exception not relevant here,the district court later affirmed the bankruptcy court 
chiplease did not comply with the court july order,however,and on the trustee motion,the district court initiated a civil contempt proceeding.chiplease defended its failure to comply,claiming it was financially unable to establish the escrow account.the district court rejected this argument,held chiplease in contempt,and ordered it to pay a penalty of per day until it complied with the escrow requirement.the court also ordered chiplease to pay the bankruptcy trustee attorney fees associated with the contempt proceeding.a week later chiplease asked the court to reconsider its decision,claiming new evidence.the court denied this motion based on chiplease lack of diligence in gathering the new evidence and presenting it to the court.
ii.discussion 
we review the bankruptcy court conclusions of law de novo and its factual findings for clear error.freeland enodis,cir.if the bankruptcy court account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety,we will not reverse its factual findings even if we would have weighed the evidence differently.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
a.the investment trust appeal 
allied standing to challenge the proposed assignment 
the trust begins with a curious argument about standing,claiming that allied lacked standing to challenge the trustee proposed assumption and assignment of the contracts at issue in this appeal.this argument makes little sense.article iii standing requirements apply to proceedings in bankruptcy courts just as they do to proceedings in district courts.in re fedpak,cir.however,b ankruptcy standing is narrower than article iii standing.in re cult awareness network,cir.standing to object to a proposed bankruptcy order requires that the objector have a pecuniary interest in the outcome of the bankruptcy proceedings.id.although allied did not have any ownership interest in the landfills in the when the rtc contracts were signed,by the time of the bankruptcy,it was the owner by succession and was identified by the trustee as rtc contract partner in three of the agreements.peoria owns the landfill involved in the fourth.although the investment trust now contends that allied did not prove in the bankruptcy court that it owns the landfills in question,everyone proceeded on that understanding,and the trust itself referred to allied as the owner in several of its filings.there is absolutely nothing in the record to suggest that allied is not the owner of the landfills.tellingly,although it had every incentive to do so,the investment trust has never identified who if not allied actually does own the landfills and therefore is a party to the agreements sought to be assumed and assigned.quite obviously,there would be no reason for allied to object to the assignments if it had no ownership interest in the landfills.we reject the investment trust challenge to allied standing.
adequate assurance of future performance 
the investment trust argues that the bankruptcy court erred in rejecting its proposal under f b.as we have noted,of the bankruptcy code allows the bankruptcy trustee to assume and assign a contract of the debtor to another party,but only if adequate assurance of future performance by the assignee of such contract is provided.f b.adequate assurance of future performance is interpreted by reference to section of the uniform commercial code.cinicola scharffenberger,cir richmond leasing capital bank,cir see also report of the commission on bankruptcy laws of the united states,doc,pt,at observing that the phrase adequate assurance of future performance is adopted from uniform commercial code.several factors are relevant to the determination the financial ability to perform the contract the general economic climate the existence of a guarantee the reputation of the party seeking to assume responsibility for the contract and past dealings between the parties.see,richmond leasing,at identifying the first three factors cmt.discussing the last two factors.we review the bankruptcy court determination for clear error.in re liljeberg,cir.
the investment trust argues first that the bankruptcy court applied the incorrect legal standard by essentially requiring an absolute guarantee of performance.see in re carlisle homes,observing that the required assurance will fall considerably short of an absolute guarantee of performance citation omitted.as used in f b,adequate is a term of art and simply means assurances that are commercially reasonable under the particular circumstances of the case.this is a commonsense,inquiry,and f b is given a practical,pragmatic construction,richmond leasing,at.our review of the record convinces us that the bankruptcy court applied the correct standard.
the judge focused his inquiry on whether the investment trust could show by a preponderance of the evidence that future performance is likely.contrary to the trust argument,this statement does not suggest that the court required an absolute guarantee of performance.instead,the court required the trust to show it was more likely than not to perform the obligations of the contract.this is the standard commonly applied to evaluate the adequacy of the assurances for purposes of f b.see in re prime motor inns,citing cases and explaining that an adequate assurance means that performance should be more probable than not.as the party seeking to become the assignee,the trust had the burden of proving it met the requirements of f.see in re.health.
to understand the bankruptcy judge decision,it is important to place the proposed transaction in context.the trust was created under illinois law as an investment vehicle but was long dormant scattered and chiplease were named as its beneficiaries while the rtc bankruptcy was ongoing and rtc principals decided to use the trust to hold and manage the four rtc contracts they wanted to assume.the parties agreed that it would take about million to perform rtc obligations under these contracts.thus,the investment trust ability to obtain million in financing was,to use the bankruptcy judge words,absolutely essential to the trust ability to perform the trust had no independent assets or revenue stream and was entirely dependent on other entities for capital.although scattered and chiplease intended to loan the investment trust the million it needed to perform the four landfill agreements,the trust had no enforceable right to demand this financing,as the bankruptcy judge noted.the judge was understandably skeptical that
