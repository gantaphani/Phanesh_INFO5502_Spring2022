in maney kagenveama in re kagenveama,cir,we held that b b does not impose a minimum duration for a chapter bankruptcy plan if the debtor has no projected disposable income,as defined in the statute.today,sitting en banc,we overrule that aspect of kagenveama and hold that the statute permits confirmation only if the length of the proposed plan is at least equal to the applicable commitment period under b.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the bankruptcy court.
background 
debtors cesar and ana flores filed a petition for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code.they have unsecured debts.they proposed a plan of reorganization under which they would pay per month of allowed,unsecured,nonpriority claims for three years.chapter trustee rod danielson objected to the plan,arguing,as now relevant,that b requires a minimum duration of five years for persons in debtors circumstances 
the bankruptcy court sustained the trustee objection,holding that debtors were not entitled to a shorter plan duration because the supreme court decision in hamilton lanning,is clearly irreconcilable with kagenveama the bankruptcy court confirmed a plan of five years duration,which provided for monthly payments of to unsecured creditors 
debtors timely appealed to the bankruptcy appellate panel.the bankruptcy court then certified the issue for direct appeal to this court pursuant to d.a divided panel of this court reversed,reasoning that lanning is not clearly irreconcilable with kagenveama and that,under kagenveama,b allows a shorter plan duration for debtors.danielson flores in re flores,cir.we then voted to rehear the case en banc.danielson flores in re flores,cir 
ii.analysis 
chapter is a mechanism available to individual s with regular income whose debts are within statutory limits,e.unlike chapter,which requires debtors to liquidate nonexempt assets to pay creditors,chapter permits debtors to keep those assets if they agree to a plan under which they pay creditors out of their future income.lanning.at citing b,a,a.a bankruptcy trustee oversees the filing and execution of the plan.a see also a.
section of the bankruptcy code sets forth the circumstances in which the bankruptcy court shall confirm a debtor proposed repayment plan and those in which it may not do so.under subsection b,if the trustee or an unsecured creditor objects to a debtor proposed plan,the court may not approve the plan unless at least one of two conditions is met.as relevant here,the second of those conditions is that the plan provides that all of the debtor projected disposable income to be received in the applicable commitment period beginning on the date that the first payment is due under the plan will be applied to make payments to unsecured creditors under the plan.b b emphasis added.the statute further provides that the applicable commitment period of a plan shall be either 
a subject to subparagraph b,
i years or 
ii not less than years,if the debtor current monthly income,when multiplied by,is not less than the median annual family income in the applicable state and 
b may be less than or years,whichever is applicable under subparagraph a,but only if the plan provides for payment in full of all allowed unsecured claims over a shorter period.
id.b.the debtor current monthly income and disposable income are calculated according to statutorily defined formulae.see id.defining current monthly income id.b defining disposable income see also lanning.at,holding that courts must calculate projected disposable income,which is not statutorily defined,using a approach emphasis added.
it is undisputed that debtors current monthly income is and that subsection b b exception to the applicable commitment period set forth in b a ii does not apply.debtors nonetheless contend that their proposed plan was permissible because b b does not set forth a minimum plan duration for debtors who,like them,have no projected disposable income.
courts have interpreted b b condition for plan confirmation in three distinct ways.see baud carroll,f d,cir describing split of decisions and collecting cases,cert.denied.first,a minority of bankruptcy courts view the applicable commitment period solely as a monetary multiplier under that monetary approach,the number of months in the applicable commitment period is multiplied by the debtor projected disposable monthly income to determine the total payments that a debtor must make,but the period has no temporal significance.id.at.second,other bankruptcy courts,as well as this court in kagenveama,have held that,although the statute does set forth a temporal requirement,that temporal requirement does not apply to debtors whose projected disposable income is less than or equal to.baud,at.third and finally,a majority of courts have held that a plan can not be confirmed unless its length is at least as long as the applicable commitment period,without regard to whether the debtor has positive,zero,or negative projected disposable income.id.at.we therefore must consider two issues whether,under b b,the applicable commitment period acts as a temporal requirement that defines a plan minimum duration and if it does,whether that requirement applies to debtors who have no projected disposable income.
with respect to the first issue,we hold that the statute defines a temporal,as distinct from a monetary,requirement for confirmation under b b.most importantly,the statute defines the applicable commitment period as having a duration years,not less than years,or less than or years,depending on the debtor current monthly income and the plan provisions for payments to unsecured creditors.b.furthermore,the requirement of b b that the plan provide for payment of the debtor disposable income to be received in the applicable commitment period suggests an ongoing series of payments for the future duration of that period.a plan can not provide for the payment of income to be received during a defined period unless it remains in effect during that period 
three of our sister courts the sixth,eighth,and eleventh circuits are among the courts that have rejected the view that the applicable commitment period is merely a monetary multiplier for determining the amount that the debtor must pay to unsecured creditors.baud,at whaley tennyson in re tennyson,cir coop frederickson in re frederickson,cir.we join those courts and hold that the applicable commitment period determines the minimum duration that a plan must have to be confirmable under b b.in doing so,we reaffirm one aspect of the decision in kagenveama,in which the panel reasoned that,in general,the applicable commitment period imposes a temporal requirement because the plain meaning of the word period indicates a period of time.at.
with respect to the second issue,we must decide whether a court may confirm a plan that is shorter than the applicable commitment period defined by b if the debtor has no projected disposable income.in light of the statute text,purpose,and legislative history,we now hold that the temporal requirement of b applies regardless of the debtor projected disposable income.
in kagenveama,we held that the b b temporal requirement contains an implicit exception because the applicable commitment period is exclusively linked to b b and the projected disposable income calculation.at.noting that n othing in the bankruptcy code states that the applicable commitment period applies to all chapter plans,the panel concluded that w hen there is no projected disposable income,there is no applicable commitment period.id.at.the sixth and eleventh circuits have disagreed and have held that b contains no such exception for debtors with no projected disposable income.see baud,at t he temporal requirement of the applicable commitment period applies to debtors facing a confirmation objection even if they have zero or negative projected disposable income.tennyson,at t he applicable commitment period is a temporal term that prescribes the minimum plan duration the only exception to this minimum period,if unsecured claims are fully repaid,is provided in b b.we now agree with the other circuits interpretation.
our analysis begins with the statute text.miranda anchondo,cir,cert.denied.although b is somewhat ambiguous,see baud,at noting that the arguments for and against an exception to b temporal requirement are nearly in equipoise,that subsection is best read to impose its temporal requirement regardless of the debtor projected disposable income.most significantly,the statute makes neither b calculation of the applicable commitment period nor b b requirement that a plan provide for payments over that period explicitly contingent on a particular level of projected disposable income.thus,even though a debtor payments to unsecured creditors will,at least initially,amount to if the debtor has no projected disposable income,the statute requires the debtor to commit to the plan for the duration of the applicable commitment period.
furthermore,the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.gale first franklin loan,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the structure of chapter confirms that b b establishes a minimum plan duration even if the debtor has no projected disposable income.a debtor applicable commitment period is not,as the panel reasoned in kagenveama,exclusively linked to b b and the projected disposable income calculation.at.rather,the applicable commitment period is expressly incorporated as a temporal limit for purposes of plan modification under.
under a,a bankruptcy court may modify a plan at any time after plan confirmation,so long as the modification occurs before the completion of payments under the plan.but a modified plan may not provide for payments over a period that expires after the applicable commitment period under section b b after the time that the first payment under the original confirmed plan was due.c emphasis added.thus,the statute defines the temporal window within which modified payments under may be made by reference to the applicable commitment period.indeed,the quoted text would make no sense unless the applicable commitment period describes a length of time that can expire or be altered.with respect to plan modification,then,the applicable commitment period serves as a measure of plan duration that is wholly unrelated to the amount of the debtor disposable income.
a minimum duration for chapter plans is crucial to an important purpose of modification process to ensure that unsecured creditors have a mechanism for seeking increased that is,payments if a debtor financial circumstances improve unexpectedly.see fridley forsythe in re fridley,cir subsequent increases in a debtor actual income can be captured for creditors by way of a plan modification.the bankruptcy court may modify a plan to increase the amount of payments on claims of a particular class.a.in other words,even if a debtor has no projected disposable income at the time of plan confirmation,and his or her statutorily required payments under b b are therefore,unsecured creditors may request a later modification of the plan to increase the debtor payments if the debtor acquires disposable income during the pendency of the applicable commitment period.creditors opportunity to seek increased payments that correspond to changed circumstances would be undermined by an interpretation of b b that relieves debtors from a minimum plan duration merely because they have no projected disposable income at the time of plan confirmation 
interpreting b b to impose a minimum plan duration is also consistent with the prevailing interpretation in our circuit of a and a.much as a permits modification until completion of payments under the plan,a entitles the debtor to discharge after completion by the debtor of all payments under the plan.in fridley,the ninth circuit bankruptcy appellate panel bap considered when a plan is completed for purposes of a and a.the debtors in that case had not paid all allowed unsecured claims in full,but sought discharge after prepaying the payments that they were required to make under their confirmed plan.fridley,at.the bap ruled that the debtors were not entitled to discharge because prepayment does not complete a plan for purposes of a or.id.at.rather,it held,t he applicable commitment period in b is a temporal requirement and the statutory concept of completion of payments includes the completion of the requisite period of time.id.at.the bap reached that conclusion even though that case,like this one,involved debtors who had no projected disposable income and for whom b b accordingly would permit monthly payments of to unsecured creditors.id.at.
because the text of b is ambiguous,we also look to legislative history in construing its temporal requirement.see wilson comm r,cir holding that we may consult legislative history as an aid to the interpretation of ambiguous text.congress amended b,adding the statutory text concerning the applicable commitment period that is at issue here,in the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of bapcpa,stat.the legislative history of bapcpa supports our interpretation of b b as requiring a minimum plan duration 
chapter plans to have a year duration in certain cases.paragraph of section of the act amends bankruptcy code sections d and b to specify that a chapter plan may not provide for payments over a period that is not less than five years if the current monthly income of the debtor and the debtor spouse combined exceeds certain monetary thresholds.if the current monthly income of the debtor and the debtor spouse fall below these thresholds,then the duration of the plan may not be longer than three years,unless the court,for cause,approves a longer period up to five years.the applicable commitment period may be less if the plan provides for payment in full of all allowed unsecured claims over a shorter period.section,and make conforming amendments to sections b and c of the bankruptcy code.
i,at,reprinted in,boldface type added.although the quoted section of the house report is confusingly worded,its title suggests that debtors are to be held to a minimum plan duration without regard to their expenses or disposable income,unless they pay unsecured claims in full over a shorter period.
finally,our interpretation of b b is consistent with the policies that underlie the bankruptcy code and the bapcpa amendments.the principal purpose of the bankruptcy code is to grant a fresh start to the honest but unfortunate debtor.marrama citizens bank,quoting grogan garner.but that generality is not the end of the story.we have recognized that bankruptcy also serves the often conflicting policy of promoting creditors interest in repayment.dumont ford motor credit in re dumont,cir see also ransom fia card,describing bapcpa core purpose as ensuring that debtors devote their full disposable income to repaying creditors.the imposition of a minimum duration is consistent with both of those policies by ensuring the availability of plan modification over the applicable commitment period,even when the debtor can not make any payments at the outset,our reading permits chapter to operate as a mechanism for repayment over time by wage earners,in accordance with their actual ability to pay.see generally collier on bankruptcy alan resnick henry sommer,ed.
in lanning,the supreme court relied in part on similar considerations in rejecting an interpretation of b that would require courts to calculate projected disposable income using a mechanical approach that depends only on a debtor current monthly income during the period preceding the bankruptcy filing date.at.the court favored a approach that takes into account known or nearly certain information about changes in a debtor earning power during the plan period.id.at.the policy justification for looking to future earnings is that a failure to do so would deny creditors payments that the debtor could easily make.id.at.in other words,the statute is meant to allow creditors to receive increased payments from debtors whose earnings happen to increase.lanning involved adjustments to plan payments,to account for known or virtually certain changes in a debtor income.id.at.but the same logic persuades us that congress intended b b to ens
