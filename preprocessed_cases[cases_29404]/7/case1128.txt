the question presented by this appeal is whether a debtor may obtain a discharge in bankruptcy from a tax debt owed to the internal revenue service if he failed to file a return until after the irs assessed the tax that he owed.the bankruptcy judge,seconded by the district judge,answered yes,and the government appeals.
payne filed no federal income tax return for until,which was of course too late.in,however,the internal revenue service,probably on the basis of an information return submitted by someone from whom payne had obtained income in from which income tax had not been withheld,had discovered that payne had not filed a return for that year and might owe income tax.the following year,after investigating the matter,the irs assessed payne for federal income tax due for of some,and after crediting him with the amount of tax that had been withheld by his employer began efforts to collect the balance.in,months after the belated filing of his tax return,payne offered to compromise his tax liability with the irs.the irs rejected his offer.in payne filed for bankruptcy and sought,and the following year received,a discharge of his unpaid tax liability.the government argues that he was not entitled to a discharge.
section a b i of the bankruptcy code forbids the discharge of federal income tax liability with respect to which a return was required to be filed but was not filed.payne argues that he filed a return for,all right,albeit six years late and after the irs had gone to the trouble of figuring out what he owed for that year and assessing him the amount.the government argues that an untimely return is not a return within the meaning of the statute and that therefore payne has never filed a return and so can not be discharged from liability for the taxes that he owes for that year.
the bankruptcy code does not define return.nor for that matter does the internal revenue code.but there is case law interpreting it because a lot can turn on whether a submission to the irs qualifies as a return.taxpayers are required to file tax returns,so a taxpayer who files a document that purports to be a return but is held not to be one can be in serious trouble.
the cases hold that to be deemed a return,a document filed with the irs must purport to be a return,be signed under penalty of perjury,contain enough information to enable the taxpayer tax liability to be calculated,and evince an honest and genuine endeavor to satisfy the law.zellerbach paper helvering.united states moore,cir.genuine is vague,however,and later cases sensibly substitute reasonable.in re moroney,cir in re hatton,cir in re hindenlang,cir beard commissioner,wl,aff,cir.a purported return that does not satisfy all four conditions does not play the role that a tax return is intended to play in a system,which is our federal tax system,of.so while a return that satisfies the first three conditions comports with the literal meaning of the word,it does not comport with the functional meaning.
all but the fourth condition is satisfied by payne belated return.that the purported return evidence an honest and reasonable endeavor to comply with the not satisfied,and not only or even mainly because payne offers no excuse for having failed to file his return until six years after it was due.at argument,his lawyer claimed without elaboration that the period from to was a difficult one in his client life.that assertion is not evidence and is entitled to no weight in our consideration of the appeal.more important,the belated return was not a reasonable endeavor to satisfy payne tax obligations.it may have been intended to induce the irs to talk compromise with him,although it was only later that the irs adopted a rule requiring the filing of a return as a prerequisite to negotiating a compromise.the belated filing may also or instead have been intended to set the stage for payne attempt to discharge his tax debt in bankruptcy.that is speculation what is certain is that the belated filing was not a reasonable effort to satisfy the requirements of the tax law,namely,the requirements of filing a timely return and paying the amount of tax calculated on the return.when payne filed,the irs had already calculated the tax due from him,which means that he had succeeded in defeating the main purpose of the requirement that taxpayers file returns to spare the tax authorities the burden of trying to reconstruct a taxpayer income and liability without any help from him.a return filed after the authorities have borne that burden does not serve the purpose of the filing requirement.
had payne filed his return on time,however,rather than filing for bankruptcy a decade later,the irs might have been able to collect the entire that he owed.it collected the of taxes due from payne for that had been withheld by his employer it might well have been able to obtain the is no suggestion that payne was already bankrupt in or that having to pay to the irs would have tipped him into bankruptcy.
payne hints that his return,belated as it was,did furnish the irs with some helpful information,for he says that the government points to no information sought from him that was not provided by him.but he does not specify any useful information that he was asked to and did provide.it is true that after he filed his return,which showed taxable income on which he had failed to pay the full tax owing,he could no longer argue that he owed nothing.but this concession was academic,since,as far as appears,his purpose in filing the belated return was to satisfy a condition precedent to obtaining a discharge rather than to pay any of the taxes that he owed.similarly,the fact that the irs now has a rule that requires the filing of the belated return as a condition to talking compromise,while it shows that in some cases the return is useful to the service,does not show that it was useful here.and neither payne purpose nor whether his return had any value to the irs is critical.the legal test is not whether the filing of a purported return has some utility for the tax authorities,but whether it is a reasonable endeavor to satisfy the taxpayer obligations,as it might be if the taxpayer had tried to file a timely return but had failed to do so because of an error by the postal service.there was nothing like that here.
our conclusion that the return that payne filed in was not a return for purposes of allowing him to discharge his tax liabilities in bankruptcy is consistent with all the appellate decisions moroney,hatton,and hindenlang that deal with untimely tax returns brandished in the bankruptcy court in an effort to obtain a discharge.see also hayes united states,cir.payne cites cases that hold that a fraudulent tax return is a return for purposes of criminal and civil fraud statutes even though such a return is worse than useless to the taxing authorities.badaracco commissioner,d in re meyers,cir klemp commissioner,cir.he argues that if a fraudulent return is a return,then surely a return that is merely not very helpful,or even completely useless,to the taxing authorities,rather than being fraudulent,is also a return.but there is no reason why the word return,undefined in either the bankruptcy code or the internal revenue code,should carry the same meaning regardless of context.as we have noted in reference to another term in the internal revenue code,it would not be surprising for the same word to bear two meanings in different contexts.indianapolis life ins.united states,cir see also united states bishop,d.
consider the different contexts found just in tax cases,rather than the greater contextual difference between a bankruptcy discharge and a charge of fraud.in case a,the taxpayer on april,mails what purports to be his tax return for,and what indeed is labeled a return,is signed under penalty of perjury,and contains all the data necessary to calculate his taxes,but he deliberately mails it not to the internal revenue service but instead to arlington national cemetery.that is not a return in any but a literal sense because it is not an honest and reasonable attempt to satisfy tax obligations,and if prosecuted for failing to file a return the
