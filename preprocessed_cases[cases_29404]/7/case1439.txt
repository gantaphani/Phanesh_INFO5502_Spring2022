papio keno club,papio keno filed a chapter bankruptcy petition and then initiated this adversary proceeding against the city of papillion,nebraska city.papio keno alleged that the city wrongfully terminated a contract in which papio keno had agreed to operate the city lottery.following a hearing on papio keno complaint,the bankruptcy court found that the city was entitled to terminate the contract based on papio keno noncompliance with its terms,but that the city had withheld funds it was not entitled to retain following the termination of the agreement.the united states bankruptcy appellate panel for the eighth circuit bap affirmed,and the city appeals.we affirm.
papio keno and the city entered into a lottery operator agreement lottery agreement in september.papio keno agreed to operate a lottery on behalf of the city for a period of five years in exchange for a designated percentage of the lottery proceeds.under the nebraska county and city lottery act.through,a city may conduct a lottery and use proceeds from its operation for community betterment purposes.see.
the lottery agreement established two forms of financial assurances securing papio keno performance.paragraph obligated papio keno to provide the city with a performance bond or letter of credit in that amount.paragraph required papio keno to deposit a cash reserve with the city equal to two times the maximum lottery prize available in any regular lottery game plus the maximum possible prize available in any progressive keno game if one was offered in the future.papio keno complied with paragraph by securing a irrevocable letter of credit from a local bank,issued in favor of the city,but it never deposited the cash reserve as required by paragraph.
the parties amended the lottery agreement in in contemplation of offering a progressive keno game in addition to the regular keno game.the amendment authorized papio keno to withhold one percent of the gross proceeds from the regular game,to be taken from the city share of the lottery proceeds,to establish a jackpot for the new progressive game.once the jackpot had been established,papio keno was to resume paying the one percent to the city.although the amendment was not effective until august,papio keno deposited a total of into a separate account during the three months prior to the amendment effective date.papio keno continued to make deposits into that account until january when it withdrew the balance,and purchased a certificate of deposit.financial statements prepared by papio keno reflect that the money was earmarked for the progressive game jackpot.
in august,the city insisted that papio keno transfer the certificate of deposit into the city name.after papio keno complied,the city determined that papio keno was not in compliance with paragraph of the lottery agreement because the value of the certificate of deposit was less than the cash reserve twice the regular prize of plus the progressive jackpot that papio keno was required to deposit with the city.the city then made a demand on the letter of credit of less the value of the certificate of deposit to cover the shortfall,which demand the issuing bank honored.
when papio keno failed to honor the issuing bank request for repayment of the,the bank gave notice to the city that the letter of credit would expire on october,and that it did not intend to renew the letter of credit.the city subsequently determined that papio keno had committed several material breaches of the lottery agreement and,pursuant to the lottery agreement liquidated damages clause,claimed in excess of million in damages.citing numerous instances of papio keno noncompliance with the lottery agreement terms,the city demanded and was paid the remaining balance of the letter of credit,by the issuing bank.the city then terminated the lottery agreement in september.papio keno filed for bankruptcy protection shortly thereafter.
in the adversary proceeding,papio keno claimed that the city had wrongfully terminated the contract and it sought damages for the funds the city had drawn on the letter of credit and for the value of the certificate of deposit held by the city.the bankruptcy court ruled that the city was entitled to terminate the contract,that it had the right to request and hold the certificate of deposit,and that it was authorized to draw on the letter of credit to increase the cash reserve to in order to ensure papio keno compliance with paragraph.the court rejected the city claim that it was entitled to retain the entire cash reserve following the termination of the contract.the court concluded that paragraph obligated the city to return the cash reserve to papio keno unless it had a legitimate claim to the funds out of the certificate of deposit,the bankruptcy court found that the city had a claim to,plus in interest,representing the one percent share of the city proceeds that were deposited by papio keno after the august amendment.it awarded the remaining value of the certificate of deposit,plus in interest,to papio keno,which,according to the court,belonged to papio keno because it was deposited prior to the effective date of the amendment and was not generated from the city share of the lottery proceeds finally,the court ordered the city to return the drawn on the letter of credit to cover the cash reserve shortfall.
after accounting for additional damages incurred by the city as a result of papio keno noncompliance,the bankruptcy court determined that the city retained drawn from the letter of credit which could be attributed to nothing other than liquidated damages.the city claimed that it was entitled to keep the amount under the lottery agreement liquidated damages clause,but the bankruptcy court ruled the clause unenforceable under nebraska law.after correcting a minor mathematical error in the bankruptcy court damage computations,see supra note,at,the bap affirmed the damages awarded to papio keno.
our standard of review is the same as that of the bap.we review the bankruptcy court findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.in re popkin stern,cir.while our review is a searching and independent one,we also realize that we are the second court charged with reviewing the bankruptcy court factual findings for clear error.being the second court to review the record,we are reminded of another jurist poignant and colorful description of the clear error standard to be clearly erroneous,a decision must strike us as more than just maybe or probably wrong it must strike us as wrong with the force of a,unrefrigerated dead fish.parts motors,sterling,cir.again,while we are always mindful of our duty to independently review the record,we think this description is a particularly accurate reflection of when we will reverse a bankruptcy court factual finding that has been upheld by the do not treat the bap as a mere way station on the road to this court.
as its initial point on appeal,the city argues the bankruptcy court erred in awarding damages to papio keno because it did so under theories of recovery that were not pleaded in the complaint or identified in the pretrial order.the theories upon which the bankruptcy court permitted recovery were that upon termination of the lottery agreement the city retained proceeds drawn on the letter of credit to cover liquidated damages that were prohibited by nebraska law,and the city breached paragraph by failing to return the portion of the cash reserve to which it had no claim 
as the city notes,a party may be barred from advancing theories that are not identified in the pretrial order.see glismann,cir see also.specifying that the pretrial order controls the subsequent course of the action.in general,the pretrial order should be construed liberally to cover any theory of recovery that might be embraced within the order language.trujillo uniroyal,cir.construing the pretrial order liberally,we conclude that the liquidated damage issue was properly preserved for the bankruptcy court consideration.papio keno claimed from the outset of the litigation that the city retained liquidated damages that had no reasonable connection to any actual damage t
