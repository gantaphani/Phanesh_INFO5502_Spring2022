in this appeal,we consider,inter alia,the rights of statutory and equitable subrogation held by the issuer of a standby letter of credit.under the circumstances presented by this case,we conclude that no right of subrogation existed.therefore,we reverse the judgment of the district court.
james hamada was the defendant in a breach of fiduciary duty and fraud action filed by his former partner in medicine.the judgment provided for damages of,punitive damages of million,and prejudgment interest.hamada appealed,and sought a supersedeas bond to stay execution of the judgment while his appeal was pending.he applied for a bond with fidelity and deposit company of maryland fidelity,and fidelity agreed to provide the supersedeas bond if hamada paid certain fees,indemnified fidelity if the bond were to be called,and posted a standby letter of credit for the full amount.hamada secured the letters of credit from imperial and far east banks,which agreed to provide the letters in exchange for hamada indemnification and provision of real and personal property as collateral.the letters were issued,and fidelity issued the supersedeas bond.
the california court of appeal modified,vacated and affirmed parts of the judgment and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.hamada filed for bankruptcy in october.in january,michelson filed an adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy court seeking a determination that his claims under the court judgment were.after an order from the bankruptcy court granting hamada motion for relief from the automatic stay,the california trial court entered another judgment in the fraud action in may.nearly a year later,in july,michelson obtained a final judgment from the bankruptcy court holding that the damages,punitive damages and prejudgment interest awarded in the state case were pursuant to a a,a and a.
in november,the california court of appeal again reversed the trial court judgment,and offered michelson a remittitur reducing the punitive damages award to,which michelson accepted.michelson then made a demand on fidelity supersedeas bond for payment of the judgment.fidelity sought payment from hamada,who told the surety that he could not pay the judgment or satisfy his obligation to indemnify fidelity.fidelity then presented the letters of credit to imperial and far east,and each bank honored its letter and paid fidelity in excess of million.fidelity then executed assignment agreements in favor of far east and imperial,assigning any rights it had to subrogation based upon its partial satisfaction of the michelson judgment.
far east and imperial filed an adversary action against hamada one year later seeking of the debts owed to them.the parties stipulated to the material facts,and filed for summary judgment.the bankruptcy court conducted a hearing on the matter in march,and in march issued an order granting hamada motion and denying the motion filed by imperial and far east.the court held that the banks claims were purely contractual and that they were not entitled to subrogation to the of the michelson judgment.the court found that the banks direct claims arising from the letters of credit were dischargeable and that their failure to file timely complaints precluded them from seeking at this late date.
the court also rejected the banks claim that they were entitled to equitable subrogation,and rejected their contention that the assignment agreements had assigned any subrogation rights held by fidelity to far east and imperial.the bankruptcy court determined that the agreements were unenforceable for lack of consideration and noted that the agreements appear to be merely a litigation ploy by the banks in an attempt to bootstrap themselves into a more favorable position than they bargained for in their agreements with hamada and fidelity.
far east appealed to the district court,which reversed the bankruptcy court ruling,essentially because the michelson judgment was based on hamada fraudulent conduct.the district court issued a judgment reversing the bankruptcy court and finding far east entitled to subrogation of the michelson claims.hamada timely appeals.

far east failed to file an adversary proceeding objecting to discharge of its debt within the statute of limitations.see fed.state bank trust,dunlap in re dunlap,cir the strict time limitation placed upon creditors who wish to object to a debt dischargeability reflects the bankruptcy code goal of providing debtors with a fresh start.
thus,unless far east is legally subrogated to the michelson judgment by virtue of its payment to fidelity,far east claims were subject to discharge in the hamada bankruptcy.
in general terms,subrogation is the substitution of one party in place of another with reference to a lawful claim,demand or right.it is a derivative right,acquired by satisfaction of the loss or claim that a third party has against another.subrogation places the party paying the loss or claim the subrogee in the shoes of the person who suffered the loss the subrogor.thus,when the doctrine of subrogation applies,the subrogee succeeds to the legal rights and claims of the subrogor with respect to the loss or claim.see,amer.surety of new york bethlehem nat.bank.discussing equitable doctrine of subrogation in surety context han united states,cir discussing equitable subrogation generally.
there are various types of subrogation,most commonly categorized as conventional or contractual subrogation,legal or equitable subrogation,and statutory subrogation.conventional or contractual subrogation rights arise from an express or implied agreement between the subrogor and subrogee.mutual serv.cas.ins.elizabeth state bank,cir.equitable subrogation is a legal fiction,which permits a party who satisfies another obligation to recover from the party primarily liable for the extinguished obligation.in re air crash disaster,cir.the right of legal or equitable subrogation arose as a creature of equity and is enforced solely for the purpose of accomplishing the ends of substantial justice.memphis dow.statutory subrogation,as one might expect,occurs by virtue of a right created by statute.see,carter derwinski,cir en banc.far east alleges that it is subrogated to the michelson judgment by virtue of a right of statutory subrogation under the bankruptcy code and a right of equitable subrogation.
far east claims a right of statutory subrogation under the bankruptcy code pursuant to a,which provides 
except as provided in subsection b or c of this section,an entity that is liable with the debtor on,or that has secured,a claim of a creditor against the debtor,and that pays such claim,is subrogated to the rights of such creditor to the extent of such payment.
the legislative history to indicates that it was designed to describe rights available to a limited class of creditors,namely,true who have actually paid a debtor obligation to the third party in question 
this section is based on the notion that the only rights available to a surety,guarantor,or comaker are contribution,reimbursement,and subrogation.the right that applies in a particular situation will depend on the agreement between the debtor and the codebtor,and on whether and how the payment was made by the codebtor to the creditor.

for our purposes,the critical question under a is whether far east was liable with the debtor on,or has secured,a claim of a creditor against a debtor.fidelity,as a surety or guarantor of hamada obligation,satisfies this requirement.however,far east,as the issuer of a letter of credit rather than a guarantor of hamada debt,is in a different position with respect to the michelson debt.a letter of credit is an undertaking by the issuing bank that it will pay a draft drawn on it upon presentation of specified documents.ray baker,associated banking,cir 
t he key distinction between letters of credit and guarantees is that the issuer obligation under a letter of credit is primary whereas a guarantor obligation is guarantor is only obligated to pay if the principal defaults on the debt the principal owes.tudor dev.group,united states fidelity guaranty,cir.a bank issuing a letter of credit,unlike a guarantor,is not obligated until after its customer fails to satisfy some obligation,and it is satisfying its own absolute and primary obligation to make payment rather than satisfying an obligation of its customer.id.thus,as opposed to the guaranty given by a surety,in a letter of credit transaction the bank obligation under the letter of credit is independent of the underlying contract.id.see also san diego gas bank leumi,th,d,discussing the independence principle as the primary characteristic of letters of credit.

far east also claims a right to assert the michelson judgment by virtue of equitable subrogation.equitable subrogation is a doctrine governed by state law.mort united states,cir.thus,we must turn to the law of california,which provides for equitable subrogation if the party seeking subrogation meets five specific criteria 
first,the claimant must have paid the debt owed to the lienholder in order to protect the claimant own interest.second,the claimant must not have acted as a volunteer.third,the claimant could not have been primarily liable for the debt he paid.fourth,the claimant must have paid the entire debt owed to the lienholder.and,fifth,the subrogation must not work an injustice to the rights of others.

the first requirement extends to those who pay in performance of a legal duty in order to protect their own rights or interests.union pac.wengert,th,d.because far east had a legal duty to pay fidelity,it acted for its own interest when it honored the letter of credit.thus,far east satisfies the first factor.
the second requirement is that the subrogee claimant may not have acted as a volunteer.in this case,the bankruptcy court determined that far east qualified as a volunteer because it entered into its agreement with hamada for profit and with full knowledge of the nature of the claim.however,under california law,a party is considered a volunteer under the doctrine if,in making a payment,they have no interest of their own to protect,they act without any obligation,legal or moral,and they act without being requested to do so by the person liable on the original obligation.mort,at.here,far east did not act without any obligation in fact it acted because of its obligation.therefore,far east does not qualify as a volunteer,and has satisfied the second requirement.
the third requirement is that far east not be primarily liable for the debt it paid.because it was primarily liable on the letter of credit,far east does not satisfy this element.as the bankruptcy court correctly observed,far east paid fidelity because of its contractual obligation under the letter of credit agreement,which was independent of the obligation fidelity owed michelson under the surety agreement.the california supreme court explained the concept this way 
the rules applicable to surety relationships do not govern the relationships between the parties to a letter of credit transaction nor does the beneficiary of a credit owe any obligations to the issuer literal compliance with the letter of credit terms for payment is all that is required.

the independence of the obligations of a letter of credit issuer in this context was underscored by the california court of appeal in san diego gas,d at 
three contractual relationships exist in a letter of credit transaction.underlying the letter of credit transaction is the contract between the bank customer and the beneficiary of the letter of credit,which consists of the business agreement between these parties.then there is the contractual arrangement between the bank and its customer whereby the bank agrees to issue the letter of credit,and the customer agrees to repay the bank for the amounts paid under the letter of credit finally,there is the contractual relationship between the bank and the beneficiary of the letter of credit created by the letter of credit itself.the bank agrees to honor the beneficiary drafts or demands for payment which conform to the terms of the letter of credit.
id.citations omitted.
for these reasons,far east must be considered primarily liable on the debt upon which its claim is founded its debt to fidelity under the letter of credit agreement.thus,far east can not satisfy the third element.
the fourth requirement for the application of equitable subrogation under california law is the claimant must have paid the entire debt owed by the debtor.although there is some dispute about the precise amount of the payment,hamada does not seriously contest that the debt was extinguished by virtue of the payment.therefore,for the purposes of this analysis,we will presume that far east met this requirement.
the final element for a finding of equitable subrogation under california law is that the subrogation must not work an injustice to the rights of others.far east argues that because the michelson judgment was based on hamada fraud,the equities tip in its favor.the district court apparently found this argument decisive hamada contends that he has suffered enough due to the underlying litigation and the bankruptcy.
neither argument addresses the salient inquiry.in this context,the rights that must be balanced are the rights of other creditors in the hamada bankruptcy.by declaring the far east debt to be,the court would be placing far east in a much better position than other creditors.as to michelson,this result was not only eminently fair,but dictated by the bankruptcy code due to the finding of the bankruptcy court that hamada had committed a breach of fiduciary duty and fraud.however,far east is not in the same position as michelson.hamada committed no fraud on far east.rather,far east consciously undertook to grant a letter of credit to fidelity with full knowledge of michelson allegations against hamada,including the alleged fraud.it did so as a commercial transaction in which hamada pledged certain real estate assets as collateral.far east,in accepting that collateral,assumed the risk that the collateral might be insufficient to satisfy michelson claim.moreover,it failed to take appropriate action in the bankruptcy court to protect its interest.thus,given these circumstances,the equities that michelson might assert other creditors do not accrue equally to far east.having entered into the commercial transaction with full knowledge of hamada alleged wrongdoing,far east can not,like casablanca captain renault,express shock at having now discovered it.rather,far east is in the same position as every other disappointed commercial creditor to whom hamada owed a debt.
nor has hamada unjustly been removed from his responsibility to pay the michelson judgment.to the contrary,hamada made financial arrangements that resulted in satisfaction of the judgment.the defrauded creditor in whose favor the bankruptcy court entered a judgment has received full payment,and there is no claim that hamada committed fraud against far east that would entitle it to preferential treatment over other creditors to whom hamada owes money.hamada has also not been relieved of his responsibility to far east however,that responsibility will be discharged through operation of the pro rata distribution of his assets to all creditors.for these reasons,the fifth element of equitable subrogation also is unsatisfied.
far east argues that application of california equitable subrogation doctrine does not depend upon slavish adherence to the five criteria enunciated by the california supreme court.it is true that california courts have,on occasion,liberally construed the doctrine.see,johnson kristovich in re johnson estate,d.indeed,the california supreme court has held explicitly that equitable subrogation is not limited to circumstances where the five factors are met.caito united.bank,cal d.however,california courts have yet to extend the doctrine to cases in which the purported subrogee is primarily liable on the debt and,in this case,the equities do not fall in far east favor when the rights of the other creditors are considered.
far east also claims a right to claim an exception to discharge based on the assignment of fidelity subrogation rights.however,we have previously held that sureties do not have a right of subrogation under such circumstances.see collection agency trahan,cir thus,far east did not acquire any rights to the michelson non dischargeability judgment by assignment of the surety rights 
because far east is neither entitled to statutory nor equitable subrogation,its claim for declaratory relief necessarily fails.the bankruptcy court was entirely correct in so holding.thus,we must reverse the judgment of the district court which reversed the judgment of the bankruptcy court.
i do not concur with the majority analysis and conclusion with respect to appellee far east national bank claim for equitable subrogation,and as such,i respectfully dissent from that portion of the majority opinion.to place my comments in their proper context,it is helpful to first briefly review the salient facts of this case.
in or about,james hamada,hamada was sued in los angeles county superior court by his former medical partner karlin michelson,michelson for fraud and breach of fiduciary duty.the matter was tried and a jury returned a verdict in favor of michelson.the jury awarded michelson compensatory damages in the amount of and million in punitive damages.on february,the trial court entered judgment in accordance with the jury verdict.
hamada appealed and was required to post a supersedeas bond to stay enforcement of the judgment.he applied to fidelity deposit company of maryland the surety to post the requisite bond.as a condition of issuing the bond,the surety required hamada to sign an indemnification agreement secured by standby letters of credit.hamada obtained letters of credit from appellee far east national bank far east and imperial bank imperial which named the surety as beneficiary.hamada executed indemnity agreements in favor of each issuing bank which were secured by certain of his real and personal property.
in october,hamada filed for bankruptcy under chapter of the bankruptcy code.in january,michelson filed an adversary action in the bankruptcy court and obtained a determination that his judgment was not dischargeable under a a,a and a.
eventually,the california court of appeal affirmed the jury finding of liability but reduced the amount of the judgment michelson made a demand upon the surety for satisfaction of the judgment.the surety provided notice of the demand to hamada who,in turn,directed the surety to present a request to far east and imperial for payment pursuant to the standby letters of credit.far east and imperial honored their agreements and collectively tendered payment in excess of million to the surety,which it in turn paid to michelson.the surety then expressly assigned all of its rights against hamada to far east.
far east and imperial then filed an adversary action in bankruptcy court seeking a declaration that the debt owed by hamada to them under the letters of credit was.they based this petition on the theory that they were equitably subrogated to the rights of michelson through the surety,or alternatively,that such rights were assigned to them by the surety.upon considering the parties for summary judgment,the bankruptcy court ruled in favor of hamada,finding that the debt was dischargeable.
far east appealed to the district court which reversed the bankruptcy court decision.hamada now appeals the district court ruling that the debt was not dischargeable.as noted,the majority believes that the district court erred in reversing the bankruptcy court ruling in favor of hamada.i can not agree with such a conclusion and would affirm the district court.
overview of equitable subrogation 
equitable subrogation permits a party who has been required to satisfy a loss created by a third party wrongful act to step into the shoes of the loser and pursue recovery from the responsible wrongdoer.fireman fund ins.maryland casualty,th,d.the purpose of this doctrine is to place the burden for a loss on the party ultimately liable or responsible for it and by whom it should have been discharged,and to relieve entirely the insurer or surety who indemnified the loss and who in equity was not primarily liable therefor.fireman fund ins.maryland cas,th,d.
to invoke the remedy of equitable subrogation,five factors generally must be satisfied payment was made by the subrogee to protect his own interest the subrogee has not acted as a volunteer the debt paid was one for which the subrogee was not primarily liable the entire debt has been paid and subrogation would not work any injustice to the rights of others.han united states,cir caito united cal.bank,cal d.equitable subrogation is a broad equitable remedy,not limited to circumstances where these five factors are met caito,cal d at,emphasis added.
primary liability 
the majority opines that far east may not equitably subrogate its claim against hamada due to the absence of the third and fifth factors.with regard to the third factor concerning the issue of primary liability,the majority concludes that far east was primarily liable for the debt which it paid to wit,the letter of credit which it issued in favor of the surety.the majority reasons that the letter of credit agreement between far east and the surety created a separate and independent obligation for which far east bore primary responsibility to pay.as support for this proposition,the majority relies on san diego gas bank leumi,th,d,and western sec.bank,cal th,d,both of which confirm the independent nature of letters of credit.western sec.bank,cal th at,d,recognizing that an issuer has the primary obligation to pay on letter of credit such that literal compliance with the letter of credit terms for payment is all that is required.san diego gas,th at,d noting that the obligation to pay on a letter of credit is independent of any underlying agreement.however,for purposes of equitable subrogation,the question is not whether far east was primarily liable under the letter of credit agreement.rather,the relevant question is whether far east was primarily liable for payment of the underlying judgment.
the approach advocated by hamada,and followed by the majority,derives from authority which erroneously equates an issuer primary obligation to pay on a letter of credit with the primarily liable inquiry germane to equitable subrogation.specifically,hamada draws the court attention to kaiser steel bank of am.national trust and savings ass n,which ruled that an issuer of a standby letter of credit could not pursue a claim for statutory subrogation under the court reasoned that a letter of credit creates an independent obligation of the issuer to pay on demand,irrespective of any defenses arising from the underlying agreement.id.at.in so doing,the court collapsed the independe
