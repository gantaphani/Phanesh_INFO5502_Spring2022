peskind law holds when there is uncertainty about where to file a security interest in order to perfect it,file everywhere this case illustrates the wisdom of that rule.in,a deed of trust securing indian trust land was recorded in the office of the auditor of pierce county,washington,the county in which the land is located.in,a commercial lease of the land was recorded in the bia title plant in portland,oregon.which interest has deed of trust or the lease we hold that federal law directs us to state law to determine priority,and under washington statute,priority is obtained by recording in the county in which the land is located.therefore,the deed of trust has priority over the lease.
background 
factual background 
roleen hargrove,a member of the puyallup tribe of indians,occupied a parcel of tribal land that was held in trust by the united states government.under federal law,holders of indian trust lands may mortgage their land,but they must first obtain bia approval.see a.in,business finance corporation bfc agreed to loan hargrove money if she executed a deed of trust in its favor.
on july,the bia puget sound agency issued a certificate of approval in connection with the deed of trust.the certificate of approval provides that it shall be attached to and recorded in the official records of the bureau of indian affairs with the deed of trust and that it was granted in accordance with federal law and pursuant to the secretary of the interior authority.however,the certificate of approval was not recorded in the bia title plant in portland at that time it was not recorded there until three years later,in.title plant is a term used to identify any one of the bia land titles and records offices located throughout the country.each such office has responsibility for indian lands located within a particular geographic region.
bfc recorded the deed of trust with the pierce county auditor in september.on january,hargrove and emerald outdoor advertising,llc executed a lease whereby emerald outdoor was permitted to erect advertising signs on hargrove land.emerald outdoor recorded its lease in the portland bia title plant,but not in pierce county.
in january,bfc assigned its deed of trust to gold eagle gaming in march,after discovering that the deed of trust was recorded only in pierce county,gold eagle counsel asked the bia to record the deed of trust in the portland bia title plant,which it did in may.
in march,after hargrove defaulted on her loan,gold eagle commenced a foreclosure of the deed of trust.in august,an official at the portland bia title plant informed gold eagle counsel that the deed of trust was void for lack of approval because the puget sound agency did not properly process the deed of trust when it was approved in.apparently,the puget sound agency failed to record the certificate of approval in the title plant.in september,the puget sound agency sought to correct the purported defect,recording a new certification as a trailer document to the original deed of trust,and declared that the deed of trust is entirely valid.the new certification,dated september,specifically references the original certificate of approval signed by the puget sound agency on july.
in february,before the foreclosure sale occurred,gold eagle assigned its interest to tiffany harrison,a member of the puyallup tribe.the next day,hargrove filed for bankruptcy,and the bankruptcy court permitted the deed of trust to be foreclosed in may.harrison was the successful bidder.
in august,harrison filed an eviction action against emerald outdoor in tribal court.that action was dismissed without prejudice.in december,harrison tried again,this time filing a quiet title action against emerald outdoor in tribal court.while that action was pending,emerald outdoor filed for bankruptcy,which stayed the tribal court proceedings.
bankruptcy proceedings 
in the bankruptcy court,emerald outdoor filed a motion to assume executory contracts and leases under seeking to establish the validity of its lease of harrison land.the bankruptcy court determined that emerald outdoor lease was extinguished upon foreclosure of the deed of trust,because its interest was junior to the interest conveyed in the deed of trust which was ultimately assigned to gold eagle,and then to harrison.see in re emerald outdoor.a to that ruling was the bankruptcy court conclusion that recording the deed of trust in pierce county gave it priority over emerald outdoor lease,even though the deed of trust was not recorded in the portland bia title plant until after the lease was recorded there.see id.at.the bankruptcy court also concluded that the deed of trust was valid when the puget sound agency issued the certificate of approval on july,not in september when the bia recorded a new certification as a trailer to the deed of trust.see id.at.
on appeal,the district court agreed with the bankruptcy court that the approval process did not depend on recording the deed of trust in the portland bia title plant,thus rendering july,the effective date of bia approval the district court,however,concluded that emerald outdoor lease had priority over the deed of trust because the lease was recorded in the bia title plant before the deed of trust was.gold eagle and harrison timely appealed.
ii.analysis 
pierce county was the proper recording location in this case.
our analysis focuses on a.to protect mortgagees that loan money to holders of indian trust lands,a subjects the holder to foreclosure in accordance with the laws of the tribe which has jurisdiction over such land or,in the case where no tribal foreclosure law exists,in accordance with the laws of the state in which the land is located.the puyallup tribe had no laws governing the foreclosure of mortgaged land and thus,washington law governed the foreclosure of hargrove land.the question before us is whether a direction to follow state law necessarily incorporates washington rules for determining priority.
emerald outdoor asserts that,notwithstanding a direction to follow state law,bia regulations dictate where a party must record an interest in indian land to obtain priority over competing interests,namely,in the bia title plant,and that recording there was necessary to perfect the deed of trust.appellants,on the other hand,assert that state law dictated the proper location of recording in this case,namely,in the county auditor office in pierce county,and that such recording was all that was necessary for perfection.
we hold that bfc perfected its lien subsequent interest holders such as emerald outdoor when it recorded in pierce county,in accordance with state law,regardless of whether it also recorded in the bia title plant.that is because a resort to washington foreclosure law necessarily incorporates washington rules for recording,lien perfection,and priority.
the act of recording has no legal significance besides providing notice to interested parties of an interest in land.as the bankruptcy court correctly noted,whether the notice achieved by recording establishes priority over another interest depends on how priority is determined under the applicable substantive law.to put it another way,priority is not solely dependent upon the earliest date of notice but may depend upon the type of transaction.at.for example,as the bankruptcy court explained,rcw establishes priority among mechanics liens by the date which materials were first supplied or labor provided,not solely by the date of notice of the lien.
this case involves the foreclosure of a mortgage on land.priority among the various interests in the land is a critical part of a foreclosure in washington.see rcw foreclosure extinguishes all liens,leases and other encumbrances that are subordinate to the foreclosed deed of trust.as to whose interests are junior,we look to state federal a and its accompanying regulations say nothing about priority of interests.
washington law provides that any conveyance of an interest in land that is not recorded in the county in which the land sits is void as against any subsequent interest that is duly recorded,provided the holder of the subsequent interest paid consideration and
