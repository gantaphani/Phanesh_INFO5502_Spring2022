appellant jerry pruzinsky appeals the district court determination that his motion for clarification of judgment,construed as one seeking relief from judgment pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,was barred by the statute of limitations contained therein.we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings.
background 
a.the wayne county agreement 
the debtor,anna marie walter,was formerly married to the appellant,jerry pruzinsky.before the bankruptcy proceedings commenced,the appellee,gianetti,obtained a default judgment against walter and pruzinsky in the wayne county circuit court for.gianetti complaint alleged that walter and pruzinsky embezzled funds belonging to several of gianetti companies.the parties entered into a settlement agreement in satisfaction of the judgment the wayne county agreement.under the terms of the agreement,walter and pruzinsky surrendered their interest in certain real property to gianetti.the agreement further provided that each side retained a contingent lien.this aspect of the agreement provided that the parties would have the real property appraised.if the value of the property exceeded the value of the debt owed to gianetti,then gianetti was to refund the difference to walter and pruzinsky.conversely,if the property value was insufficient to satisfy the debt owed to gianetti,then gianetti would have a lien on all other assets owned by walter and pruzinsky.the wayne county circuit court entered an order on december,incorporating the terms of the wayne county agreement.
b.the federal agreement 
prior to the completion of the valuation process called for in the wayne county agreement,walter filed her bankruptcy petition in the bankruptcy court,which automatically stayed the proceedings against her in the wayne county action.when he received notice of this action,gianetti pursued in the bankruptcy court his claim against the walter estate for the unsatisfied judgment.the trustee in bankruptcy subsequently reached an agreement with gianetti to settle the claim the federal agreement.walter and pruzinsky were divorced at the time she initiated the bankruptcy proceedings.therefore,pruzinsky was neither a party to nor did he participate in the negotiation of this agreement.pruzinsky was,however,like gianetti,a creditor of the walter bankruptcy estate and,as such,was entitled to receive notice of the proposed settlement.after receiving notice,pruzinsky filed a written objection to certain language in the proposed order which gianetti and the trustee had drafted to settle the claim.the objection stated 
now comes jerry pruzinsky,creditor in the above captioned matter and objects to the entry of the proposed order approving settlement and particularly the final paragraph of the same for the reason that this paragraph seeks to adjudicate matters not before this court a dispute between jerry pruzinsky and silvo gianetti concerning claims between these parties which is pending in the wayne country circuit court.
objection to entry of order approving settlement.february.at emphasis added.the proposed order,memorializing the federal agreement between gianetti and the trustee in bankruptcy,read in relevant part as follows the parties refer to these two paragraphs as paragraphs three and four 
it is further ordered that the wayne county circuit court default judgment obtained by gianetti against debtor anna marie walter and her,jerry pruzinsky as well as a certain settlement agreement order of the wayne county circuit court are hereby satisfied and forever discharged.
it is further ordered that any contingent liens by the debtor her jerry pruzinsky,arising under the wayne county settlement and order are hereby released,discharged,and void.
order approving settlement of secured claim.april.emphasis added.
c.the april order 
at a hearing on march,the bankruptcy court heard pruzinsky objections to the federal agreement.pruzinsky explained that he was not a party to the federal agreement and that he did not participate in the negotiations that produced the proposed order.he further explained that the proposed order drafted by gianetti and the bankruptcy trustee purported to extinguish his right under the wayne county agreement to a refund if the appraised value of the property exceeded the value of the debt owed to gianetti.pruzinsky maintained that it was unfair to allow the bankruptcy trustee and gianetti to bargain away his rights when he was not a party to their agreement.the following exchange took place 
fellrath counsel for pruzinsky the order provides that contingent claims and liens by jerry pruzinsky against the letter sic excuse me,against the released,discharged and void.my client objects to that language.
the court well,we talking now about the last paragraph only of the proposed order am i right,fellrath 
fellrath that correct 
the court all right.
fellrath what we object to is the language in that order proposed order,that claims of pruzinsky against gianetti are released,discharged and void 
the court if the.fellrath 
fellrath yes.
the court if the words,looking now at the proposed order,now do you have it in front of you 
fellrath yes,your honor,i do.
the court if the words her,jerry pruzinsky so i understand what you eliminated from the order,would that solve your problem 
fellrath yes,your honor.reference to my client should be deleted from that portion of the order.
the court all right.specifically,would that do the trick from your perspective 
fellrath yes.yes.
at this point in the hearing,watson,counsel for gianetti,objected to the request to delete the reference to pruzinsky.he argued that it was fair to dissolve pruzinsky contingent lien because the terms of the federal agreement released pruzinsky from liability in the event the appraised value of the property was not enough to satisfy the amount owed gianetti under the default judgment.the bankruptcy court rejected this argument.
the court how can the debtor and yourself,between the two of you,eliminate pruzinsky rights 
watson well,because we are also releasing him from any liability under the settlement 
the court all right.so i do see how i can include language in there which,in effect,gives up rights,frankly.so i will sign an order that excises from the proposed order the language i was talking about,the words her jerry pruzinsky.i sign that order.
d.the motion for clarification 
the important point to observe from the foregoing exchange is that while the bankruptcy court intended to fully preserve pruzinsky rights under the wayne county agreement,the settlement order,as modified by the bankruptcy court,does not reflect that intent.it is clear from the record that the objective of the modification was to remove pruzinsky from the force of the order.this,however,was accomplished only with respect to paragraph four,as pruzinsky mistakenly told the bankruptcy court that his objection lay only with that section of the order.the april order of the bankruptcy court did not remove the reference to pruzinsky in paragraph three.instead,paragraph three of the order continued to declare that the wayne county agreement was fully satisfied and discharged and therefore pruzinsky contingent lien was dissolved.
the oversight came to a head in august,when pruzinsky filed subpoenas in wayne county circuit court to determine the value of property included in the wayne county agreement.gianetti raised the bankruptcy court april order as a defense,pointing to paragraph three,the provision of the order stating that,as to pruzinsky,the wayne county agreement was satisfied and forever discharged.the wayne county circuit court,for some reason that remains unexplained,adjourned all motions pruzinsky then filed a motion to clarify the april order with the bankruptcy court,contending that the april order did not bar his action in wayne county,and sought an order from the bankruptcy court to that effect.
the bankruptcy court construed pruzinsky motion to clarify as one seeking relief from judgment pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure rule b authorizes a court to relieve a party from a final judgment or order in the f
