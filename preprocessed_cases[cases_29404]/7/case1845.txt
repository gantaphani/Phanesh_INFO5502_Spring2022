in these consolidated cases,the bankruptcy trustee trustee appeals from a decision of the bankruptcy appellate panel bap affirming the bankruptcy court determination that,having successfully avoided a preferential vehicle lien under the trustee was not entitled to a money judgment equal to the value of the avoided liens under a.the bankruptcy court and the bap held that the bankruptcy estate had been sufficiently returned to its status by avoiding the preferential lien and stepping into the lien priority of the avoided creditor under.we affirm.
facts and procedural history 
the facts of both cases are similar and straightforward.in each case,the debtors purchased a vehicle with a loan,but the lender appellees did not perfect their liens within days after the debtors received possession,resulting in their liens being perfected and considered a transfer within days of the debtors petition dates.see b,e b.thus,the trustee filed adversary actions against the lenders,seeking avoidance of the lien under,recovery of the value of the avoided lien as of the petition date under a,preservation of the lien for the benefit of the estate under,and recovery of payments made by the debtors to the lenders under 
the lenders and trustee settled the claim for payments,and it was dismissed.the trustee then sought summary judgment on the remaining three claims.the lenders did not contest the trustee ability to avoid the lien and preserve it for the benefit of the estate,and thus the court granted summary judgment to the trustee on the first and third claims.this appeal therefore focuses on the availability of a relief specifically,whether in these circumstances,such relief is required the trustee position,permissive but only with respect to possessory property interests the bankruptcy court view,or permissive with respect to both possessory and nonpossessory interests,but unnecessary on these facts the view of the bap.
the bankruptcy court compared the remedies available in recovery of property or its value and automatic preservation of avoided transfer for benefit of the estate and concluded that in cases where the transfer is of a nonpossessory lien interest,the preservation of the lien interest for the benefit of the estate is sufficient to place the estate in exactly the same position it would have been in,but for the granting of the lien.there is,under these circumstances,no need for the trustee to recover any property or its value.rodriguez drive fin.servs.lp in re trout,rodriguez daimlerchrysler fin.servs americas,llc in re bremer.the bankruptcy court denied summary judgment on the trustee second claim for relief and dismissed the claim.
the cases were consolidated on appeal,and the bap affirmed the bankruptcy court,though on a slightly different basis.the bap agreed with the bankruptcy court that recovery under was not mandatory but permissive.but the bap did not consider relief under and to be mutually exclusive and declined to hold that relief under was completely unavailable in the case of nonpossessory lien interests.rather,the bap recognized that although ordinarily lien avoidance and preservation under will be sufficient,there may be circumstances in which and will not put the estate back to its position,and then some recovery under could be appropriate.see in re bremer.
nonetheless,the bap concluded that,on the facts of this case,the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion by determining that the remedy was sufficient.the bap noted that the lenders,as secured creditors,had contractual rights against the vehicle,and that by avoiding the lien interest which then became preserved for the estate,the trustee succeeded to those rights,but no more and no less.the bap noted that although the value of the security interest the vehicle may have declined,the bankruptcy code does not guarantee that assets recovered would be worth what they were at any relevant valuation date,only that the estate will be returned to its position.id.at.
this appeal followed.

discussion 
several bankruptcy code provisions work together to protect the bankruptcy estate from preferential transfers made within ninety days of filing the bankruptcy petition.first,under,the trustee may avoid any transfer of an interest of the debtor in property.once avoided,that transfer is automatically preserved for the estate under,which provides any transfer avoided under section is preserved for the benefit of the estate but only with respect to property of the estate.in the case of an avoided security interest or lien,as here,ensures that a trustee avoiding a senior lien moves into that priority position and the estate is not trumped by the interest of a junior lien.see morris john bank in re haberman,cir.
in addition to these remedies,a also provides 
t o the extent a transfer is avoided under section the trustee may recover,for the benefit of the estate,the property transferred or,if the court so orders,the value of such property.
the trustee argues that the bankruptcy court must award the estate some relief under,either return of the property or a monetary award of the value of the property.the bankruptcy court concluded that recovery is permissive rather than mandatory,and that and are mutually exclusive provisions,with applying to nonpossessory lien interests and applying only to possessory property interests.the bap concluded that is automatic and usually sufficient to restore the estate position,but that there may be circumstances involving nonpossessory liens in which the trustee is also entitled to permissive recovery under a.as we explain more fully below,we believe the bap has the better argument in light of the statutory language and the underlying purposes to be served by these provisions.in addition,the bap position is the most consistent with the opinions of other circuits who have considered the issue.
the bankruptcy court and bap correctly noted that under,the transferred lien was automatically preserved for the benefit of the estate,whereas recovery under is not automatic and requires action by the trustee.see,f see also suhar burns in re burns,cir.the courts also correctly concluded that the language in is permissive rather than mandatory if a transfer is avoided under,the trustee may recover the transferred property or its value.as the bap explained 
the word may is generally used in the permissive or discretionary sense.use of the word may,rather than shall or must next to the word recover denotes that recovery is not mandatory.
at.the sixth circuit reached the same conclusion in in re burns,commenting that the language of is permissive rather than mandatory the trustee must recover or descriptive the trustee thereby recovers.at see also usaa thacker in re taylor,cir a trustee,however,has the discretion to seek an alternative remedy under the trustee may recover.
the trustee argues,however,that the bankruptcy court must award the estate some recovery under a,whether it is a return of the property in this case,the lien or the property value.the trustee claims that is only a priority statute,rather than a remedial one,and thus even with liens,some further action under is required.while does prevent junior lienholders from the estate in the event a senior lien is avoided,this does not mean that does nothing remedial for the estate.as we explained in in re haberman,upon avoidance of a lien,under the trustee steps into the shoes of the former lienholder,with the same rights in the collateralized property that the original lienholder enjoyed.at.thus,as we discuss further below,in situations in which avoidance of the lien and its preservation for the estate are sufficient to make the estate whole,the trustee may not need to seek recovery under,or,stated differently,relief under to wit,return of the property might be simply duplicative of what the trustee has already received through and.
in arguing that a relief is mandatory,the trustee also relies
