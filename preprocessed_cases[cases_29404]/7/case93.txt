this bankruptcy appeal requires us to resolve a question of statutory construction that has divided bankruptcy courts and has not yet been addressed by any other circuit whether the means test for identifying an abusive chapter petition allows a debtor to deduct from his income the installment payments due for property he plans to surrender in the bankruptcy.see b.both the bankruptcy court and the bankruptcy appellate panel bap held that such a deduction is permitted because,at the time the disposable income calculation is performed,such payments the words of the statute scheduled as contractually due.we agree,and therefore affirm.
applicable law 
the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of bapcpa was enacted in response to an upward trend in consumer bankruptcy filings and concerns that bankruptcy relief was too readily available and sometimes used as a first resort,rather than a last resort.i,at,reprinted in.of particular concern was the pursuit of chapter liquidations instead of chapter debt repayment plans by consumer debtors who could afford to repay some of their debts.see cong.rec,daily ed,statement of hatch in re hardacre,citing cong.rec.at.
the bapca was designed to lessen the resort to chapter filings by,among other measures,amending section b of the bankruptcy code to relax the standard for dismissing a chapter case as abusive.see,in re king,wl,at.previously,a showing of substantial abuse was required,and t here was a presumption in favor of granting the relief sought by the debtor.id.as amended by the bapca,section b drops the qualifying word substantial,permitting a bankruptcy court to dismiss a chapter proceeding brought by an individual debtor who has mostly consumer debts if the court finds that the granting of relief would be an abuse.b.in order to ensure that debtors repay creditors the maximum they can afford,the bapcpa established a mathematical formula,known as a means test,by which some chapter cases are deemed presumptively abusive.see.i,at,reprinted in at describing the screening mechanism as t he heart of the bill consumer bankruptcy reforms b,see also neary in re,cir the purpose of the means test is to distinguish between debtors who can repay a portion of their debts and debtors who can not.
only those debtors whose monthly income exceeds the state median for their family size are subject to means testing.b.the formula calculates the debtor average monthly disposable income,over a period by deducting statutorily prescribed expenses from current monthly income.see id.at b a ii iv.if the resulting income figure exceeds a threshold amount specified in the statute per month at the time relevant bankruptcy case is presumptively abusive.b a i upon motion by the united states trustee,the bankruptcy court may either dismiss such a case or,with the debtor consent,convert it into a chapter proceeding.b.
the deductible expenses under the means test include standard living expenses prescribed by the internal revenue service,see,id.at b a ii i certain reasonably necessary actual expenses such as for health and disability insurance,and other actual expenses up to a maximum allowable deduction for example,expenses for the education of a minor child not to exceed per year,id.at b a ii iv.at issue here is the allowable deduction on account of secured debts,such as mortgage or car payments.id.at b a iii i.the critical language describes the deductible amount of such debts to be the total of all amounts scheduled as contractually due to secured creditors in each month of the months following the date of the petition,divided by.id the resulting amount is the debtor average monthly expense for secured debt.
debtors submit their calculations under the means test on form chapter statement of current monthly income and calculation,one of the documents a debtor must file with a chapter bankruptcy petition.see b c fed.b debtors also must file a schedule of current income and current expenditures,known as schedules i and j,respectively,and a statement of intention that discloses plans to retain or surrender the properties that are securing the debts listed on a separate schedule of assets and liabilities.see a b ii id.at a a fed.b.
the type of dispute that underlies this case arises when a debtor announces an intention to surrender certain,a house that secures two includes future mortgage payments in calculating the amount of secured debt to be deducted from monthly income on form.given that the property will be surrendered and the mortgage will no longer be paid,the question is whether such payments are scheduled as contractually due in each month of the months following the date of the petition.
factual background 
appellee glen rudler filed a chapter bankruptcy petition in august.since his monthly income at the time of the filing exceeded the applicable state median for his family size,rudler was subject to the means test to determine if his bankruptcy case should be categorized as presumptively abusive.in a statement of intention,rudler reported that he intended to surrender his home,which was secured by two mortgages with a combined monthly payment of approximately.despite his plans to give up the house,rudler deducted the in mortgage payments when calculating his monthly disposable income on form.that calculation produced a monthly disposable income of negative,avoiding the presumption of abuse.
if rudler were unable to deduct the mortgages,he instead could claim a statutorily prescribed housing allowance of in that event,his monthly disposable income under the formula would be,far in excess of the monthly amount that triggers the presumption of abuse based on these figures,the united states trustee moved under section b to dismiss rudler chapter case as abusive,arguing that rudler should not have included the mortgage debt in his calculation of secured debt because he intended to surrender the property and,consequently,would not be making payments on the mortgages.
the bankruptcy court denied the motion to dismiss,concluding that rudler was entitled to deduct the mortgage payments under the means test notwithstanding his intention to surrender the property.the trustee appealed the decision to the bankruptcy appellate panel bap for the first circuit,which affirmed.the bap held that the means test calculation is meant to be a of the debtor situation as of the petition date,rather than a consideration of only those payments that will actually be made.in re rudler,cir.bap.on appeal to this court,the trustee reiterates her contention that section b does not permit a debtor to deduct payments on debts secured by property the debtor intends to surrender.
we briefly address the threshold issue of whether we have jurisdiction to review the bap decision.circuit courts have jurisdiction over all final decisions,judgments,orders,and decrees issued by a bankruptcy appellate panel on appeal from a bankruptcy court.d.to be final,a bankruptcy order need not resolve all of the issues in the proceeding,but it must finally dispose of all the issues pertaining to a discrete dispute within the larger proceeding.perry first citizens fed.credit union in re perry,cir.finality is given a flexible interpretation in bankruptcy because bankruptcy cases typically involve numerous controversies bearing only a slight relationship to each other.in re northwood,llc,cir quotation marks and citation omitted see also,at finality does not require the termination of the entire bankruptcy proceeding rather,an adjudication by the bankruptcy court is definitive because it can not be affected by the resolution of any other issue in the proceeding,and therefore no purpose would be served by postponing the appeal to the proceeding conclusion.quoting in re oakley,cir.
four circuits,addressing an earlier version of section b,have characterized orders on motions to dismiss for abuse as final.see,at in re cortez,cir stuart koch in re koch,cir matter of christian,cir we also are persuaded that,at least where the dispute at issue turns on a question of law,it is appropriate to treat such orders as final under the amended version of section b.but see barben donovan in re donovan,cir holding that an order denying a motion to dismiss a chapter case for substantial abuse,under the earlier version of section b,was not appealable 
this case involves only the purely legal question of whether secured debts may be deducted under section b if the secured property will be surrendered as part of the bankruptcy proceedings.further development of the case will shed no new light on that issue.delaying consideration of the question,however,may frustrate both principles of judicial economy and congress goal of ensuring that debtors allocate as much of their resources as possible toward repaying their debts.see koch,at requiring trustees to complete chapter proceedings before appealing denial of their b motions wastes debtor resources that should be used to pay creditors,and forces trustees and bankruptcy courts to expend their scarce institutional resources on abusive chapter petitioners.see also id.noting that,if such an order can not be appealed,bankruptcy proceedings must be completed before it can be determined whether they were proper in the first place.quoting christian,at.
moreover,motions to dismiss for abuse under section b are subject to statutory deadlines,presumably foreclosing renewed requests for dismissal as the chapter case proceeds thus,from a pragmatic standpoint,the discrete dispute over a debtor abuse of chapter will be finally resolved when a court denies a motion to dismiss under section b and,consequently,an immediate appeal of the ruling will not interfere with further action on the issue by the lower courts.
we therefore proceed to address the deductibility of secured debts on property that will be surrendered.our review is de novo.marrama,at holding that,on an appeal from a bap decision,the appeals court reviews the bankruptcy court legal rulings de novo.
in arguing her view of section b a iii i,the trustee relies heavily on congress purpose in enacting the bapcpa,to ensure that individuals who are able to repay a portion of their debts do so.however,we must defer our consideration of congressional intent because our examination of the statute must begin where all such inquiries must begin with the language of the statute itself.united states ron pair,d stornawaye fin.hill in re hill,cir.if the statute language is plain,the sole function of the least where the disposition required by the text is not to enforce it according to its terms.lamie united states,d quoting hartford underwriters ins.union planters bank,d ron pair,at.we thus look first to the specific language at issue,which defines deductible secured debt as amounts that are scheduled as contractually due to secured creditors in each of the months following the date of the petition.unless that language is ambiguous,we consider congress intent only to be certain that the statute plain meaning does not lead to absurd results.lamie,at.
statutory language 
although the precedent runs both ways,the vast majority of bankruptcy courts to consider the issue have concluded that the plain language of section b permits a chapter debtor to deduct payments on a secured debt even when the debtor plans to surrender the collateral underlying that debt.see,in re,in re crawley,wl,at,in re hayes,in re hartwick,randle,at in re sorrell,in re haar,in re chang,wl,at,in re walker,wl,at.may.but see,in re naut,wl,at,in re harris,in re skaggs,the courts have focused in particular on two aspects of the text the significance of the phrase scheduled as contractually due and the nature of the reference to the period following the date of the petition.see,hayes,at haar,at.
the trustee asserts that,read in combination,the two phrases call for a projection of the actual payments the debtor will make on secured debts after the bankruptcy proceedings have ended.she emphasizes that,in many cases,nothing remains contractually due after a debtor surrenders the collateral securing a debt and points out that,even if a deficiency payment is owed,the remaining liability is not contractually due to a secured creditor,as required by the statute.we turn to an evaluation of these arguments.
scheduled as contractually due 
at the time a debtor files a bankruptcy petition and completes form,which includes the means test calculation and the inquiry about secured debts that are scheduled as contractually due,see supra note,the debtor will not yet have given up any secured property identified for surrender in his or her statement of intention.thus,even if the debtor plans to surrender a house on which he is paying a mortgage,he will at that point still have contractually due payments that are scheduled to be paid during the upcoming months.this is so whether or not the debtor has already defaulted on the mortgage by failing to make such payments in previous months because the fact of default does not release him from the ongoing obligation.see randle,at t he debtor must fill out form as of the petition date,and on that date her mortgage payments were due under the contract whether the debtor planned to make them in the future or not.
the instructions on form confirm that the debtor is expected to provide current information for all secured debt.it identifies the future payments on secured claims that must be listed on line,pursuant to section b a iii,as follows 
for each of your debts that is secured by an interest in property that you own,list the name of the creditor,identify the property securing the debt,and state the average monthly payment.the average monthly payment is the total of all amounts contractually due to each secured creditor in the months following the filing of the bankruptcy case,divided by.
emphasis added.the form,like the statute itself,asks in the present tense for a list of debts secured by property.the list is not limited to debts on property the debtor plans to retain,nor does it exclude debts that recently have gone unpaid.the statutory provision is stated comprehensively,asking for the total of all payments scheduled during the period,without reference to whether other documents filed in connection with the bankruptcy show that the payments are likely to stop during that period.see,hartwick,at randle,at in sum,any debt that is secured is covered by the statute inquiry.
the trustee argues that reading the phrase scheduled as contractually due to include all current contractual obligations fails to give independent meaning to the words scheduled as.if that is what congress meant,she asserts,it could simply have defined the relevant payments as those contractually due following the date of the petition.to give effect to the separate term scheduled as,she maintains that the statute must be read as asking for a assessment of whether the payments actually will be made.
the word scheduled,however,does not connote the confirmation of payments to be made that the trustee ascribes to it.indeed,it implies the contrary recognition that such payments,although scheduled,may in fact not be made otherwise,the request would more logically have been for information about all payments that will be made to creditors during the targeted period,or all payments the debtor expects or intends to make during that time frame.see walker,wl,at noting that the word scheduled implies the possibility that the payments may not be made as required under the contract.as other courts have observed,if congress had sought to exclude secured debt on properties the debtor has stated an intention to surrender,it could easily have said so.randle,at see also,hartwick,at walker,wl,at noting that congress could have specified that the payments to be deducted are only those payments to be made on secured debts that the debtor intends to reaffirm.congress choice of language shows a clear intent not to impose any such limit on debtors.randle,at.
the trustee points out fairly that,under this interpretation,the term scheduled as appears to play no role in defining the payments covered by section b a iii i.the same result would be achieved by referring only to payments that were,at the time of the bankruptcy filing,contractually due.still,we fail to see how that apparent surplusage warrants limiting the words scheduled as which are stated in the present only those payments that will be made in the future.see lamie,at.surplusage does not always produce ambiguity and our preference for avoiding surplusage constructions is not absolute.although our construction of the statutory language can not turn on the language of form official document on which debtors must report their means test think it worth noting that the phrase scheduled as is omitted from the form instructions for calculating secured debt.see supra note.the absence of that language may reflect a recognition by those tasked with creating the document that the term adds nothing to the inquiry.
the trustee alternatively argues that scheduled as must be construed in the specific context of the bankruptcy code,where the word schedule and the phrase scheduled as are used as terms of art.this argument invokes a debate in the cases that address section b a iii i between two main interpretive camps one concluding that the word scheduled refers to a debt being listed on the debtor formal bankruptcy schedules,and the other adopting the common,meaning of scheduled as planned for a certain date.hayes,at see also haar,at skaggs,at.the trustee argues here that the code refers to claims or debts being scheduled as due if the debt is properly listed on a debtor bankruptcy schedules,and she asserts that scheduled as contractually due should thus be limited to those contractual obligations properly listed on a bankruptcy schedule because the debtor intends to honor them.
the primary problem with this argument,as recognized in hayes and other cases cited therein,see at,is that section b a iii i does not refer directly to any bankruptcy schedules,and there is no schedule that asks a debtor to identify obligations that are contractually due at the time of the petition,but that may be resolved through surrender of the collateral.see see also sorrell,at a debtor statement of intention is not a schedule.randle,at in re nockerts,noting that,when describing the bankruptcy schedules,congress include s in the statute a reference to the schedules,either directly by name or indirectly by reference to,the provision that requires the debtor to file bankruptcy schedules.moreover,to the extent that appearance on a schedule is a prerequisite for including a debt in the means test calculation,schedule j,which lists the debtor expenses as of the petition date,could be in this include any mortgage payments due at that time,without regard for the debtor future intentions with respect to the underlying property.see randle,at noting that schedule j normally includes mortgage and car payments due at the time the bankruptcy petition is filed 
in addition,the code uses the word scheduled in two places in the sense to refer to scheduled payments,making an ordinary construction of the term a possibility in this context as well.see hayes,at citing,as an example,a b,which provides that a debtor shall make payments scheduled in a lease of personal property directly to the lessor.hence,the code other uses of scheduled or scheduled as fail to illuminate the meaning of the term here,giving us no reason to depart from the provision plain meaning,that the debtor may deduct all payments owed at the time of the bankruptcy filing.
the scheduled as language may not be construed in isolation,however,hayes,at,and we therefore consider whether the other critical statutory language points to a different outcome.
f ollowing the date of the petition 
the trustee argues that congress,in using the word following,contemplated a projection of future,expenses that will exist following the bankruptcy than a snapshot of current expenses.again,however,that interpretation is not supported by the words themselves,which are only in the sense that the required current calculation is for debts that are scheduled into the future.see hayes,at noting that the provision is in the sense that it takes into account payments required in the future,but that it is clear from the plain language of the provision that this determination is to be made at the time the petition is filed haar,at.the trustee attempts to change this plain meaning by analogy,asserting that other deductions allowed by the means test are and that the deduction for secured debts should be treated consistently with the treatment of such other expenses.
as the trustee acknowledges,however,the statute sets allowable expenses by means of several different methods,and,l ike section b a iii,many other provisions of the means test appear to operate contrary to the goal of accurately determining the amount of income that would actually be available for payments to unsecured creditors in a chapter case.walker,wl,at.for example,the starting point for the means test,current monthly income,is calculated as the average income earned by the debtor in the six months preceding the bankruptcy filing.see a crawley,wl,at walker,wl,at.by the time of the filing,the amount of actual income could be dramatically different from the previous example,if the debtor has just lost his job or secured a new one.see hayes,at walker,wl,at.
even on the expense side of the calculation,the means test relies on standard deduction amounts for certain types of expenses that may be either significantly less than or greatly in excess of the debtor actual expenses.walker,wl,at see also hayes,at randle,at.for example,the irs has prescribed standard amounts to be used in the means test calculation,instead of the individual debtor actual costs,for certain categories of expenses food,housekeeping supplies,and transportation.see b a ii i eugene wedoff,means testing in the new b,am.thus,the future inaccuracy of the approach to the expense for secured debt does not help the trustee argument.see hayes,at it can not be fairly said,therefore,that congress was with capturing an accurate,precise financial picture to determine whether the case would be presumed abusive.randle,at congress adopted a test for the presumption of abuse that relies primarily on standardized estimates of expenses,not the debtor actual expenses.walker,wl,at m any other provisions of the means test appear to operate contrary to the goal of accurately determining the amount of income that would actually be available for payments to unsecured creditors.
o n account of secured debt 
the trustee also invokes a third phrase from section b a in support of her position,arguing that the requirement that payments be made on account of secured debts excludes debts that will remain after the property serving as collateral for them has been surrendered.she reasons that,after title has transferred following surrender,the debtor obligation either will be eliminated entirely or changed into an unsecured that any future payments will not be on account of secured debts.the trustee asserts that the transformation of such debts is relevant to the debtor monthly expenses,and thus relevant to whether granting the debtor a chapter discharge would be an abuse.indeed,she points out,the purpose of surrendering collateral is to reduce monthly living expenses.see harris,at in re love.
other courts have closely examined the impact of a debtor surrender of property and whether the original contractual obligation remains even after the debtor has defaulted on a loan.see,randle,at see also rudler,at t hose amounts remain contractually due,regardless of whether said payments will actually be made,whether the debtor will reaffirm the debt,or whether the debtor will surrender the property to the secured party.walker,wl,at.in our view,this issue is largely beside the point.the pertinent question is not the debtor status the loan after it is renounced,but whether the means test calculation is to be performed coincident with the bankruptcy filing,based on information.as we have explained,the statute as written plainly requires such a calculation.
our conclusion that the language of the statute is unambiguous allows us to consider congressional intent only if literal application of the statute would lead to absurd results.lamie,at.see also ron pair,at.describing the inquiry as whether literal application will produce a result demonstrably at odds with the intentions of its drafters quotation marks and citation omitted.that exception is not triggered here.as we shall explain,a snapshot approach to the deduction for secured debts fits rationally within the statutory scheme.
congressional intent 
the trustee argues that allowing debtors to deduct only payments they will actually make,rather than all payments scheduled at the time of the bankruptcy filing,better serves the purpose behind the means test because it more accurately reflects the debtor resources following the bankruptcy proceedings.this argument has it misses the point.there are a number of ways congress could have effectuated its goal of increased debtor responsibility,and calculating projected income based on actual anticipated expenses is unquestionably one of them.however,based on the plain language of the statute,that is not the approach congress enacted into law,and we can not rewrite the statute simply because we think a different method of assessing abuse would be more effective.
a test that relies on a snapshot of the debtors circumstances at the time of the bankruptcy filing is not an absurd alternative.to the contrary,a fixed approach to the secured debt deduction makes sense because the actual amount the debtor will pay on secured debts in the relevant period is subject to a number of variables 
a debtor might state an intention to reaffirm but the creditor might refuse to agree,preferring to take the collateral back because of the debtor bad payment history.or the debtor might be able to reaffirm the debt at a more favorable interest rate or lower monthly payment.or the debtor might state an intention to redeem but later be unable to obtain redemption financing.
randle,at see also haar,at walker,wl,at noting that,after filing the statement of intention,the debtor may decide to amend it and to reaffirm the debt or redeem the property.although congress could have chosen to give bankruptcy judges the discretion to address such uncertainties on a basis,there is nothing absurd about congress choice to adopt a rigid formula.
a number of courts have in fact concluded that a specific intent to limit the bankruptcy court discretion underlies the means test and accounts for congress adoption of a mechanical formula for presuming abuse of chapter.randle,at citing report of the committee on the judiciary,house of representatives,to accompany,pt,at,sess.t he formula remains inflexible and divorced from the debtor actual circumstances.dissenting views see also hayes,at noting that the intent of congress in creating the specific mechanics of the means test under b appears more to have been a plan to reduce judicial discretion on the question of whether a particular case is presumed abusive hartwick,at the major objective of congress in adding the means test in b was to limit judicial discretion from the process of determining abuse by providing an objective standard for establishing a presumption of abuse.in re barr,i t appears that congress intended to adopt a specific test to be rigidly applied rather than a standard to be applied according to the facts and circumstances of the case.walker,wl,at the means test is a mechanical estimate of the debtor abilities to fund a chapter plan and was not intended to be a perfect indicator of ability to pay.
indeed,choosing the certainty of a mechanical approach over an actual circumstances evaluation under section b complements the inquiry prescribed by section b b,which remains a backup option when the trustee is dissatisfied by the results of the means test.see,rudler,at hartwick,at id.at under the totality of the circumstances test,courts may take into account both current and foreseeable circumstances,including a debtor ability to repay his debts under a chapter plan.singletary,at to allow a movant to include the outcome of future events as part of the means test would eliminate the distinction between the presumption of abuse test and the totality of the circumstances test.if a review of all of a debtor bankruptcy documents shows that the means test is too generous,a finding of abuse may be appropriate under that subsection,at a determination that the presumption of abuse does not arise pursuant to the means test does not close the door on conversion or dismissal.crawley,wl,at the fact that the debtors pass the means test does not,however,end the inquiry t he case may nevertheless be dismissed as an abuse if the totality of the circumstances demonstrates abuse.quoting b hartwick,at see also singletary,at.
the court in walker also observed that the bapcpa goals extend beyond increasing debtors accountability for their debts.still part of the code is the longstanding objective to provid e honest debtors with a fresh start,as well as encouraging financially responsible behavior and rehabilitation.wl,at see also susan jensen,a legislative history of the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of,am,quoting president bush remarks upon signing the act,stating that bankruptcy laws give those who can not pay their debts a fresh start and that the new law will require those with ability to pay back at least a portion of their debts.if section b a iii i were interpreted as the trustee debts on property that will be might be inclined to unwisely reaffirm such debts to avoid triggering the presumption of abuse.walker,wl,at.although other provisions of the code may defeat such a strategy,see,m giving the court authority to disapprove reaffirmation agreements,the possibility of the other uncertainties,noted above,surrounding the decision to reaffirm or support a reading of the deduction.a calculation that is more generous to the debtor,but has the advantage of certainty,is not inevitably at odds with congress intent 
we thus conclude that,in calculating monthly income under the means test,the plain language of section b a iii i allows debtors to deduct payments due on a secured debt notwithstanding the debtor intention to surrender the collateral.that plain language is consistent with other provisions that rely on standardized estimates of expenses rather than the debtor actual circumstances.the mechanical approach avoids the uncertainties that surround a debtor announced,but not yet executed,plan to surrender property or reaffirm secured debts.hence,allowing the deduction does not produce an absurd result and the plain language of section b a iii i must govern.
accordingly,the judgment of the bankruptcy court is affirmed.
so ordered.
i join the judgment of the court affirming the bankruptcy court application of the means test.
the underlying problem concerns whether a bankruptcy petition filed under chapter should be converted to a chapter petition with the debtor consent,or be dismissed,because it is abusive.see b.chapter,which discharges the debtor debts,is more favorable to the debtor than chapter,which commits the debtor projected disposable income toward paying his creditors.
in the structure of the bankruptcy act,congress provided two different mechanisms for determining whether a chapter petition is abusive.the first test,which presumes abuse if the debtor monthly income as calculated under the statute exceeds a certain,per the means test under b a i.the second test allows the court to consider whether the petition was filed in bad faith and whether the totality of the circumstances of the debtor financial situation demonstrates abuse.id.b.here,the trustee argued that the chapter petition was presumptively abusive under the means test she did not seek a finding of abuse under the totality of the circumstances test.
the question before us is the meaning of the statutory phrase scheduled as contractually due,id.b a iii i,as it applies to collateral which the debtor intends to surrender at the time he files his schedules and statement of intentions.although the language of the statute tends to support the debtor position,i do not think the plain text resolves the issue one way or the other.the word scheduled,even standing alone,is ambiguous.if congress had wanted to include all future payments regardless of the debtor intent
