opinion of the court 
this is an appeal by a commercial landlord who contends a chapter bankruptcy was filed only to frustrate his collection of rent.at issue is an interpretation of bankruptcy code b and the code good faith requirements.
sheldon solow owns a manhattan office tower at west street.on august,he leased square feet to ppi enterprises ppie,a delaware corporation,for its corporate headquarters.the lease ran for ten years,requiring annual payments in monthly installments of for five years and thereafter.polly peck international,plc,a united kingdom corporation and the indirect corporate parent of ppie,guaranteed these commercial lease obligations sanwa bank issued a standby letter of credit to solow,on behalf of ppie,in the amount of.
over time,polly peck financial status unraveled and insolvency proceedings commenced in great britain.on october,the chancery division of the high court of justice entered an administration order for polly peck and appointed three administrators for the company.as polly peck subsidiary,ppie faced credit cancellations and defaults exceeding million 
in september,ppie abandoned its corporate headquarters in manhattan and ceased paying rent to solow.on october,solow delivered ppie written notice of default under the lease.after ppie failed to cure the default,solow gave notice on october,of his intent to terminate the lease.remaining rent due under the leasehold agreement totaled approximately million.solow subsequently drew on sanwa bank letter of credit,applying it in lieu of monthly rent payments between october and july.by the latter date,the letter of credit was exhausted.
on october,solow sued ppie and polly peck in the united states district court for the southern district of new york.on november,the district court granted solow partial summary judgment,holding ppie wrongly terminated its lease,but did not address possible damages.on march,almost four and one half years after filing its initial lawsuit and after the failure of settlement negotiations,solow asked the district court to schedule a damages trial.on the eve of that proceeding,ppie filed for chapter bankruptcy in delaware.ppie stated it had four objectives concluding the polly peck liquidating ppie invoking provisions to reject a restriction on its ability to sell the del monte stock and limiting solow lease termination damages under bankruptcy code b.
on august,solow filed a proof of claim with the bankruptcy court,reducing his alleged damages to then,in december,solow moved to dismiss the chapter filing for bad faith.solow alleged ppie bankruptcy was a sham filing designed to create value for polly peck and its creditors at his expense,and that the bankruptcy served no legitimate purpose.according to solow,ppie did not intend its bankruptcy filing to effectuate a corporate reorganization,because the company had no ongoing business,only one remaining employee,and no assets other than stock certificates representing a interest in del monte foods company.after an evidentiary hearing,the bankruptcy court in january denied the motion without prejudice 
on march,ppie filed its bankruptcy plan plan,dividing administrative claims and priority tax claims into four classes after providing for the division,the plan stated the treatment of and consideration to be received by holders of allowed claims and interests pursuant to this article iv of the plan shall be in full and complete satisfaction,settlement,release and discharge of such claims and interests.the debtors obligations in respect of such claims and interests shall be satisfied in accordance with the terms of this plan.
the plan treated solow claim as a class general unsecured claim.ppie contended plan approval by the classes of creditors was unnecessary since none were impaired.nonetheless,ppie solicited votes from classes,and.only two of seven ballots were returned from class solow no vote and one yes vote.with no clear majority,solow contends class effectively rejected the plan 
solow renewed his motion to dismiss on april,contending his vote against the plan had not counted because his claim was improperly classified as unimpaired.over a period,the bankruptcy court heard evidence on the debtors objection to solow claim solow renewed motion to dismiss and solow objections to the plan confirmation.on december,the bankruptcy court determined solow claim was subject to the statutory cap of b and reduced by application of the letter of credit the bankruptcy was filed in good faith and as an unimpaired creditor,solow was deemed to have accepted the plan.in re ppi,walsh.
the united states district court for the district of delaware affirmed without opinion and this appeal followed 
the bankruptcy court had subject matter jurisdiction under and.the district court had jurisdiction over the bankruptcy court order under a.we have jurisdiction under d.we review the bankruptcy court legal determinations de novo,its factual findings for clear error,and its exercises of discretion for abuse thereof.in re cont l airlines,cir.
the central issue on appeal is whether the doctrine of impairment precludes solow from having voting rights against ppie chapter bankruptcy plan.
impairment is a term of art crafted by congress to determine a creditor standing in the confirmation phase of bankruptcy plans.in re l j anaheim,cir.each creditor has a set of legal,equitable,and contractual rights that may or may not be affected by bankruptcy.if the debtor chapter reorganization plan does not leave the creditor rights entirely unaltered,the creditor claim will be labeled as impaired under of the bankruptcy code.if the creditor claim is impaired,the code provides the creditor with a vote that,depending on the value of the creditor claim,may be sufficient to defeat confirmation of the bankruptcy plan.
the bankruptcy code creates a presumption of impairment so as to enable a creditor to vote on acceptance of the plan.in re monclova care,in re seasons apartments.under,the presumption of impairment is overcome only if the plan leaves unaltered the creditor legal,equitable,and contractual rights.the burden is placed on the debtor to demonstrate the plan leaves the creditor rights unaltered.
the bankruptcy court here began by reviewing b.the court determined the plan did not impair solow legal,equitable,and contractual rights,since the limitation on solow potential recovery was dictated by b,which was independent of the plan.solow contends application of b alters his claim and entitles him to vote against the plan confirmation.the question is whether the impairment sections of the bankruptcy code require such a result.
we begin with the language of the bankruptcy code.united states ron pair,d.as noted,provides that a claim is impaired unless the plan leaves unaltered the legal,equitable,and contractual rights to which such claim entitles the holder of such claim.under,a claim refers broadly to a creditor right to recovery see also johnson home state bank,d we have previously explained that congress intended by this language to adopt the broadest available definition of claim.citations omitted.
solow contends a broad definition of claim requires a finding of impairment whether the source of impairment is the plan or a statute.the bankruptcy court rejected solow argument,finding he confuse d two distinct concepts i plan impairment,under which the debtor alters the legal,equitable,and contractual rights to which the claim entitles the holder of such claim,and ii statutory impairment,under which the operation of a provision of the code alters the amount that the creditor is entitled to under nonbankruptcy law.ppi,at.
the bankruptcy court relied on in re american solar king,to reach its conclusion.in solar king,a chapter corporate debtor sought confirmation of a modified reorganization plan.certain parties already involved in litigation with the bankrupt company doubtless concerned about reduced recoveries challenged the plan.id.at.the court recognized the operation of b in altering the petitioning creditors claims,but found the reduction in the creditors potential,nonbankruptcy recovery did not result in impairment.id.at.the court reasoned 
a closer inspection of the language employed in section reveals impairment by statute to be an oxymoron.impairment results from what the plan does,not what the statute does.a plan which leaves unaltered the legal rights of a claimant is one which,by definition,does not impair the creditor.a plan which leaves a claimant subject to other applicable provisions of the bankruptcy code does no more to alter a claimant legal rights than does a plan which leaves a claimant vulnerable to a given state usury laws or to federal environmental laws.the bankruptcy code itself is a statute which,like other statutes,helps to define the legal rights of persons,just as surely as it limits contractual rights.any alteration of legal rights is a consequence not of the plan but of the bankruptcy filing itself.
id.at see also in re smith,a plan may limit payment of claims to the extent allowed,without impairing them for until claims are allowed,or deemed allowed,the holders thereof are not entitled to distribution from the bankruptcy estate.
generally,we agree with the solar king analysis.the relevant impairment language requires bankruptcy plans to leave unaltered those rights to which the creditor claim or interest entitles the holder of such claim or interest.this language in does not address a creditor claim under nonbankruptcy law.the use of a verb suggests a creditor rights must be ascertained with regard to applicable statutes,including the b cap.in other words,a creditor claim outside of bankruptcy is not the relevant barometer for impairment we must examine whether the plan itself is a source of limitation on a creditor legal,equitable,or contractual rights.
under solow interpretation,every capped claim under b would be impaired and entitled to a vote.yet this would make b a nullity,since,unlike some other code sections,the limitation on damages under b is absolute and is a limit based on fairness rather than a rule of convenience.collier on bankruptcy,at alan resnick henry sommer,ed.thus,ppie could not offer a plan that departed from the b limitation.accordingly,we hold that where b alters a creditor nonbankruptcy claim,there is no alteration of the claimant legal,equitable,and contractual rights for the purposes of impairment under.
the solar king court adopted a similar rationale when interpreting b,which automatically subordinates security purchase and sale claims to the claims of general,unsecured creditors.the rationale for this code section is that general creditors should not share in the risk of an unlawful issuance of securities.see collier on bankruptcy,at.like b,this code section is mandatory,not discretionary.to hold that its mere application in a bankruptcy proceeding causes impairment would nullify its meaning.
further,as the bankruptcy court here noted,solow interpretation would create perverse incentives for all creditors,effectively urging them to file inflated claims,disputed claims,or claims of questionable validity.once those claims were reduced by operation of the bankruptcy code,under solow analysis,creditors would succeed in having their claims impaired and would receive a vote to defeat the plan.
in sum,ppie chapter plan intends to pay solow his legal entitlement and provide him with full and complete satisfaction of his claim on the date the plan becomes effective.solow is only entitled to his rights under the bankruptcy code,including the b cap.solow might have received considerably more if he had recovered on his leasehold claims before ppie filed for bankruptcy.but once ppie filed for chapter protection,that hypothetical recovery became irrelevant.solow is only entitled to his legal,equitable,and contractual rights,as they now exist.because the bankruptcy code,not the plan,is the only source of limitation on those rights here,solow claim is not impaired under 
solow also contends congress repeal of,a separate exception to the presumption of impairment,supports his broad definition of claim.before,specified that a creditor receiving full payment of an allowed claim was not impaired.this subsection,eliminated in,provided 
except as provided in section a of this title,a class of claims or interests is impaired under a plan unless,with respect to each claim or interest of such class,the plan provides that,on the effective date of the plan,the holder of such claim or interest receives,on account of such claim or interest,cash equal to a with respect to a claim,the allowed amount of such claim 
interpreting this statute in,one bankruptcy court held that allowed a solvent debtor to pay the allowed claims of unsecured creditors in full,excluding postpetition interest,without risking impairment.in re new valley,the new valley court held that a portion of a creditor claim that was not allowed under the bankruptcy code need not be paid after a bankruptcy filing,even if the claim would be recoverable in a context.id.this decision contrasted with several cases holding that unsecured creditors of a solvent debtor must be paid in full,including postpetition interest,under the fair and equitable test of b,consol.rock prods.du bois.debentureholders protective,at.
after the new valley decision,congress repealed.relevant legislative history recited 
the principal change in this section is set forth in subsection d and relates to the award of post petition interest.in a recent bankruptcy court decision new valley,unsecured creditors were denied the right to receive post petition interest in order to preclude this unfair result in the future,the committee finds it appropriate to delete section from the bankruptcy code.as a result of this change,if a plan proposed to pay a class of claims in cash in the full allowed amount of the claims,the class would be impaired,entitling creditors to vote for or against the plan of reorganization.
at,reprinted in.
solow contends this repeal established that creditors receiving cash equal to their allowed claims,even including postpetition interest,were still impaired by bankruptcy filings.he claims the repeal was not limited to fact situations involving postpetition interest and that congress went beyond the new valley problem,providing creditors with voting rights if a bankruptcy plan alters their nonbankruptcy rights in any manner.some bankruptcy courts appear to have adopted this rationale.see,seasons apartments,at while the congressional record reveals that congress was most concerned about solvent debtors avoiding interest on unsecured claims,congress repealed the entire subsection.in re crosscreek apartments,in light of the deletion of subsection to by the bankruptcy reform act of,the court concludes that it is no longer a valid argument to assert that the plan proponent can render a claim unimpaired by paying the claim in full at confirmation.equitable life ins.of iowa partners,concluding congress repeal of was an extreme remedy for the new valley issue but that legislative history demonstrates congress intended to do away with the concept that a creditor receiving payment in full is unimpaired 
the bankruptcy court here rejected such a broad reading of the repeal,concluding,m y reading of the legislative history indicates that congress merely intended to eliminate the anomalous result created by the new valley decision.thus,i conclude that congress did not intend to eliminate unimpairment for purely money claims.it intended that to be unimpaired,the claim must receive postpetition interest.ppi,at citation omitted see also in re rocha,a solvent debtor must now pay and interest on a claim to have a class considered unimpaired.section has been deleted in its entirety,which had previously allowed a class of creditors to be considered unimpaired without paying interest on the claim.the bankruptcy court also held that and offered different tests for nonimpairment section created nonimpairment status by a cash payment equal to the allowed amount of the claim but without postpetition interest.such treatment could not qualify for nonimpairment under because the failure to pay postpetition interest does not leave unaltered the contractual or legal rights of the claim.ppi,at.
in other words,and were different exceptions to the presumption of impairment,and the repeal of one should not affect the other.we agree with the bankruptcy court analysis.contrary to solow representations,the legislative history does not reflect a sweeping intent by congress to give impaired status to creditors more freely outside the postpetition interest context.instead,as the bankruptcy court noted,the legislative history accompanying the repeal of indicated the principal change in the repeal relates to the award of post petition interest.the congressional committee specifically referenced the new valley decision without referencing the text of or the many cases addressing its provisions,including solar king.therefore,the legislative history supports our holding.
having determined solow claim is not impaired,we must consider the operation of b.as the bankruptcy court noted,ppie asserts that solow claim under b entitles him to.solow counters that capping his claim still would award him.these disparate views are due to conflicting interpretations of b.
section b caps a landlord claim in bankruptcy for damages resulting from the termination of a real property lease under b,a is entitled to rent reserved from the greater of one lease year or fifteen percent,not to exceed three years,of the remaining lease term.the cap operates from the earlier of the petition filing date or the date on which the lessor repossessed or the lessee surrendered,the leased property.the landlord also retains a claim for any unpaid rent due under such lease prior to the earlier of those dates.this language reflects congress intent to limit lease termination claims to prevent landlords from receiving a windfall over other creditors.see,at,reprinted in,the cap limits the damages allowable to a landlord of the debtor it is designed to compensate the landlord for his loss while not permitting a claim so large based on a lease as to prevent other general unsecured creditors from recovering a dividend from the estate.the damages a landlord may assert from termination of a lease are limited collier on bankruptcy,at the cap is designed to compensate the landlord for his loss while not permitting a claim so large as to prevent other general unsecured creditors from recovering a dividend from the estate.
just over two years into the parties lease,ppie breached the leasehold agreement by failing to pay rent.solow gave ppie ten days to cure its breach.when ppie did not respond,solow initiated termination proceedings and filed suit seeking damages for the term of the lease.since solow terminated the lease long before ppie filed its bankruptcy petition,the bankruptcy court correctly fixed the date on which solow accepted ppie surrender of the leased property as the starting point for its b calculation 
once the b calculation is complete,the prevailing view,and the view adopted by the bankruptcy court here,favors deduction of a security deposit from the b cap of a landlord claim,atl.container,at it is that a security deposit held by a lessor on a rejected lease must be applied against the maximum claim for lease termination damages allowed to the lessor under b.equating a letter of credit with a security deposit,the bankruptcy court held that because solow drew down the letter of credit for subsequent to termination of the lease,solow b claim should be reduced by that amount.ppi,at.
the bankruptcy court relied upon oldden tonto realty,cir,which established the practice of deducting security deposits from b calculations.see also,at,reprinted in,a landlord will not be permitted to offset his actual damages against his security deposit and then claim for the balance under b.rather,his security deposit will be applied in satisfaction of the claim that is allowed under the statute.oldden stands for the proposition that a bankruptcy filing limits damages for breach of a leasehold agreement and requires a return of the tenant security deposit.at.nonetheless,it bears noting that oldden involved a security deposit given directly to the creditor from the debtor,not from a third party.we must consider whether this factor requires different treatment under b.
solow contends b applies only to funds collected by the landlord directly from the tenant,and that any other funds recovered by a landlord,whether from a letter of credit or a new tenant,are immaterial.accord atl.container,at rent,use,and occupancy payments should not be applied against the landlord maximum allowable lease termination claim see also in re conston.in this context,solow suggests a security deposit and a letter of credit are fundamentally different.solow argues he never had the functional equivalent of a security deposit and instead simply maintained contractual rights to the letter of credit proceeds,which should not affect his recovery under b.
this distinction is important because if sanwa bank had defaulted on its letter of credit to solow,solow would have pursued a separate legal action against sanwa bank he would have no claim against ppie based on the letter of credit.because the letter of credit allegedly is independent of his claim against ppie,solow contends the should not be deducted from the b cap calculation.
under similar circumstances,some courts have adopted the independence principle to separate proceeds from a letter of credit from the debtor estate,kellogg blue quail energy,cir holding that the independence principle is the cornerstone of letter of credit law musika arbutus shopping,determining the b cap without regard to the letter of credit see also collier on bankruptcy,property of the estate does not include the proceeds of a letter of credit paid to a creditor of the debtor who is a beneficiary of the letter.geoffrey berman et al,last in line landlords use letters of credit to bypass the claim cap of b,am.under this view,the independence principle should generally govern in situations where a issuer,not the tenant itself,provides the letter of credit.
yet there is another view.ppie argues that once the letter of credit is drawn down,sanwa bank,as guarantor,will pursue recovery of its loss directly against ppie.under solow interpretation,this means solow would keep the and ppie would be liable for that same amount to sanwa bank.in effect,this result would be an end run around b,since solow would receive a windfall at ppie,and other creditors,expense,and ppie would be liable twice for the same amount of money.the more appropriate outcome under the relevant case law and legislative history,ppie contends,is to treat the letter of credit as a payment from ppie to solow,thus reducing ppie burden under b in bankruptcy.
chapter is intended to permit the debtor to rehabilitate itself while simultaneously protecting creditors.the parties here posit competing legal and equitable arguments that reflect the dual purposes of bankruptcy.although there are reasons to the contrary,we are not inclined to disturb the rationale followed since oldden.as the second circuit explained in oldden 
although the instant case is admittedly different in that the tenant here pledged his own property to cover the possibility of default,and the rights of a third party are in no way involved,yet in both situations there is an attempt on the part of the landlord to insure performance by the tenant.the difference is purely technical i n one case the insurance is security put up by the tenant himself,while in the other it is the credit standing of a third party procured by the tenant this difference is insufficient to justify divergent rules as to the respective allowable claims.if the total damages are limited in the one instance,they should likewise be limited in the other instance.
nonetheless,we need not decide the underlying question because it is clear the parties intended the letter of credit to operate as a security deposit.article of the parties lease required ppie to give solow a security deposit in the amount of.article of the rider attached to the lease clarified ppie obligation
