this appeal involves the bankruptcy of quincy medical center,qmc ed physicians,and quincy physician corporation debtors.apurv gupta and victor munger appellants,former senior executives of debtors,appeal the district court ruling that the bankruptcy court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over their claims for severance payments against the purchaser of debtors assets.because we agree that the bankruptcy court had no jurisdiction over gupta and munger claims,we affirm.
the facts pertinent to this appeal none of which are disputed are fully set forth in the opinions of the bankruptcy court and the district court.see quincy med.ctr.gupta,and,wl,at,in re quincy med,bankr.in re quincy med,bankr.we assume familiarity with the decisions below and discuss only the pertinent facts here.
gupta and munger were senior executives at quincy medical center,a hospital operated by debtors in quincy,massachusetts.on june,debtors signed an asset purchase agreement the apa whereby they agreed to sell substantially all of their assets to quincy medical center,a steward family hospital,steward medical holdings subsidiary five,steward one day later,on july,debtors filed voluntary petitions under chapter of the bankruptcy code,and a motion the sale motion under sections and of the bankruptcy code seeking bankruptcy court approval of the apa.see.
sections and of the apa,which deal with the continued employment of debtors former employees,are relevant to appellants claims.specifically,section provides 
not later than ten business days prior to the closing,steward shall offer employment by steward to each of the employees who remain employed by debtors as of a recent date,such employment to commence immediately following the closing.such individuals who accept such offer of employment are hereinafter referred to as the transferred employees.
section further provides that steward is obligated to pay each transferred employee base wage and salary levels provided to such employees immediately prior to the closing for no less than three months after the closing date.additionally,section c of the apa provides that upon steward termination of the employment of any employees of debtors at or following the closing,steward shall be liable to any of such persons for severance or retention pay or any other payments otherwise due them as employees for debtors.
on september,the bankruptcy court issued an order the sale order approving the apa as requested in the sale motion.the sale closed on october.six days later,debtors filed a proposed chapter plan of reorganization the plan.the bankruptcy court thereafter confirmed the plan the confirmation order.
the sale order and the plan each contain provisions regarding the retention of jurisdiction by the bankruptcy court over any disputes arising under them.the sale order provides 
it is necessary and appropriate,in order to ensure the validity of the sale of the assets to steward and to ensure compliance with this order,for this court to retain jurisdiction to a interpret and enforce the provisions of the apa,the assigned agreements,the sale motion and this order b protect steward and any of the assets against any lien or claim c resolve any disputes arising under or relating to the apa,the assigned agreements,the sale motion and this order and d determine the validity,extent and priority of asserted liens or claims on,and the disposition of the gross proceeds of sale of,the assets.
similarly,the plan provides that 
notwithstanding the entry of the confirmation order and the occurrence of the effective date,on and after the effective date,the bankruptcy court shall,to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law,retain exclusive jurisdiction over all matters arising out of,or related to,the chapter cases and the plan pursuant to sections a and of the bankruptcy code,including jurisdiction to 
enter and enforce any order for the sale of property pursuant to sections,or a of the bankruptcy code 
enforce all orders previously entered by the bankruptcy court 
the confirmation order also incorporates the retention of jurisdiction provision from the plan.
on october,appellants received letters from debtors stating that their employment was terminated effective october,the day the sale closed.appellants subsequently sought severance pay from debtors by filing motions in the bankruptcy court for allowance of administrative expenses against debtors.the bankruptcy court denied administrative expense status to both claims.however,the court held that appellants motions should be treated as seeking relief in the alternative for an order directing steward to pay the claims.the court found that it had subject matter jurisdiction to hear the claims against steward pursuant to the retention of jurisdiction provisions of the sale order and the court authority to interpret and enforce its own prior orders.the bankruptcy court offered steward an opportunity to respond,and steward filed its objections.
following a hearing at which gupta,munger,and steward were heard,the bankruptcy court found steward liable to appellants under the apa for their severance pay.steward appealed to the district court,which concluded that the bankruptcy court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over appellants claims.specifically,the district court found that appellants claims against steward fell outside the bankruptcy court statutorily granted jurisdiction and that the retention of jurisdiction provision relied upon by the bankruptcy court did not change this analysis.the district court therefore vacated the judgments against steward and remanded with instructions to dismiss appellants claims.this appeal followed.
jurisdictional principles 
appellants contend that the district court erred in concluding that their severance claims against steward fell outside the bankruptcy court statutorily granted jurisdiction.thus,we first must examine the statutory scheme establishing the bankruptcy court jurisdiction,understanding that the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy courts,like that of other federal courts,is grounded in,and limited by,statute.celotex edwards.we examine the bankruptcy court findings of fact for clear error and afford de novo review to its conclusions of law.see razzaboni schifano in re schifano,cir.
the general grant of bankruptcy jurisdiction is found in,which establishes two main categories of bankruptcy matters over which the district courts have jurisdiction cases under title,a,and proceedings arising under title,or arising in or related to cases under title,b.see also middlesex power equip.marine,town of tyngsborough,in re middlesex power equip.marine,cir.c ases under title refers only to the bankruptcy petition itself,and it is the umbrella under which all of the proceedings that follow the filing of a bankruptcy petition take place.id.in turn,permits the district courts to refer to bankruptcy courts all proceedings arising under title or arising in or related to cases under title.this broad jurisdictional grant allows the bankruptcy courts to deal efficiently and expeditiously with all matters connected with the bankruptcy estate.celotex,at quoting pacor,higgins,cir.
hence,in order for appellants severance claims to fall within statutory grant of jurisdiction,the claims must arise under,arise in,or relate to a case under title.we have observed that the boundaries between these types of proceedings are not always easy to distinguish from each other.see in re middlesex power equip.marine,at noting that t he dividing line is unclear between proceedings that arise under as opposed to arise in and as opposed to relate to title.the statute itself provides no definitions.nonetheless,each term has a particular scope that matters for the jurisdictional analysis here.
the arising under language of b is analogous to the arising under language in.in re middlesex power equip.marine,at comparing arising under jurisdiction to federal question jurisdiction.in other words,proceedings aris e under title when the bankruptcy code itself creates the cause of action.see stoe flaherty,cir.noting that arising under jurisdiction is limited to proceedings where the bankruptcy c
