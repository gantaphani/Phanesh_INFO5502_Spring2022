the parties in this case have brought what are effectively from an order of dismissal entered by the united states district court for the district of massachusetts on march,district order,affirming the july,decision of the united states bankruptcy court on second remand from the district court.
the dispute is between new seabury company limited partnership the debtor and new seabury properties,llc nsp over the debtor claim to a share of funds in the debtor general operating account operating account following the debtor declaration of bankruptcy and the entry of a stipulation between the parties allowing the debtor to retain the real estate brokerage segment of the business while turning over its other assets to nsp.
procedural background and facts 
the debtor filed a chapter petition on march,pursuant to et.it owned and operated a planned resort community in mashpee,massachusetts,known as new seabury resort.the debtor business was made up of three interrelated divisions the recreation division,the hotel division,and the real estate division.the funds relative to the divisions were commingled in the debtor single operating account.the functions of the three divisions were as follows 
the recreation division maintained and operated two golf courses and a golf club house,a tennis facility,a beach club,and a swimming pool facility.
the hotel division managed and maintained a hotel facility using debtor and property for short term rental by guests of the new seabury resort.
the real estate division operated a real estate brokerage the brokerage.the brokerage operated one real estate company,new seabury real estate,that sold debtor and property on the new seabury resort and another real estate company,sound realty,that brokered and rentals of property for private individuals within new seabury resort.commissions provided the brokerage primary source of revenue.the brokerage was never a member of the multiple listing service mls and,as the exclusive broker,sold most of the property in new seabury.mls brokers not related to the brokerage sold a small percentage of the property the brokerage and unrelated mls brokers would share some sales.
during the bankruptcy proceedings,the debtor and nsp offered competing plans for reorganization of the debtor.on may,the bankruptcy court entered an order and preliminary decision stating that the debtor plan was not confirmable,but nsp was.for two days leading up to the confirmation hearing on may,the debtor and nsp engaged in negotiations to resolve the differences between their competing plans.ultimately,on may,the parties executed a stipulation the stipulation,pursuant to which the debtor withdrew its own plan for reorganization.
the stipulation noted that nsp plan,to which the debtor now consented,provided for nsp to acquire substantially all of the debtors assets.so as to resolve the parties controversy,however,the debtor and nsp stipulated that certain assets of the debtor will not be acquired by nsp and will be retained by the debtor free and clear of all liens,encumbrances,claims and interest.thus,paragraph of the stipulation provided that t he real estate brokerage segment of the debtor business,including all licenses and permits required to operate that segment of the business,shall be retained by the debtor.paragraph of the stipulation went on to state that the parties would execute on the plan effective date the effective date an agreement containing the following provisions,and failing the execution of such agreement the provisions as set forth herein shall constitute such agreement.
clauses a,b,and c of paragraph then provided that the debtor,a c great island,and christopher burden would retain a license to use the requested trade name new seabury in connection with real estate brokerage operations conducted by one or more of them for as long as burden or his family maintained a majority ownership interest or were involved in daily operations.the license would include the right to use the new seabury name in marketing materials.additionally,the brokerage operations were to have access to all resort amenities,including related pictures and information,in its marketing and other material for viewing and touring,with specified free membership rights to be granted to christopher and nancy burden in the new seabury club.signage rights were also granted to the brokerage operations relating to real estate service operations in nsp new seabury related property,with various limitations spelled out as to the form and location of the signage,its acceptability to the debtor and nsp,and changes desired by nsp.
paragraph of the stipulation also contained details and limitations relative to the retained brokerage operation.the debtor would retain certain specified real property on which real estate service operations are conducted,including the main new seabury real estate office and adjacent parking facilities,and certain other parcels.on and for a period following the effective date,the debtor was to allow nsp use of three desks on one of these parcels,along with certain rights to install phone lines and place its own reasonable office equipment.properties to be retained by the debtor were to be free and clear of all liens,encumbrances,claims and interests with additional conditions specified as to a particular note held by burden and a mortgage on one parcel.
paragraph of the stipulation provided for execution by the parties of a limited agreement prohibiting nsp and its assignees,successors,and assigns from engaging in real estate brokerage within new seabury,except as to its own properties,and the debtor,a c great island and burden from engaging in resort operations within the boundaries of the new seabury development and within a radius.nothing,however,was to prohibit nsp from employing a broker of its choice to market its properties.
paragraph specified that except as provided herein and except as to the obligations of nsp under the nsp plan,all parties shall be deemed to have remised,released and forever discharged against the other any and all debts,demands,obligations,avoidance actions,causes of action and any other claims,through the effective date of the nsp plan.
the remaining paragraphs of the stipulation dealt with the discharge of debts,providing,inter alia,that nsp did not release its debts against the debtor and that burden released certain of his debts.
nothing was said in the stipulation as to retention or ownership of monies held in the debtor operating account.in particular,there was no reference to the disposition of any sums therein derived from real estate brokerage activities.
at a hearing,the bankruptcy court confirmed nsp plan and entered a formal order on june,the confirmation date.after the confirmation date,the debtor continued to operate the brokerage.
during the preparation of the documents to close the transaction transferring the bulk of the debtor assets to nsp,a dispute arose regarding whether the debtor was entitled to receive and retain the net cash the brokerage had generated through the effective date of nsp plan the disputed funds.as noted,revenue from the brokerage operations was commingled with that from the debtor two other divisions in a single operating account.
in order to complete the closing,the documents specifically excluded the disputed funds pending resolution of the parties rights the specific language is quoted below.the parties executed the final closing documents on september,the closing,which was also the effective date of the reorganization plan.the bill of sale provided that the debtor agreed to sell all of the debtor rights and title but specifically excluded 
i any assets being retained by new seabury company limited partnership pursuant to the stipulation relating to competing plans of reorganization,objections to confirmation,motion for reconsideration and motion for plan partnership,entered into on may,the stipulation ii telephone number pending a further determination of the debtor right to retain that number and iii property,assets and rights,generated by or associated with the seller real estate brokerage operations the brokerage operations including net cash generated by the brokerage operations from january,through september,in the amount of,as estimated by the seller which amount shall remain in the debtor account in its entirety until such time as the court adjudicates the rights of the seller and nsp thereto,or until further agreement of the parties,and any purchased assets described on schedules b,c,d and e hereto.
after the closing,the debtor retained the desks,computers,fixtures,independent contractor agreements,marketing materials,furniture and other equipment at the brokerage.pursuant to the stipulation,the debtor retained the real property in which the brokerage conducts business.
nsp moved for an order to compel the debtor to transfer the disputed funds.the debtor resisted,contending that the disputed funds were an asset of the brokerage which,under the terms of the stipulation,it was entitled to retain.it insisted that revenues kept in the operating account went to the debtor by implication under paragraph of the stipulation,which allowed the debtor to retain the real estate brokerage segment of the debtor business.nsp responded that the stipulation made no reference to retention by the debtor of any portion of the operating account,hence the disputed funds belonged to nsp.
a.the bankruptcy court first order 
the bankruptcy court agreed that the language of paragraph did not permit the debtor to retain any portion of the operating account,hence the disputed funds became the property of nsp.in its march,order on the case,the bankruptcy court analyzed paragraph of the stipulation and the bill of sale and concluded that the two documents could not be read to transfer or permit the debtor to retain any portion of the general operating account.paragraph of the stipulation reads 
the real estate brokerage segment of the debtor business,including all licenses and permits required to operate that segment of the business,shall be retained by the debtor.
the pertinent part of the subsequent bill of sale reads 
t he purchased assets conveyed to new seabury properties,llc shall specifically exclude i any assets being retained by new seabury company limited partnership pursuant to the stipulation relating to competing plans of reorganization,objections to confirmation,motion for reconsideration and motion for plan modification between new seabury properties,llc and new seabury company limited partnership,entered into on may,ii telephone number pending a further determination of the debtor right to retain that number and iii property,assets and rights,generated by or associated with the debtor real estate brokerage operations including net cash generated by the brokerage operations from january,through september,in the amount of,as estimated by the seller which amount shall remain in the debtor account in its entirety until such time as the court adjudicates the rights of the seller and nsp thereto,or until further agreement of the parties 
the bankruptcy court wrote 
the bill of sale dated september,provides in pertinent part as follows 
t he purchased assets conveyed to new seabury properties,llc shall specifically exclude iii property,assets and rights,generated by or associated with the debtor real estate brokerage operations from january,through september,in the amount of,as estimated by the seller which amount shall remain the debtor account in its entirety until such time as the court adjudicates the rights of the seller and nsp thereto,or until further agreement of the parties 
paragraph of the stipulation supra can not be read to transfer or to permit the debtor to retain any portion of the general operating account.
the bankruptcy court found that b ased on the language of the may stipulation and the bill of sale,the disputed funds are property of nsp and nsp is entitled to possession thereof.the debtor appealed to the district court from the bankruptcy court order.
b.the district court first order on appeal 
the district court,in its october,memorandum order,concurred with the bankruptcy court that the contract documents were unambiguous but read the contract language as mandating a different outcome from that reached by the bankruptcy judge.analogizing the situation to the construction of wills,the district court noted that 
c ourts have consistently concluded that a business can not be considered separately from the funds used to run it i see no reason to come to a contrary conclusion in respect of the brokerage operations here.its cash assets were part of the business and,as in any business,are necessary to keep it operating.
the district judge looked to the language in paragraph of the stipulation providing for retention of the brokerage segment of the business,including all licenses and the permits required to operate that segment,and found that the list was an inclusive,rather than exclusive matter.he stated that it was improbable that the licenses and permits were the only assets retained by the debtor and that the term brokerage operations itself indicates that at least those assets essential to running the operations should be retained by the debtor.he held that the cash assets of the brokerage were part of the business and were necessary to keep the business operating,but specifically did not reach the issue as to whether any of the funds in the operating a ccount were truly attributable to the brokerage.the district court order remanded the case and directed the bankruptcy court to determine the amount of cash in the general operating account which is attributable to the brokerage operations.
c.the bankruptcy court order on the first remand 
on remand,the bankruptcy court conducted a trial.it concluded first that the calculations of the amount in the fund were to begin on january.determination of the amount to which each of the parties was entitled required consideration of three elements the total amount of disputed funds the application of real estate credits given to parties who bought real estate through the brokerage and the application of certain other costs,which are discussed below.
in a pretrial stipulation in the bankruptcy court,entered into prior to the hearing on remand,the parties had agreed that the maximum amount of the disputed funds that the debtor could recover was the net revenue that the brokerage earned from january,until september,or,and that the amount inclusive of the credits and charges would be.
the debtor offered parties that purchased real estate through the brokerage a credit the credit or the credits.the purchasers of the property could apply the credit towards the initiation fee required of new members to join the new seabury country club the club.the recreation division ran the club.membership in the club enabled a member to use its facilities,including the golf courses.the amount of the credit was a percentage of the commission and could be applied towards the initiation fee for as long as the homeowner remained a property owner at new seabury resort.credits exercised during the relevant period totaled.
the real estate carrying costs the charges were costs associated with unsold property of the debtor such as landscaping costs,depreciation and condo fees.the unsold properties themselves were placed under control of the hotel division and used as short term rentals.the parties agreed in the pretrial stipulation that for the period of january,to september,the charges totaled.
the debtor historically maintained consolidated financial statements for all of its revenue producing entities,including new seabury real estate,sound realty,and the club.when homeowners utilized the credits and joined the club,the debtor recorded the total amount of the initiation fee,including the credit,as income to the resort division.the debtor recorded the amount of the credit as an expense to the real estate division at the time of its exercise.the charges were also treated as an expense of the brokerage.the bankruptcy court held that,treating the brokerage as a separate entity,the historic treatment of the credits and charges was inappropriate to its determination.it adopted testimony from expert witnesses as to applicable accounting principles and concluded that the recreation division would have recorded both the income and expense of the credit and,in essence,recorded the transaction as a reduced price sale,and that the charges were properly attributable to the hotel division for the charges bore no relationship to the brokerage.the bankruptcy court ultimately concluded that the debtor was entitled to the entire of the disputed funds.
a second appeal to the district court followed.
d.the district court second order and remand 
in its march,memorandum order,the district court reaffirmed its earlier ruling that cash in the operating account attributable to the brokerage operation formed a part of the brokerage segment of debtor business which the debtor was allowed to retain under the stipulation.however,it was unsatisfied with the accounting rationale accepted by the bankruptcy court based upon a methodology not historically followed in the debtor own consolidated financial statements.accordingly,it remanded for recalculation of the sums applicable to the brokerage segment,the recalculation to be based on the original accounting methodology,see supra.the court suggested this would lead the parties to the figure earlier stipulated to in the bankruptcy court or to,the net income of the real estate division reflected in earlier accounting statements.
in once again grappling with the case,the district court also noted its own dissatisfaction with its earlier rationale for concluding that cash traceable to real estate brokerage operations should be treated as a part of the retained assets to which the debtor was entitled.the district court wrote 
further reflection has persuaded me that this case law,that resting on testamentary dispositions of businesses is not fully sufficient to support my earlier conclusion.wills involve different modes of construction than arm length commercial transactions,let alone settlements in bankruptcy proceedings,because the relationships between the parties,the ultimate goals of the instruments,and the interpretive goals of the court differ in sum,courts are likely to construe a bequest generously,because the testator manifestly sought to give something of value to a worthy beneficiary,and because any verbal missteps in the will are neither the beneficiary fault,nor errors against which the beneficiary could have protected himself a chapter bankrupt can not fairly claim the benefits of this analogy it is,after all,not a deserving child inheriting the family business,but rather an insolvent permitted to remain in business for the benefit of creditors.nevertheless,the bankruptcy court should treat the writings surrounding a reorganization with an eye toward the equities of reorganization.
the district court went on to affirm its conclusion that the term business in the stipulation necessarily included cash by reference to other modes of analysis,including contract interpretation,but noted that it was essentially performing a functional analysis of the parties arrangement.
while it acknowledged that the relevant documents did not explicitly mention cash as among the assets to be retained by the debtor and that a reading of the stipulation that excludes cash might be consistent with the absence of a negotiated cash valuation method,and the bankruptcy context in which the primary goal is to pay back the debtor creditors,the district court nonetheless concluded that the loss should lie with nsp,because it was in a better position to protect its interests by writing more detailed contractual language,and because its theory of the limits of a business does not lead to a coherent resolution.the court additionally noted that 
t he general rubrics for construction of analogous writings do not provide a full answer to the question.nor does general business practice.a business may be conveyed in a variety of assets,all assets except cash,all nonliquid assets,goodwill and intellectual and real property only,goodwill only,and so therefore the answer must necessarily turn on the degree that any default position has been refined.in this context,the debtor draws a simple and coherent line a business includes all its assets unless stated otherwise.nsp,having asserted that the line actually falls somewhere inside the set of business assets,must provide a logical place in which to draw it,but has not done so.
on the issue of the proper way to account for the cash it found debtor was entitled to retain,the district court noted that while historically,the debtor had recorded the initiation fee at the country club as income to the recreation division,it had recorded the amount of the credit as a loss to the real estate division.in august,after the stipulation had been executed and the plan had been confirmed,the debtor principal,christopher burden,told his accountant to rework the figures for the real estate operations.the new accounting treated initiation fee credits as losses to the recreation division,not the real estate division.the effect of this new accounting system was to increase the net income of the real estate division on the consolidated financial statements.
the district court concluded that,under its new analysis based on the parties intent to form a contract,it was only permissible for nsp to be found to have assented to the terms of the bargain it could reasonably foresee.the district court observed that nsp could not have foreseen the debtor change in accounting methodology it is one thing for a court to hold nsp to the reasonably foreseeable consequences of its bargain with the debtor it is quite another for the court to hold nsp to terms that could not possibly have been on the table.the district court thus vacated the bankruptcy court calculation of the cash attributable to the debtor and remanded for a recalculation under the original accounting methodology.
the district court concluded 
if by march,the parties are unable to agree upon a stipulated figure,i will remand to the bankruptcy court to determine the amount of cash attributable to the brokerage,using,january,as a start date,but applying the accounting methodologies employed by the debtor on the date the plan was confirmed.footnote the parties shall file a status report by no later than march,regarding the issues to be resolved.in all other respects,the decision of the bankruptcy court is affirmed.
in the cited footnote,the district court stated 
i assume that the parties or the bankruptcy court will naturally gravitate towards either the figure in the parties joint pretrial stipulation,or,the net income of the real estate division reflected on debtor financial statements,which treated both the real estate credits and the carrying costs as losses to the real estate division.however,the parties and,if necessary,the bankruptcy court are free to determine the appropriate number under the former methodology based on an independent review of the financial data.if the parties are unable to agree,the bankruptcy court may,but need not,receive new evidence beyond what has already been presented to it.
the parties status report indicated that 
in light of footnote of the memorandum and order,nsp offered to stipulate to the figure in the parties join pretrial stipulation.debtor responded that there was no figure within the range described in footnote of the memorandum and order to which it would stipulate.debtor did not provide a figure to which it was willing to stipulate.
e.the bankruptcy court order on second remand 
on remand,the bankruptcy court,mechanically applying the accounting principles historically used by debtor,held that the debtor was entitled to of the disputed funds.the district court affirmed that order,and both parties appealed to this court.
discussion 
nsp in its argues that the district court erred in reversing the bankruptcy court initial ruling that the debtor was not entitled to any portion of the operating account,hence could receive no part of the disputed funds.understandably,the debtor sees no virtue in the initial bankruptcy court rejection of its claim to funds in the operating account,and asks us to uphold its retention of as found by the bankruptcy court on the first remand.the debtor urges that the district court later erred both in altering its own analysis after the first remand to limit recovery to the debtor historic accounting principles and in suggesting the much lower range of totals from which the bankruptcy court was to choose.
nsp responds that if we find the debtor is owed some portion of the cash in the operating account,it should be the lowest possible amount.
while the issue is somewhat close,we incline towards the bankruptcy court original finding denying to the debtor retention of any of the funds in the operating account.the plain language of the stipulation and the fact that this transaction occurred in the context of a bankruptcy,not a traditional commercial sale,among other reasons,support this conclusion.accordingly,we hold that the debtor is not entitled to receive any portion of the disputed funds.
standard of review 
the bankruptcy and district courts rulings regarding the debtor entitlement under the stipulation to the funds in the operating account are matters of law reviewed de novo,and any findings of fact made by the bankruptcy court are reviewed for clear error.in re laroche,cir.this court cede s no special deference to the district court initial review in examining a bankruptcy court decision on appeal.in re merrimac paper harrison,cir quoting in re bank of new engl,cir.rather,we review directly the bankruptcy court determination.id.
b.why the debtor may not retain cash from the operating account 
preliminary to the issue of how much money might have been due the debtor is whether the debtor is due any money at all.as noted,nsp now argues that the district court erred both in its order when,using testamentary bequest analysis,it reversed the bankruptcy court initial conclusion that the contract documents between the parties could not be read to leave any money from the operating account in the hands of the debtor,and again in when it reaffirmed its theory underlying its order but applied a functional analysis which concluded that nsp was more capable of looking out for its interests than was the debtor and thus was required to bear the loss.nsp argues that the district court approach ignores the standard principles of contract interpretation.
the debtor,of course,agrees with the district court reversal of the bankruptcy court original ruling but not with its revised order regarding accounting.for the reasons explained below,we agree with the bankruptcy court that,under the language of the stipulation and accompanying documents,the debtor is not entitled to any of the cash in the operating account.
a plan of reorganization is a binding contract between the debtor and the creditors and is subject to the general rules of contract construction and interpretation.see in re sergi,cir.likewise,stipulations entered into between parties are treated as contractual and are subject to the principles of contract interpretation.gomez rodriguez,cir ti fed l credit union delbonis,cir.
there were four documents related to the ownership of the funds in the operating account nsp plan,the stipulation,the confirmation order,and the bill of sale.as set forth in nsp plan as affirmed in the confirmation order,
on the effective date the debtor shall close the sale event by conveying to nsp all of the debtor right,title and interest in and to the purchased assets exclusive of the assets to be left with the debtor under the stipulation.
nsp plan also provided that n sp shall have the right not to take title to any asset the language in the plan and confirmation order indicates that any right the debtor has to any assets would be determined by reference to the stipulation.
in support of the initial ruling of the bankruptcy court rejecting the debtor claim to cash,nsp argues that the stipulation itself makes no provision for the debtor to retain any portion of the operating account.it is true,as the debtor emphasizes,that paragraph of the stipulation reads 
the real estate brokerage segment of the debtor business,including all licenses and permits required to operate that segment of the business,shall be retained by the debtor.
however,the paragraphs immediately following describe in considerable detail what assets within the real estate brokerage segment,beyond licenses and permits required to operate that segment,are to be retained by the nowhere,either in paragraph itself or thereafter,is reference made to any cash in the operating account.paragraphs and read as follows 
nsp and the debtor shall,on the effective date of the nsp plan,execute an agreement in a form reasonably acceptable to nsp and the debtor,binding on each parties successors and assigns,containing the following provisions,and failing the execution of such agreement the provisions as set forth herein shall constitute such agreement 
a.the debtor,a c great island,and christopher burden shall have and retain,or receive for nominal consideration,a license to use the registered trade name new seabury in connection with real estate brokerage operations conducted by one or more of them,which license shall continue for as long as christopher burden or any member of his family maintain a majority ownership interest in or is involved in daily operations of such business.the license shall include a license to use the new seabury name in marketing material.
b.the brokerage operations will have access to all resort amenities and may include pictures and information regarding the resort amenities in its marketing and other material for viewing and touring.christopher and nancy burden will be afforded full membership rights in the new seabury club at no cost for as long as burden has a majority ownership interest in or participates in daily operations of the brokerage operations,or for as long as either burden or burden reside at new seabury.
c.the brokerage operations will have the right to place reasonable temporary signage open house signs and permanent signage relating to real estate service operations on nsp new seabury related property.the permanent signage shall be where presently located and shall be in its present form,or in a form reasonably acceptable to the debtor and nsp,provided however,that nsp may change the permanent signage so long as such signage is of equal visibility.
real property on which the real estate service operations are conducted,including and limited to,the main new seabury real estate office and the adjacent parking facilities,the popponessett real estate parcel as identified in the debtor plan and the parcel at the mashpee rotary on routes and referred to as the sound realty parcel shall be retained by the debtor.the debtor shall,on and for a period following the effective date,afford nsp use of three desks at the sound realty location.nsp may,at its sole option and expense,install its own phone lines and place its own reasonable office equipment,including a facsimile and copy machine in the sound realty property for as long as it has the right to utilize that property.except as provided herein,the properties retained by the debtor shall be free and clear of all liens,encumbrances,claims and interests.nsp shall have no obligation to the debtor,burden,or any affiliates with respect to the sound realty parcel,the new seabury real estate office,or the popponessett real estate parcel,including,without limitation,the note held by christopher burden in the original principal,except for the existing mortgage lien on the popponnessett real estate parcel,which mortgage will be paid in accordance with the nsp plan.
as noted,the stipulation makes no reference to the retention by debtor of any portion of the cash held in the debtor operating account.the real estate division maintained no bank account of its own.all the cash attributable to the three operating divisions was held in the debtor single operating account,where they were commingled.one would expect,if the parties to the stipulation had intended the debtor to retain up to from the commingled operating account,that they would have said so.especially would this be expected in a stipulation settling a bankruptcy which specifies in detail the other real estate brok
