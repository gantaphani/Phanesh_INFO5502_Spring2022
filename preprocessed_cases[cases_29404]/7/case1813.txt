discussion 
liens for real property tax delinquent penalties 
california property tax statute requires that property taxes be paid by november,and if they have not been paid by december,thereafter a delinquent penalty of ten percent attaches to them.cal.tax code.the property tax delinquent penalties are subject to statutory liens.id.the fdic argues that as receiver it is not liable for liens on the real property securing property tax delinquent penalties.
the resolution of this issue hinges on our interpretation of b.in construing a statute,we first consider its text.when the statute language is plain,the sole function of the least where the disposition required by the text is not to enforce it according to its terms.united states v.one toyota land cruiser,cir quotations and alteration omitted.section b provides 
b other exemptions 
when acting as a receiver,the following provisions shall apply with respect to the corporation the fdic 
the corporation,including its franchise,its capital,reserves,and surplus,and its income,shall be exempt from all taxation imposed by any state,county,municipality,or local taxing authority,except that any real property of the corporation shall be subject to state territorial,county,municipal,or local taxation to the same extent according to its value as other real property is taxed,except that,notwithstanding the failure of any person to challenge an assessment under state law of such property value,such value,and the tax thereon,shall be determined as of the period for which such tax is imposed.
no property of the corporation shall be subject to levy,attachment,garnishment,foreclosure,or sale without the consent of the corporation,nor shall any involuntary lien attach to the property of the corporation.
the corporation shall not be liable for any amounts in the nature of penalties or fines,including those arising from the failure of any person to pay any real property,personal property,probate,or recording tax or any recording or filing fees when due.
emphases added.
the fdic points out that the statute provides in b that it is exempt from involuntary liens on the property of the corporation,and in b that it is exempt from penalties for the failure of others to pay property taxes.therefore,the fdic argues,it is exempt from paying liens based on delinquent property taxes,even if those liens arose before it was appointed as receiver for the burdened properties.
the fifth circuit has rejected this analysis.in irving indep.sch.dist.packard,cir,the fdic acquired property with preexisting liens securing unpaid real property taxes and penalties.when the fdic refused to pay the liens,the local school district and suit against the fdic and won in district court.irving dealt with the same issue we face in this case does b require the extinction of liens securing penalties for the nonpayment of property taxes on real property that the fdic later acquires as receiver id.at.
the fifth circuit concluded that the liens survived,relying on the plain language of the statute.because b states when the fdic is acting as receiver,the following provisions shall apply emphasis added,the statute provision nor shall any involuntary lien attach to the property of the corporation is prospective congress used the future tense to exclude only those liens that would otherwise attach after the fdic acquired a property l iens may not attach to that property while the fdic owns it,but a property previously encumbered must remain so.at.
the irving court then turned to subsection b,which states that the fdic shall not be liable for any amounts in the nature of penalties or fines,including those arising from the failure of any person to pay any real property tax.the fdic argued as it does here that allowing the liens based on the penalties violates subsection b by imposing on the fdic an amount in the nature of penalties.the fifth circuit concluded that allowing the liens to survive did not effect the imposition of a penalty on the fdic,because the fdic would have been perfectly aware of those preexisting liens already attached to the property when it took it over.congress chose to leave property acquired by the fdic in the same condition as the fdic found it the fdic is protected from the disadvantages attendant upon its role,but the nature of the assets the fdic receives from the institution remains unchanged.irving,at quotations and alteration omitted see first state metroplex petroleum,cir the key to our holding in irving was that allowing future enforcement of the liens did not constitute a deprivation of the fdic property.
the seventh circuit followed irving,adopting its result and its reasoning based on the plain language of the statute.see rtc commercial assets trust phoenix bond indem,cir.
the fdic urges us to adopt a different interpretation of the statute language,arguing that when acting as a receiver is not a temporal limitation meaning during the period when the fdic is the receiver,but instead simply establishes the context within which b applies.but congress chose the temporal word when,and we must interpret the language as it is written,giv ing effect,if possible,to every clause and word of a statute.williams taylor,d quotations omitted 
we also note that subsection b provides nor shall any involuntary lien attach to the property of the corporation emphasis added.that language plain meaning is that once the property belongs to the fdic,that is,when the fdic acts as receiver,no liens shall attach.the statute does not,however,provide for extinguishing liens that attached when the property was not the fdic.under the plain terms of the statute subsections,the fdic is not exempt from liens that attached before the subject real property became the property of the corporation.see branch indep.sch.dist.fdic,aff.in irving.
the fdic argues that we should interpret b and b the same way that the supreme court interpreted a pair of former bankruptcy statutes some forty years ago.in simonson granquist,d,the question was whether the federal government could recover federal tax penalties that were perfected liens against the estate of a bankrupt.section of the bankruptcy act then read,debts owing to the united states as a penalty or forfeiture shall not be allowed section,however,stated that statutory liens for taxes and debts owing to the united states may be valid against the trustee the government argued that should be read to apply only to unsecured penalty claims,referring to the general purpose and structure of the bankruptcy act.the court disagreed,stating that the language its
