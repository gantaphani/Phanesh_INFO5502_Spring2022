ernesto mutuc appeals his conviction and resulting sentence for having committed bankruptcy fraud.he argues ineffective assistance of counsel,failure to properly instruct the jury,and an erroneous sentence calculation.we affirm mutuc conviction and sentence.
background 
in,mutuc marriage ended in divorce.under the divorce decree,mutuc former wife,julie kanealy,received alimony,child support,the marital domicile,and the funds within mutuc k.the k funds,approximately as of may,were to be used in paying the marital debts.kanealy failed to pay the creditors.
the divorce proceedings also provided for reciprocal releases and indemnity agreements for the spousal debts occurring after october.nevertheless,in james pritikin,kanealy divorce attorney,obtained a judgment for attorney fees against mutuc for.shortly thereafter,mutuc filed for bankruptcy,represented by attorney george jonscher.
mutuc,through jonscher,filed a chapter bankruptcy petition in the northern district of illinois on april.mutuc stated that his total secured debt amounted to,his monthly income was,and his monthly expenses were.more importantly,mutuc claimed that he owned no real estate,had a limited number of stock options from his former employer,and had a checking account with bank with a balance of zero.he also claimed his money market account at northern trust was closed in november of when he gave the final balance of to his sister.
essentially,mutuc claimed that he had no assets or money to satisfy debts that equaled approximately.the bankruptcy court granted mutuc a discharge of his debts.it later became apparent that much of this information was false.
mutuc stated reason for filing for bankruptcy was to force his to pay the marital debts.in doing so,he badly misrepresented his net worth.the facts show,among other things,that mutuc concealed various bank accounts and stock options,that he concealed his ownership of real property and failed to disclose the transaction in which he obtained the property,and that he misrepresented his gross income.many of these false statements were made in documents filed in the bankruptcy court and others given orally while under oath.
at some point during an august,deposition regarding the dischargeability of pritikin attorney fees,mutuc admitted to being the true owner of the real property mentioned above.pritikin then informed the office of the united states attorney that mutuc had committed bankruptcy fraud.
the government charged mutuc with one count of filing a bankruptcy petition in furtherance of a scheme to defraud,two counts of making false statements,under penalty of perjury,and one count of making a false oath or account in a bankruptcy case.after a six day jury trial,mutuc was found guilty as charged and sentenced to twenty three months imprisonment,three years supervised release,and fined.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
ineffective assistance of counsel 
mutuc takes issue with the representation he received during the divorce proceedings and bankruptcy proceedings,by attorney jonscher,and the criminal trial,by attorney james fennerty.
in an attempt to show ineffective assistance of counsel,mutuc points to jonscher representation during the bankruptcy proceedings.jonscher was not mutuc attorney for the criminal proceedings and there is no constitutional right to a competent attorney in civil proceedings.
mutuc also argues that fennerty,his trial counsel,was ineffective that fennerty weak grasp of bankruptcy law made him incompetent to deal with the issues in the criminal case.specifically,he points to fennerty examination of jonscher,his failure to secure a particular jury instruction,his poor relationship with mutuc,and his failure to file motions in limine or to object to certain evidence introduced by the government as demonstrations of incompetency.
mutuc claims that fennerty examination of jonscher was lacking and that he was incompetent to deal with the various bankruptcy issues involved in the criminal case.on the contrary,fennerty examination elicited responses that tended to show that jonscher either was intimately familiar,or should have been intimately familiar,with mutuc assets.he brought out the fact that jonscher was not a regular bankruptcy attorney and that he filed only a few bankruptcy cases a year.he brought out that jonscher was aware of certain assets in which mutuc had an interest that were not mentioned in the bankruptcy proceedings.finally,he noted that jonscher was receiving only a small fee for his work related to the bankruptcy proceedings.in short,fennerty examination of jonscher supported the defense theory of the case.the examination arguably centered on showing jonscher failure to properly guide mutuc,a reasonable trial strategy when taken as support for mutuc argument that he relied on the advice of jonscher when filing for bankruptcy.the examination did not fall below the objective standard of reasonableness as set out in strickland.strickland washington,d.
as to fennerty failure to obtain the good faith jury instruction,a defendant is not entitled to a specific good faith instruction so long as,considering the instructions as a whole,the jury was adequately instructed upon his theory of defense.united states given,cir.here,the jury had to find that mutuc had an intent to defraud.it is that one with an intent to defraud does not act in good faith.
the irreconcilable differences between mutuc and fennerty do not support a finding of ineffective assistance of counsel.the sixth amendment does not guarantee a friendly and happy relationship.morris slappy,d.the fact that fennerty and mutuc did not get along does not translate into an inability of fennerty to zealously defend his client it does not mean that the objectives of representation could not be fulfilled.br.of at.mutual admiration societies are not constitutional guarantees and conclusory statements that fennerty took a dive shows antagonism toward the lawyer but,without more,does not show antagonism from the lawyer toward the client.
mutuc also points to his trial counsel failure to file motions in limine in order to bar the introduction of what he claims was expert testimony as further examples of ineffective assistance of trial counsel.assuming arguendo that the evidence was expert testimony,the claim still fails to meet the prejudice prong of strickland.
it is clear that,if required,the two witnesses would have been qualified as experts in their fields under federal rule of evidence.the first witness merely explained a business record generated by her department at the defendant former place of employment.the second witness,pritikin,an experienced divorce attorney,essentially explained the nuances of divorce proceedings.the evidence was relevant and not overly prejudicial.therefore,filing a motion to exclude such expert testimony would have been fruitless.
moreover,the tenth circuit has said c onsidering that a motion in limine is sought to aid counsel in formulating his trial strategy,the decision regarding whether to file such a motion is clearly part of the process of establishing trial strategy.jones stotts,cir.because there is a strong presumption that strategy decisions are sound and mutuc offers nothing to overcome this presumption,his argument fails the performance prong of strickland as well.strickland,at.
finally,mutuc argues that trial counsel should have objected to witness pritikin testimony regarding divorce fraud.the simple fact is that he did object and the objection was sustained.
in summary,none of the arguments forwarded by mutuc warrant any remedy.as explained in detail by the above discussion,the defendant right to effective assistance of counsel was not violated.
failure to properly instruct the jury 
mutuc claims that the trial court erred by refusing to instruct the jury on good faith.as the government correctly asserts,it is unclear whether the defendant takes issue with a failure to give the tendered instruction,the cheek instruction,or a reliance on instruction.nevertheless,defendant was not entitled to any of them.
a district court refusal to give a tendered theory of defense jury instruction is reviewe
