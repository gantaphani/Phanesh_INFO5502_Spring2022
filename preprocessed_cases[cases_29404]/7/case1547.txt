appellant rowe sanderson iii appeals from the district court judgment affirming the bankruptcy court order granting appellees hank and dolly willmses motion for an extension of time to file a nondischargeability complaint.we conclude that under our existing case law the bankruptcy court erred in two ways by sua sponte extending the time for the willmses to file a nondischargeability complaint after the deadline had already passed and by doing so without either a showing or a finding of cause.therefore,we reverse the district court and remand with instructions to dismiss.
the material facts underlying the parties dispute are straightforward.rowe sanderson company sci was experiencing a cash flow problem.it had a promissory note for million from la pine village,llc lpv that was secured by a deed of trust to real property in oregon.sanderson expected to receive full repayment on the lpv note in two months but in the meantime needed operating capital for sci.
hank and dolly willms agreed to provide bridge financing.they loaned to sci,in exchange for which sci executed a note agreeing to repay that amount plus interest within six days after the lpv payment was due.sci granted the willmses an interest in the lpv note as security and,sometime later,delivered it to them.lpv did not repay its debt to sci on time.consequently,sci could not repay the willmses by the agreed date 
approximately nine months after the payments on the lpv and sci notes were originally due,lpv repaid to sci.on the same day,sci paid the willmses,an amount that,according to sanderson,represented the principal and remaining interest due on sci note.
the willmses did not agree that sanderson payment should be applied to the debt on the sci note and refused to return the lpv note,which they held as collateral.sanderson,meanwhile,desiring to close the lpv transaction,attempted to induce the title company to release the funds from escrow and reconvey the deed of trust to lpv.to that end,he signed a letter of indemnity in which he claimed that sci had lost,misplaced,or destroyed the lpv note,despite knowing that the note remained in the willmses possession.
sanderson filed a voluntary chapter petition seeking personal bankruptcy protection in october.the meeting of creditors was first set in december.on february,the last possible day the willmses moved to extend the deadline for filing either a complaint objecting to the petition discharge or a motion to dismiss.
the bankruptcy court held a hearing on the willmses motion ten days later.at the hearing,the bankruptcy court denied all of the relief requested in the willmses motion.after hearing the willmses allegations,the bankruptcy court opined that the willmses may have a fairly straightforward a a claim objecting to dischargeability the bankruptcy court then sua sponte extended the time for the willmses to file such a complaint.the willmses never requested this relief and,by all appearances,never even considered this strategy the willmses original request for an extension referenced b only.nonetheless,they adopted the bankruptcy court suggestion and filed a nondischargeability complaint within the extended time period set by the court.
the willmses objected to the dischargeability of the debt owed under the sci note from sanderson bankruptcy estate.overlooking the legal distinction between sanderson and sci,the willmses claimed that sanderson was personally liable on the sci note.although they acknowledged receiving sci payment,they contended that it applied to sanderson other debts to them.they sought to have the debt on the sci note declared nondischargeable under a a on the ground that sanderson had obtained the loan fraudulently.
at the conclusion of a bench trial,the bankruptcy court found in favor of the willmses.in an oral ruling,the bankruptcy court declared sci debt to be nondischargeable on the basis that sanderson failed to prove that he had repaid the debt from the lpv loan proceeds.sanderson moved for relief from this ruling,presenting documentary evidence for the first time that he had repaid the willmses immediately after receiving lpv payment.the bankruptcy court accepted this evidence,reversed its initial decision,and entered a judgment of dismissal.
the willmses appealed the bankruptcy court judgment to the district court,arguing that the bankruptcy court had abused its discretion by allowing sanderson to present new evidence after trial.sanderson on the ground that the willmses should not have been allowed to file their adversary proceeding at all.sanderson asserted that the willmses failed to request a time extension to file a nondischargeability complaint and the bankruptcy court decided to do so only after the deadline had passed.in addition,sanderson argued that the willmses had failed to show cause for needing more time.
the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court sua sponte time extension but reversed its decision to consider sanderson evidence.accordingly,the district court instructed the bankruptcy court to enter judgment reinstating its initial oral findings in favor of the willmses.sanderson now appeals both of the district court rulings

we can not endorse the bankruptcy court approach for a number of reasons.first,the court recommended a specific legal course of action for the willmses to pursue.o ur adversary system is designed around the premise that the parties know what is best for them,and are responsible for advancing the facts and arguments entitling them to relief.greenlaw united states,d quoting castro united states,d internal quotation marks omitted.
the bankruptcy court also sidestepped sanderson due process right to notice and meaningful opportunity to respond.see griffin wardrobe in re wardrobe,cir w hile a bankruptcy court has equitable judicial power,its power is confined by ordinary standards of notice and opportunity to be heard.sanderson was denied that right when the court suggested that the willmses proceed on a completely new theory of relief and without input from sanderson extended their time to do so.
finally,there are limited circumstances in which a bankruptcy court can sua sponte extend the deadline to file a nondischargeability complaint after the deadline has passed,and this case was not among them.moreover,even when presented with a timely motion,a bankruptcy court errs by granting it without cause.see fed.c setting strict day deadline for filing complaint alleging a a claim and providing that,after a hearing,the court may for cause extend the deadline.
