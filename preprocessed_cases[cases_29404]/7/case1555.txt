this case requires us to determine whether a mortgage company violated hawaii state law when it did not publicly announce the postponement of a foreclosure sale of property owned by appellant margery kanamu kalehuanani kekauoha alisa,and if so,to ascertain the proper remedy for that violation.a federal bankruptcy court held that appellees failure publicly to announce the foreclosure violated the requirements of hawaii nonjudicial foreclosure procedure under hawaii revised statute hrs,as well as its consumer protection law,hrs.the court voided the sale of the appellant property and awarded her treble damages of under hrs for violation of the consumer protection statute.the bankruptcy appellate panel reversed,ruling that the mortgagee actions did not violate state law.
we hold that the lack of public announcement did violate hawaii nonjudicial foreclosure statute,and this defect was a deceptive practice under state law.accordingly,we affirm the bankruptcy court avoidance of the foreclosure sale.however,we remand to the bankruptcy court for a proper calculation of attorneys fees and damages under hrs.
i background 
in,margery kanamu kalehuanani kekauoha alisa debtor refinanced a mortgage on her property on hawaii island and executed a promissory note to ameriquest mortgage company in the amount of.debtor defaulted on her loan eight times,causing ameriquest to initiate foreclosure proceedings in early.on april,ameriquest assigned its interest in the mortgage to wm speciality mortgage llc,which later became jpmc mortgage,the named party in this action.the assignment notwithstanding,ameriquest continued to service debtor mortgage hereafter,ameriquest and jpmc mortgage are referred to collectively as lenders.a foreclosure sale was scheduled for may.
on may,three days before the scheduled foreclosure sale,debtor filed for chapter bankruptcy,triggering an automatic stay of the sale.to comply with the stay,a law firm employed by lenders postponed the scheduled foreclosure sale.hrs authorizes a foreclosure sale to be postponed from time to time by public announcement made by the mortgagee or by a person acting on the mortgagee behalf.the law firm properly announced the postponement of the sale three times from may,until september.
on september,the law firm attempted to postpone the sale yet again,a fourth and final time.the auction was scheduled to occur at noon at a flagpole located in front of hale halewai,a local community center.the firm delegated the task to a legal secretary who had never before postponed a foreclosure sale.the secretary arrived ten or fifteen minutes before noon.rather than shouting out the postponement to all those present,the secretary asked several of the people present if they were interested in debtor property.everyone she spoke to said they were not.she did not attempt to speak to those individuals who appeared to be there for another auction that was occurring at the same time,and she did not speak to everyone in the area.she did not tell those she spoke with that the auction was postponed to december.the secretary stayed at the flagpole until approximately pm,after the other auction had finished and the area was deserted.she left without ever announcing or posting the information that the sale of debtor property had been postponed.
on november,lenders moved for relief from the stay to allow them to proceed on the foreclosure sale.on november,after debtor failed to respond,the bankruptcy court granted lenders motion.the foreclosure sale took place on december.the successful and only bid was a credit bid made by the auctioneer on behalf of lenders.a quitclaim deed to the property was recorded on december.lenders initiated an ejectment action in state court in january.lenders obtained a judgment in their favor on april,which debtor appealed.that appeal is still pending in state court apparently waiting for our decision.
on april,debtor filed a complaint in the bankruptcy court,alleging,inter alia,that the sale had violated the automatic stay,breached the terms of the mortgage contract,constituted an unfair and deceptive trade practice under hrs,violated various requirements of nonjudicial foreclosure procedure under hrs,and constituted a fraudulent transfer under hrs.the bankruptcy court dismissed on summary judgment debtor claims alleging a violation of the stay and fraudulent transfer.
after a bench trial on the remaining claims,the bankruptcy court issued amended findings of fact and conclusions of law.the court concluded that lenders failure to publicly pronounce the postponement of the foreclosure sale on september,violated the public announcement requirement of hrs as well as the terms of the mortgage contract.contrary to debtor assertion on appeal,the court found only a single violation of hrs.as a remedy,the court voided the foreclosure sale.the court held that the improper postponement was also a breach of the mortgage contract,because the contract required that lenders comply with state law in any foreclosure proceeding.
in addition,the court ruled that the improper postponement was an unfair and deceptive trade practice under hrs.it awarded debtor treble damages,under hrs,for damages sustained as a result of the violation of,calculating the damages sustained as debtor lost equity in her house,the rental value of the house for the time during which she lost possession of it,and the attorneys fees debtor expended defending against the state court ejectment action.the total money judgment was.
finally,the court awarded debtor additional attorneys fees under two hawaii statutes hrs,allowing fees for the prevailing party in contract claims,and hrs b,allowing fees for the party establishing a violation of hrs.the court allocated attorneys fees equally between the contract claim and the hrs claim.because hrs limits attorneys fees to percent of the judgment on a contract claim,the court allowed recovery of only for that portion of the attorneys fees claim,a sum which it arrived at by calculating percent of the value of debtor equity in the mortgaged property.
lenders appealed the bankruptcy court decision to the bankruptcy appellate panel bap,challenging both the bankruptcy court findings of liability and its calculation of damages and attorneys fees.debtor,challenging only the bankruptcy court ruling that attorneys fees under hrs should be limited to percent of the value of debtor equity in the foreclosed property.
the bap reversed the bankruptcy court on its findings of liability,holding that lenders actions met the public announcement requirement of hrs,did not breach the mortgage contract,and did not constitute an unfair or deceptive practice under hrs.because it found in favor of lenders on the liability issues,the bap did not reach the parties challenges to damages and attorneys fees.debtor now appeals the decision of the bap.

iii analysis 
hawaii revised statute 
hrs authorizes a foreclosure sale to be postponed from time to time by public announcement made by the mortgagee or by a person acting on the mortgagee behalf.in this case,we must first address whether the secretary actions on september constituted a public announcement under the meaning of hawaii law.when interpreting state law,we are bound by the decision of the highest state court.sec.pac.bank kirkland in re kirkland,cir.absent a controlling state court decision,our duty is to predict how the highest state court would decide the issue.id.at.
neither hrs nor hawaii case law defines the term public announcement.therefore,we apply hawaii rules of statutory construction to interpret the term.hawaii courts follow certain principles of statutory construction.haw.gov t emps.ass n,afscme local,afl cio lingle,haw.under those principles,where the statutory language is plain and unambiguous,our sole duty is to give effect to its plain and obvious meaning.id.quoting awakuni awana,haw.if there is ambiguity,we may consider context and legislative purpose to determine the meaning of the word or phrase.id.at.
applying these principles,it is clear that any reasonable meaning of public announcement does not encompass lenders actions in this instance.the bankruptcy court turned to the dictionary,noting that merriam websters defines announce as to make known publicly proclaim and announcement as public notification or declaration.no party suggests a different definition,and this interpretation captures the essence of what the statute requires mortgagees shall publicly announce the postponement of a foreclosure sale to a subsequent date.
in this case,the secretary engaged in several conversations with individuals whom,based on the secretary judgment,appeared as if they might have been present because they were interested in the foreclosure of debtor property.even in these conversations,the secretary did not communicate that the sale had been postponed.the secretary did not,in private conversation or otherwise,announce that the debtor property would be sold on december.the bankruptcy court conclusion,based on these facts,was that the secretary never made an open,oral announcement to all those present of the date and time to which the auction was being postponed and she did not post or display such an announcement in written form.lenders do not dispute this finding of fact,and it suffices to establish under the plain meaning of hrs that there was no public announcement of a postponement.
the bap acknowledged that i t is undisputed that the secretary did not make a public announcement within its commonly understood or dictionary meaning.nonetheless,it reasoned that the phrase must be given a fair and reasonable construction and interpreted in light of the purpose of the statute.the bap concluded that the requirements of the statute could be met by any mode of communication that reasonably achieves the spirit and purpose of the public announcement requirement,which they reasoned was to inform those who appeared at a foreclosure sale that it has been postponed.
the bap erred in relying on statutory context and purpose to introduce ambiguity into the meaning of public announcement because,as it acknowledged,the meaning of the phrase is plain on its face.see ross stouffer hotel,haw w here the terms of a statute are plain,unambiguous and explicit,we are not at liberty to look beyond that language for a different meaning.however,even if use of these tools of statutory interpretation were appropriate,we would not find the bap conclusion persuasive.hawaii nonjudicial foreclosure statute affords mortgagees a quick and inexpensive alternative to judicial foreclosure but balances that accommodation by mandating compliance with minimal procedural requirements to protect mortgagors interest in their property.lee hsbc bank usa,haw.that statutory balance would be upset if mortgagees could dispense with those procedures they perceive as futile,or substitute procedures they believe achieve the spirit and purpose of the law.a reviewing court would frequently have no evidence of the adequacy of those substitute procedures other than the testimony of the mortgagee agent.in this case,for instance,the bankruptcy court would be required to rely on the rough assessment of a legal secretary undertaking her first foreclosure postponement that none of the individuals present was interested in debtor property.moreover,the secretary admitted she had signed a declaration stating that she had publicly announced the postponement when she knew she had not made a public announcement.we reject an approach that would force a trial court to rely upon evidence of this sort,and hold that lenders actions violated the plain meaning of public announcement in hrs.
we turn to the question of the proper remedy for lenders violation of hrs.hawaii law does not specify a remedy.the bankruptcy court,based on its reading of silva lopez,haw,wl,ruled that improper postponement required voiding the subsequent foreclosure sale.the bap,on the other hand,believed that silva does not provide controlling precedent,and reasoned that the hawaii supreme court would have to look to other jurisdictions to decide the issue.relying on the trend in the majority of states,the bap concluded that the hawaii supreme court would draw a distinction between technical violations of foreclosure procedures which do not prejudice a mortgagor and substantive violations which do.the bap held that a foreclosure sale should be voided only when a procedural violation is significant,material,causes prejudice or otherwise contributes to the inadequacy of the price or other injury.the bap concluded in this instance that debtor had shown no prejudice from the foreclosure and was not entitled to any relief.
with all respect to the bap,we agree with the bankruptcy court that hawaii precedent is clear and controlling.mortgagee violation of the nonjudicial foreclosure requirements of hrs,whether those violations are grievously prejudicial or merely technical,voids a subsequent foreclosure sale.id.at.in silva,the hawaii supreme court voided a mortgage sale of real estate and livestock because the mortgagee did not comply with the conditions of the power of sale set out in the mortgage contract.id.the silva mortgagee erred by scheduling the foreclosure sale one day too early under the mortgage contract,the power of sale could be exercised only after three weeks of notice and the silva mortgagee had scheduled the sale after only twenty days of notice.id.at.the silva court affirmed the trial court ruling that if the notice is insufficient,the sale under it is void and not merely voidable.id.at.silva establishes that under hawaii law,even technical violations of foreclosure procedures void a subsequent foreclosure sale.
the bap attempted to distinguish silva on two grounds.first,the bap noted that the silva court did not explain why strict,rather than substantial compliance,with foreclosure procedure is required.however,this undercuts,rather than supports,the bap conclusion.the fact that the silva court did not discuss prejudice or substantial compliance demonstrates that this factor is irrelevant to the mortgagor remedy under hawaii law.
the bap also distinguished silva on the ground that there the defect in the notice requirement was coupled with another irregularity the livestock was not available for inspection at the auction sale.this assertion misreads silva.in fact,the silva court voided the sale of real estate solely on the basis of inadequate notice,and not because of the failure to display the auctioned cattle.the decision makes this clear t he third objection to the sale that the mortgagee failed to display the cattle to bidders applies only to the sale of the chattels.silva,wl,at emphasis added.
that hawaii law requires strict compliance with statutory foreclosure procedures is confirmed by the hawaii supreme court recent decision in lee,a decision that was not available at the time the bap issued its decision.the lee court,answering a question certified to it by a federal district court,held that a foreclosure sale conducted after the mortgagors had cured their default was not valid.the court cited silva for the proposition that the foreclosure sale did not comply with the requirements of hrs section and was,thus,invalid.lee,at.as in silva,there was no discussion in lee of the degree to which the violation of hrs prejudiced the mortgagor that would suggest that prejudicial impact is relevant under hawaii law.while lee involved the violation of a different requirement of hrs than is at issue here,the court reasoning encompasses the facts of this case.
finally,we note that a strict compliance requirement is not so out of step with the law of other jurisdictions that we have reason to our interpretation of hawaii law.the bap is accurate in noting that the majority of states draw a distinction between procedural defects that are insignificant and those that are prejudicial enough to render a foreclosure sale void or voidable.see,gilroy ryberg,describing the majorit
