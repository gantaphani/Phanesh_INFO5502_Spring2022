background 
employment history and benefits 
john mcmillan worked at ltv steel cleveland works west plant cleveland west in cleveland,ohio as an hourly employee for over thirty years.while employed at ltv steel,mcmillan was a member of the collective bargaining unit represented by the united steelworkers of america,the uswa.the uswa and ltv steel negotiated a labor and benefit agreement that provided various benefits to employees,including pension benefits.as an employee of ltv steel,mcmillan was covered by both the defined contribution pension agreement and the defined benefit agreement.the defined benefit agreement provided basic pension benefits.an employee account under the defined contribution pension agreement consisted of a company contribution account,to which the employer contributed certain amounts based on an hourly rate,and an elective contribution employee k which the employee contributed.
on august,the uswa and ltv steel entered into an agreement the agreement restructuring the pension benefits for all qualified employees.the agreement provided that i ndividual company contribution accounts will be transferred into the defined benefit pension plan,invested with the defined benefit assets,and at retirement the defined contribution plan annuities will be paid from the defined benefit plan.the agreement eliminated future company contributions to the pension plan,and preserved the k contributions to the plan,as well as the right of employees to receive a payment from the defined benefit plan upon retirement,subject to a cap.
ltv steel financial difficulties 
on december,ltv steel,copperweld,ltv parent company of both copperweld and ltv numerous ltv affiliates filed voluntary petitions for chapter bankruptcy.subsequently,on april,ltv steel issued a notice pursuant to the worker adjustment and retraining notification act warn act to the uswa regarding the planned closing of cleveland west and resulting mass layoffs.on july,the bankruptcy court approved a modified labor agreement mla entered into by ltv steel and the uswa.the mla,which the uswa membership ratified,rescinded the april warn notice.ltv steel,however,never reopened the cleveland west plant.following the closing of cleveland west,mcmillan accepted work at other ltv facilities which,in at least one instance,involved a reduced rate of pay,in order to avoid layoff.despite his efforts to remain employed,mcmillan was laid off on august,and never returned to work.
in a letter dated november,mcmillan and other employees at the cleveland west plant received notification of ltv steel intention to permanently shut down cleveland west.the letter informed the employees that,under the terms of the mla,they could exercise one of four options associated with the permanent shutdown accept a severance allowance accept pension options and agree to terminate employment with ltv steel no later than november,transfer permanently to the east side plant,which would result in a new date of continuous service of august,or remain on layoff.ltv steel requested that the employees return the irrevocable election form no later than november.on december,mcmillan elected to retire with pension benefits,and received a payment 
in an attempt to secure the funds necessary to continue its operations,ltv steel sought a million loan under the federal emergency loan guarantee program.receipt of the loan depended on ltv steel obtaining wage and benefit concessions from the uswa,but negotiations regarding concessions broke down on november.as a result,the federal loan guarantee board refused to grant preliminary approval of the loan,and ltv steel decided to cease operations due to a lack of funds.on november,ltv steel issued a warn notice,informing ltv steel employees that it was terminating all steelmaking operations and eliminating all hourly jobs.ltv steel also sought approval of an asset protection plan in the bankruptcy court permitting the sale of substantially all of ltv steel assets outside of the ordinary course of business.on december,the bankruptcy court approved the asset protection plan and,as proposed,ltv steel sold its assets.although the proceeds from the sale were sufficient to satisfy the debts owed to secured creditors,ltv steel remained unable to pay the administrative and other unsecured claims against its estate.accordingly,ltv steel declared itself administratively insolvent and therefore unable to confirm a plan of reorganization.see a a providing that full payment of administrative expenses is a prerequisite to confirmation of a reorganization plan.
in addition to declaring itself administratively insolvent,ltv steel also was unable to fund the payments as required under the terms of the defined benefit plan.as a result,the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc terminated the defined benefit plan and assumed all of the rights and powers of a trustee specified,or otherwise granted by law,beginning march.pbgc continues to administer the unpaid benefits of mcmillan and other ltv steel retirees.
on december,ltv steel and the uswa agreed to modify numerous aspects of preexisting agreements,effective december.among other modifications,the parties agreed that ltv steel obligations under any and all of the collective bargaining agreements,including any benefit programs,shall be modified to provide that t he provisions on severance allowance would no longer be in effect for employees at basic steel facilities,including employees at the cleveland west plant.
c.the uswa claims 
on june,the uswa filed a proof of claim for administrative expenses against ltv steel estate.the proof of claim stated that debtors,including ltv steel,had failed to fulfill their obligations to the uswa,including the obligation to pay severance,to pay amounts resulting from warn act liability,and to contribute to retiree benefits.ltv steel and its affiliates settled the uswa administrative expense claim and,on december,the bankruptcy court entered a stipulation and order embodying the parties settlement the stipulation.the stipulation provided that the uswa claim shall be allowed as an administrative expense claim against the estate of ltv steel in the amount of million in full satisfaction of that claim.in addition,the stipulation directed ltv steel to make pro rata payments to all of the former ltv steel employees listed on exhibit a,such that each e mployee receives an equal gross amount of any distributions stemming from the uswa administrative expense claim.the stipulation explicitly noted that the list of employees in the attached exhibit a excludes those on layoff from the cleveland west operation on behalf of whom warn notice was given at an earlier time and all other employees on layoff on or before november.in exchange for its allowed administrative expense claim and ltv steel pro rata payments to ltv steel employees,the uswa 
irrevocably and unconditionally release d the ltv parties from any and all claims including any proofs of claim or administrative claims asserted against any of the ltv parties estates,and any causes of action of any kind or nature,including,but not limited to,claims arising from any relationship,contract,agreement,or other connection between the uswa and the ltv parties 
because mcmillan was laid off on august,and never returned to work,mcmillan was not included among all former hourly ltv steel employees who were actively employed and working at certain of ltv steel facilities on november,listed in exhibit.as a result,under the terms of the stipulation,mcmillan was not entitled to receive any of the pro rata payments.the uswa did not direct ltv steel to provide mcmillan with notice of the stipulation,and neither mcmillan nor his attorney were provided with direct notice of the stipulation.
copperweld settlement 
on december,mcmillan filed a proof of claim with the bankruptcy court.mcmillan asserted a general unsecured claim in the amount of against ltv steel,ltv corporation,and copperweld.mcmillan claimed entitlement to wages and employee benefits,including from his defined contribution pension plan account.debtors,including ltv corporation,copperweld,and ltv steel,objected to mcmillan claim,arguing that the claim was improper as to copperweld and ltv corporation and that mcmillan could assert his claim against only ltv steel.the bankruptcy court sustained the objection,noting that there was no evidence that ltv steel,ltv corporation,and copperweld operated as an integrated enterprise as mcmillan had claimed.mcmillan appealed the bankruptcy court ruling.
before the bankruptcy court ruled on the appeal,however,mcmillan settled with copperweld.the settlement agreement the copperweld settlement allowed mcmillan an unsecured priority claim totaling and a general unsecured claim in the amount of the copperweld settlement provided that copperweld p ayment of the settlement amount shall constitute full satisfaction of any and all liabilities with respect to mcmillan claims.mcmillan also agreed to release all claims against copperweld,but did not waive any claim against ltv steel company,or ltv corporation.pursuant to the terms of the copperweld settlement,mcmillan filed a motion to dismiss his appeal.the bankruptcy court granted the motion,and dismissed mcmillan appeal on october.in its order of dismissal,the bankruptcy court explicitly stated that the dismissal of the appeal shall not affect in any manner mcmillan ability to seek relief against the ltv steel company.
mcmillan administrative claim 
in,mcmillan sought and the bankruptcy court granted leave to file an administrative expense claim against ltv steel in the amount of.mcmillan claim,which is the subject of this appeal,consisted of three components representing the unpaid balance in his defined contribution pension plan account dcp component in unpaid severance benefits severance component and in backpay,to which mcmillan claims he is entitled under the warn act warn act component.mcmillan asserted that each component of his claim constituted an administrative expense as defined in a.ltv steel objected to the claim.on january,the bankruptcy court sustained ltv steel objections and denied mcmillan administrative expense claim.
on january,mcmillan filed a motion to amend and supplement the bankruptcy court findings and a motion for reconsideration of the bankruptcy court order of january.the bankruptcy court considered mcmillan motion as a rule e motion to amend or alter the judgment and a motion for reconsideration of the disallowance of a claim under j.after concluding that mcmillan failed to meet his burden,the bankruptcy court denied mcmillan motions in their entirety.
mcmillan appealed to the district court,arguing that the bankruptcy court inappropriately denied his administrative expense claim mcmillan contended that the bankruptcy court failed to consider the fact that the balance in his dcp account vested prior to the agreement,which he argued entitled him to the value of the funds in dcp account just prior to the agreement.mcmillan also argued that the bankruptcy court erred in denying his motion to reconsider.the district court rejected mcmillan arguments,concluding that he had failed to establish that the various components of his claims were entitled to treatment as administrative expenses under b.mcmillan appealed.
ii.mcmillan claim for administrative expenses 
standard of review 
on appeal from a district court judgment affirming an order of the bankruptcy court,this court reviews the bankruptcy court order directly,and gives no deference to the district court decision.in re hamilton,cir.this court reviews the bankruptcy court findings of fact for clear error,asking only whether this court is left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.id.the bankruptcy court legal conclusions are reviewed de novo,mckesson,cir.
mcmillan argues that the bankruptcy court improperly denied his administrative expense claim when it sustained ltv steel objections to his claim.mcmillan further contends that the bankruptcy court erred in concluding his administrative expense claim was barred by the stipulation between ltv steel and the uswa,and also by the copperweld settlement.
dcp component 
in addressing mcmillan arguments,the bankruptcy court framed the issue as whether mcmillan has met his burden of proving his entitlement to an allowance of an administrative claim,and set forth the applicable law.the bankruptcy court analysis,however,focused on other grounds for disallowing mcmillan claim.the bankruptcy court concluded that the agreement between ltv steel and the uswa regarding revisions to the structure of employees pension benefits released the dcp component of mcmillan claim.the agreement provided that employees dcp accounts would be transferred to defined benefit accounts,which the pbgc now administers.as a result,the bankruptcy court found that mcmillan could not assert a claim against ltv steel,but had recourse only against the pbgc.
as an alternative basis for its conclusion,the bankruptcy court determined that the copperweld settlement,which allowed mcmillan a general unsecured claim to be distributed in accordance with copperweld plan of reorganization,satisfied the dcp component of mcmillan claim.the bankruptcy court further concluded that a portion of the dcp component was duplicative of a portion of the general unsecured claim that mcmillan previously asserted against ltv steel,copperweld,and ltv corporation and,accordingly,was barred by collateral estoppel.
administrative expense priority status 
the bankruptcy code assigns priority to certain administrative expenses,including the actual,necessary costs and expenses of preserving the estate,including wages,salaries,or commissions for services rendered after the commencement of the case.b a.under the bankruptcy code,administrative expenses are entitled to priority over prepetition unsecured claims.hartford underwriters ins.union planters bank,d citing a,a,a a.
this court applies a test to determine whether a claim is entitled to administrative expense priority status under b.a debt constitutes an actual,necessary administrative expense only if it arose from a transaction with the bankruptcy estate and it directly and substantially benefitted the estate.in re,cir quoting pension benefit guar.sunarhauserman,in re sunarhauserman,cir.thus,a debt must arise after the debtor files for bankruptcy postpetition in order to be accorded administrative expense priority.in re sunarhauserman,at.mcmillan,as the claimant,has the burden of proving that his claim constitutes an administrative expense,in re white motor,cir noting that a claimant must prove that the debt arose,and that the debt directly and substantially benefitted the estate.
mcmillan argues that the dcp component of his portion representing retirement benefits he claims remain in a dcp an administrative expense entitled to priority status under b and a.the dcp component of mcmillan administrative expense claim relates to funds he argues he became entitled to prior to august,because his benefits had vested prior to that date.regardless of whether his benefits were vested,ltv steel did not file bankruptcy until december.thus,any liability that ltv steel might have arose and,accordingly,does not constitute an administrative expense.see in re sunarhauserman,at.
to avoid this result,mcmillan relies on e to argue that his retirement benefits are administrative expenses.we note that mcmillan has forfeited this argument by failing to raise it in the courts below.see nicsand,cir.even if we considered mcmillan argument that e requires the dcp component of his claim to be treated as an administrative expense,mcmillan argument would fail.while e provides that any payment for retiree benefits has the status of an allowed administrative expense,the type of benefit involved in mcmillan claim is not a retiree benefit within the meaning of.retiree benefits include only payments to any person for the purpose of providing or reimbursing payments for retired employees and their spouses and dependents,for medical,surgical,or hospital care benefits,or benefits in the event of sickness,accident,disability,or death under any plan,fund,or program that is maintained or established in whole or in part by the debtor prior to filing a petition commencing a case under this title.a.while the pension program was maintained or established by ltv steel prior to filing its bankruptcy petition,the program does not provide payments for medical,surgical,or benefits as required by a.thus,does not apply to ltv steel benefit program directed at administering pensions.see adventure,holland,cir concluding that does not apply to a program that administer s only pension benefits and noting that was passed in response to a perceived threat to retiree health benefits posed by the bankruptcy reorganization of numerous large employers.
accordingly,we conclude that mcmillan can not demonstrate that the dcp component of his claim is entitled to priority treatment as an administrative expense.
ltv steel as a proper party 
the bankruptcy court denied the dcp component of mcmillan claim because it concluded that the agreement transferred the balance of mcmillan defined contribution plan account to a defined benefit account.the bankruptcy court found that,because pbgc now administers ltv steel defined benefit plan,mcmillan has recourse against only pbgc and,thus,his claim against ltv steel was improper.
the bankruptcy court findings regarding the effect of the agreement are not clearly erroneous.under the terms of the agreement,i ndividual company contribution accounts were transferred into the defined benefit pension plan,and invested with the defined benefit assets.the agreement further provides that,at retirement,the dcp annuities will be paid from the db plan.such support in the record does not leave this court with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed and,as a result,we uphold the bankruptcy court factual findings.see in re hamilton,at.therefore,we conclude that the bankruptcy court correctly determined that mcmillan could assert the dcp component of his claim against only pbgc.
mcmillan has failed to satisfy his burden of demonstrating that the dcp component of his claim is an administrative expense and,because pbgc now administers the db plan,has improperly asserted the dcp component of his claim against ltv steel.thus,because these grounds support the bankruptcy court conclusions,we do not consider mcmillan arguments with respect to the alternative bases for the bankruptcy court holding with respect to the dcp component.
severance payments and warn act liability 
the bankruptcy court concluded that the warn act and severance components of mcmillan claim were released pursuant to the stipulation and order with the uswa because the uswa acted as mcmillan agent in negotiating the stipulation.mcmillan argues that this finding is not supported by the terms of the stipulation,and that his due process rights were violated because he did not receive notice of the stipulation that purported to waive his right to pursue claims against ltv steel.
effect of the stipulation 
on appeal,mcmillan does not contest that the terms of the stipulation irrevocably and unconditionally release d the ltv parties from any and all claims including proofs of claim or administrative claims asserted against any of the ltv parties estates.instead,he maintains that the stipulation does not bar his claims for two reasons.first,mcmillan asserts that the uswa has no right to represent retirees because retirees are not members of the uswa.therefore,according to mcmillan,the stipulation does not preclude his administrative expense claim.
mcmillan,however,has not argued previously that his status as a retiree precludes the uswa from representing him,or that the uswa was not authorized to represent him.in his argument to the bankruptcy court,mcmillan stated that he did not waive his statutory rights under the warn act because mcmillan can not be bound by the december,order absent a clear and unmistakable waiver of his rights to a judicial forum.alteration in original.mcmillan district court brief also advanced this argument,asserting that mcmillan warn act and severance claims are grounded in statutory rights which the sixth circuit has held can not be released by a union without a clear and unmistakable waiver by the employee.emphasis omitted.he further argued that,while a union had standing to sue to enforce its members right to payment of wage claims and claims under the warn act,the union does not own its members wage and warn claims.emphasis omitted.
with respect to whether the uswa was authorized to represent him with respect to the stipulation,the bankruptcy court found that mcmillan did not contest that the uswa could represent him the arguments mcmillan points to in his briefs to the bankruptcy and district courts address whether the union had authority to bargain away his retirement benefits and do not relate to the stipulation.because mcmillan has not raised arguments with respect to whether the uswa could represent because he was a retiree at the time or because the uswa was not authorized to act on his has waived his right to make these arguments on appeal.nicsand,at.
second,mcmillan argues that the stipulation does not preclude his claims because he did not provide a clear and unmistakable waiver of his warn act rights.to support his argument,mcmillan relies on a series of cases that address under what conditions a court will conclude that a union member has waived rights to pursue claims in a judicial forum or against the employer.ltv steel argues that,because none of these cases were decided in the context of bankruptcy proceedings or involved the warn act,their holdings are inapplicable to the present case.specifically,ltv steel notes that,once an employer declares bankruptcy,a union has authority to negotiate with the employer regarding necessary modifications to a collective bargaining agreement.ltv steel also argues that the warn act authorizes unions to pursue claims on behalf of former employees,authority that unions do not have with respect to other claims.
for the first time on appeal,mcmillan cites cleveland electric illuminating utility workers union of america,cir,and united steelworkers of america cooper tire rubber,cir.he argues that cleveland electric establishes that the uswa was required to obtain his consent to settle any statutory claims he might have had against ltv steel.this court has held that,in order to arbitrate a retiree statutorily granted benefits,a union must obtain the consent of the retiree.cleveland,at.mcmillan,however,did not argue the issue of consent to either the bankruptcy court or the district court.although he attempts to include the consent argument as part of his argument that the uswa waiver of his statutory rights was ineffective for failure to provide a clear and unmistakable waiver,neither cleveland electric nor cooper tire involved the issue of whether the employee provided a clear and unmistakable waiver.thus,to the extent he relies on these cases to argue that the union waiver was invalid for lack of consent,mcmillan has forfeited the argument by failing to assert it below.while it would not be improper to cite these cases to this court for the first time in support of an argument he previously raised,mcmillan can not use this authority to support a theory not presented to the lower courts.see b h,llc abp,cir.thus,mcmillan has forfeited his right to present the consent argument to this only argument applicable to the severance component of his we therefore will address only his clear and unmistakable waiver argument as it re
