slater health center slater,a nursing home which is currently in chapter bankruptcy,was overpaid by medicare because it took medicare money for the expenses of third services but then did not pay those third parties as required.a c.the government sought to recover these overpayments by reducing medicare reimbursements due to the bankrupt but still operational slater.slater responded by instituting an adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy court,alleging that this was an improper setoff within the context of bankruptcy.at issue,effectively,is whether the government may recover the overpayments to slater to put them back into medicare or whether slater estate gets the funds to be distributed to its many creditors.
this court recently held in in re holyoke nursing home,cir,that a government adjustment for a medicare overpayment constitutes a recoupment,and not a setoff,and therefore that such an adjustment is permissible and unaffected by the bankruptcy context.the reasoning of that case controls here,where the overpayment was due to slater taking money from medicare and contracting with third parties for services that were provided but for which slater did not pay the providers in a timely manner.c.we affirm the district court decision,which allowed medicare to recoup the funds at issue.
under the federal medicare program,the federal government makes estimated payments at least once a month to participating health centers for reasonable costs incurred in treating medicare patients,subject to subsequent audits and necessary adjustments on account of previously made overpayments or underpayments.a see v a good samaritan hosp.shalala,d.the purpose for making estimated payments,often before a provider has actually rendered a service,is to protect the liquidity of providers.see fischer united states,d.by statute,the secretary of health and human services is empowered to administer this cost reimbursement scheme and make regulations in this area.see v a thomas jefferson shalala,d subject to a few exceptions,congress authorized the secretary to issue regulations defining reimbursable costs and otherwise giving content to the broad outlines of the medicare statute.
using his power to promulgate regulations,the secretary has defined the statutory term overpayment.by regulation,an overpayment includes the situation where a provider is given money by medicare to pay for certain health care services,and the provider contracts with a third party who,in turn,provides those services,but the provider fails to liquidate the liability by paying the third party within a designated period of time.c.the regulation reads,in part,as follows 
although medicare recognizes,in the year of accrual,the accrual of costs for which a provider has not actually expended funds during the current cost reporting period,for purposes of payment medicare does not recognize the accrual of costs unless the related liabilities are liquidated timely.
c.specifically,liabilities like those at issue in this case must be paid off within one year after the end of the cost reporting period in which the liability is incurred,although extensions of up to three years after the end of the cost reporting year in which the liability is incurred may be granted.c i.
slater,a nursing home located in pawtucket,rhode island,filed a chapter bankruptcy petition on january,and thereafter continued to operate as a debtor in possession.slater is a participant in the medicare program.blue cross blue shield of rhode island blue cross,a fiscal intermediary for medicare notified slater in december that it had reopened slater cost report for analysis and that it had found medicare overpayments to slater.in february,blue cross notified slater that it also had found medicare overpayments to slater based on its cost report,which had likewise been reopened.the total amount of these overpayments,plus interest,was approximately.these sums were subject to recoupment.
all but one of the overpayments for these two overpayments under c that is,in overpayments arose because slater contracted with certain providers for health care services to medicare patients and the services were provided by these third parties but the third parties themselves were never paid by slater.by the time blue cross notified slater of the medicare overpayments,slater could not pay the providers,because it was in bankruptcy.
in response to blue cross notice of overpayment,slater,beginning in january,stopped billing medicare for its receivables for a period of time.evidently,slater theory was that medicare could not recoup overpayments if slater filed no further requests for payment.eventually,though,this strategy became too costly for slater slater filed an adversary proceeding against blue cross and the federal government with a federal bankruptcy court in rhode island on june,seeking injunctive and declaratory relief preventing any recoupment due to section c overpayments.in re slater health.
the bankruptcy court denied slater request for a temporary restraining order on august,after an expedited hearing.id.slater then filed claims for all of its receivables,which were paid minus the total amount of the overpayments.id.at.slater next moved the bankruptcy court for reconsideration of the denial of its motion for a temporary restraining order the court granted the motion on june,and the bankruptcy court issued an order requiring medicare to return to the bankruptcy estate the less the of admitted overpayment due to an accounting error id.at.
the bankruptcy court held that the automatic stay provision in the bankruptcy code,a,had not been violated because medicare attempt to recover all of the overpayments constituted a recoupment,rather than a setoff.the payments and subsequent adjustments for overpayments constituted a single,integrated transaction.in re slater health,at.
however,the bankruptcy court then invoked equitable principles against the secretary right of recoupment and refused to allow medicare to recoup the that was due to section c overpayments.over objections that equitable principles could not overcome the secretary right of recoupment,the bankruptcy court held that it was entitled to perform a careful weigh ing of the relative harm to both parties.id.the court stressed that the overpayment in this case was generated by slater failure to pay certain providers who provided medicare services to patients since these providers were now creditors of the estate,any recoupment by medicare would hurt the providers and other creditors by giving them a reduced payout.id.on the other hand,the court stated that medicare would merely be gaining a windfall if it were to recoup these funds because all of the medicare services had been provided,and thus the money was actually earned by the providers and would not make up for any loss by medicare.id.
the bankruptcy court also determined several other,related points of contention.the bankruptcy court allowed slater to assume the medicare agreement and eventually confirmed slater chapter plan,which contained a subordination of medicare overpayment claim.id.at.the result was that medicare would receive none of this claim.
after the plan was confirmed,the secretary appealed the bankruptcy court holding that it could not recoup the overpayment along with the subsidiary orders on the same topic to the federal district court,which reversed the bankruptcy court.in re slater health.the district court agreed with the bankruptcy court that the automatic stay provision of a did not apply to medicare claim because it was a recoupment,rather than a setoff id.at.
however,the district court held that the bankruptcy court had erred in ranging so broadly to balance the equities in order to nonetheless deny medicare its right of recoupment and,at any rate,the equities cut in medicare favor.id.at.the proper balancing was not between medicare and the providers,but between slater and medicare,because the money could not be set aside merely for the use of the unpaid creditors and its return to the estate would only somewhat improve those unpaid creditors chances of being paid.id.and this was money that slater was neve
