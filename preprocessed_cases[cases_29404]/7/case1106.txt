background 
desnick was the owner and sole shareholder of doctors hospital and a number of other entities.one of his other companies,hpch llc hpch,owned the land on which the hospital sat and collected monthly rent from it.another of his companies,medical management of america,mma,managed the hospital and received fees for these services.desnick treated his companies like personal bank accounts,sometimes withdrawing money for himself,other times depositing money when his companies coffers ran low.
doctors hospital guaranteed two loans that figure prominently in this litigation,though it enjoyed the proceeds of only one.in march mma funding owned by doctors hospital borrowed roughly million from daiwa healthco the daiwa loan.because the loan was,in practical effect,a loan to the hospital,the hospital secured the loan by pledging its receivables.in addition,desnick personally guaranteed the loan.in august nomura asset capital corporation loaned hpch million the nomura loan.although the nomura loan went ostensibly to hpch,it was secured by the hospital equipment and like the daiwa loan by the hospital accounts receivable.the hospital also executed a guaranty and suretyship agreement in favor of nomura.the nomura loan proceeds did not go to the hospital,however.instead,the million after administrative deposited into an account bearing the name of desnick and his wife.over time lasalle bank came to control the nomura loan 
the hospital filed for chapter bankruptcy protection in april.daiwa filed a claim against the hospital to collect the outstanding portion of its loan,and desnick personally paid the debt of about million.the hospital filed an adversary complaint against desnick and numerous other defendants.twelve of the other defendants were entities and four were former corporate officers or directors of the hospital whom desnick had effectively agreed to indemnify for their losses the gist of the complaint was that desnick and the other officers and directors caused the hospital bankruptcy through mismanagement and a series of fraudulent the tune of about benefitted desnick,his other companies,and hospital management the complaint asserted counts,including breach of fiduciary duties,conversion,violation of the illinois uniform fraudulent transfer act,fraudulent transfers under the bankruptcy code,improper distributions to the shareholder,and equitable subordination of desnick claims against the hospital desnick claimed the hospital owed him roughly million.the complaint also named lasalle and sought to void the guaranty on the nomura loan.
after two years of litigation,the hospital moved the bankruptcy court for approval of a settlement agreement that had been reached by the parties except lasalle.under the terms of the settlement,desnick agreed to pay the hospital roughly million and also agreed to forfeit any subrogation rights he had to seek recovery of the million he personally paid to daiwa on behalf of the hospital.he also agreed to withdraw any other claims he filed against the hospital.moreover,desnick promised to use his best efforts to obtain dismissal or withdrawal of a million claim against the hospital filed by the department of health and human services dhhs for reimbursements dhhs claimed were improperly paid to the hospital.if he could not secure dismissal of the entire dhhs claim,desnick agreed to pay of the claim,up to million.finally,desnick agreed to cooperate with the hospital in its remaining claims against other defendants,including lasalle,by among other things allowing the hospital access to his expert.in exchange,the hospital agreed to release from all claims desnick,his companies,and the four individuals he agreed to indemnify.
lasalle objected,and the bankruptcy court conducted a evidentiary hearing on the hospital motion.the hospital,desnick,the bankruptcy trustee,and the creditors committee all recommended that the settlement would be the best way to avoid protracted,expensive,complex,and uncertain litigation.the bankruptcy court concluded that the scenario for the hospital would be a million victory and the worst case a million victory.lasalle had argued that the high end was in excess of million and the low end near million the bankruptcy judge thought that was unrealistic.the court agreed with the hospital and desnick that the million victory was the least likely result because audited financials tended to support desnick position regarding the date of insolvency,which was critical to the bulk of the hospital claims.given the range of litigation possibilities,the bankruptcy court concluded the settlement was reasonable because it would spare scarce resources,which might be wasted on protracted litigation that would likely yield mediocre results.lasalle appealed to the district court,which affirmed.
ii.discussion 
bankruptcy courts may approve adversary litigation settlements that are in the best interests of the estate.in re energy,cir in re am.reserve,cir.the linchpin of the best interests of the estate test is a comparison of the value of the settlement with the probable costs and benefits of litigating.in re energy,at.among the factors the court considers are the litigation probability of success,complexity,expense,inconvenience,and delay,including the possibility that disapproving the settlement will cause wasting of assets.in re am.reserve,at.as part of this test,the value of the settlement must be reasonably equivalent to the value of the claims surrendered.this reasonable equivalence standard is met if the settlement falls within the reasonable range of possible litigation outcomes.in re energy,at in re,new haven hartford,cir see also protective comm.for indep.stockholders of tmt trailer ferry,anderson,d depoister mary holloway,cir.because litigation outcomes can not be predicted with mathematical precision,only if a settlement falls below the low end of possible litigation outcomes will it fail the reasonable equivalence standard.in re energy,at.

lasalle complains of several errors,most having to do with the value of the settlement to the estate and whether it falls within the reasonable range of litigation outcomes.first,lasalle maintains the bankruptcy court clearly erred in determining the value of the settlement to the estate.lasalle argues that some of the claims desnick gave up are worthless and that the settlement achieves practically nothing for unsecured creditors.second,lasalle contends the bankruptcy court miscalculated the range of litigation outcomes.according to lasalle,both the low and high ends of possible outcomes are much higher than the bankruptcy judge thought,and the settlement does not fall within the range of lasalle higher projected outcomes.finally,lasalle argues the bankruptcy court did not make an independent evaluation of the settlement,but instead the misguided recommendations of the trustee and the creditors committee.
value of the settlement 
the bankruptcy court held that the settlement had significant value to the estate.the hospital released desnick,twelve entities,and four former officers and directors of the hospital from all claims against them.in return,desnick paid the estate some million cash.in addition,desnick agreed to waive his claim against the estate for the million or so he paid on the daiwa loan.he also agreed to use his best efforts to help resolve the million claim favorably to the estate.the settlement also made desnick financial expert available to the estate he had detailed knowledge of the hospital books dating as far back as,which could help the estate in its claim against lasalle.finally,the settlement narrowed the scope of litigation and allowed the hospital to focus its resources on winning the few remaining claims rather than battling on all fronts.
lasalle takes issue with several of the bankruptcy court conclusions.first,lasalle argues that desnick forfeiture of his claim for the daiwa loan is worthless.lasalle insists that when desnick paid the daiwa loan,the loan was extinguished and desnick obtained no subrogation rights.lasalle cites no law to support this argument,and the position is not defensible.when a guarantor pays a debt,he is subrogated to the rights of a creditor against the corporation on whose behalf he paid the debt.weissman weener,cir fertilizer exch.bank of,cir see also mut.serv.cas.ins.elizabeth state bank,cir s ubrogation can arise simply from the fact of payment.lasalle suggests that any subrogation claim would be subject to equitable subordination based on desnick conduct,but it does not develop the argument.in any event,the point is immaterial because the bankruptcy court did not assume the value of the released claim to be worth million to the estate.rather,the court assumed that,if nothing else,the released claim saved the estate the expense of litigating to determine whether the claim was valid.that is not error.
lasalle also argues desnick promise to use his best efforts to defeat the claim is of no value.by lasalle reckoning,desnick already had a duty to obtain the release of the claim because of his position as director and sole shareholder of the hospital.here again lasalle does not cite any legal authority for its position.corporate directors do not have continuing fiduciary duties once they resign.see,standage planned inv,noting there is no more fiduciary duty when director or officer resigns microbiological research muna,utah when a corporate officer ceases to act as such,because of his resignation or removal,the fiduciary relationship ceases.renpak,oppenheimer,so d,william meade fletcher,fletcher cyc.desnick resigned as director of the hospital in november,so he had no continuing duty to right the ship in.moreover,desnick agreed to pay for the filing of a report with dhhs regarding the medicare medicaid report that could cost he had no duty to do so personally,even in a sole shareholder situation at least not without veil piercing,which lasalle has not pressed.kelly fahrney.noting in the context of a closely held corporation that there is no duty on the part of shareholders to use individual pecuniary means to assist the corporation in its money difficulties or by use of such means shield it from financial destruction.finally,desnick agreed to pay of the claim,up to million of his own money,should he not secure its release.so even assuming he had some sort of duty to help secure the release of the claim,desnick sweetened the deal by offering to pay for the filing of the dhhs report and a portion of any remaining claims.desnick promise was hardly illusory.
range of litigation outcomes 
the date the hospital became insolvent was critical to determining the range of possible litigation outcomes.most of the hospital claims against desnick centered on allegations of breach of fiduciary duty,fraudulent transfer,and conversion.everyone agrees there are no viable claims for any period during which the hospital was solvent that is because as long as a corporation is solvent,directors typically owe fiduciary duties only to shareholders.beach miller,paul schwendener,jupiter,d.because desnick was the sole shareholder of the hospital,he can hardly have defrauded himself or breached a fiduciary duty to himself.see in re tufts,cir holding that corporate opportunity doctrine does not apply against sole shareholder who can not defraud or conceal information from himself.if the hospital was insolvent,however,desnick fiduciary duties extend to the hospital creditors.paul schwendener,at.likewise,the hospital fraudulent transfer and conversion claims depend on insolvency.see.comp.stat.nostalgia network,lockwood,cir when a person transfers money or other property to another person without receiving anything in return,and the transferor is insolvent or made insolvent by the transfer,the transfer is voidable dannen scafidi,d,no liability for converting corporate funds if all shareholders ratify the act and creditors are not impaired.
the hospital maintains that it became insolvent in january.between january and august,the date of the nomura loan,some million in transfers moved from the hospital to desnick.after august,no more than about or million in transfers occurred.the bankruptcy court,sensibly enough,determined that the upper limit of possible litigation outcomes was about million,assuming the hospital could prove insolvency as early as january and would prevail on all of its claims.
lasalle contends the bankruptcy judge upper limit does not account for all of the hospital claims.according to lasalle,the bankruptcy court should have included a claim for the million nomura loan because desnick had pledged the hospital assets to secure it.that claim would have raised the upper limit of possible outcomes to nearly million,and lasalle contends the hospital had a viable alter ego or leveraged buyout theory that would permit recovery of the amount of the nomura loan.the hospital lawyer disagreed.he testified that he entertained this theory,but ultimately considered it too.
the bankruptcy court did not clearly err by leaving the nomura funds out of the calculation.the court noted that the adversary complaint did not actually make a claim against desnick for the million nomura loan.the hospital had only secured the loan it never had a right to the loan proceeds,which were given to hpch.nor had the proceeds ever passed through the hospital bank accounts.the hospital wanted only to be off the security hook it did not have a claim to recover the money from desnick.
from the estate perspective,trying to get the nomura money from desnick on a novel legal theory would have been more trouble than it was worth.to do so would also run the risk of undercutting its claim against lasalle to void the nomura guaranty it would essentially confirm lasalle claim against the estate for the nomura funds.by disavowing any recovery against desnick on the nomura loan and seeking only to void the guaranty,the hospital looked to knock out million or more in claims.perhaps the estate could have pressed the legal theories necessary to win the nomura funds,but it made the strategic decision not to.the bankruptcy court exclusion of the nomura loan amount was not clearly erroneous.
the bankruptcy court determined the low end of possible outcomes by figuring the result if desnick defenses were established,which necessarily included an assessment of whether those defenses were any good.desnick claimed the hospital was not insolvent until september.he also claimed to have given back to the hospital some of the funds he transferred out.if his theories and proofs held up,desnick maintained he could be liable for no more than million.the bankruptcy court thus placed the low end of possible outcomes at million.
lasalle maintains the district court erred in this determination as well.at the low end,lasalle argues,the hospital could have recovered at least the mil
