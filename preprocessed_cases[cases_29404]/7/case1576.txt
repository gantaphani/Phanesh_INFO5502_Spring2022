we apply the same standard of review to the bankruptcy court findings as does the district court findings of fact are reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard,and conclusions of law,de novo.christensen tucson estates,in re tucson estates,cir.on de novo review of the district court decision,we conclude that the apartment trust is invalid and that the grove trust is michaels alter ego.we therefore affirm the district court decision in part and reverse it in part.
factual and procedural background 
the debtors created both the apartment trust and the grove trust on june.they named their minor child,sydnee michaels sydnee,beneficiary and appointed juan briones briones trustee.
simultaneously with the creation of the apartment trust,michaels transferred all the stock of kokee woods apartments,kokee woods,of which he was the sole shareholder,to the apartment trust.the bankruptcy court found that a texas verdict rendered against kokee woods made the stock potentially worthless at the time of the transfer.it also found,however,that the debtors were insolvent and that michaels devised the transfer to avoid his creditors ability to recover the asset because he intended to pursue an appeal of the texas verdict and he did not want to go through all the effort of an appeal only to have his creditors pursue the corporation stock.therefore,it concluded,the transfer was made for the fraudulent purpose of avoiding the debtors creditors.after the transfer,michaels successfully appealed the verdict,winning a judgment of plus interest.the trust paid michaels consulting fees of per week to collect the judgment.
the only asset placed into the grove trust at its inception was.in december,however,michaels company impetrol corporation purchased four lots of land containing avocado groves the grove lots for the grove trust.the bankruptcy court noted that the assets used to acquire the grove lots belonged to michaels and that impetrol was nothing but a shell to put properties in the corporate name.it found that the debtors were insolvent at the time of the purchase and that t he grove trust acquisition of the grove lots was a fraud on the creditors of the debtors.it also found that michaels dominated and controlled all decisions related to both the grove lots and the grove trust and that briones had no role nor took any action other than to write checks as demanded by michaels.the grove trust paid michaels at least in unexplained fees from february to september.
although the trusts paid for sydnee education,clothing,medical care,car,and golf lessons and tournament expenses,the debtors also benefitted from both trusts.the bankruptcy court found that briones provided payments to michaels from both the grove trust and the apartment trust without complete documentation and that,t hrough his influence over briones,michaels received advances and expedited payments from either the apartment trust the grove trust to avoid a creditor about to levy on a judgment against him.michaels asked for and received reimbursement from one of the trusts for another daughter wedding and for a life insurance policy briones testified that he did not know who michaels named as the policy beneficiary.the debtors lived with sydnee in a manufactured home that the grove trust purchased after acquiring the grove lots and in a house in temecula,california that the apartment trust purchased in.
briones maintained no books or records for either trust prior to and often intermingled their funds.the trusts shared a bank account from october through january,briones transferred money between the trusts when he determined that one needed more,and the apartment trust made purported loans to the grove trust that were not documented,had no terms for repayment,and were never repaid.the trusts also paid each other expenses.for example,the parties stipulated that the grove trust paid various amounts for the maintenance of the temecula,california property held by the apartment trust,and that the apartment trust paid water bills and trustee fees for the grove trust.
in october,the debtors filed bankruptcy petitions seeking to discharge approximately million in debt.goodrich,as trustee for the consolidated bankruptcy estates,filed an adversary complaint seeking to recover approximately million in assets from the apartment trust and the grove trust.following a bench trial,the bankruptcy court initially concluded that both trusts are valid and that neither is the alter ego of the debtors.on goodrich motion for reconsideration,however,the court partially reversed its earlier ruling,holding that the grove trust is michaels alter ego.as to the apartment trust,it reaffirmed its earlier rulings that the trust is valid because it was created for the benefit of a minor child and that it is not michaels alter ego.
the district court affirmed the judgment of the bankruptcy court in part and reversed it in part.first,the district court held that the apartment trust is invalid because one of the debtors purposes in creating it was to defraud creditors,but it remanded for the bankruptcy court to determine whether that issue is,noting that goodrich had failed to argue before the bankruptcy court that the statute of limitations did not begin to run until briones repudiated the trust.second,relying on hickey,cir,the court held that legal ownership is a prerequisite to alter ego liability in california and that,because michaels was neither trustee nor beneficiary of the trusts,they were not his alter ego.goodrich appealed to this court,and the debtors.
ii.discussion 
the apartment trust 
goodrich argues that the district court erred in holding that the apartment trust is not michaels alter ego,while the debtors,on,contend that it erred in holding that the apartment trust is invalid.we agree with the district court conclusion that the apartment trust is invalid,and we further hold that goodrich claim to invalidate it is not because we hold that the apartment trust is invalid and may therefore be disregarded,we need not address whether it is michaels alter ego.
it is that a trust created for the purpose of defrauding creditors or other persons is illegal and may be disregarded.in re marriage of dick,d,see also cal.a trust may be created for any purpose that is not illegal or against public policy.properly designating a minor child as a beneficiary does not validate a trust that was created with an improper purpose.see scott on trusts ed.although the terms of the trust in themselves are perfectly lawful,the trust is illegal where the motive of the settlor for creating the trust is to defraud creditors or other persons.here,the bankruptcy court found that michaels transferred the kokee woods stock simultaneously with the creation of the apartment trust and that the transfer was made for the fraudulent purpose of avoiding the debtors creditors.those findings are sufficient to establish that michaels purpose in creating the trust was to defraud creditors.the apartment trust is therefore an invalid trust.
moreover,even to the extent it alleges fraudulent transfer,goodrich claim is not by the statute of limitations set forth in california civil code c if an express trust,for instance,it was formed for a fraudulent trustee holds legal title to the property on a resulting trust for the trustor and his or her heirs.see bainbridge stoner,cal in bank.t he trustee of a resulting trust is considered a voluntary trustee and the statute of limitations does not begin to run in favor of a voluntary tru
