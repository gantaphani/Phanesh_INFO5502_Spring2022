in this case of first impression in the courts of appeals,we are asked to decide whether a federal district court may exercise bankruptcy jurisdiction over generally nonremovable claims brought under the securities act of.this is a close question,as it involves a direct conflict between two unambiguous a of the securities act of which bars removal of individual securities act claims,and a which permits removal of claims that are related to a bankruptcy case.because our resolution of this controlling question of law will determine whether scores of pending lawsuits are properly in federal court,we have considered this appeal on an interlocutory basis.
based on our analysis of the relevant statutes,viewed against the backdrop of the scheme of federal jurisdiction laid out in title of the united states code,we hold that the conflict between section a of the securities act and the bankruptcy removal statute must be resolved in favor of bankruptcy removal.for the reasons stated below,we do not agree with the plaintiffs that section a of the securities act is more specific than the bankruptcy removal provision,nor do we believe that congress granted the plaintiffs an absolute choice of forum when it amended the securities act in.instead,we resolve the conflict between the statutes by contrasting the bankruptcy removal statute,which contains no exception for claims arising under an act of congress that prohibits removal,with the general removal statute,which applies e xcept as otherwise expressly provided by an act of congress.a emphasis added.based on this analysis of the federal jurisdictional scheme as a whole,we conclude that section a does not preclude removal of individual actions that are related to a bankruptcy case under section a.
background 
the following facts are drawn principally from the district court opinion and order of march.see in re worldcom.sec,remand opinion.further detail is provided both in that opinion and in other opinions of the district court.
on june,worldcom announced that it had improperly treated billion in ordinary costs as capital expenditures.within two months of that announcement,at least securities class actions had been filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york against numerous defendants,including worldcom former worldcom executive officers,underwriters of worldcom bond offerings the underwriters,worldcom former directors the directors,worldcom former accountants,and research analysts at a citigroup unit who issued reports regarding worldcom citigroup defendants in the meantime,numerous securities class actions were also filed in other federal courts around the country.
on august,the class actions in the southern district were consolidated under the caption in re worldcom.securities litigation.on october,the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation mdl panel ordered the class actions filed around the country centralized in the southern district of new york pursuant to as a result of this consolidation order,pretrial proceedings in the consolidated securities class action have gone forward in the southern district of new york before judge denise cote.
appellants in the instant case are state and private pension funds that bought worldcom bonds the bondholders.rather than joining a class action against worldcom and the other defendants,the bondholders,represented by milberg weiss bershad hynes lerach milberg weiss,have brought scores of individual actions in state courts around the country.the bondholders,unlike the class members,do not assert claims under the securities exchange act of act,et instead,they bring claims exclusively under the securities act of act or the act,et.between july,and october,milberg weiss filed at least of these individual actions on behalf of over plaintiffs in numerous state courts.
the bondholders litigation strategy is carefully considered.by limiting their complaints to claims under the act,the bondholders seek to take advantage of section a of the act,which states that,with one exception that is not relevant here,n o case arising under this subchapter and brought in any state court of competent jurisdiction shall be removed to any court of the united states.a emphasis added.in other words,the bondholders have crafted their complaints in order to avoid removal of their actions to federal court and consolidation of those actions in a single venue.
despite crafting their complaints in order to avoid federal jurisdiction,the bondholders have not succeeded in keeping their claims out of federal court.rather,with worldcom in bankruptcy,the bondholders actions have been removed to federal courts around the country under a,which permits removal of actions that fall within the federal courts bankruptcy jurisdiction as defined by b,including actions that are related to a bankruptcy.see a permitting removal of a civil action to the district court for the district where such civil action is pending,if such district court has jurisdiction of such claim or cause of action under section of this title b providing that district courts shall have original but not exclusive jurisdiction of all civil proceedings related to cases under title.the underwriters and the directors asserted that the actions were related to worldcom bankruptcy case by virtue of their contribution,indemnification,and contractual reimbursement rights against worldcom once the bondholders actions were removed to federal court,they were consolidated for purposes with the class actions already before judge cote.
had the bondholders asserted claims under the act,the removal of their claims to federal court would have been uncontroversial,because claims under the act are otherwise removable under the general removal provision of.see a except as otherwise expressly provided by act of congress,any civil action brought in a state court of which the district courts of the united states have original jurisdiction,may be removed.however,because the bondholders only brought expressly nonremovable claims under the act,the removal of those claims to federal court provoked a flurry of motions to remand.
for our purposes,the first relevant motion to remand was filed by the new york city employees retirement system nycers.while the bondholders actions were being removed,nycers filed its own individual action in new york state court alleging violations of both the act and new york law.when that action was removed to federal court under section a,nycers filed a motion to remand.at that point,judge cote allowed the bondholders,including the california public employees retirement system,to intervene in the proceedings on nycers motion and argue for remand of their individual actions as well.
nycers and the bondholders argued in the district court that their actions should be remanded to the state courts in which they were filed for two independent reasons first,they contended that section a of the act,a,provides plaintiffs with an absolute choice of forum,and therefore bars removal of their claims to federal court.second,they argued that,even if section a does not bar removal under section a,their actions could not properly be removed under section a because those actions are not related to the worldcom bankruptcy.in support of the latter argument,the bondholders noted that the defendants indemnification and contribution claims would not create liability for worldcom unless a separate action against worldcom were filed in the bankruptcy court,and were likely to be accorded little or no value in the worldcom reorganization plan then pending before the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york.
on march,judge cote rejected these arguments in a comprehensive opinion denying nycers motion to remand.see remand decision,at.judge cote also ordered individual plaintiffs other than nycers to submit supplemental briefing to explain why the march,decision denying remand should not apply to them.on may,after supplemental briefing,judge cote adopted the reasoning in the march,decision to deny also the bondholders motion to remand.in re worldcom.sec,civ,wl may.finally,on may,judge cote declined to reconsider her remand decisions.in re worldcom.sec.in doing so,judge cote rejected the bondholders argument that the april,filing of worldcom plan of reorganization with the united states bankruptcy court divested the district court of jurisdiction over the bondholders claims.the court explained that,even if the plan of reorganization would limit the defendants ability to recover from the estate on their indemnification and contribution claims,the court would not be divested of related to jurisdiction,because jurisdiction is established based on the facts at the time of removal.see id.at.
on may,the bondholders filed a motion pursuant to b to certify the orders denying remand for interlocutory appeal.notwithstanding the sub judice status of their application for an interlocutory appeal,on august,the bondholders filed a petition in this court for a writ of mandamus directing the district court to vacate its orders denying their motions to remand by order dated august,judge cote deemed the application for an interlocutory appeal pending before her to have been withdrawn without prejudice.in re worldcom.sec,civ,wl aug.
on october,this court denied the petition for a writ of mandamus on the grounds that an interlocutory appeal pursuant to b remains a possible and adequate avenue for appellate review of the district court orders and petitioners right to relief in this case is not clear and indisputable.in re california public,cir quoting in re drexel burnham lambert,cir.
after we denied the mandamus petition seeking remand to state court,the bondholders renewed their motion to certify the orders denying remand for interlocutory appeal pursuant to b.on december,the district court granted the motion to certify the may and may orders insofar as they held that individual securities act claims can be removed under despite the prohibition against removal contained in section a.in re worldcom.sec,civ,wl.on january,we accepted the interlocutory appeal,and allowed the parties to supplement the briefs they had submitted in support of and in opposition to the mandamus petition.
notably,although the district court certified its may and may orders insofar as they held that act claims can be removed under a,the court declined to certify the question of whether the individual actions are related to the worldcom bankruptcy.see id.at.the court reasoned that the latter question,in contrast to the former,does not involve a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion.see id.at applying standard set forth in b.moreover,in our january,order accepting the interlocutory appeal,we specifically stated that the district court may and may orders meet the requirements of b insofar as the district court held that securities act claims can be removed under despite the prohibition against removal contained in section a of the securities act.
well before we accepted the instant appeal,the district court began to rule on motions to dismiss individual actions filed by the bondholders.first,on november,the district court granted a motion to dismiss one milberg weiss action based,inter alia,on the statute of limitations applicable to securities act claims.in re worldcom.sec,d.then,on january,the district court dismissed with prejudice more individual actions.in re worldcom.sec,d.on the same date,the court also refused to extend the february,deadline by which individual plaintiffs either had to opt out of the class or join the class and withdraw their individual actions.in re worldcom.sec,civ,wl,at.
on january,we ordered the parties to show cause whether,in light of continuing proceedings in the district court,including the district court dismissal of individual actions brought by milberg weiss and its denial of milberg request to delay the opt out period of the class action,any order of this court should be issued in aid of our jurisdiction over this appeal.in response,the bondholders requested that we stay further proceedings in the cases that were initially brought in state court vacate the district court november,and january,rulings dismissing individual claims and extend the time for opting out of the class action until after we had decided this appeal.the defendants initially opposed each of these requests on february,we entered an order directing the district court to extend the deadline to opt out of the class action,as well as the accompanying deadline by which plaintiffs who have filed individual actions must move to dismiss their actions voluntarily,until at least days after this court mandate issues.as a result of our february,order,which did not address the bondholders first two claims for preliminary relief,the bondholders have not forfeited any right to relief that they would have had in the absence of this appeal.
discussion 
i.the scope of the appeal 
the district court granted the bondholders motion to certify one,whether act claims can be removed under section a despite the prohibition against removal contained in section a.the court denied the bondholders motion to certify a second,whether related to jurisdiction lies over the bondholders securities act claims despite the fact that the defendants indemnification and contribution claims against worldcom were likely to be extinguished in a plan of reorganization and,in any event,could not create liability for worldcom in the absence of a separate action against worldcom in the bankruptcy court.see in re worldcom.sec,civ,wl,at.
notwithstanding a district court determination that a particular issue fails to meet the requirements of b,our court may address any issue fairly included within the certified order,as it is the order that is appealable,and not the controlling question identified by the district court.yamaha motor calhoun,d internal quotation marks omitted.nevertheless,in these circumstances,we will not consider whether the defendants potential claims against the estate rendered the bondholders actions related to worldcom bankruptcy,because we agree with the district court that this question is not a controlling question of law.b.
in its march,opinion and order,the district court found that certain defendants contribution claims against worldcom supported related to jurisdiction over the bondholders actions.because the effect of contribution claims on the bankruptcy estate is at the very least conceivable,the district court reasoned,the nycers action is related to the bankruptcy and subject to the jurisdiction of this court.remand opinion,at applying standard articulated in in re cuyahoga equip,cir the test for determining whether litigation has a significant connection with a pending bankruptcy proceeding is whether its outcome might have any conceivable effect on the bankrupt estate.having isolated a single basis for,certain defendants contribution claims against the district court did not decide whether the directors indemnification claims against the estate or any other potential claims supported related to jurisdiction.
because at least one alternative basis for related to jurisdiction may,the directors indemnification claims against the are not convinced that the bondholders have raised a controlling question that should be reviewed on an interlocutory basis.see int l soc.for krishna consciousness,air canada,cir interlocutory appeal inappropriate where there is a multiplicity of factual possibilities which generates a kaleidoscope of hypothetical legal issues.indeed,the district court has specifically noted,among other things,that worldcom payment of the directors attorneys fees may support related to jurisdiction over the individual actions,notwithstanding the director and officer insurance policies held by worldcom.see in re worldcom.sec,wl,at.
we also are not convinced that the bondholders have raised a question of law.rather,to the extent the bondholders argue that there is no related to jurisdiction because it has always been evident that the various defendants claims against the worldcom estate would be valued at or near zero in any plan of reorganization,they are challenging the district court largely factual determination that these claims could conceivably affect the estate.by its plain terms,section b may only be used to challenge legal determinations.see harriscom svenska ab harris,cir 
because the issue is not properly before us,we intimate no view as to whether the bondholders claims are related to worldcom bankruptcy case notwithstanding the tenuous connection between those claims and worldcom reorganization process.instead,we assume for the purposes of this appeal that the bondholders actions are related to the bankruptcy case,and we limit our inquiry to the one question properly before us whether the district court erred when it exercised bankruptcy jurisdiction over generally nonremovable claims brought under the securities act of.
ii.the statutory conflict 
bankruptcy removal 
the bankruptcy removal provisions,and,provide that most civil actions related to a bankruptcy case may be removed to federal court.section a states 
a party may remove any claim or cause of action in a civil action other than a proceeding before the united states tax court or a civil action by a governmental unit to enforce such governmental unit police or regulatory power,to the district court for the district where such civil action is pending,if such district court has jurisdiction of such claim or cause of action under section of this title.
a.jurisdiction under section is contingent upon a civil proceeding relationship to a bankruptcy case.that section provides 
notwithstanding any act of congress that confers exclusive jurisdiction on a court or courts other than the district courts,the district courts shall have original but not exclusive jurisdiction of all civil proceedings arising under title,or arising in or related to cases under title.
b emphasis added.
these provisions were originally included in the bankruptcy reform act of reform act or bankruptcy code.see b,repealed.the senate report on the reform act explains the purpose of the provisions as follows 
this broad grant of jurisdiction will enable the bankruptcy courts to dispose of controversies that arise in bankruptcy cases or under the bankruptcy code.actions that formerly had to be tried in the state court or in the federal district court,at great cost and delay to the estate,may now be tried in the bankruptcy court.
at,reprinted in.similarly,the house report explains that the breadth conferred by the new jurisdictional provisions was intended to greatly diminish the basis for litigation of jurisdictional issues which consumes so much time,money,and energy of the bankruptcy system and of those involved in the administration of debtors affairs,at,reprinted in.in sum,sections a and b were intended to decrease the litigation costs to the estate resulting from actions arising in or related to a bankruptcy case.
in,a plurality of the supreme court concluded that c which provided for broad jurisdiction in bankruptcy courts,was unconstitutional.see northern pipeline construction marathon pipe line,d.in response,congress enacted the bankruptcy amendments and federal judgeship act of,stat.although that statute revamped the relationship between article iii judges and article i bankruptcy judges,it did not materially alter the jurisdictional scheme set forth in the reform act.see collier on bankruptcy ed.thus,sections a and b,in their current form,can properly be viewed as parts of the bankruptcy code.
b.the securities act 
the key jurisdictional provision of the act is found in section a,which provides for concurrent state and federal jurisdiction over claims under the act 
the district courts of the united states and united states courts of any territory,shall have jurisdiction of offenses and violations under this subchapter and under the rules and regulations promulgated by the commission in respect thereto,and,concurrent with state and territorial courts,except as provided in section of this title with respect to covered class actions,of all suits in equity and actions at law brought to enforce any liability or duty created by this subchapter.
see a emphasis added.section a,in addition,specifically bars removal of certain claims brought under the act 
except as provided in section c,no case arising under this subchapter and brought in any state court of competent jurisdiction shall be removed to any court of the united states.
section c of the act excepts class action s brought in state court from the scope of the nonremoval provision and provides that those class actions shall be removable to the federal district court for the district in which the action is pending.c emphasis added.moreover,section b of the act preempts a broad category of state law claims insofar as they are asserted in a securities class action 
no covered class action based upon the statutory or common law of any state or subdivision thereof may be maintained in any state or federal court by any private party alleging an untrue statement or omission of a material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security or that the defendant used or employed any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security.
b emphasis added.
section of the act,in its current form,was added to the act in,when congress enacted the securities litigation uniform standards act of slusa,stat.codified in part,a.slusa was the second major federal securities statute passed in the.in,congress had passed the private securities litigation reform act of pslra,stat.the pslra was intended to curtail strike suits,meritless class actions alleging fraud in the sale of securities.see conf.it aimed to curtail these suits by instituting,among other things,heightened pleading requirements for class actions alleging fraud in the sale of securities.see.
slusa was enacted after it became evident that the pslra had not achieved its purpose.the pslra was ineffective in eliminating strike suits in large part because class action plaintiffs were able to avoid its strictures by bringing suit in state rather than federal courts.slusa,which made federal court the exclusive venue for class actions alleging fraud in the sale of certain securities,closed this loophole in the pslra,and expanded federal jurisdiction over class actions.see generally lander hartford life annuity ins,cir detailing the history of pslra and slusa.
like the pslra,however,slusa did not in any way alter section a bar on the removal of individual securities act claims.accordingly,the statutory conflict between the bankruptcy removal statute and section a remains clear while the bankruptcy removal statute unambiguously states that any civil action brought by a private party in state court or any court besides the united states tax court may be removed to federal court if the action is related to a bankruptcy case,section a of the act states,in equally unambiguous terms,that individual actions under the act may not be removed from state court.because the bondholders have brought individual claims under the act that are presumptively related to a bankruptcy,we must resolve the conflict between the statutes.
iii.case law 
a.the district court opinion 
in a thoughtful and thorough opinion,judge cote concluded that the bankruptcy removal statute trumps section a of the act.see remand opinion,at.to reach this conclusion,judge cote relied principally on several arguments put forward by the defendants.
first,judge cote pointed out that the general removal statute,codified at a,provides except as otherwise expressly provided by an act of congress,any civil action brought in a state court of which the district courts of the united states have original jurisdiction,may be removed section a,by contrast,contains just two enumerated exceptions proceedings before the tax court and civil actions brought by the government.in judge cote view,under the principle inclusio unius est exclusio to express or include one thing implies the exclusion of the enumerated exceptions in section a must be viewed as exclusive.remand opinion,at.
next,judge cote explained that i nterpreting section to allow removal for all actions over which there is bankruptcy jurisdiction is consistent with the purpose of the bankruptcy code namely,to preserve assets so that the estate can be reorganized in an efficient manner.remand opinion,at.
finally,judge cote relied on our court decision in gonsalves amoco shipping,cir.in gonsalves,an expressly nonremovable jones act claim was joined with a claim for unseaworthiness and a maintenance and cure claim.no explicit bar to removal applied to either of the maritime claims,and diversity jurisdiction existed over the maintenance and cure claim.the defendant removed the action as a whole to federal court under c.prior to the enactment of the judicial improvements act of,stat,c provided that whenever a separate and independent claim or cause of action,which would be removable if sued upon alone,is joined with one or more otherwise claims or causes of action,the entire case may be removed c 
although we ultimately held on appeal that the maintenance and cure claim was not sufficiently separate and independent of the jones act claim to warrant removal of the jones act claim under c,see gonsalves,at,we stated first that if the joined claims were sufficiently independent to be removed under that provision,section a,which makes jones act claims nonremovable,would not override section c.see id.at.in other words,as judge cote put it,the court of appeals found that the jones act removal bar provided an express exception to removal under section a,but did not create an exception from the additional removal jurisdiction available under section c for cases that otherwise could not be removed.at.according to judge cote,a similar analysis would mean that section a bar to the removal of act claims would not prevent an action from being removed to federal court if there was a separate,appropriate basis for the removal.id.
b.other decisions 
judge cote was the first district judge to resolve the conflict between the securities act and the bankruptcy removal statute in favor of removal.many district courts to address the issue have reached the opposite conclusion.see illinois mun.ret.fund citigroup,dist.lexis,at,city of birmingham ret.relief fund citigroup,no,wl,at.consol.ret.citigroup,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.may,mcrae lykes.steamship,wl,dist.lexis,granting remand to state court because provision of jones act overrides claim of related to jurisdiction under and kinder.barge line,same.in the most extensive of these opinions,judge william haynes,of the middle district of tennessee reasoned that the conflict between the statutes should be resolved in favor of section a because it is more specific than section a.see,wl,at,dist.lexis,at citing bulova watch united states,d stating that a specific statute controls over a general one without regard to priority of enactment.the court in that case also noted that section a was amended as recently as,when congress enacted slusa.id.at,dist.lexis,at.
since judge cote declined to remand the individual actions in the instant case,two more district judges in the southern district of new york have resolved the conflict between section a and section a in favor of section a.see in re adelphia communications.sec.and derivative,mdl,wl,at,mckenna,in re global crossing.sec,civ,wl,at july,lynch.in global crossing,judge lynch explained that,although slusa was enacted in and ordinarily,the more recently enacted statute will control where it conflicts with a prior law,slusa narrow purpose was to prevent class action plaintiffs from suing in state courts.id.therefore,in judge lynch view,slusa does not reflect a recent indication of congressional intent regarding the conflict between and a.id.internal quotation marks omitted.in adelphia,judge mckenna adopted judge lynch reasoning.see adelphia,wl,at 
iv.analysis 
we review a district court denial of a motion to remand de novo.cicio does,cir.in reviewing judge cote denial of the bondholders motions to remand,we are mindful that the defendant bears the burden of demonstrating the propriety of removal.grimo blue shield of vermont,cir accord united food commercial workers union,local centermark props.meriden square,cir where,as here,jurisdiction is asserted by a defendant in a removal petition,it follows that the defendant has the burden of establishing that removal is proper.shamrock oil gas sheets.directing that removal statutes be given strict construction.based on our analysis of the securities act of and the bankruptcy removal statute,we conclude that the defendants have met their burden in the instant case.
statutory language 
construction of the relevant statutes must begin with the words of the text.saks franklin covey,cir.section a states that a party may remove any claim or cause of action in a civil action other than claims falling within two cited exceptions.a emphases added.section a,meanwhile,states that except as provided in section c,no case arising under this subchapter and brought in any state court of competent jurisdiction shall be removed to any court of the united states.a emphases added.the statutes,therefore,contain equally categorical language.while the unambiguous language of the bankruptcy removal statute permits removal of act claims that are related to a bankruptcy case,the unambiguous language of the securities act forbids removal of such claims.
the direct conflict between the statutes can not be resolved based on the familiar maxim inclusio unius est exclusio alterius.under that maxim,because section a enumerates the two narrow exceptions that it contemplates,proceedings before the tax court,and civil actions brought by the government,these are the only exceptions to removal under the bankruptcy code.under the same maxim,however,the single exception to section a,class action s brought in any state court,c,should be treated as the only exception to nonremoval under the act.in sum,the inclusio unius maxim,to the extent that it is divorced from the broader statutory framework of sections a and a,is of little value in the instant case.both section a and section a contain exceptions that would,in the absence of a direct statutory conflict,be treated as exclusive.
specificity 
despite the direct conflict between the act and the bankruptcy removal statute,the bondholders contend that we can resolve the dispute between the parties without looking beyond the language of these statutes.in particular,the bondholders claim that section a necessarily trumps section a because it is more specific than section a.we disagree.
where there is no clear intention otherwise,a specific statute will not be controlled or nullified by a general one,regardless of the priority of enactment.radzanower touche ross,d quoting morton mancari,d see also greene united states,cir when two statutes are in conflict,that statute which addresses the matter at issue in specific terms controls over a statute which addresses the issue in general terms,unless congress has manifested a contrary aim.in determining whether section a is more specific than section a,radzanower itself is instructive.at issue in that case was the proper venue for a suit brought under the act against a national banking association.radzanower,at.the venue provision of the act,allows suits to be brought in any district where the defendant transacts business or may be found,or where the violation occurred.however,the venue provision of the national bank act,provides that actions against a national banking association may be had only in the district where the association is established.see radzanower,at.in concluding that the national bank act venue provision is more specific than the act venue provision,the court reasoned 
when congress enacted the narrow venue provisions of the national bank act,it was focusing on the particularized problems of national banks that might be sued in the state or federal courts.when,years later,congress enacted the securities exchange act,its focus was on the objective of promoting fair dealing in the securities markets,and it enacted a general venue provision applicable to the broad universe of potential defendants subject to the prohibitions of that act.thus,unless a clear intention otherwise can be discerned,the principle of statutory construction discussed above counsels that the specific venue provisions of are applicable to the respondent bank in this case.
having concluded that the venue provision of the national bank act is more specific than the venue provision of the act,the supreme court went on to determine that,when it enacted the act,congress did not express a clear intention to repeal the national bank act venue provision by implication.the court explained that a general statute will not be construed to repeal a specific statute by implication in the absence of an irreconcilable conflict between the statutes.id.at.because,in the court view,application of to securities actions against banking associations will not unduly interfere with the operation of the securities exchange act,there is no irreconcilable conflict between the act and the national bank act,and the more specific statute controls.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.
based on the principles of statutory interpretation articulated in radzanower,we can not conclude that section a is more specific than section a.first,unlike the national bank act venue provision,which applies to a defined group of litigants,section a,like both section a and the act venue provision,applies to a defined class of claims.thus,the supreme court distinction between a statute applicable to a broad universe of potential defendants and a statute that protects a particularized group of defendants,id.at,carries no weight here.
additionally,the class of claims covered by section a is no more specific than the class of claims covered by section a.section a does not cover only a subset of the claims covered by section a.by the same token,section a does not cover only a subset of the claims covered by section a.rather,just as section a applies to many claims that are not brought under the act,section a applies to many claims that are not related to a bankruptcy.
in that respect,it is instructive to compare section a to the general removal statute,which,except as otherwise expressly provided by act of congress,permits removal of any civil action brought in a state court of which the district courts of the united states have original jurisdiction a.even without the introductory clause in section a,section a would arguably trump that provision on the ground that section a is more specific than section a that is,section a applies to only one subset of those actions over which the district courts of the united states have original jurisdiction,while section a covers the whole universe of such actions.by contrast,section a does not cover only a subset of the universe of claims that are related to a bankruptcy case rather,it applies to numerous claims that are in no way related to a bankruptcy,just as section a applies to numerous claims that are not brought under the act.
finally,even if we were to conclude that section a covers a more specific group of claims than section a,section a would not necessarily control.the supreme court in radzanower indicated that where the application of a specific statute would unduly interfere with the operation of a general statute that was enacted subsequent to the specific statute,the more general statute controls.see radzanower,at.in radzanower,however,the court determined that the national bank act venue provision would not unduly interfere with the operation of the act,because the provision will have no impact whatever upon the vast majority of lawsuits brought under that act and i n the tiny fraction of litigation where its effect will be felt,it will foreclose nobody from invoking the act provisions.id.
we are not so sanguine about section a effect on the system created by the bankruptcy code.when congress enacted section a in,fifty years after it first enacted section a,congress intended to grant comprehensive jurisdiction to bankruptcy courts so that they might deal efficiently and expeditiously with all matters connected with the bankruptcy estate.celotex edwards,d emphasis added and internal quotation marks omitted.therefore,congress crafted section a to allow removal in a broad array of situations.first,unlike section a,which authorizes defendants to remove,the bankruptcy removal statute authorizes any party,including plaintiffs,to remove.see a.second,because any one party can remove under section a,removal under that provision,unlike removal under section a,does not require the unanimous consent of the defendants.see creasy coleman furniture,cir.third,whereas the general removal statute,a,contemplates removal only from state court,there is no such limitation in section a.see,quality tooling,united states,holding that removal of an action from the court of federal claims to federal district court was proper under section a.accordingly,in its every detail,section a is designed to further congress purpose of centralizing bankruptcy litigation in a federal forum.see in re cuyahoga equip,cir noting the strong bankruptcy code policy that favors centralized and efficient administration of all claims in the bankruptcy court in re pan am,cir similar.
were section a construed to trump section a,section a could interfere with the operation of the bankruptcy code,especially in large chapter cases.celotex,at.noting that related to jurisdiction may extend more broadly when it concerns a reorganization under chapter as opposed to a liquidation under chapter.when a debtor seeks to reorganize,as worldcom has,its plan of reorganization must resolve all lawfully pending liabilities,and,to do so,the plan must marshal and allocate all of the debtor assets.regardless of whether the defendants contribution or indemnification claims in this particular case ultimately had a material impact on worldcom final plan of reorganization,it is apparent that contribution and indemnification claims can,in some circumstances,affect the administration of a bankrupt estate.in re enron,derivative erisa litigation,no,wl,at,predicting a significant impact on enron bankrupt estate should morgan potential claims for indemnity and contribution against enron succeed.because,in any given case,the full amount of damages sought under the act can be the basis for a claim against the estate,the policy underlying section a applies with full force to claims under the act.section a dictates that these claims,when they are brought against defendants with contribution rights,should not be subject to conflicting outcomes along with repetitive and discovery proceedings in multiple state courts.
in sum,because section a does not cover a narrower class of claims than section a,it can not be considered more specific than section a.moreover,even if section a were more specific than section a,radzanower counsels that,because section a could interfere with the operation of the bankruptcy code,it would not necessarily control.
rule of recency 
the bondholders argue further that section a,which was amended by slusa in,trumps section a,which was enacted in,because section a is the more recently enacted statute.once again,we disagree.
it is well established that when two statutes are in irreconcilable conflict,we must give effect to the most recently enacted statute since it is the most recent indication of congressional intent.in re ionosphere clubs,cir.however,it is also well established that repeals by implication of jurisdictional statutes are disfavored.henderson ins,cir.based on the second principle,the mere fact that section a was amended in is not particularly probative in order to convince us that section a trumps section a as a result of slusa,the bondholders would need to show that,when it enacted slusa,congress intended to give individual plaintiffs an absolute choice of forum for claims brought under the act.
the bondholders can not make this showing,because nothing in the text or legislative history of slusa indicates that congress intended to alter the jurisdictional scheme applicable to individual actions under the act.indeed,given congress focus in on expanding federal jurisdiction,i t would be ironic to read slusa as implicitly contracting federal jurisdiction by reversing,without comment in either text or legislative history,the bankruptcy remov
