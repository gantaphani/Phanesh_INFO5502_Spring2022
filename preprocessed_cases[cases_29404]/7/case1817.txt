background 
debtors filed a chapter petition in february.at the time,debtors were attorneys actively practicing law under the law partnership of scovis and scovis.the case was converted to chapter in august of,and their discharge was granted on march.
during the chapter case,creditor christen brun henrichsen obtained a judgment declaring debtors debt to him,on a state court judgment obtained in,under a.in an unpublished memorandum disposition,this court affirmed.
in september,arthur scovis underwent quadruple bypass surgery and was also diagnosed with severe diabetes.soon after,debtors filed a chapter petition.debtors voluntarily dismissed the petition in march because they wished to resolve certain claim litigation outside of the chapter arena,intending to later if necessary.
the second and current chapter petition was filed on october.an amended petition was filed on november,in which the nature of debt was changed from business to,the estimated number of creditors was decreased,the estimated liabilities were increased,and the signature of their attorney was added.the only schedule of debts filed by debtors are those submitted with the amended petition.
in the real property schedule,schedule a,debtors valued their residence at,encumbered by a first trust deed in favor of great western bank of along with the henrichsen judgment lien of.in the property claimed as exempt schedule,schedule c,debtors listed a homestead exemption,allowed under california law.see a.henrichsen was listed again,this time under the creditors holding secured claims schedule,schedule d,as having secured by the residence.a priority claim of for irs payroll taxes,and general unsecured claims of were listed on the creditors holding unsecured priority claims and creditors holding unsecured nonpriority claims schedules,schedules e and f,respectively.
in addition,debtors,under schedule d,listed as secured a debt of to mary scovis,arthur scovis mother,for a loan she made to debtors for the purchase of an automobile.however,no written security agreement was ever executed,nor was mary scovis ever listed as a lienholder on the title to the car.about a year after the petition date,while the confirmation was being contested before the bankruptcy court,debtors filed a declaration from mary scovis in which she purportedly waived any claim on the loan.
before the bankruptcy court,henrichsen objected to confirmation of debtors chapter plan on several grounds.he asserted that debtors did not propose their plan in good faith and specifically,that debtors were misusing the automatic stay to avoid a judgment,that their schedules were inaccurate,and that their proposed payments were inadequate.thereafter,debtors amended schedule f to delete three creditors who had been paid by insurance or other sources,which lowered the general unsecured debt owed from to.according to the numbers,the deletion of the three creditors should have resulted in an overall general unsecured debt reduction of,not.a comparison of schedule f and amended schedule f show that debtors altered the amount they owed for federal income taxes and penalties from down to.oddly,there is no indication in the record that debtors actually paid to the irs the difference.it is the combined and figures that reflect the general unsecured debt reduction of.furthermore,on debtors motion,henrichsen judgment lien against their residence was avoided by order entered on april.
in september,henrichsen further objected to confirmation,arguing that debtors fail to meet chapter eligibility requirements.at a hearing held october,the bankruptcy court confirmed debtors chapter plan.in deciding that debtors met the statutory debt limits set forth in e,the bankruptcy court treated henrichsen lien as partially secured by the value of debtors home in excess of the first deed of trust,notwithstanding the homestead exemption.the court also concluded that henrichsen did not meet his burden of proof to overcome debtors showing that their chapter plan had been proposed in good faith.on november,the bankruptcy court filed a written order reiterating its october,eligibility ruling.
henrichsen moved for reconsideration,arguing that the bankruptcy court had never ruled on his objection to debtors expenses.the court agreed to entertain argument on that issue at a continued confirmation hearing,and in january conditioned confirmation on the reduction of some budget items,but denied henrichsen objection to confirmation.on february,debtors filed an amended chapter plan,reflecting those reductions in expense items.henrichsen again objected to confirmation.at a hearing held march,the bankruptcy court confirmed debtors amended plan and entered an order to that effect on march.
on appeal,the bap determined that debtors homestead exemption rendered henrichsen claim completely unsecured for purposes of e eligibility.furthermore,the bap found that if the debt owed to mary scovis is considered unsecured,then the total unsecured debt would total.see scovis,at.the bap used the following figures in arriving at this total henrichsen debt,general unsecured debt,priority unsecured debt irs payroll taxes,and mary scovis debt.the bap reversed the bankruptcy court confirmation of the chapter plan,and remanded the case to the bankruptcy court to make factual determinations as to whether the mary scovis debt is unsecured and for findings regarding debtors good faith if they are eligible under e.
ii.standard of review 
we review decisions of the bap de novo.see in re filtercorp,cir.the bankruptcy court findings of fact are reviewed for clear error and conclusions of law are reviewed de novo.id.
iii.jurisdiction 
we have jurisdiction to review final orders of the bap under d.see in re kelly,cir.the bap renders a final order when it affirms or reverses a bankruptcy court final order.id.however,the bap order is ordinarily not final when the bap remands for further factual findings related to a central issue raised on appeal.id.
given the unique nature of bankruptcy proceedings,however,we have taken a pragmatic approach by balancing several policies in determining whether a remand order may be considered final,including the need to avoid piecemeal litigation judicial efficiency systemic interest in preserving the bankruptcy court role as the finder of fact and whether delaying review would cause either party irreparable harm.see lundell anchor constr.specialists,cir.
we have acknowledged two narrow exceptions to the general finality rule.we may assert jurisdiction even though the bap has remanded a matter for factual findings on a central issue if that issue is legal in nature and its resolution either could dispose of the case or proceedings and obviate the need for factfinding or would materially aid the bankruptcy court in reaching its disposition on remand.id.
debtors raise three issues on appeal.first,they contest the bap determination that,due to the homestead exemption,henrichsen entire claim is unsecured.second,they argue that the mary scovis automobile loan should not be classified as unsecured debt.third,they contend that the irs payroll tax should be disregarded since it was erroneously included in the schedules and because the tax has since been paid.
here,jurisdiction hinges on the mary scovis claim since it is the only claim that was both remanded to the bankruptcy court for further inquiry and appealed to this court.because debtors unsecured debt obligation,as determined by the bap,barely exceeds,the bankruptcy court findings on remand as to the mary scovis claim could result in chapter eligibility.
this is one of those rare instances where we may assert jurisdiction even though the bap has remanded a matter for factual findings on a central issue.by appealing the mary scovis debt,debtors have implicated an important legal question that would likely dispose of the case and obviate the need for further factfinding.see lundell,at.in short,this legal question is in deciding whether debtors aggregated unsecured debt is within the statutory limit for chapter eligibility,may the bankruptcy court look beyond the originally filed schedules in so calculating debtors would have us believe that the mary scovis debt should not enter the determination because it was withdrawn a year after the petition was filed.to agree with this argument is to implicitly condone looking beyond the originally filed schedules to determine eligibility.this timing issue infects the entire eligibility calculation,and will likely obviate the need for further fact finding on the mary scovis debt.for instance,although the original schedules listed in general unsecured debt,the bap used a figure of from amended schedule f,reflecting the amount of general unsecured debt remaining after had purportedly been paid off subsequent to the filing of the schedules.debtors also argue that the irs payroll taxes should be removed from consideration since that debt has now been satisfied,even though they were listed on the originally filed schedules.
having found jurisdiction,we now proceed to examine the issues on appeal.
iv.chapter eligibility 
timing of eligibility 
e states that o nly an individual with regular income that owes,on the date of the filing of the petition,noncontingent,liquidated,unsecured debts of less than may be a debtor under chapter of this title.the bap decision purports to endorse in the matter of pearson,cir,in which the sixth circuit held that chapter eligibility should normally be determined by the debtor schedules checking only to see if the schedules were made in good faith.however,the bap quickly qualifies its endorsement by stating that a bankruptcy court should look past the schedules to other evidence submitted when a good faith objection to the debtor eligibility has been brought by a party in interest.scovis,at quoting in re quintana,bap cir,aff,cir.although we affirmed the bap in quintana,we assumed without argument that chapter eligibility should be decided using the date of debtor petition.see quintana,at the parties do not dispute the use of the date of debtors petition for the purpose of determining debtors eligibility under chapter.
in tallying up the various unsecured debt in the scovis petition,however,it becomes entirely unclear what law the bap is applying.see scovis,at.for the henrichsen debt,the bap used the debt at the time the petition was filed,yet went beyond the schedules to consider accrued interest for the general unsecured debt,the bap used a figure that was nearly half that of the debt listed on the originally filed schedules for the mary scovis debt,the bap remanded but gave no instruction as to whether mary scovis declaration,submitted a year after the initial petition,and which purported to waive any claim to unsecured debt,should be included in the bankruptcy court fact finding consideration on remand.see id.at.
in in re slack,cir,we recently considered the timing aspect of e for eligibility determination purposes.there,we held that a final judgment entered in state court in an insurer civil action against debtor,after the debtor chapter petition was filed,could not be considered in deciding the amount of debt owed to the insurer for purposes of determining eligibility for relief.see id.at.
prior to filing for bankruptcy relief,slack was a defendant in a tort action in which a california state judge had entered a tentative decision that slack was jointly and severally liable to plaintiff wilshire in the amount of.soon after,slack filed for bankruptcy under chapter.creditor wilshire argued that slack was ineligible for chapter relief because the state court tentative ruling established that slack had a noncontingent,liquidated,unsecured debt which exceeded the statutory limit.slack,on the other hand,argued that this debt was unliquidated.the parties had stipulated to the amount of damages wilshire actually suffered before the state and the bankruptcy courts,which totaled.based on the stipulation of damages,the bankruptcy court dismissed slack petition,finding that his noncontingent,liquidated,unsecured debt exceeded the statutory limit.see id.at.
by the time slack reached this court on appeal,the state court had entered final judgment in favor of wilshire,definitively holding slack jointly and severally liable for plus interest.wilshire,thereafter,filed a motion for this court to take judicial notice of the state court judgment for purposes of determining chapter eligibility.see id.we refused to do so because the judgment was entered after the bankruptcy petition was filed.in so deciding,we cited to and implicitly adopted the sixth circuit holding in pearson that the bankruptcy court should normally look to the petition to determine the amount of debt owed,checking only to see that the schedules were made in good faith.see slack,at.as articulated in pearson,this rule finds its grounding in both the text of e and congressional intent,and is similar in nature to the subject matter jurisdiction context for purposes of determining diversity jurisdiction.see pearson,at.
we now simply and explicitly state the rule for determining chapter eligibility under e to be that eligibility should normally be determined by the debtor originally filed schedules,checking only to see if the schedules were made in good faith.because the bap decision is premised upon an incorrect application of pearson,as well as an incorrect interpretation of the eligibility requirements for chapter relief,we must reverse its decision and assess eligibility de novo.
eligibility calculation 
the henrichsen debt 
although the bankruptcy court computed of the henrichsen debt as secured by the residence,henrichsen argues that the entire claim is unsecured for eligibility purposes.we agree.
in schedule a,debtors valued their residence at,encumbered by a first trust deed in favor of great western bank of as well as the henrichsen judgment lien of.in schedule c,debtors listed a homestead exemption,allowed under california law.see a.henrichsen was listed again,this time under schedule d,showing of the judgment lien as unsecured.although debtors clearly recognized that at least of the henrichsen judgment lien was undersecured debt,debtors failed to list this amount as an unsecured claim under schedule 
to determine the status of henrichsen claim,we must look to a.through the inclusion of a a analysis to define secured and unsecured in the e context,a vast majority of courts,and all circuit courts that have considered the issue,have held that the unsecured portion of undersecured debt is counted as unsecured for e eligibility purposes.see,in re balbus,cir miller united states,cir in the matter of day,cir soderlund,at bap cir.section a provides in pertinent part 
an allowed claim of a creditor secured by a lien on property in which the estate has an interest,or that is subject to setoff under section of this title,is an unsecured claim to the extent that the value of such creditor interest or the amount so subject to setoff is less than the amount of such allowed claim.
it is true that although a speaks in terms of an allowed claim,applying a to e is necessary to prevent raising form over substance and manipulation of the debt limits to achieve chapter eligibility.soderlund,at.by merely looking at the value of debtors residence,the first deed trust,and the judgment lien,it is clear that henrichsen judgment lien is undersecured to a significant extent.the listed value of debtors residence is.after considering the first deed trust,only remains as possible equity to which liens could attach.since henrichsen judgment lien is for,at least of the judgment lien is undersecured.there is no question that this undersecured debt is to be counted as unsecured for eligibility purposes.
