debtors filing for protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code must agree to a plan under which they pay creditors out of their future income.if the bankruptcy trustee or an unsecured creditor objects,a bankruptcy court may not approve the plan unless it provides for the full repayment of unsecured claims or provides that all of the debtor projected disposable income to be received over the plan duration will be applied to make payments in accordance with plan terms.b.before enactment of the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of bapcpa,the code loosely defined disposable income.though it did not define projected disposable income,most bankruptcy courts calculated it using a mechanical approach,multiplying monthly income by the number of months in the plan and then determining the disposable portion of the result.in exceptional cases,those courts also took into account foreseeable changes in a debtor income or expenses.bapcpa defines disposable income as current monthly income received by the debtor less amounts reasonably necessary to be expended for,the debtor maintenance and support.b a i.current monthly income,in turn,is calculated by averaging the debtor monthly income during a period preceding the petition filing.see a i.if a debtor income is below the median for his or her state,amounts reasonably necessary include the full amount needed for maintenance or support,see b a i,but if the debtor income exceeds the state median,only certain specified expenses are included,see b,b a.
a buyout from respondent former employer caused her current monthly income for the six months preceding her chapter petition to exceed her state median income.however,based on the income from her new job,which was below the state median,and her expenses,she reported a monthly disposable income of.she thus filed a plan that would have required her to pay per month for months.petitioner,the chapter trustee,objected to confirmation of the plan because the proposed payment amount was less than the full amount of the claims against respondent,and because she had not committed all of her projected disposable income to repaying creditors.petitioner claimed that the mechanical approach was the proper way to calculate projected disposable income,and that using that approach,respondent should pay per month for months.her actual income was insufficient to make such payments.
the bankruptcy court endorsed a payment over a period,concluding that projected requires courts to consider the debtor actual income.the tenth circuit bankruptcy appellate panel affirmed,as did the tenth circuit,which held that a court calculating projected disposable income should begin with the presumption that the figure yielded by the mechanical approach is correct,but that this figure may be rebutted by evidence of a substantial change in the debtor circumstances.
held when a bankruptcy court calculates a debtor projected disposable income,the court may account for changes in the debtor income or expenses that are known or virtually certain at the time of confirmation.
a respondent has the better interpretation of projected disposable income.first,such a approach is supported by the ordinary meaning of projected.see asgrow seed winterboer.in ordinary usage future occurrences are not projected based on the assumption that the past will necessarily repeat itself.while a projection takes past events into account,adjustments are often made based on other factors that may affect the outcome.second,projected appears in many federal statutes,yet congress rarely uses it to mean simple multiplication.see,b b.by contrast,as the bankruptcy code shows,congress can make its mandate of simple multiplication unambiguous commonly using the term multiplied.see,b.third,under case law,the general rule was that courts would multiply a debtor current monthly income by the number of months in the commitment period as the first step in determining projected disposable income,but would also have discretion to account for known or virtually certain changes in the debtor income.this is significant,since the court will not read the bankruptcy code to erode past bankruptcy practice absent a clear indication that congress intended such a departure,travelers casualty surety of america pacific gas,and congress did not amend the term projected disposable income in.
b the mechanical approach also clashes with terms.first,b b reference to projected disposable income to be received in the applicable commitment period strongly favors the approach.because respondent would have far less than per month in disposable income during the plan period,petitioner projection does not accurately reflect disposable income to be received.in such circumstances,the mechanical approach effectively reads that phrase out of the statute.second,b direction to courts to determine projected disposable income as of the effective date of the plan,the confirmation date is more consistent with the view that they are to consider postfiling information about a debtor financial situation.had congress intended for projected disposable income to be no more than a multiple of disposable income,it could have specified the plan filing date as the effective date.third,b b requirement that projected disposable income will be applied to make payments is rendered a hollow command if,as of the plan effective date,the debtor lacks the means to pay creditors in the calculated monthly amounts.
c the arguments supporting the mechanical approach are unpersuasive.the claim that the code detailed and precise disposable income definition would have no purpose without the mechanical approach overlooks the important role that this statutory formula plays under the approach,which begins with a disposable income calculation.the tenth circuit rebuttable presumption analysis simply heeds the ordinary meaning of projected.this court rejects petitioner argument that only the mechanical approach is consistent with a b,which refers to projected disposable income of the debtor as defined in section b.and the court declines to infer from the fact that b incorporates which allows courts to consider special circumstances,but only with respect to calculating expenses that congress intended to eliminate,sub silentio,the discretion that courts previously exercised to account for known or virtually certain changes.
d petitioner proposed strategies for avoiding or mitigating the harsh results that the mechanical approach may produce for debtors a debtor could delay filing a petition so as to place any extraordinary income outside the period a debtor with unusually high income during that period could seek leave to delay filing a schedule of current income and ask the bankruptcy court to select a period more representative of the debtor future disposable income a debtor could dismiss the petition and refile at a later,more favorable date and respondent might have been able to obtain relief by filing under chapter or converting her chapter petition to one under chapter are all flawed.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit 
justice alito delivered the opinion of the court.
chapter of the bankruptcy code provides bankruptcy protection to individual s with regular income whose debts fall within statutory limits,e.unlike debtors who file under chapter and must liquidate their nonexempt assets in order to pay creditors,see a,chapter debtors are permitted to keep their property,but they must agree to a plan under which they pay creditors out of their future income,see b,a,a.a bankruptcy trustee oversees the filing and execution of a chapter debtor plan.a see also a.
section of title specifies circumstances under which a bankruptcy court shall and may not confirm a plan.a,b.if an unsecured creditor or the bankruptcy trustee objects to confirmation,b requires the debtor either to pay unsecured creditors in full or to pay all projected disposable income to be received by the debtor over the duration of the plan.
we granted certiorari to decide how a bankruptcy court should calculate a debtor projected disposable income.some lower courts have taken what the parties term the mechanical approach,while most have adopted what has been called the approach.we hold that the approach is correct.
as previously noted,provides that if a trustee or an unsecured creditor objects to a chapter debtor plan,a bankruptcy court may not approve the plan unless it provides for the full repayment of unsecured claims or provides that all of the debtor projected disposable income to be received over the duration of the plan will be applied to make payments in accordance with the terms of the plan.b see also b ed.before the enactment of the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of bapcpa,stat,the bankruptcy code code loosely defined disposable income as income which is received by the debtor and which is not reasonably necessary to be expended for the maintenance or support of the debtor,for qualifying charitable contributions,or for business expenditures.b a,b.
the code did not define the term projected disposable income,and in most cases,bankruptcy courts used a mechanical approach in calculating projected disposable income.that is,they first multiplied monthly income by the number of months in the plan and then determined what portion of the result was excess or disposable.see lundin,chapter bankruptcy,and ed.hereinafter lundin ed.citing cases.
in exceptional cases,however,bankruptcy courts took into account foreseeable changes in a debtor income or expenses.see in re heath,bkrtcy.app.panel in re richardson,bkrtcy.tr.of oral arg.accord,lundin,at ed.the debtor should take some care to project estimated future income on schedule i to include anticipated increases or decreases in income so that the schedule will be consistent with any evidence of income the debtor would offer at a contested confirmation hearing 
bapcpa left the term projected disposable income undefined but specified in some detail how disposable income is to be calculated.disposable income is now defined as current monthly income received by the debtor less amounts reasonably necessary to be expended for the debtor maintenance and support,for qualifying charitable contributions,and for business expenditures.b a i and ii ed.current monthly income,in turn,is calculated by averaging the debtor monthly income during what the parties refer to as the period,which generally consists of the six full months preceding the filing of the bankruptcy petition.see a i the phrase amounts reasonably necessary to be expended in b is also newly defined.for a debtor whose income is below the median for his or her state,the phrase includes the full amount needed for maintenance or support,see b a i,but for a debtor with income that exceeds the state median,only certain specified expenses are included see b,b a.
respondent had in unsecured debt when she filed for chapter bankruptcy protection in october.in the six months before her filing,she received a buyout from her former employer,and this payment greatly inflated her gross income for april to and for may to.app.as a result of these payments,respondent current monthly income,as averaged from april through october,was a figure that exceeds the median income for a family of one in kansas.see,at.respondent monthly expenses,calculated pursuant to b,were,at.she reported a monthly disposable income of on form.ibid.
on the form used for reporting monthly income schedule i,she reported income from her new job of per month which is below the state median,at see also,at.on the form used for reporting monthly expenses schedule j,she reported actual monthly expenses of,at.subtracting the schedule j figure from the schedule i figure resulted in monthly disposable income of.
respondent filed a plan that would have required her to pay per month for months.see,at.petitioner,a private chapter trustee,objected to confirmation of the plan because the amount respondent proposed to pay was less than the full amount of the claims against her,see b a,and because,in petitioner view,respondent was not committing all of her projected disposable income to the repayment of creditors,see b b.according to petitioner,the proper way to calculate projected disposable income was simply to multiply disposable income,as calculated on form,by the number of months in the commitment period.employing this mechanical approach,petitioner calculated that creditors would be paid in full if respondent made monthly payments of for a period of months,at.there is no dispute that respondent actual income was insufficient to make payments in that amount.tr.of oral arg.
the bankruptcy court endorsed respondent proposed monthly payment of but required a plan period,wl,bkrtcy.the court agreed with the majority view that the word projected in b b requires courts to consider at confirmation the debtor actual income as it was reported on schedule at emphasis added.this conclusion was warranted by the text of b,the bankruptcy court reasoned,and was necessary to avoid the absurd result of denying bankruptcy protection to individuals with deteriorating finances in the six months before filing.ibid.
petitioner appealed to the tenth circuit bankruptcy appellate panel,which affirmed.the panel noted that,although congress redefined disposable income in,it chose not to alter the term projected disposable income.at.thus,the panel concluded,there was no reason to believe that congress intended to alter the practice under which bankruptcy courts determined projected disposable income by reference to schedules i and j but considered other evidence when there was reason to believe that the schedules did not reflect a debtor actual ability to pay.ibid.
the tenth circuit affirmed.according to the tenth circuit,a court,in calculating projected disposable income,should begin with the presumption that the figure yielded by the mechanical approach is correct,but the court concluded that this figure may be rebutted by evidence of a substantial change in the debtor circumstances,at.
this petition followed,and we granted certiorari.
the parties differ sharply in their interpretation of reference to projected disposable income.petitioner,advocating the mechanical approach,contends that projected disposable income means past average monthly disposable income multiplied by the number of months in a debtor plan.respondent,who favors the approach,agrees that the method outlined by petitioner should be determinative in most cases,but she argues that in exceptional cases,where significant changes in a debtor financial circumstances are known or virtually certain,a bankruptcy court has discretion to make an appropriate adjustment.respondent has the stronger argument.
first,respondent argument is supported by the ordinary meaning of the term projected.when terms used in a statute are undefined,we give them their ordinary meaning.asgrow seed winterboer.here,the term projected is not defined,and in ordinary usage future occurrences are not projected based on the assumption that the past will necessarily repeat itself.for example,projections concerning a company future sales or the future cash flow from a license take into account anticipated events that may change past trends.see,tellabs,makor issues rights,describing adjustments to projected sales in light of falling demand innovair aviation,united states,fed.cl,calculating projected cash flow and noting that past sales are not necessarily the number of sales that will be made in the future.on the night of an election,experts do not project the percentage of the votes that a candidate will receive by simply assuming that the candidate will get the same percentage as he or she won in the first few reporting precincts.and sports analysts do not project that a team winning percentage at the end of a new season will be the same as the team winning percentage last year or the team winning percentage at the end of the first month of competition.while a projection takes past events into account,adjustments are often made based on other factors that may affect the final outcome.see in re kibbe,bkrtcy.app.panel contrasting multiplied,which requires only mathematical acumen,with projected,which requires mathematic acumen adjusted by deliberation and discretion 
second,the word projected appears in many federal statutes,yet congress rarely has used it to mean simple multiplication.for example,the agricultural adjustment act of defined projected national yield,projected county yield,and projected farm yield as entailing historical averages adjusted for abnormal weather conditions,trends in yields,and any significant changes in production practices.b b,j,k 
by contrast,we need look no further than the bankruptcy code to see that when congress wishes to mandate simple multiplication,it does so unambiguously most commonly by using the term multiplied.see,b current monthly income,when multiplied by b,b,a same b a i,b iv multiplied by accord,b b multiplied by the number of months in such year a multiplied by such individual total service f multiplied by the number of months in such year 
third,case law points in favor of the approach.prior to bapcpa,the general rule was that courts would multiply a debtor current monthly income by the number of months in the commitment period as the first step in determining projected disposable income.see,in re killough,per curiam in re anderson,in re solomon.see lundin,at ed.most courts focus on the debtor current income and extend current income and expenditures over the life of the plan to calculate projected disposable income but courts also had discretion to account for known or virtually certain changes in the debtor income.see heath,at richardson,at in re james,bkrtcy.idaho in re jobe,bkrtcy.wd in re crompton,bkrtcy.ed see also in re schyma,bkrtcy.t he prospect of dividends is not so certain as to require debtors or the court to consider them as regular or disposable income in re krull,bkrtcy.since there are no changes in income which can be clearly foreseen,the court must simply multiply the debtor current disposable income by in order to determine his projected income this judicial discretion was well documented in contemporary bankruptcy treatises.see collier on bankruptcy a,ed.hereinafter collier as a practical matter,unless there are changes which can be clearly foreseen,the court must simply multiply the debtor known monthly income by and determine whether the amount to be paid under the plan equals or exceeds that amount emphasis added norton,bankruptcy law and practice,it has been held that the court should focus upon present monthly income and expenditures and,absent extraordinary circumstances,project these current amounts over the life of the plan to determine projected disposable income emphasis added lundin,at to ed.describing how reported decisions treated anticipated changes in income,particularly where such changes were too speculative to be projected see also in re greer,bkrtcy.cd as a practical matter,unless there are changes which can be clearly foreseen,the court must simply multiply the debtor current monthly income by quoting collier a ed.james,supra,at same quoting collier a ed.crompton,supra,at same citing collier a,b,at to ed.accord,collier b,at ed.as with the income side of the budget,the court must simply use the debtor current expenses,unless a change in them is virtually certain emphasis added.indeed,petitioner concedes that courts possessed this discretion prior to bapcpa.tr.of oral arg.
bankruptcy practice is telling because we will not read the bankruptcy code to erode past bankruptcy practice absent a clear indication that congress intended such a departure.travelers casualty surety of america pacific gas,lamie united states trustee,cohen de la cruz,see also grogan garner,kelly robinson.congress did not amend the term projected disposable income in,and bankruptcy practice reflected a widely acknowledged and view that courts may take into account known or virtually certain changes to debtors income or expenses when projecting disposable income.in light of this historical practice,we would expect that,had congress intended for projected to carry a specialized and indeed,unusual meaning in chapter,congress would have said so expressly,c a,b expressly defining projected earnings as reflecting a historical average.
the mechanical approach also clashes repeatedly with the terms of.
first,b b reference to projected disposable income to be received in the applicable commitment period strongly favors the approach.there is no dispute that respondent would in fact receive far less than per month in disposable income during the plan period,so petitioner projection does not accurately reflect income to be received during that period.see in re nowlin.the mechanical approach effectively reads this phrase out of the statute when a debtor current disposable income is substantially higher than the income that the debtor predictably will receive during the plan period.see kawaauhau geiger,w e are hesitant to adopt an interpretation of a congressional enactment which renders superfluous another portion of that same law internal quotation marks omitted.
second,b directs courts to determine projected disposable income as of the effective date of the plan,which is the date on which the plan is confirmed and becomes binding,see a.had congress intended for projected disposable income to be nothing more than a multiple of disposable income in all cases,we see no reason why congress would not have required courts to determine that value as of the filing date of the plan.see fed.rule bkrtcy.proc.b requiring that a plan be filed within days of the filing of a petition,online at all internet materials as visited june,and available in clerk of court case file.in the very next section of the code,for example,congress specified that a debtor shall commence payments not later than days after the date of the filing of the plan.a emphasis added.congress decision to require courts to measure projected disposable income as of the effective date of the plan is more consistent with the view that congress expected courts to consider postfiling information about the debtor financial circumstances.see,at d etermining whether or not a debtor has committed all projected disposable income to repayment of the unsecured creditors as of the effective date of the plan suggests consideration of the debtor actual financial circumstances as of the effective date of the plan 
third,the requirement that projected disposable income will be applied to make payments is most naturally read to contemplate that the debtor will actually pay creditors in the calculated monthly amounts.b b.but when,as of the effective date of a plan,the debtor lacks the means to do so,this language is rendered a hollow command.
the arguments advanced in favor of the mechanical approach are unpersuasive.noting that the code now provides a detailed and precise definition of disposable income,proponents of the mechanical approach maintain that any departure from this method leaves that definition with no apparent purpose.in re kagenveama.this argument overlooks the important role that the statutory formula for calculating disposable income plays under the approach.as the tenth circuit recognized in this case,a court taking the approach should begin by calculating disposable income,and in most cases,nothing more is required.it is only in unusual cases that a court may go further and take into account other known or virtually certain information about the debtor future income or expenses 
petitioner faults the tenth circuit for referring to a rebuttable presumption that the figure produced by the mechanical approach accurately represents a debtor projected disposable income.see,at.petitioner notes that the code makes no reference to any such presumption but that related code provisions expressly create other rebuttable presumptions.see b a i and b i.he thus suggests that the tenth circuit improperly supplemented the text of the code.
the tenth circuit analysis,however,simply heeds the ordinary meaning of the term projected.as noted,a person making a projection uses past occurrences as a starting point,and that is precisely what the tenth circuit prescribed.see,nowlin,supra,at.
petitioner argues that only the mechanical approach is consistent with a b,which refers to projected disposable income of the debtor as defined in section b.this,petitioner argues,shows that congress intended for the term projected disposable income to incorporate,presumably in all contexts,the defined term disposable income.it is evident that a b refers to the defined term disposable income,see b,but that fact offers no insight into the meaning of the word projected in a b and b b.we fail to see how that word acquires a specialized meaning as a result of this particularly where both a b and b b refer to projected disposable income to be received during the relevant period.see supra,at.
petitioner also notes that allows courts to take special circumstances into consideration,but that b incorporates only with respect to calculating expenses.see in re wilson,bkrtcy.mdnc.thus,he argues,a special circumstances exception should not be inferred with respect to the debtor income.we decline to infer from incorporation of that congress intended to eliminate,sub silentio,the discretion that courts previously exercised when projecting disposable income to account for known or virtually certain changes.accord,in re liverman,and bkrtcy.nj.
in cases in which a debtor disposable income during the period is either substantially lower or higher than the debtor disposable income during the plan period,the mechanical approach would produce senseless results that we do not think congress intended.in cases in which the debtor disposable income is higher during the plan period,the mechanical approach would deny creditors payments that the debtor could easily make.and where,as in the present case,the debtor disposable income during the plan period is substantially lower,the mechanical approach would deny the protection of chapter to debtors who meet the chapter main eligibility requirements.here,for example,respondent is an individual whose income is sufficiently stable and regular to allow her to make payments under a plan,and her debts fall below the limits set out in e.but if the mechanical approach were used,she could not file a confirmable plan.under a,a plan can not be confirmed unless the debtor will be able to make all payments under the plan and comply with the plan.and as petitioner concedes,respondent could not possibly make the payments that the mechanical approach prescribes.
in order to avoid or at least to mitigate the harsh results that the mechanical approach may produce for debtors,petitioner advances several possible escape strategies.he proposes no comparable strategies for creditors harmed by the mechanical approach,and in any event none of the maneuvers that he proposes for debtors is satisfactory.
petitioner first suggests that a debtor may delay filing a petition so as to place any extraordinary income outside the period.we see at least two problems with this proposal.
first,delay is often not a viable option for a debtor sliding into bankruptcy.
potential chapter debtors typically find a lawyer office when they are one step from financial armageddon there is a foreclosure sale of the debtor home the next day the debtor only car was mysteriously repossessed in the dark of last night a garnishment has reduced the debtor pay below the ordinary requirements of food and rent.instantaneous relief is expected,if not necessary.lundin brown,chapter bankruptcy ed,http subscriber chapter.
see also,debtor counsel often has little discretion when to file the chapter case 
second,even when a debtor is able to delay filing a petition,such delay could be risky if it gives the appearance of bad faith.see a requiring,as a condition of confirmation,that the action of the debtor in filing the petition was in good faith see also,in re myers,citing the timing of the petition as a factor to be considered in assessing a debtor compliance with the requirement.accord,neufeld freeman,a debtor prepetition conduct may inform the court inquiry.
petitioner next argues that a debtor with unusually high income during the months prior to the filing of a petition,could seek leave to delay filing a schedule of current income schedule i and then ask the bankruptcy court to exercise its authority under a ii to select a period that is more representative of the debtor future disposable income.we see little merit in this convoluted strategy.if the code required the use of the mechanical approach in all cases,this strategy would improperly undermine what the code demands.and if,as we believe,the code does not insist upon rigid adherence to the mechanical approach in all cases,this strategy is not needed.in any event,even if this strategy were allowed,it would not help all debtors whose disposable income during the plan period is sharply lower than their previous disposable income 
petitioner suggests that a debtor can dismiss the petition and refile at a later,more favorable date.but petitioner offers only the tepid assurance that courts generally do not find this practice to be abusive.brief for petitioner.this questionable stratagem plainly circumvents the statutory limits on a court ability to shift the period,see supra,at,and,and should give debtors pause in re glenn,bkrtcy.ed noting that courts should consider,among other factors,whether this is the first or a subsequent filin g when assessing a debtor compliance with the requirement.
petitioner argues that respondent might have been able to obtain relief by filing under chapter or by converting her chapter petition to one under chapter.the availability of chapter to debtors like respondent who have incomes is limited.in respondent case,a presumption of abuse would attach under b a i because her disposable income,multiplied by,exceeds the amounts specified in subclauses i and ii.see also b allowing a court to dismiss a petition filed by a debtor whose debts are primarily consumer debts if it finds that the granting of relief would be an abuse of the provisions of this chapter app.notice to individual consumer debtor under b of the bankruptcy code if your income is greater than the median income for your state of residence and family size,in some cases,creditors have the right to file a motion requesting that the court dismiss your case under b of the code nevertheless,petitioner argues,respondent might have been able to overcome this presumption by claiming that her case involves special circumstances within the meaning of b b i.section identifies as examples of special circumstances a serious medical condition or a call or order to active duty in the armed forces,and petitioner directs us to no authority for the proposition that a prepetition decline in income would qualify as a special circumstance.in any event,the special circumstances exception is available only to the extent that there is no reasonable alternative,a proposition we reject with our interpretation of b today 
in sum,each of the strategies that petitioner identifies for mitigating the anomalous effects of the mechanical approach is flawed.there is no reason to think that congress meant for any of these strategies to operate as a safety valve for the mechanical approach.
we find petitioner remaining arguments unpersuasive.consistent with the text of and practice,we hold that when a bankruptcy court calculates a debtor projected disposable income,the court may account for changes in the debtor income or expenses that are known or virtually certain at the time of confirmation.we therefore affirm the decision of the court of appeals.
it is so ordered.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit 
justice scalia,dissenting.
the bankruptcy code requires a debtor seeking relief under chapter,unless he will repay his unsecured creditors in full,to pay them all of his projected disposable income over the life of his repayment plan.b b.the code provides a formula for project ing what a debtor disposable income will be,which so far as his earnings are concerned turns only on his past income.the court concludes that this formula should not apply in exceptional cases where known or virtually certain changes in the debtor circumstances make it a poor predictor.ante,at.because that conclusion is contrary to the code text,i respectfully dissent.
a bankruptcy court can not confirm a chapter plan over the objection of the trustee unless,as of the plan effective date,either a the property to be distributed on account of the unsecured claim at issue exceeds its amount or b the the plan provides that all of the debtor projected disposable income to be received in the applicable commitment period beginning on the date that the first payment is due under the plan will be applied to make payments to unsecured creditors under the plan.b b.the code does not define projected disposable income,but it does define disposable income.the next paragraph of b provides that f or purposes of this subsection,the term disposable income means current monthly income received by the debtor,excluding certain payments received for child support,less amounts reasonably necessary to be expended on three categories of expenses.b.the code in turn defines current monthly income as the average monthly income from all sources that the debtor receives derived during the period ending on one of two dates a.whichever date applies,a debtor current monthly income,and thus the income component of his disposable income,is a sum certain,a rate fixed once for all based on historical figures.
this definition of disposable income applies to the use of that term in the longer phrase projected disposable income in b b,since the definition says that it applies to subsection b.a b referring to the projected disposable income of the debtor as defined in section b the puzzle is what to make of the word projected.
in the court view,this modifier makes all the difference.projections,it explains,ordinarily account for later developments,not just past data.ante,at.thus,the court concludes,in determining projected disposable income a bankruptcy court may depart from b inflexible formula,at least in exceptional cases,to account for significant changes in the debtor circumstances,either actual or anticipated.ante,at.
that interpretation runs aground because it either renders superfluous text congress included or requires adding text congress did not.it would be pointless to define disposable income in such detail,based on data during a specific period,if a court were free to set the resulting figure aside whenever it appears to be a poor predictor.and since disposable income appears nowhere else in b,then unless b definition applies to projected disposable income in b b,it does not apply at all.
the court insists its interpretation does not render b incorporation of current monthly income a nullity a bankruptcy court must still begin with that figure,but is simply free to fiddle with it if a significant change in the debtor circumstances is known or virtually certain.ante,at.that construction conveniently avoids superfluity,but only by utterly abandoning the text the court purports to construe.nothing in the text supports treating the definition of disposable income congress supplied as a suggestion.and even if the word projected did allow or direct a court to disregard b fixed formula and to consider other data,there would be no basis in the text for the restrictions the court reads in,regarding when and to what extent a court may or must do so.if the statute authorizes estimations,it authorizes them in every case,not just those where changes to the debtor income are both significant and either known or virtually certain.ibid.if the evidence indicates it is merely more likely than not that the debtor income will increase by some minimal amount,there is no reading of the word projected that permits or requires a court to ignore that change.the court,in short,can arrive at its compromise construction only by rewriting the statute.
the only reasonable reading that avoids deleting words congress enacted,or adding others it did not,is this setting aside expenses excludable under b a and b,which are not at issue here,a court must calculate the debtor projected disposable income by multiplying his current monthly income by the number of months in the applicable commitment period.the word projected in this context,i agree,most sensibly refers to a calculation,prediction,or estimation of future events,see brief for united states as amicus curiae collecting dictionary definitions see also webster new international dictionary ed.but one assuredly can calculate,predict,or estimate future figures based on the past.and here congress has commanded that a specific historical figure shall be the basis for the projection.
the court rejects this reading as unrealistic.a projection,the court explains,may be based in part on past data,but adjustments are often made based on other factors that may affect the final outcome.ante,at.past performance is no guarantee of future results.no gambler would bet the farm using project ions that are based only on a football team play before its star quarterback was injured.and no pundit would keep his post if he projected election results relying only on prior cycles,ignoring recent polls.so too,the court appears to reason,it makes no sense to say a court project s a debtor disposable income when it considers only what he earned in a specific period in the past.ante,at.
such analogies do not establish that carrying current monthly income forward to determine a debtor future ability to pay is not a projection.they show only that relying exclusively on past data for the projection may be a bad idea.one who is asked to predict future results,but is armed with no other information than prior performance,can still make a projection it may simply be off the mark.congress,of course,could have tried to prevent that possibility by prescribing,as it has done in other contexts,that a debtor projected disposable income be determined based on the best available evidence,c,or any relevant information,c.but it included no such prescription here,and instead identified the data a court should consider.perhaps congress concluded that other information a bankruptcy court might consider is too uncertain or too easily manipulated.or perhaps it thought the cost of considering such information outweighed the benefits.b j m requiring national and local projected yields of various crops to be adjusted only for abnormal weather,trends in yields,and production practices,apparently to the exclusion of other presumably relevant variables such as a sudden increase or decrease in the number of producers,farm subsidies.in all events,neither the reasons for nor the wisdom of the projection method congress chose has any bearing on what the statute means.
the court contends that if congress really meant courts to multiply a static figure by a set number of months,it would have used the word multiplied,as it has done elsewhere indeed,elsewhere in the same subsection,see,b instead of the word projected.ante,at.i do not dispute that,as a general matter,we should presume that congress does not ordinarily use two words in the same context to denote the same thing.but if forced to choose between a assuming congress enacted text that serves no purpose at all,b ascribing an meaning to the word projected loaded with restrictions simply to avoid undesirable results,or c assuming congress employed synonyms to express a single idea,the last is obviously the least evil.
in any event,we are not put to that choice here.while under my reading a court must determine the income half of the projected disposable income equation by multiplying a fixed number,that is not necessarily true of the expenses excludable under b a and b.unlike the debtor current monthly income,none of the three types of expenses payments for the support of the debtor and his dependents,charitable contributions,and expenses to keep an existing business above water is explicitly defined in terms of historical figures at least for debtors with incomes below the state median.the first of those can not possibly in many cases be determined based on the same period from which current monthly income is derived and the texts of the other two are consistent with determining expenses based on expectations.see b a ii charitable expenses to qualified entities limited to percent of gross income of the debtor for the year in which the contributions are made b b expenditures necessary for the continuation,preservation,and operation of a business in which the debtor is engaged.
in short,a debtor projected disposable income consists of two parts one current monthly income that is fixed once for all based on historical data,and another the enumerated expenses that at least arguably depends on estimations of the debtor future circumstances.the statute thus requires the court to predict the difference between two figures,each of which depends on the duration of the commitment period,and one of which also turns partly on facts besides historical data.in light of all this,it seems to me not at all unusual to describe this process as projection,not merely multiplication.
the court remaining arguments about the statute meaning are easily dispatched.a mechanical reading of projected disposable income,it contends,renders superfluous the phrase to be received in the applicable commitment period in b b.ante,at.not at all.that phrase defines the period for which a debtor disposable income must be calculated,the period over which the projection extends,and thus the amount the debtor must ultimately pay his unsecured creditors.
similarly insubstantial is the court claim regarding the requirement that the plan provide that the debtor projected disposable income will be applied to make payments toward unsecured creditors claims,b b.the court says this requirement makes no sense unless the debtor is actually able to pay an amount equal to his projected disposable income.ante,at.but it makes no sense only if one assumes that the debtor is entitled to confirmation in the first place and that assumption is wrong.the requirement that the debtor pay at least his projected disposable income is a prerequisite to confirmation.the will be applied proviso does not require a debtor to pay what he can not it simply withholds chapter relief when he can not pay.
the court also argues that b directive to determine projected disposable income as of the effective date of the plan makes no sense if mere multiplication of existing numbers is required.ante,at.as i have explained,however,projected disposable income may in some cases require more than multiplication as to expenses,and the estimations involved may vary from the date of the plan filing until the date it takes effect.moreover,the provision also applies to the alternative avenue to confirmation in b a,which requires that the value of the property to be distributed under the plan to an unsecured creditor equals or exceeds the creditor claim.as to that requirement,the requirement makes perfect sense.
text aside,the court also observes that circuit practice prior to the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of bapcpa,stat,aligns with the atextual approach the court adopts today.ante,at.that is unsurprising,since the prior version of the relevant provisions was completely consistent with that approach.the court is correct that bapcpa did not amend the term projected disposable income,ante,at.but it did amend the definition of that term.before,b defined disposable income simply as income which is received by the debtor and which is not reasonably necessary to be expended on the same basic types of expenses excluded by the current statute.b ed.nothing in that terse definition compelled a court to rely exclusively on past data,let alone a specific period.but in bapcpa the same act in which congress defined current monthly income in a congress redefined disposable income in b to incorporate that definition.see pub,b,h,stat.given these significant changes,the fact that the court approach conforms with practice not only does not recommend it,see,pennsylvania of public welfare davenport,but renders it suspect.
unable to assemble a compelling case based on what the statute says,the court falls back on the senseless results it would produce results the court do es not think congress intended.ante,at.even if it were true that a mechanical reading resulted in undesirable outcomes,that would make no difference.lewis chicago,slip,at.for even assuming though i do not believe it that we could know which results congress thought it was achieving or avoiding apart from the only congressional expression of its thoughts,the text,those results would be entirely irrelevant to what the statute means.
in any event,the effects the court fears are neither as inevitable nor as senseless as the court portrays.the court first concern is that if actual or anticipated changes in the debtor earnings are ignored,then a debtor whose income increases after the critical window will not be required to pay all he can afford.ante,at.but as lanning points out,brief for respondent,chapter authorizes the bankruptcy court,at the request of unsecured creditors,to modify the plan a t any time after confirmation to increase the amount of payments on a class of claims or reduce the time for such payments.a ed.the court offers no explanation of why modification would not be available in such instances,and sufficient to resolve the concern.
the court also cringes at the prospect that a debtor whose income suddenly declines after the window or who,as in this case,receives a windfall during that window,will be barred from chapter relief because he will be unable to devote his disposable income which turns on his prior earnings to paying his unsecured creditors going forward.ante,at.at least for debtors whose circumstances deteriorate after confirmation,however,the code already provides an answer.just as a creditor can request an upward modification in light of postconfirmation developments,so too can a debtor ask for a downward adjustment.a.b requiring that modifications meet requirements of a b,c,and a,but not b.
moreover,even apart from the availability of modification it requires little imagination to see why congress might want to withhold relief from debtors whose situations have suddenly deteriorated after or even toward the end of the window,or who in the midst of dire straits have been blessed within the window by an influx of unusually high income.bankruptcy protection is not a birthright,and congress could reasonably conclude that those who have just hit the skids do not yet need a reprieve from repaying their debts perhaps they will recover.and perhaps the debtor who has received a bonus will thereby be enabled to stay afloat.how long to wait before throwing the debtor a lifeline is inherently a policy choice.congress confined the calculation of current monthly income to a period ordinarily ending before the case is commenced,but it could have picked or months or a different end date instead.whatever the wisdom of the window it chose,we should not assume it did not know what it was doing and accordingly refuse to give effect to its words.
even if one insists on making provision for such debtors,the court is wrong to write off four alternative strategies the trustee suggests,brief for petitioner 
presumably some debtors whose income has only recently been reduced,or who have just received a jolt that causes a temporary uptick in their average income,can delay filing a chapter petition until their current monthly income catches up with their present circumstances.the court speculates that delay might giv e the appearance of bad faith,ante,at citing a,but it offers no explanation of why that is so,and no authority supporting it 
even if bad faith were a real worry,or if it were essential to a debtor prospects that he invoke automatic stay immediately,the debtor might ask the bankruptcy court to excuse him from filing a statement of current income,so that it determines his currently monthly income at a later date.see a ii.the court dismisses this alternative,explaining that if the code requires a mechanical approach this solution would improperly unde
