opinion of the court 
section a of the bankruptcy code sets a limit for the commencement of avoidance actions on behalf of the bankruptcy estate to recover money or property transfers.this provision was amended in to provide an additional year for such actions running from the date of the appointment or election of certain trustees,if such appointment or election occurs before the expiration of the aforementioned period.
appellant steven singer,the elected chapter trustee for the debtors in this proceeding,filed numerous actions to avoid certain preferences that were made by the debtor.those actions were dismissed as untimely by the bankruptcy court and affirmed by the district court.he appeals,asking us to interpret the statutory language regarding the statute of limitations so as to make timely the avoidance actions he filed.as discussed below,the language of the statute will not bear such an interpretation.
on january,a number of creditors filed involuntary chapter petitions in the bankruptcy court for the district of delaware against american pad paper company and six related companies the debtors,which had been in the business of manufacturing and marketing a variety of paper and stationery products.on january,each debtor filed a voluntary chapter petition,as well as a request that the bankruptcy court enter an order for relief upon the debtors joint consent.that same day,the bankruptcy court entered the order for relief,as well as an order directing the joint administration of the cases.almost two years later,on december,the bankruptcy court entered an order granting a motion made by the creditors committee to convert the cases to chapter.by the terms of the order,the conversion to chapter was to be effective on january.
also on january,the united states trustee appointed jeoffrey burtch as interim chapter trustee pursuant to section of the bankruptcy code.that section provides 
interim trustee 
a promptly after the order for relief under this chapter,the united states trustee shall appoint one disinterested person that is a member of the panel of private trustees established under section a of title or that is serving as trustee in the case immediately before the order for relief under this chapter to serve as interim trustee in the case.
if none of the members of such panel is willing to serve as interim trustee in the case,then the united states trustee may serve as interim trustee in the case.
b the service of an interim trustee under this section terminates when a trustee elected or designated under section of this title to serve as trustee in the case qualifies under section of this title.
c an interim trustee serving under this section is a trustee in a case under this title.
emphasis added 
it is significant for the issue before us that the date of the appointment of burtch as the chapter trustee under section,january,was a mere eleven days prior to the anniversary of the entry of the order for relief.a notice dated january,scheduled the meeting of creditors pursuant to section of the code for february.see within a reasonable time after the order for relief in a case under this title,the united states trustee shall convene and preside at a meeting of creditors.collier on bankruptcy ed.the chief function of the meeting of creditors is to provide the machinery for creditors to elect a trustee,examine the debtor and be heard generally in an advisory capacity on questions concerning the administration of the estate.it is also evident that the creditors meeting was scheduled for a date more than two years after the entry of the order for relief.
at the meeting,certain creditors requested the election of a trustee pursuant to section of the code and a new individual,steven singer,the appellant in the instant case,was so elected on that date,more than two years after the entry of the order for relief.
it appears that trustees are infrequently elected under section,primarily because of the substantial creditor effort needed to meet the statutory requirements for an election.in cases where no election takes place,the interim trustee will continue to serve as the trustee for the chapter case pursuant to section d.george treister et,fundamentals of bankruptcy law a ed collier on bankruptcy a i since trustee elections under section are rare,the date of the section meeting usually will be the date of appointment of the trustee for purposes of section a b.thus,had singer not been elected the section trustee at the section meeting,interim trustee burtch would have continued to serve as trustee by operation of section d of the code,which provides that i f a trustee is not elected under this section,then the interim trustee shall serve as trustee in the case.see also collier on bankruptcy a the interim trustee,who is appointed promptly by the trustee after entry of the order for relief under section,automatically becomes the permanent trustee at the meeting of creditors pursuant to section if creditors do not elect a trustee under section.we note that notwithstanding the language in the excerpt from collier,the term permanent trustee does not appear in the relevant sections of the bankruptcy code.
between august and december trustee singer filed approximately avoidance actions under section of the code,which exists to prevent debtors from depleting the estate to pay favored creditors with assets that otherwise would have been apportioned among creditors according to the prioritization scheme of the bankruptcy code.in re pillowtex,cir.a number of defendants in the adversary actions moved the bankruptcy court to dismiss on the ground that they were filed beyond the applicable statute of limitations.the bankruptcy court granted the motions to dismiss on october,and march.singer franklin boxboard in re american pad paper,singer in re american pad paper.the district court affirmed on january,in singer franklin boxboard in re american pad paper,and thereafter in three additional orders in january,each pertaining to a related case and affirming the bankruptcy court orders for same reasons set forth in the january,opinion and order.
singer filed timely notices of appeal of these four orders.this court consolidated the appeals by order entered february.

as revised by congress in,the statute of limitations on avoiding powers appears at a,and reads in relevant part as follows 
limitations on avoiding powers 
a an action or proceeding under section of this title may not be commenced after 
the later of 
a years after the entry of the order for relief or 
b year after the appointment or election of the first trustee under section,or of this title if such appointment or such election occurs before the expiration of the period specified in subparagraph a.
the application of the above limitations period to our facts is straightforward.here,the order for relief was entered on january.thus,the initial period expired on january,before singer filed the avoidance actions at issue here.see,technical coll.arkansas television in re technical,reading the time computation provision in rule a of the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure as making timely a filing made on anniversary date.
singer did not bring the first of his actions until august of,almost seven months past the statutory period.as we noted earlier,singer election as trustee under section did not take place until february,approximately a month after the expiration of the period specified in subparagraph a,the expiration of the initial period.see a b.thus,from a plain reading of the statute of limitations,and as the bankruptcy and district courts held,singer avoidance actions are.when a statute language is plain,the sole function for the least where the disposition required by the text is not to enforce it according to its terms.robert wood johnson.hosp.thompson,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted in re first merchs.acceptance bradford,cir only absurd results and the most extraordinary showing of contrary intentions justify a limitation on the plain meaning of the statutory language see also collier on bankruptcy if a trustee is appointed or elected within two years of the entry of the order for relief,the trustee is afforded one additional year from its appointment or election to commence avoidance actions.if a trustee is not appointed or elected prior to the expiration of the initial period,commencement of avoidance actions is,even if a trustee is subsequently appointed or elected in the case.emphasis added.
despite the fact that the statute of limitations plainly bars appellant avoidance actions,appellant draws the court attention to the date the interim trustee,burtch,was appointed january.essentially,appellant argues that,because the interim trustee under section was appointed on january,prior to the expiration of the initial period,appellant as permanent trustee should have received an additional period to file the avoidance actions,running from january.yet,the plain language of the statute of limitations does not include section interim trustees,and makes reference only to year after the appointment or election of the first trustee under section,or.the omission of section from the list of sections is evident.
reading the appointment of an interim trustee under section as an event that triggers the additional period has no basis in the language of the statute.see hartford underwriters ins.union planters bank,d noting the general inappropriateness,as a matter of statutory construction,of assuming that a catalogue of empowered parties in a statute is nevertheless a nonexclusive list,as where a statute names the parties granted the right to invoke its provisions,such parties only may act internal quotation marks and citation omitted united states landmesser,cir the canon of expressio unius est exclusio alterius means that explicit mention of one thing in a statute implies a congressional intent to exclude similar things that were not specifically mentioned.internal quotation marks and citation omitted see also turner bolduc et.in re crowe rope,llc,concluding there is no need to invent a reference to in section a b,and rejecting argument that the period ran from the date of the appointment of the interim trustee under section,instead of from the date of the section meeting at which the interim trustee is appointed the trustee by operation of law pursuant to d if no trustee is elected styler conoco,in re peterson,the bankruptcy reform act of also clarifies that the limitations period does not run from the appointment of an interim trustee.there is no added reference to.
in support of his argument based upon the date of burtch section appointment,appellant calls our attention to a bankruptcy court decision that held that the additional period under section a b began to run upon the appointment of the interim trustee under section.burtch in re allied digital techs,rev,see also claybrook ponderosa indus.de mexico in re wood,wl,at,concluding,in a case where,unlike the instant case,no trustee was elected that s ince the trustee was appointed within the two years of the order for relief and became the permanent trustee under section d when no trustee was elected,he is entitled to the extension of time to file avoidance actions granted by section a b running from the date of his appointment as interim trustee.
in allied digital,the bankruptcy court entered the order for relief on october,and the first interim trustee was appointed on july,with a successor interim trustee appointed july.at.the section meeting of creditors did not take place,however,until march,more than four months after the expiration of the initial period.id.at.despite the expiration of the period,the bankruptcy court held that avoidance actions brought by the successor interim trustee on june,were timely,and that a window running from july,existed in which the interim trustee could bring avoidance actions.id.at.the bankruptcy court concluded that it should read section into a b,as there is no practical difference between the powers of an interim trustee and those of the permanent trustee.id.at.it relied on the ninth circuit decision in avalanche maritime,parekh in re parmetex,cir,that interpreted the version of the statute of limitations to conclude that the period begins to run upon the appointment of the interim trustee under section.in avalanche maritime,the ninth circuit,noting the difficulty of parsing this unclear statute,recognized that there was no reference to section in the version of the statute,but it read section into the list of authorizing statutes in order to give effect to the references to appointment in the statute and to reconcile its decision with earlier holdings in that circuit regarding the version of the statute.id.at.
yet,as the district court in allied digital pointed out in reversing the holding of the bankruptcy court,the similarities in function between section and section trustees do not warrant interposing section where it does not appear in the statute.allied digital,at holding that it was error for the bankruptcy court to have presumed that congress intended to grant an additional one year to an interim trustee,and to have read section into a b,because a court must begin with the text of the provision and,if its meaning is clear,end there internal quotation marks and citation omitted.moreover,even the allied digital bankruptcy court noted that it was not passing on whether a new one year period is barred if the election occurs outside the initial two years but an interim trustee was appointed within the two years.allied digital,at that,of course,is the issue in the matter before us.
surely,a conclusion that appellant avoidance actions are timely,even though his election under section plainly occurred after expiration of the period specified in subparagraph a,presents even greater direct conflict with the statutory language than the events at issue in allied digital.
as the supreme court stated in bread political action comm.fec,d,o ur analysis of this issue of statutory construction must begin with the language of the statute itself.quoting dawson chem.rohm haas,d.where statutory language is clear,and admits of no more than one meaning the duty of interpretation does not arise and the rules which are to aid doubtful meanings need no discussion.mckelvie,cir en banc quoting caminetti united states.lancashire coal sec y of labor,mine safety and health admin.msha,cir w hen the statutory language is clear a court need ordinarily look no further.the supreme court has stated that congress says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.hartford underwriters ins,at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
