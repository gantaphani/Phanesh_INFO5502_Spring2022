in this appeal,we hold that a bankruptcy court may approve retroactively the rejection of an unexpired nonresidential lease.we adopt the first circuit conclusion in thinking machines mellon financial services in re thinking machines,cir although rejection of an unexpired nonresidential lease does not take effect until court approval,the approving court has the equitable power,in suitable cases,to order a rejection to operate retroactively.we further hold that the retroactive date may be earlier than the date on which the landlord retakes possession of the premises.here,the bankruptcy court permissibly allowed the debtor to reject the leases as of the date on which the debtor filed its motion seeking to reject them.accordingly,we affirm.
background 
in happier times,debtor at home corporation was actively engaged in the delivery of broadband network services to residential customers.as part of an aggressive growth strategy,in early debtor leased two buildings from pacific shores development corporation,llc.debtor placed in escrow approximately million to fund the remodeling of the two leased buildings.debtor intended to occupy the premises upon completion of the renovation.
but things did not go as planned.debtor filed for chapter bankruptcy protection on september.although the renovation was virtually complete by then,debtor had never occupied the leased buildings.debtor did not furnish pacific shores with a formal surrender notice before seeking protection under chapter it feared that pacific shores would convert more than million,which remained in the escrow account for remodeling,into rent.indeed,that conversion apparently took place on the same day that debtor filed its bankruptcy petition.
also on that same day,debtor filed an emergency motion for order pursuant to a authorizing rejection of unexpired leases of nonresidential real property.that motion sought an order rejecting the leases nunc pro tunc to september,the date on which the motion was filed.pacific shores did not quarrel with the decision to reject the leases,but objected to the motion to the extent it seeks retroactive rejection of the leases.the parties contested this point because the effective date of rejection of the leases governed whether debtor would owe pacific shores more than million in additional rent.
during the first day emergency motions hearing on october,debtor asked the court to schedule a hearing on its motion to reject the leases early next week.on october a committee of creditors had not yet formed.because the following monday was a court holiday,the bankruptcy court scheduled the hearing for tuesday,october.
at the october hearing,the bankruptcy court heard argument from pacific shores,debtor,the united states trustee,and the newly formed creditors committee.the bankruptcy court then rendered an oral decision in which it concluded that a nunc pro tunc order was appropriate because debtor moved to reject the lease immediately upon filing its bankruptcy petition debtor set the matter for hearing promptly debtor was not in possession of the premises and pacific shores opposed nunc pro tunc rejection without having suggested that this process should be speeded up so that pacific shores could get its indefeasible right to the premises.in other words,pacific shores sole interest was in running the administrative rent.the court later issued a written order approving the retroactive rejection of the leases.
pacific shores challenged the bankruptcy court order in district court.the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court in a published opinion.pac.shores,llc v.at home in re at home.relying on thinking machines,the district court held that d permits a bankruptcy court to order the rejection of a nonresidential lease retroactive to an earlier date,whether or not the landlord was in possession of the leased premises on that date.id.at.the court also held that,on the facts of this case,the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion by approving debtor rejection of its leases retroactive to the september filing date.id.at.pacific shores timely appealed to this court.

discussion 
pacific shores agrees that,as a general matter,a bankruptcy court may exercise its equitable powers to approve the rejection of a nonresidential lease retroactively.nonetheless,pacific shores contends that the bankruptcy court erred in two respects.first,pacific shores argues that the bankruptcy court lacked authority to approve the rejection of the leases to a date before the date on which pacific shores,as landlord,regained possession of the premises.second,pacific shores takes issue with the factors on which the bankruptcy court relied in granting debtor motion.
our task is to identify the authority for,and the limits of,a bankruptcy court discretion in this context.we will begin by analyzing d,which controls the treatment of unexpired nonresidential leases in chapter proceedings,and the cases discussing the effective date of lease rejection under the statute.we then will turn to an analysis of the bankruptcy court decision.
equitable authority under d.
the shopping center amendments changed the treatment of unexpired nonresidential leases in chapter bankruptcy proceedings.
the parties dispute turns on the text and purpose of d,which sets forth a debtor duties under a nonresidential lease once the debtor has filed for bankruptcy protection.the relevant subsections of d provide 
the trustee shall timely perform all the obligations of the debtor,except those specified in section b,arising from and after the order for relief under any unexpired lease of nonresidential real property,until such lease is assumed or rejected,section b of this title.the court may extend,for cause,the time for performance of any such obligation that arises within days after the date of the order for relief,but the time for performance shall not be extended beyond such period acceptance of any such performance does not constitute waiver or relinquishment of the lessor rights under such lease or under this title.
i n a case under any chapter of this title,if the trustee does not assume or reject an unexpired lease of nonresidential real property under which the debtor is the lessee within days after the date of the order for relief,or within such additional time as the court,for cause,within such period,fixes,then such lease is deemed rejected,and the trustee shall immediately surrender such nonresidential real property to the lessor.
those subsections impose two obligations on a trustee or debtor with respect to unexpired nonresidential leases.first,d makes clear that the debtor must perform all obligations owing under a the obligation to pay rent at the contract the lease is rejected.second,d requires a debtor or trustee to decide whether to assume or reject a lease within days after the filing of a bankruptcy petition.if the trustee fails to act within days,the lease is deemed rejected and the trustee must immediately surrender such nonresidential real property to the lessor.d.
those duties arose out of the shopping center amendments contained in the bankruptcy amendments and federal judgeship act of,stat.through those amendments,congress sought to protect the interests of commercial landlords who,compared to other creditors,were unfairly disadvantaged because they were forced to continue extending the form of the pendency of reorganization proceedings.see cong.rec,reprinted in,statement of hatch discussing problem.
specifically,congress enacted the shopping center amendments to tackle two main problems.the first problem which the amendments would remedy is the vacancy or partial operation of space by a bankrupt tenant.id.at.previously,a debtor could file a chapter bankruptcy petition and then maintain control of the leased property for the entire duration of the bankruptcy proceedings,even if the debtor had ceased operations and had vacated the premises.the automatic stay prevented the landlord from evicting the debtor or regaining possession of the leased space.the landlord lost money,and the extended vacancy hurt other tenants in the same shopping center as the bankrupt tenant because of decreased customer traffic.id.at.
a second and related problem is that during the time the debtor has vacated space but has not yet decided whether to assume or reject the lease,the trustee has stopped making payments due under the lease.id.again,this problem affected both the landlord and the other tenants.t he landlord was forced to provide current use of its property,utilities,security,and other current payment.id.other tenants could be required to increase their common area charge payments to make up for the fact that the bankrupt tenant was no longer contributing to common area charges.id.the landlord eventually received only the actual,necessary costs and expenses of preserving the estate,b a,rather than the rent that would have been due under the terms of the lease.thus,landlords could not rent the unused space until the proceedings terminated,and they received only an amount equal to the reasonable value of the debtor actual use and occupation of the property during those proceedings.towers chickering gregory in re trading,cir.
the shopping center amendments solved those two problems by ensuring that a commercial tenant who seeks protection under chapter continues to perform its obligations under the the obligation to pay the full amount of rent notwithstanding section b until the lease is rejected.by requiring the tenant to pay administrative rent until it rejects the lease,and by providing for automatic rejection of the lease after days,the amendments ensure that the tenant determines promptly whether to assume or reject the lease,rather than taking advantage of the automatic stay.
thinking machines appropriately recognized bankruptcy courts equitable authority under d.
soon after congress enacted the shopping center amendments,courts began to arrive at contrary conclusions with respect to when a lease rejection takes effect.much depends on that conclusion,because the effective date of rejection determines when a debtor obligation to pay rent ceases.under the majority view,the rejection of a lease becomes effective upon entry of a court order approving a trustee or debtor motion to reject an unexpired nonresidential lease.see,paul harris stores,mabel salter realty trust in re paul harris stores,in re federated dep t stores.this view regards court approval as a condition precedent to the rejection of a lease.thinking machines,at under the minority view,lease rejection is effective upon filing the motion to reject.thus,court approval is not a condition precedent to an effective assumption or rejection,but rather is a safeguard subjecting the decision of the trustee and its business judgment to review and possible reversal.in re joseph spiess.
the first circuit undertook to mend the seeming rift in the case law between the majority and minority views.thinking machines,at.after thoroughly reviewing the cases on both sides,the court adopted the majority view,concluding that section a is most faithfully read as making court approval a condition precedent to the effectiveness of a trustee rejection of a nonresidential lease.id.at.at the same time,the court emphasized that nothing in our holding today precludes a bankruptcy court,in an appropriate section a case,from approving a trustee rejection of a nonresidential lease retroactive to the motion filing date.id.at.that proviso reconciled the competing approaches and yielded a single rule rejection under section a does not take effect until judicial approval is secured,but the approving court has the equitable power,in suitable cases,to order a rejection to operate retroactively.id.at.
many bankruptcy courts have since implemented thinking machines rule.see,stonebriar mall.cci wireless,llc in re cci wireless,llc,in re amber stores.even those courts that deny retroactive relief do so as a matter of discretion,rather than as a matter of law.see,in re,t he court finds that it will not exercise its equitable power to deem the landlords leases rejected as of the petition date.indeed,the equitable authority recognized in thinking machines has been imported to contexts other than unexpired nonresidential leases.see,malden mills,maroun in re malden mills,cir applying approach to abandonment of personal property.
even before thinking machines,some courts had allowed retroactive rejection of a nonresidential lease,reasoning that nothing in d expressly prevents a bankruptcy court from exercising its equitable powers to approve a retroactive rejection.as the southern district of new york explained in constant.partnership jamesway in re jamesway,d does not state that rejection can not be applied retroactively,or that there are restrictions as to the manner in which the court can approve rejection.the district court below similarly observed that d does not specify whether a bankruptcy court may order the rejection of a lease retroactive to the motion filing date.at home,at.
but statutory silence alone does not invest a bankruptcy court with equitable powers.those powers are limited and do not amount to a roving commission to do equity.saxman educ.credit mgmt.in re saxman,cir quoting united states sutton,cir.the bankruptcy code limits the equitable powers of bankruptcy courts to the issuance of any order,process,or judgment that is necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this title.a.thus,a bankruptcy court must locate its equitable authority in the bankruptcy code.see norwest bank worthington ahlers,d w hatever equitable powers remain in the bankruptcy courts must and can only be exercised within the confines of the bankruptcy code.
fortunately,we need look no further than d itself to see that,in appropriate cases,retroactive lease rejection may be necessary or appropriate to carry out this provision of title.a.as we have noted,one of the chief purposes of the shopping center amendments was to remedy the vacancy of leased premises during protracted bankruptcy proceedings.see at lamenting that under the version of tenant space has been vacated for extended periods of time before the bankruptcy court forced the trustee to decide whether to assume or reject the lease.together,d and d operate to force the to decide quickly whether to assume or reject an unexpired lease.
similarly,thinking machines observed that retroactive lease rejection had the salutary side effect of acting as a stimulus to all parties to cooperate in getting the trustee motion to reject heard and determined at the earliest practicable date.at.so courts generally focus on whether the parties have facilitated or hindered the prompt return of the leased premises to the landlord when deciding whether to approve the rejection of a lease retroactive to an earlier date.for example,the court in in re amber stores approved the rejection of a lease nunc pro tunc to the motion filing date because the debtor had turned over the keys and vacated the premises,and served a motion to reject the lease as soon as possible.at.by so doing,the debtor had acted to further the intended purposes of d the prompt rejection of the lease and the return of the leased premises to the landlord possession.thus,equitable relief was appropriate.id.
in re amber stores is a faithful application of both thinking machines rule and the provisions of d themselves.indeed,neither party argues,nor does any relevant authority suggest,that the exercise of a bankruptcy court equitable powers in similar circumstances runs counter to d or any other provision of the bankruptcy code.we therefore hold that a bankruptcy court,in exercising its equitable powers under a,may approve the retroactive rejection of a nonresidential lease when necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of d.
the landlord possession of the leased premises is not a requirement for retroactive relief.
pacific shores argues that the bankruptcy court exceeded its equitable powers by approving the rejection of the leases retroactive to the motion filing date because debtor,not pacific shores,remained in possession of the leased premises on that date.by permitting a rejection predating the landlord resumption of possession,pacific shores contends,the bankruptcy court thwarted the spirit,if not the letter,of d.we are not persuaded.
the relevant provisions of d do not even mention the term possession,much less elevate it to a condition precedent to a bankruptcy court exercise of its equitable powers.the legally operative event in d is the debtor or trustee assumption or rejection of the lease,rather than the landlord possession of the leased premises.
congruently,the legislative history refers to a landlord possession of leased premises only in connection with proceedings by landlords to regain possession of leased premises when the lease has expired by its own terms.at.like the statute itself,the legislative history focuses on the period of time during which the debtor has vacated space but has not yet decided whether to assume or reject the lease.id.at emphasis added.indeed,the legislative history consistently stresses congress intention to hasten the trustee decision to assume or reject a lease 
t enant space has been vacated for extended periods of time before the bankruptcy court forced the trustee to decide whether to assume or reject the lease.
the bill would lessen the problems caused by extended vacancies and partial operation of tenant space by requiring that the trustee decide whether to assume or reject a nonresidential real property lease within days 
id.emphasis added.
our earlier cases similarly emphasize the trustee decision to reject the lease,rather than the landlord eventual possession of the leased premises.in in re trading,we interpreted section d to express the intent of congress to secure for lessors the full amount of rent due while the trustee determines to accept or reject the lease.at emphasis added see also cukierman uecker in re cukierman,cir noting that d requires the trustee to perform all lease obligations u ntil the trustee assumes or rejects an unexpired lease of nonresidential real property.
in the normal course,a landlord will regain possession of leased premises shortly after the trustee decides to reject the lease,and the estate must pay administrative rent covering the time between those two acts.see federated dep t stores,at stating that,a s a general rule,the party seeking relief in any court must bear the risk that the court may not reach a decision as quickly as the party expected or desired.but nothing in the text or history of the statute,nor in our case law,suggests that bankruptcy courts are powerless to deviate from the usual rule in appropriate circumstances.
adopting the interpretation of d that pacific shores urges would deprive a bankruptcy court of flexibility in molding its orders to reflect the circumstances and the actions of both parties to the lease.in jamesway,for example,the court authorized the rejection of a lease retroactive to the date on which the court would have heard the debtor motion but for the landlord frivolous objection and delaying tactics.at.that kind of appropriate relief would be impossible were we to adhere to a strict rule under which the landlord regaining possession of the leased premises is a precondition to lease rejection.
pacific shores attempts to accommodate jamesway by arguing that,although d does not preclude retroactive rejection of a lease when,as in jamesway,a landlord is voluntarily deprived of possession by its own malfeasance,it does preclude retroactive rejection when a landlord is involuntarily deprived of possession.other than jamesway itself,pacific shores cites no authority that supports that argument.the statute does not support this proposed distinction.
in the absence of explicit direction from the statute itself,we decline to hamstring bankruptcy courts in this way.we prefer the straightforward approach adopted by the bankruptcy courts in cases such as jamesway and cci wireless.after concluding that nothing in section prohibits a bankruptcy court from selecting a retroactive date for the rejection of an unexpired nonresidential lease,the court s applied an abuse of discretion standard in considering whether the circumstances of the debtor case merited retroactive rejection.cci wireless,at explaining and adopting the analysis of jamesway.we expressly adopt that approach here 
having held that d confers on bankruptcy courts the equitable authority to approve the rejection of a lease retroactive to the motion filing date,we next turn to whether the bankruptcy court properly exercised that authority in this case.
b.the bankruptcy court decision to grant debtor motion.
i n most cases a lease will be considered rejected as of the date of entry of the order approving the rejection,and only in exceptional circumstances will the court adopt a retroactive date.in re theatres.the bankruptcy court below identified four factors supporting its conclusion that exceptional circumstances justified retroactive rejection the immediate filing of debtor motion to reject the leases debtor prompt action in setting that motion for hearing the fact that debtor never occupied the premises and pacific shores motivation in opposing rejection of the leases nunc pro tunc to the motion filing date.pacific shores challenges all but the first of those factors.
the absence of delay.
the bankruptcy court began by commenting that debtor had moved for rejection of the leases immediately upon filing its bankruptcy petition and had scheduled a hearing virtually as soon as possible 
it was perfect.it was done absolutely as soon as possible,but it was done without any delay.there was a holiday in here there was neither any deliberate use of a long notice period to keep their options open nor in fact as i can see it any indifference to the timing concerns of the landlord.this is virtually as soon as possible in this particular case.
pacific shores takes issue with the bankruptcy court conclusion that debtor set its motion for hearing virtually as soon as possible.
the bankruptcy court itself noted that debtor should have asked pacific shores to stipulate to an immediate rejection of the leases upon filing for bankruptcy.it is,of course,speculative whether pacific shores would have agreed,knowing that,by doing so,it would lose million in administrative rent.but even if that option had been available,we can not say that the bankruptcy court finding that debtor moved swiftly to reject the leases is clearly erroneous.the minimal delay in bringing the motion to a hearing was due in part to factors outside debtor control,including a court holiday and the fact that a creditors committee had yet to form by the time of the first day emergency motions.
pacific shores nonetheless argues that,in granting debtor motion,the bankruptcy court improperly shifted the burden of justifying delay to the landlord.as we noted in trading,b y requiring the trustee to timely pay the debtor rent,congress clearly placed the burden on the trustee to promptly and properly reject the lease if it has no intention of assuming it.at.several other courts also have interpreted the amended d as a mechanism to shift to the debtor the costs of delay.see,paul harris stores,at federated dep t stores,at.
this argument misunderstands the import of the bankruptcy court finding.the bankruptcy court did not require pacific shores to bear the costs associated with a delay.rather,the court concluded that there was no appreciable delay in the first place.that conclusion is consistent with the approach taken by other bankruptcy courts in similar situations.in paul harris stores,for example,the court held that the effective date of rejection was the date on which the court approved the motion to reject,in part because t he gap i n this months,due in part to extensions of hardly be considered small.at by contrast,the court in in re amber stores granted the motion to reject as of the motion filing date,wh
