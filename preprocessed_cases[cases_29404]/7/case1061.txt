background 
chapter bankruptcy was created to give family farmers facing bankruptcy a fighting chance to reorganize their debts and keep their land.in re fortney,cir quoting in re kerns.after a debtor chooses to file a chapter petition for bankruptcy,creditors file proofs of claim with the bankruptcy court.see a.the debtor must file a reorganization plan that sets out how the various claims will be paid,and the plan must meet certain statutory requirements.id.the court then holds a confirmation hearing,and a party in interest can object to the confirmation of a plan.id.a plan can not be confirmed without the consent of a holder of a secured claim where the holder does not accept the plan or the debtor does not surrender the collateral,unless the plan provides that the holder retain the lien securing the claim and the value of property to be distributed to the debtor or trustee under the plan with respect to that claim is not less than the allowed amount of the claim.id.a in re krause,cir.bap.once the plan is confirmed,it is binding on the debtor and the creditors.a.however,a debtor can request at any time that the court dismiss the case unless it has been converted to a chapter or chapter bankruptcy,and the court must dismiss it.id.b.the debtor can not waive his right to dismiss the case.id.a dismissal reinstates avoided transfers or voided liens made under certain provisions of the bankruptcy code,vacates certain types of orders made under the code,and revests the property of the estate in the entity in which such property was vested immediately before the commencement of the case,unless the bankruptcy court orders otherwise for cause.id.b.
in this case,the wieses filed for chapter bankruptcy on january,after the bank commenced state court foreclosure and replevin actions.the state actions were stayed,and the bank filed a proof of claim with the bankruptcy court a few months later.over the next several months,the wieses filed a reorganization plan,an amended plan,and a second amended plan.the bank objected to each plan,and the plans could not be confirmed because the bank either would not retain all its liens securing the claim or the bank would not receive the full value for the claim.in november,the wieses filed an adversary proceeding objecting to the bank proof of claim and asserting several lender liability claims against the bank.the parties reached an agreement on a third amended plan,which the bankruptcy court confirmed on december.
the reorganization plan included the following terms the wieses agreed to release the lender liability claims against the bank,and the bank agreed to release a lien held on funds in escrow,forgive default interest,set a cap on attorneys fees and expenses,allow a delay prior to the wieses payment,and the wieses loan at the contract rate of interest rather than at the higher default rate of interest.certain liquidation procedures were required if the wieses defaulted under the plan.
less than a week after the plan confirmation,the wieses filed a motion to vacate the confirmed order and liquidate their assets because a loan program they thought would be available to them was not.in march,the court denied the motion,as well as another motion that the wieses filed to amend the confirmed plan,noting that the parties reached an agreement which was placed on the record with full awareness that the debtors might not qualify for the loan program in question.consequently,in april,the wieses moved to dismiss the case,as was their right under b.the court granted the motion to dismiss.in determining what effect a dismissal had on the parties rights and obligations,the bankruptcy court noted that b governed and explained that for cause to be ordered,there must be an acceptable reason for altering the normal impact of b.the court concluded 
cause in this context is usually geared toward protecting rights acquired in reliance upon the bankruptcy when a debtor seeks the dismissal of a case,the court may properly consider the interests of creditors or other third parties which were gained in the course of,or in reliance upon,the bankruptcy.in this case,the debtors and the creditor negotiated a confirmed plan after a series of contested hearings.the creditor granted the debtors certain concessions,and the debtors agreed to the release of certain claims and various liquidation provisions in the event of a default.to the extent that might affect the rights obtained as a result of the confirmed plan,the court finds sufficient cause to order otherwise.

the wieses appealed the order.the district court agreed that b governed the rights of the parties in a dismissal,and it cited the legislative history to determine that the purpose of subsection b is to undo the bankruptcy case,as far as practicable,and to restore all property rights to the position in which they were found at the commencement of the case.wiese cmty.bank of central,wl,at quoting,at.the district court noted that we held in in re sadler,cir,that attempting to avoid the effect or purpose of a statute is not an acceptable reason for finding cause.wiese,wl,at.allowing a confirmed plan to remain binding on the parties after dismissal would rob the debtors of unqualified right to dismiss the would essentially serve as a waiver,even though an actual waiver is not permitted by statute.id.accordingly,since the purpose of the statute would be nullified,the district court concluded that the bankruptcy court cause determination must be vacated.id.the district court noted that now are free to pursue any legal claims they may have including those addressed in the confirmed plan.id.
ii.analysis 
in reviewing the district court decision to reverse the bankruptcy court,we employ the same standard of review that the district court itself used.corporate assets,paloian,cir.therefore,we review the bankruptcy court determinations of law de novo and findings of fact for clear error.in re,cir.but where the bankruptcy code commits a decision to the discretion of the bankruptcy court,we review that decision only for an abuse of discretion.fortney,at citing in re leventhal,cir.a court abuses its discretion when its decision is premised on an incorrect legal principle or a clearly erroneous factual finding,or when the record contains no evidence on which the court rationally could have relied.corporate assets,at.
