glenn and ann mccrory appeal from the judgment of the bankruptcy appellate panel bap reversing the bankruptcy court and holding that the debt owed them by robert spigel as a result of a rhode island superior court judgment was not exempt from discharge pursuant to a a.the mccrorys claim that the collateral estoppel effect of the superior court judgment creating the debt establishes that spigel committed fraud in a transaction related to that debt,and hence that debt should be exempt from discharge.the bap disagreed,concluding that the superior court did not find that spigel engaged in fraud,thereby precluding reliance on collateral estoppel.we disagree with the bap analysis because the superior court judgment reflected findings that spigel engaged in fraudulent conduct.however,that judgment did not establish a sufficient link between spigel fraudulent conduct and the debt spigel owes the mccrorys to allow an exception to discharge under a a on the basis of collateral estoppel.consequently,we affirm for a different reason.
the facts in this case are drawn from the judgment and record of the rhode island superior court.the mccrorys are owners of an unincorporated business,frenchtown auto sales,that services and sells automobiles in north kingstown,rhode island.at some point prior to the events at issue here,the mccrorys entered into a verbal agreement with spigel concerning frenchtown business.first,the mccrorys wanted an independent contractor to perform all of their service work.spigel formed a corporation called a smiling bob enterprises,smiling bob,and the mccrorys agreed to have that corporation service automobiles at the frenchtown lot.second,the mccrorys hired spigel individually as a sales agent.under rhode island law,an individual can only sell six cars per year.to sell more,a special license is required.spigel did not have the requisite license,so the mccrorys extended to him the authority to use their license to sell and buy cars,provided that spigel did so either at auctions or on the frenchtown lot.
the transaction that underlies the debt at issue here began when spigel received a phone call from a nephew who sold cars in new york.this nephew had three cars with new jersey titles that he wished spigel to sell for him.spigel took delivery of the cars and sold all three,one to tarbox motors and two to apollo auto sales.both buyers were rhode island dealers.spigel used the mccrorys license number to authorize all three sales,even though none of the sales were conducted in accordance with the limited grant of authority given to him by the mccrorys.the sales did not occur at auction or on the frenchtown lot.
although spigel claimed that he had called an unidentified police officer to run the cars vehicle identification numbers vin to ensure their legitimacy,the cars were,in fact,stolen apollo discovered this problem soon after the sale,when it performed its own check of the vin.informed of the problem,spigel refunded the purchase price of both cars and then called tarbox to stop any sale of the car he had sold them.spigel did not,however,refund the purchase price to tarbox or take any other action to reimburse tarbox,apparently lacking the funds to do so.tarbox submitted a claim to its insurer for the loss associated with the stolen car.the insurer paid the claim and then,rather than suing spigel for the loss,proceeded before the rhode island motor vehicles dealers commission to get reimbursement from the mccrorys through spigel use of the mccrorys license to sell a stolen car.before the commission contacted them concerning this complaint,the mccrorys had not known of spigel sales to tarbox and apollo.the mccrorys claimed,in their defense,that spigel had acted on his own.the commission rejected this defense and ordered the mccrorys to reimburse tarbox insurer the purchase price that tarbox had paid spigel for the car 
after working out an arrangement to pay tarbox insurer,the mccrorys instituted an action against spigel in the rhode island superior court.in due course,the mccrorys filed a motion for summary judgment seeking to ground the liability of spigel on a theory of equitable indemnification.although the superior court found that both spigel and the mccrorys were liable to tarbox,it also concluded that spigel had,through a transaction that failed to bear any indicia of legitimacy,been entirely at fault in causing tarbox loss.the court noted the cars illicit background and spigel unauthorized use of the mccrorys rhode island auto sales license.the cars new jersey titles had obvious misspellings and two of the titles,though with two different previous owners,had the same control number spigel also listed frenchtown on the back of the titles as the buyers of the vehicles,even though frenchtown had no involvement at all with the cars.moreover,spigel created a new bill of sale designed to further the false impression that he was acting as agent for frenchtown.this bill of sale bore the heading specializing in high quality one owner reconditioned vehicles.you just made a great deal.a smiling bob enterprises,incorporated frenchtown auto sales.in contrast to the opprobrium it directed at spigel,the court found that the mccrorys were blameless.consequently,the court ordered spigel to indemnify the mccrorys for the money they paid to tarbox insurer.
spigel appealed to the rhode island supreme court.during the pendency of that appeal,spigel filed for bankruptcy.the mccrorys responded with the present adversary proceeding,seeking to have the debt created by the superior court judgment deemed nondischargeable pursuant to a a.the bankruptcy court stayed the proceeding pending the rhode island supreme court decision.shortly after the supreme court affirmed,spigel and the mccrorys filed for summary judgment in the bankruptcy court,agreeing that the court should take judicial notice of the decision and record in the rhode island courts.in a terse order,the bankruptcy court granted the mccrorys motion and denied spigel,thereby ruling that spigel debt to the mccrorys was nondischargeable.spigel appealed to the bap,which reversed and ordered judgment in favor of spigel.the mccrorys now appeal.
