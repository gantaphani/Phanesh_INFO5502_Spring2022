this appeal arises from an involuntary chapter bankruptcy petition filed by eight putative creditors of focus media,focus.these creditors consisted of appellees national broadcasting company,nbc,abc abc and paxson communications,paxson,as well as five affiliates of abc collectively with appellees,petitioning creditors.focus appeals the district court order affirming the bankruptcy court orders granting the petitioning creditors motion for summary judgment and denying focus motions to disqualify the bankruptcy judge.appellees contend that this appeal is moot and that,in any event,the bankruptcy and district courts correctly decided the merits.
we do not dismiss focus appeal as moot.however,because focus did not present evidence that creates a triable issue of fact regarding the involuntary petition requirements of,and the bankruptcy judge did not abuse her discretion in deciding not to recuse herself,we affirm.
background 
focus was a company that placed commercial spots for its clients on television and radio stations.its two major clients were sears,roebuck sears and universal city studios,universal,each of which paid focus in advance for booking commercial time on various media outlets,such as the petitioning creditors.focus,in turn,would pay the media outlets for the booked commercial spots.
universal and sears fired focus in and,respectively.sears subsequently filed a civil suit against focus in california superior court,alleging that funds it had paid focus were transferred for the specific purpose of focus paying the media outlets on sears behalf.according to sears,the funds had not in fact been used to pay the media.thus,sears sought a preliminary injunction against focus,alleging that the money paid to focus belonged to sears and not focus focus,however,argued that it owed millions of dollars to the media for spots it had booked for sears and others and thus should be permitted to keep the payments sears had advanced to focus.the superior court granted sears a preliminary injunction on may,prohibiting focus from distributing or transferring any of sears funds.
on october,nbc,abc and paxson filed an involuntary petition for chapter bankruptcy against focus,pursuant to.five abc affiliates joined the petition in january.the involuntary petition triggered an automatic stay of the state court proceedings under.
on october,sears moved in the bankruptcy court for relief from the automatic stay,so that it could pursue its state court action.the next day,sears filed an alternative motion for the appointment of an interim trustee.on october,the bankruptcy court granted the motion for an interim trustee.
the bankruptcy court proceedings were tense and.on november,focus moved to disqualify the bankruptcy judge,who heard the motion on december and denied it on january.on july,focus moved again to disqualify the bankruptcy judge,who,after a hearing,also denied this second motion on september.in addition to these two disqualification motions,focus chief financial officer also filed a judicial misconduct complaint against the bankruptcy judge with the judicial council of the ninth circuit 
meanwhile,on december,focus filed a motion for summary judgment of the involuntary petition.the bankruptcy judge heard the motion on january,denying it on february.
on august,the petitioning creditors filed their own motion for summary judgment.under,petitioners may impose involuntary bankruptcy on an alleged debtor only if certain conditions are met.if the debtor has more than total creditors,which focus did at the time of the petition,the petitioners must show that there are at least three qualified petitioning creditors they each hold claims against the debtor not subject to bona fide dispute and totaling at least and the debtor is not generally paying debts as they become due.b,h 
on september,the bankruptcy court granted the petitioning creditors motion as to these three issues.specifically,the bankruptcy court found that there was not a genuine issue for trial as to the petitioning creditors showing that seven of the eight petitioning being the claims against focus the claims of these seven petitioning creditors were not in bona fide dispute and totaled over million and focus debt structure revealed that it was not generally paying its debts as they became due 
the bankruptcy court,however,denied the petitioning creditors summary judgment on focus affirmative defense of bad faith as to abc.expressing concern that a reviewing court might conclude that bad faith by abc could defeat the petition entirely,the bankruptcy judge therefore declined to issue an order for relief in favor of the petitioning creditors.instead,she held over for trial the issues of whether abc had a claim against focus and whether abc had filed against focus in bad faith.after a trial,the bankruptcy court ruled in favor of abc on these issues and entered an order for relief on october.focus promptly filed a notice of appeal to the district court from the order for relief and,after the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court,filed a combined notice of appeal with this court on may.although focus has appealed the bankruptcy court grant of summary judgment and denials of its disqualification motions,it has not appealed its claim of bad faith by abc.
discussion 
we independently review the bankruptcy court ruling without deference to the district court decision.virtual vision,praegitzer,in re virtual vision,cir.whereas the bankruptcy court decision to grant summary judgment is reviewed de novo,its factual findings are reviewed for clear error.see am.broad,beta communications,in re betacom of phoenix,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the record shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.arrow,justus in re kaypro,cir quoting.c.further,we review for abuse of discretion the bankruptcy court denial of focus motions for disqualification.united states wilkerson,cir.because focus prior claim of bad faith by abc is not before us,the order of relief can be sustained if we uphold the district court affirmation of the bankruptcy court summary judgment order and denial of focus motions for disqualification.
appellees contend that focus appeal is moot because focus failed to obtain a stay in either the bankruptcy court or the district court and failed to seek one in this court.according to appellees,the trustee has filed and abandoned various claims in the bankruptcy proceeding and granting relief to focus would create an unmanageable situation in the bankruptcy court.
bankruptcy appeals may become moot in one of two somewhat overlapping ways.first,events may occur that make it impossible for the appellate court to fashion effective relief.bennett gemmill in re combined metals reduction,cir.for example,when a trustee has already sold assets to third parties,a court may be powerless to undo what has already been done.id.however,t he party asserting mootness has a heavy burden to establish that there is no effective relief remaining for a court to provide.pintlar fid.cas.in re pintlar,cir.second,an appeal may become equitably moot when a ppellants have failed and neglected diligently to pursue their available remedies to obtain a stay of the objectionable orders of the bankruptcy court,thus permitt ing such a comprehensive change of circumstances to occur as to render it inequitable to consider the merits of the appeal.trone roberts farms,in re roberts farms,cir.in roberts farms,a ppellants did not at any time apply to the bankruptcy judge for a stay,id.at,and we concluded that dismissal for mootness was appropriate,id.at.
fashioning relief in this case would not be impossible.focus seeks relief primarily under i.when a court dismisses an involuntary petition,i allows an award of costs and attorney fees from the petitioners to the debtor.here,focus also asks us to order the disgorgement of attorney fees previously paid out of focus estate to the petitioning creditors attorneys.to clear the way for the relief focus seeks,we would have to return control of the business to focus,discharge the trustee and dismiss the involuntary petition.see semel dill in re dill,cir an award of attorney fees under i depends upon dismissal of the petition.because we could fashion these equitable remedies,effective relief is available to focus,and this case is therefore not moot under the first type of mootness.see spirtos moreno in re spirtos,cir holding appeal not moot when court could order debtor to return to the estate distributions of pension plan assets.
neither are we persuaded that we should dismiss focus appeal as equitably moot.appellees have not demonstrated that this case present s transactions that are so complex or difficult to unwind that the doctrine of equitable mootness would apply.lowenschuss selnick in re lowenschuss,cir.because focus seeks an exit instead of a,the termination of bankruptcy proceedings and the dismissal of the trustee,rather than a complex corporate requested relief is not only possible but decidedly more practicable than the relief sought in other bankruptcy appeals we have dismissed as moot.see baker drake,pub.serv.comm in re baker drake,cir holding appeal not moot where bankruptcy proceedings involved third parties but unlike roberts farms and rochman northeast utils.serv.group in re pub.serv,cir,the reorganization plan is not a complex,affair that has affected innumerable third parties mann alexander dawson in re mann,cir explaining debtor failure to obtain stay of foreclosure sale pending appeal rendered moot his appeal of bankruptcy court ruling on foreclosure action,where debtor under california law no longer had right of redemption in the property and the sale would not be set aside moreover,an order compelling disgorgement of attorney fees and expenses would not require the bankruptcy court to unravel a complicated bankruptcy plan.rather,it would require only that one party disgorge money it has received,money that would then be distributed pursuant to the bankruptcy court final decree.retail stores ekstrom in re retail stores,cir.
finally,unlike the appellants in roberts farms,focus did seek stays of the order for relief in the bankruptcy court and before the district court.these requests were denied.moreover,focus did not invite these bankruptcy proceedings rather,the petitioning creditors forced focus into bankruptcy.we therefore decline to dismiss this appeal based on equitable mootness.
ii.summary judgment 
bona fide dispute 
petitioners in an involuntary chapter proceeding must establish that they have claims totaling at least that are not subject to bona fide dispute.b.here,focus contends that the petitioning creditors claims are subject to bona fide dispute,notwithstanding the bankruptcy court finding that focus owed the petitioning creditors millions of dollars.focus contends that its obligations to these creditors is in dispute because of potential adjustments focus clients may be entitled to from the petitioning creditors.
in declarations filed in focus state court litigation with sears,focus chairman and chief executive officer,tom rubin,explained that focus routinely paid the media days after receiving their bills.rubin also admitted that focus was liable to the media for many millions of dollars.a document that surfaced in the bankruptcy proceedings,focus aged payables report,confirmed rubin admission,listing million in debts older than days that focus owed to the petitioning creditors as of march,this amount far exceeds the required by b 
focus contends that the amounts listed in its aged payables report overstate its actual debts because of an adjustment process called,whereby focus would reconcile advertising charges with the media for commercial spots that failed to run at the promised time or to achieve the promised audience.according to focus,is completed to days after the end of the quarter,after which focus would contact the media stations to negotiate compensation for nonconforming commercials.thus,for example,t he parties agreed that focus media would pay invoices from nbc stations within days after receipt of the station invoice,and that would be resolved by negotiation and compromise,before any litigation was filed.
it is undisputed that the commercial spots giving rise to the debts listed in focus aged payables report were never subjected to.focus contends,however,that it was unable to conduct a because its employees quit during the bankruptcy proceeding and because the trustee took custody of the relevant files.in lieu of a,focus submitted to the bankruptcy court declarations from analysts who alleged that the petitioning creditors had overcharged focus and,more generally,that a full would reduce the amounts focus owed to the petitioning creditors.focus contends that because there has not been a full reconciliation of its debts to the petitioning creditors,those debts can not be ascertained with certitude and are thus in dispute.
moreover,relying on our decision in liberty tool manufacturing vortex fishing systems,in re vortex fishing systems,cir,focus further contends that any uncertainty or dispute as to the amount of a debt is a bona fide dispute unless the dispute arises from a transaction that is wholly separate from the debt itself.vortex held that a bona fide dispute exists when there is a legitimate disagreement over whether money is owed,or,in certain cases,how much.id.at emphasis added.vortex also discussed chicago title insurance seko investment,in re seko investment,cir,noting that seko had held that a dispute as to the amount of a claim is not a bona fide dispute if it is based on a counterclaim arising from a wholly separate transaction.vortex,at.focus argues that the uncertainty of the amounts owed to the petitioning creditors does not arise from a wholly separate transaction within the meaning of vortex and seko,and is therefore a bona fide dispute that defeats the petition under b.we conclude that the bankruptcy court properly found against focus both on the facts and as a matter of law.
regarding the facts,the bankruptcy court found that even if would have discovered nonconforming commercials that would have entitled focus or its clients to an adjustment,the amounts shown as currently due in focus aged payables report remained valid.rubin explanation of and his acknowledgment that focus owed millions of dollars to the media companies establish that focus was obligated to pay the amounts billed by the media as they came due,with any adjustments coming from a later and separate.further,as the district court explained 
focus makes only an argument for the potential that the amounts would be in dispute.at the stage of summary adjudication,it was incumbent upon focus media to present evidence to support its contention of disputes as to the actual amounts,listed in the reports or otherwise at issue,not merely to speculate how such claim could,potentially,be disputed the declaration it submitted amounted to argument,not a demonstration of a bona fide dispute.
thus,the bankruptcy court properly concluded that focus had not established any actual dispute as to the amounts owed the petitioning creditors.
regarding our case law,even assuming there was an actual,dispute as to the precise amounts focus owed the petitioning creditors,under seko such a dispute is relevant only if it takes the total debt below.we disagree with focus contention that an uncertainty or dispute as to amounts owed above can create a bona fide dispute as to the entire debt.when a counterclaim arises from the same transaction as the debtor claim,it 
may serve to work a diminution or setoff of the claim of the petitioning creditors.because the bankruptcy code requires that the claims of petitioning creditors against a debtor aggregate a certain amount,this diminution can reduce a petitioning creditor claim so that the creditor is no longer eligible to file an involuntary petition.
seko,at citations and internal quotation marks omitted under seko,a dispute as to the amount of a claim gives rise to a bona fide dispute only when it does not arise from a wholly separate transaction and netting out the claims of debtors could take the petitioning creditors below the amount threshold of.id.
that vortex referred only to the first of seko premises does not undermine the second.seko discussion of netting out the claims of debtors merely stated a widely accepted proposition regarding involuntary bankruptcy petitions i f at least a portion of the debt that is the subject of the petition is undisputed,the undisputed portion is sufficient to create a debt under section b not subject to a bona fide dispute.ibm credit compuhouse,see subway equip.leasing sims in re sims,cir explaining that even if creditors had failed to make reasonable efforts to mitigate their damages,any such failure would serve only to reduce the amount of their claims it would not constitute a substantial factual or legal question bearing on the debtors liability see also in re willow lake partners ii,in re,in re onyx,collier on bankruptcy b i ed.revised hereinafter collier citing seko for the proposition that a counterclaim arising out of a different transaction and hence not creating a right of recoupment does not evidence the existence of a bona fide dispute.counterclaims,however,may be relevant in determining whether the requisite dollar amount is met under section b or whether the debtor is generally not paying its debts as they become due under section h.
applying this proposition here,we conclude that focus did not raise a triable issue of fact as to whether the petitioning creditors have claims totaling at least that are not subject to a bona fide dispute.plainly,focus did not present evidence to show that its debts to the petitioning creditors fell below this threshold.nothing in the record rebuts the petitioning creditors documented assertions that their claims totaled millions of dollars,well over.nor is there evidence suggesting that any would have generated adjustments of the magnitude necessary to shrink the millions of dollars of debt anywhere near,much less below that amount.moreover,focus has not pointed to evidence that the interim trustee prevented it from conducting,or any authority supporting its view that the departure of focus employees excused it from having to conduct.we therefore hold that the bankruptcy court appropriately granted summary judgment to the petitioning creditors,finding that they collectively held claims totaling at least that were not subject to a bona fide dispute.
requirement 
the eight petitioning creditors include abc and five of its affiliates.the affiliates qualifications as petitioning creditors were determined at summary judgment,whereas abc qualifications were determined after trial.focus now contends that abc and its affiliates are disqualified as petitioning creditors because they illicitly transferred or acquired claims for the purpose of initiating the involuntary bankruptcy in violation of bankruptcy rule a,which provides 
a transferor or transferee of a claim shall annex to the original and each copy of the petition a copy of all documents evidencing the transfer,whether transferred unconditionally,for security,or otherwise,and a signed statement that the claim was not transferred for the purpose of commencing the case and setting forth the consideration for and terms of the transfer.an entity that has transferred or acquired a claim for the purpose of commencing a case for liquidation under chapter or for reorganization under chapter shall not be a qualified petitioner.
here,the petition would not satisfy the requirement of b only if focus is correct that abc and its five affiliates are disqualified as petitioning creditors under rule,in which case only nbc and paxson would remain.
during the trial concerning abc petition,abc offered testimony that its affiliates had turned to abc to facilitate the collection of debts owed them by focus.tanya menton,an attorney for abc,testified in reference to these debt collection efforts that,in my humble opinion there was a transfer of all of the claims from the abc affiliates to abc,she explained,however,that the affiliates did not come to her and ask that she file a petition for involuntary bankruptcy,but instead sought her help in collecting their claims against focus.relying on menton testimony,focus argues that abc and its five affiliates can not be qualified petitioning creditors because they transferred or acquired a claim for the purpose of commencing a case for liquidation under chapter in violation of rule a 
rule endeavors to curtail trafficking in claims.sims,at in re butcher.without rule,such trafficking could enable entities without proper claims to acquire them and thus become petitioning creditors,or facilitate by companies seeking to satisfy the requirement.see in re averil,expressing concern that i f the of a single obligation qualify as separate claimants the legislative purpose of requiring a joint effort to launch an involuntary proceeding would be frustrated.
here,the bankruptcy court did not err in finding that there were no illicit transfers.notwithstanding menton testimony,the bankruptcy court observed 
nobody testified to there being an oral or written request for transfer.menton feeling that those entities wanted abc,to collect the debt from focus falls far short of there being a legally valid transfer or an assignment from the subsidiaries to abc.moreover there was no testimony about any particular subsidiary.
in addition,focus contention that the abc affiliates transferred their claims to abc is contradicted by a prior agreement between abc and focus.according to that agreement,abc could not claim for itself debts owed to separately incorporated media stations,even if those stations were affiliates of abc.consistent with the agreement,abc never did contend that it qualified as a petitioning creditor based on the debts owed to the five abc affiliates that separately filed their own petitions thus,the bankruptcy court did not err in rejecting menton characterization of the facts and finding instead that abc affiliates had not transferred their claims to abc.
we therefore conclude that abc and its five affiliates were not subject to disqualification as petitioning creditors under rule.given that nbc,paxson and the five abc affiliates each holds claims against focus that are not subject to a bona fide dispute,the bankruptcy court correctly concluded that there was no triable issue of fact regarding b requirement.
paying debts as they become due 
because we agree with the bankruptcy court that there were no triable issues of fact regarding the bona fide dispute and issues,we turn to the issue of whether focus was not generally paying its debts as they became due.see h.before summary judgment,the bankruptcy court imposed a discovery sanction on focus,establishing as fact that focus was not generally paying its debts as they became due.nonetheless,in granting summary judgment,the bankruptcy court made an independent and separate finding to this effect based on the record before it.
we agree with the bankruptcy court grant of summary judgment on this issue.this circuit has adopted a totality of the circumstances test for determining whether an alleged debtor is generally paying its debts as they become due.hayes rewald in re bishop,baldwin,rewald,dillingham wong,cir.thus,a finding that a debtor is generally not paying its debts requires a more general showing of the debtor financial condition and debt structure than merely establishing the existence of a few unpaid debts.vortex,at quoting dill,at.in vortex,for example,we held that the bankruptcy court did not clearly err in finding that vortex was generally paying its debts as they became due,where vortex ha d been paying off the debts it ha d incurred,including a full settlement of the irs deficiency that was assessed.at.
the circumstances of vortex are not replicated here.as we have explained,rubin admitted in his state court declarations that focus debts to media companies became due within days of receiving their invoices and that focus owed media companies millions of dollars for such debts.there is no evidence that focus was paying off its debts owed to the media companies at all,let alone within days.further,the bankruptcy court explained 
th e aged payables report as of shows total owed to creditors listed in the
