in this appeal we must decide whether the district court properly exercised its discretion in holding plaintiff wayne gardner is judicially estopped from pursuing his personal injury claims against defendants because he failed to disclose his pending claims to the bankruptcy court in the context of his chapter bankruptcy.our jurisdiction arises under.we conclude the district court properly exercised its discretion,and affirm.
gardner was injured in an auto accident while in the employ of defendant union pacific railroad uprr.gardner,represented by a personal injury attorney,filed an action along with a coworker in federal district court for damages in september against uprr pursuant to the federal employers liability act.see.he alleged wyoming state law negligence claims against the remaining defendants pursuant to the supplemental jurisdiction statute.see.with his personal injury claims pending,gardner and his wife retained a bankruptcy attorney and in may filed a voluntary chapter bankruptcy petition.gardner did not notify his personal injury attorney of the bankruptcy.
the bankruptcy petition,which gardner signed under penalty of perjury,failed to disclose his pending lawsuit as a potential asset of the estate.by signing the petition,gardner verified he had read the petition,schedules,and statement of financial affairs,and the information contained therein was true and correct.on schedule b relating to personal property,gardner checked none as to item.item required gardner to disclose o ther contingent and unliquidated claims of every nature.item on his statement of financial affairs required gardner to l ist all suits and administrative proceedings to which the debtor is or was a party within the preceding year.gardner listed two collection suits.conspicuously absent from the list was gardner pending personal injury lawsuit against defendants.
at the meeting of creditors in june,gardner unequivocally responded no when the trustee asked him if he had a personal injury suit pending.when given a second chance to set the record straight,gardner failed to do so.instead,gardner let his bankruptcy attorney do the talking 
trustee do either of you have a personal injury suit pending

trustee so,you just continue to hang out there,huh 
attorney ya.
trustee are there any creditors here for the gardners i do see that there is anything to administer.i am going to close this as a no asset case.this is completed.
in august,the bankruptcy court entered an order granting gardner a discharge under chapter of the bankruptcy code.neither the district court nor counsel involved in gardner personal injury suit had yet to learn of his bankruptcy.
nearly a year later,gardner personal injury attorney became aware of his bankruptcy while performing a routine court search under gardner name.counsel promptly notified the bankruptcy trustee,and in july,the trustee moved to reopen the chapter bankruptcy case and list gardner pending lawsuit as an asset of the estate.according to the trustee motion,t he debtors testified at the meeting of creditors that there was a workers compensation action for gardner that was considered to be exempt.subsequently,the trustee was notified of the pending personal injury action regarding gardner that was a rail road workers compensation action which is not exempt.the bankruptcy court entered an order reopening the case the next day.
at a pretrial hearing before the district court the next week,gardner personal injury attorney informed the court and defense counsel that he recently discovered gardner had filed for bankruptcy and received a discharge during the pendency of the personal injury action.after the trustee unsuccessfully attempted to sell the lawsuit to gardner for the benefit of his creditors,the court granted the trustee leave to intervene and substituted the trustee as plaintiff and in the personal injury action.see.a.defendants shortly thereafter moved for summary judgment against both gardner and the trustee based on the equitable defense of judicial estoppel.
applying the principles set forth in new hampshire maine,d,the district court concluded gardner and the trustee were estopped from pursuing personal injury claims against defendants.in a thorough written order,the district court explained gardner took an inconsistent position before the bankruptcy court.he convinced the bankruptcy court to rely on his inconsistent position.and he gained an unfair advantage,or substantial benefit,by obtaining the discharge of his debts in a no asset bankruptcy.eastman union pacific railroad,order at,filed,unpublished.the court further concluded,based on the undisputed historical facts,that gardner had a motive to conceal his personal injury claim from the bankruptcy court and that his failure to disclose was not inadvertent 
what the court finds most telling is the fact that when given the opportunity at the meeting of creditors to reveal the pending litigation,gardner did not disclose his personal injury action.first,he explicitly denied having a personal injury action pending.second,his attorney represented that the claim was not workers compensation per se,but indicated that any claim was related to an injury,leading the trustee to believe that the claim was similar in nature to a workers compensation claim.third,gardner attorney referred to uprr failure to provide hearing aids to gardner,misrepresenting the extent of the claims involved.gardner had an affirmative duty to speak up and let the trustee know the nature of his lawsuit against uprr as well as eight other defendants 
id.at.careful not to suggest gardner or his bankruptcy attorney intentionally lied to the bankruptcy court in an effort to conceal assets,the district court nonetheless refused to take the benign view that the failure to disclose was inadvertent 
if the only defendant in the personal injury action had been gardner employer,uprr,the court might have been swayed that gardner attempted to disclose the lawsuit.certainly,there was a discussion in the meeting of creditors of a work related injury.as it stands,however,no reference was ever made,however slight,to the eight other defendants involved in the personal injury action,six of whom are not even tangentially related to uprr.the bankruptcy court was misled,and it is incumbent upon this court to protect the integrity of the judicial process 
id.at.this appeal followed 
at the outset we note that shortly prior to the district court decision,the trustee settled the personal injury action with two named defendants who are not before us on appeal.this ultimately provided the bankruptcy estate with sufficient assets to pay all allowable creditors claims.with gardner debts satisfied,the bankruptcy court entered an order directing the trustee to abandon the estate interest in this appeal,and the trustee has done so.accordingly,we grant the parties pending motions to substitute plaintiff gardner in this appeal as the in place of the bankruptcy trustee,amend the caption of this appeal to reflect such change,and proceed.see fed.a 
this appeal arises in the context of summary judgment,so we view the facts and all reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party,gardner.see roberts barreras,cir.assuming the district court has properly characterized the facts in light of the applicable standard,we then review its decision to judicially estop gardner from pursuing his personal injury claims only for an abuse of discretion.see new hampshire,at.a court abuses its discretion only when it makes a clear error of judgm
