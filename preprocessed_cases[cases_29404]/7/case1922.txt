thomas connolly,chapter trustee for the debtor,miniscribe corporation,appeals from orders of the district court reversing an order of the bankruptcy court awarding him a trustee fee of,and ordering that he be allowed a fee of.we affirm.
on january,the debtor filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy under chapter.it converted the case to a chapter liquidation on april.ten days later,connolly was appointed chapter trustee.
at the time connolly assumed his duties as trustee,the miniscribe estate was insolvent.the estate had only cash on hand,and faced chapter administrative expenses exceeding million,a superpriority claim against it by standard chartered bank scb in the amount of million,and total claims of approximately million.the only opportunities to develop a bankruptcy estate lay in recoveries on avoidance claims and in a fraud action against former miniscribe officers and outside accountants and consultants.
the bankruptcy court found that connolly performed admirably in obtaining funds for the estate.he not only convinced scb to reduce its claim from million to million,but also further persuaded it to loan the estate million to defray the cost of prosecuting its fraud action.this action was eventually settled on terms highly favorable to the bankruptcy estate and its creditors,yielding over million for the payment of claims.connolly also conducted adversary proceedings that realized over million for the estate and that resulted in the reduction of claims against the estate from approximately million to approximately million.finally,connolly settled a recovery action against one of miniscribe creditors by taking an equity interest in the creditor which connolly ultimately sold for over five times the value of the settlement.
the bankruptcy court made a number of interim fee payments to connolly as trustee.in his final fee application,he sought additional compensation that would have resulted in a total fee of.this was the maximum fee permitted at that time under the percentage fee scheme the cap outlined in a appellee harris trust company,representing miniscribe debenture holders,opposed the request,as did the united states trustee.
first bankruptcy court decision 
the bankruptcy court carefully analyzed connolly fee request and issued an extensive order and opinion approving the statutory maximum payment.connolly harris trust in re miniscribe.the court determined that during his administration,connolly had disbursed through his accounts.this amount,which included settlements of fraud actions that the trustee and other litigants had brought against third party defendants,would be used in calculating the statutory maximum under the cap set out in a.
the bankruptcy court next applied a lodestar analysis,focusing on a reasonable number of hours spent by the trustee on his duties multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate.it noted that connolly time records reflected hours spent on the case,along with an additional hours spent by his paralegals.the bankruptcy court concluded that this amount of time,however,was misleadingly low because connolly had performed more efficiently than expected.it rejected the objectors position that the hourly rate should be differentiated,with a rate of to awarded for time spent on the fraud litigation and a more modest rate of awarded for time spent on other activities.the court determined that a uniform,reasonable hourly rate of should be applied to the hours reasonably expended by connolly,resulting in a lodestar fee of.
the court next adjusted the lodestar fee by considering the factors outlined in johnson georgia highway express,cir.it determined that these factors novelty and difficulty of the issues requisite skill preclusion of other employment contingent nature of the fee time limitations amount involved and results obtained and the experience,reputation,and ability of the trustee justified a lodestar multiplier of,resulting in a total fee of.
alternatively,the court applied a common fund or percentage of the fund analysis to arrive at an appropriate fee.if the trustee were allowed his claimed fee of,the total adjusted costs for raising and administering the common fund of the bankruptcy estate would be,approximately percent of the total funds that had been administered by the trustee.this percentage,the bankruptcy court determined,was well within the range of permissible costs on a percentage basis.
first district court decision 
harris trust appealed from the bankruptcy court award.in an unpublished order and judgment,the district court rejected application of the common fund analysis under the circumstances of this case.under a common fund theory,the court reasoned,the entire cost of recovery of the amount disbursed by connolly would be borne by the only remaining creditors,the subordinated debenture holders.moreover,connolly was not solely responsible for creation of the fund the plaintiffs whose fraud claims had been consolidated with his own had also been represented by able counsel and the bankruptcy court had not factored in the fees,costs and expenses paid to them.
the district court also rejected the per hour unified lodestar rate as lacking in evidentiary support.it found the multiplier unjustified because it overstated the risk of to connolly,ignored the routine nature of much of the work he had performed,and overlooked the contribution of the trustee counsel and counsel for the other fraud plaintiffs to the recovery of the fund.the bankruptcy court would have to recalculate the adjusted lodestar amount on remand.
finally,the district court addressed the statutory cap.it found that miniscribe bankruptcy estate had been unusual because of the amount of money passing through the trustee accounts and because of the circumstances surrounding those disbursements.it noted that million of the approximately million that had passed through the trustee accounts had been paid to other parties who had consolidated their fraud actions with the trustee fraud action for purposes of trial.the correct measure of the results achieved for purposes of computing the statutory cap lay somewhere between the million contended for by harris trust,and the million figure adopted by the bankruptcy court.the precise figure was left to be calculated by the bankruptcy court on remand.
second bankruptcy court decision 
the bankruptcy court held further hearings on remand and took up the fee issues in a second published decision,connolly harris trust in re miniscribe.it recalculated the size of the estate,leaving a figure of million attributable to connolly efforts.
the bankruptcy court did not read the district court order to preclude application of a common fund analysis it believed the district court had only rejected its application based on the bankruptcy court prior findings.therefore,having adjusted these findings,the bankruptcy court once again applied a common fund percentage analysis to the million estate realized by connolly efforts.assuming connolly were awarded the million he sought,the million total administrative burden would still be within a reasonable range under a common fund analysis.
the bankruptcy court next turned to the lodestar analysis.addressing the district court criticism of its previous effort,it conceded that there was no direct support for the per hour figure in the record.upon consideration of connolly highly responsible role and the fees charged by other professionals,however,the bankruptcy court determined that while a fee of per hour would not be unreasonable,a rate of per hour would also be reasonable.applied to the hours accounted for by connolly,the base lodestar amount would be.
the bankruptcy court next turned to the district court criticism of its use of a lodestar multiplier.after again analyzing the trustee contribution to and success achieved in the case,it concluded that a multiplier of would be appropriate.thus,the adjusted lodestar fee would be.once again,however,the bankruptcy court concluded that the lodestar fee was not the appropriate measure of reasonable compensation instead,it allowed a larger amount of,calculated under a common fund approach.
second district court decision 
harris trust again appealed from the bankruptcy court award.the district court again concluded that a common fund analysis was inappropriate in this case.it found that there was no way to quantify connolly contribution to the bankruptcy estate that would be comparable to the fund creation theory supporting application of the common fund method.the district court opined that the lodestar method,rather than the common fund method,was the appropriate measure of compensation for this case.it concluded that the adjusted lodestar fee of arrived at by the bankruptcy court in its second decision constituted a reasonable fee within its sound discretion.
standard of review 
the district court first order was not a final,appealable decision under d,because it remanded the case to the bankruptcy court for significant further proceedings of a discretionary nature.office of thrift supervision overland park fin.in re overland park fin,cir.connolly appeal from the district court second,final order,however,permits us to address issues pertaining to both orders,as he requests.see masunaga stoltenberg in re rex montis silver,cir.
our review of the bankruptcy court decision is governed by the same standards of review that govern the district court review of the bankruptcy court.accordingly we review the bankruptcy court legal determinations de novo and its factual findings under the clearly erroneous standard.a finding of fact is clearly erroneous if it is without factual support in the record or if,after reviewing all of the evidence,we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.
conoco,styler in re peterson,cir citations omitted.
seeking to reap the deferential standard of review accorded to the bankruptcy court factual findings favorable to his position,connolly paints all the underlying issues here as factual.he contends that the district court improperly supplanted the bankruptcy court factual findings concerning the comparable cost of his services,a reasonable hourly rate for his services,and the contingent nature of his fee.harris trust,by contrast,argues that this case also presents an important legal issue requiring our de novo review.it asks whether a bankruptcy trustee who does not act as his own litigation counsel may ever be compensated based on a common fund methodology.we will exercise de novo review to conclude that under the applicable statutes common fund methodology is not an appropriate form of compensation for a chapter trustee.
statutory authority 
authority for payment of a reasonable fee to a chapter trustee is found in and.section a provides that a bankruptcy court may award a trustee 
reasonable compensation for actual,necessary services rendered by such trustee and by any paraprofessional persons employed by such trustee based on the nature,the extent,and the value of such services,the time spent on such services,and the cost of comparable services other than in a case under this title and 
reimbursement for actual,necessary expenses.
section a provides a formula that limits the compensation of a chapter trustee arrived at under 
in a case under chapter the court may allow reasonable compensation under section of this title of the trustee for the trustee services,payable after the trustee renders such services,not to exceed fifteen percent on the first or less,six percent on any amount in excess of but not in excess of,and three percent on any amount in excess of,upon all moneys disbursed or turned over in the case by the trustee to parties in interest,excluding the debtor,but including holders of secured claims.
under this standard,a sets the maximum compensation payable to the trustee it does not establish a presumptive or minimum compensation.
the computation in a is a limitation on compensation,not a mandate for minimum commissions.the section states that the court may allow only reasonable compensation under section.thus,the cap of section a is implicated only when the compensation is reasonable,and reasonableness is a determination that must begin with.
in re butts.
accordingly,a court awarding trustee fees must begin by assessing reasonableness under a before applying the cap under a.
common fund theory 
the common fund doctrine was first recognized by the supreme court in trustees greenough,and most recently discussed in boeing van gemert,d.essentially,the doctrine holds that a litigant or lawyer who recovers a common fund for the benefit of persons other than himself or his client is entitled to a reasonable attorney fee from the fund as a whole.boeing,at.at.it is most appropriate when the class of persons benefitted by the lawsuit is small and easily identifiable,the benefits can be traced with some accuracy,and the costs of the litigation can be shifted accurately to those who profit by it.this is an equitable doctrine,and is usually justified on the ground that it prevents unjust enrichment of the,who have taken a free ride on the trailblazer efforts.jurisdiction over the fund enables a court to prevent such inequity by assessing fees out of the entire fund,spreading the burden proportionately among those benefitted.

as connolly notes,we have approved the use of common fund methodology to award attorneys whose efforts created a fund benefitting persons other than themselves or their clients.see,gottlieb barry,cir.this case,however,presents a different issue whether a approach analogous to the equitable doctrine of common fund has a place in establishing reasonable statutory compensation for a chapter trustee.
the available authority on this question is quite limited.what authority there is divides sharply on the question.recognizing this fact,a national report on professional compensation in bankruptcy cases takes an agnostic approach to the question 
i t appears that a majority of courts employ the lodestar approach to trustees fee determinations.some courts,however,reject that approach as inappropriate in light of the significant difference between the functions performed by trustees and those performed by the professionals employed by trustees.in these courts especially,the results obtained in the case play a far greater role in determining reasonable compensation for trustees than they do with respect to the compensation of professionals.
am,american bankruptcy institute national report on professional compensation in bankruptcy cases warner,at.
we have found no cases in this circuit that discuss whether a common fund or other rationale may be used in setting trustee compensation under.connolly cites a case specifically endorsing a common fund or approach for trustee compensation,in re guyana development.harris trust responds with a case in which a trustee common fund argument was rebuffed,in re marvel entertainment group.
in guyana development,the bankruptcy court rejected a lodestar approach and awarded the trustee a percentage based fee analogous to a common fund recovery,measured by the maximum permitted under.the methodology employed in guyana development has been seriously criticized,however,because the court applied a sliding scale approach that essentially incorporated the maximum permitted compensation calculated on a percentage basis by statute into the calculation of a reasonable fee.see in re neill,marvel entertainment,at.for this reason,we do not find guyana development persuasive.
in marvel entertainment,by contrast,the district court rejected a trustee request for a fee.in its decision,the court gave several reasons for rejecting the request,many of which are also applicable here section serves only as a cap and does not establish the trustee entitlement to a commission or percentage of amounts disbursed from the estate there is no principled relationship between the amounts disbursed by a debtor corporation and reasonable compensation based on the trustee actual efforts there is no support in case law for a common fund approach setting reasonable compensation based on a percentage of the debtor disbursements would create a substantial risk of abuse in the selection and appointment of trustees by the unit
