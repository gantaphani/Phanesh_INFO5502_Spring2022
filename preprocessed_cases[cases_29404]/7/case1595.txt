this case is an appeal of the district court order affirming the bankruptcy court decision limiting scott greene homestead exemption in his bankruptcy petition to pursuant to p,based on the fact that greene established residency on his property and filed his homestead claim within days of filing his bankruptcy petition.we have jurisdiction pursuant to d and.
background 
the material facts of this case are not in dispute.greene purchased a parcel of undeveloped land at alamosa drive in sparks,nevada,the property in may.by august,greene had moved a trailer onto the property and was living in it.on that day,greene recorded a declaration of homestead with the washoe county recorder office for a trailer and the property.sixteen days later,on august,greene filed a chapter bankruptcy petition.greene concedes that until early august,he never lived on or made any improvements to the property.on october,rena wells wells,a creditor,filed an objection to greene claim of a homestead exemption,asserting that greene homestead was not his bona fide residence.greene voluntarily dismissed the petition on february.
on august,greene was cited by washoe county for illegally using a recreational vehicle for dwelling purposes.at that time,greene told authorities he was no longer using the trailer as a dwelling but was sleeping on the property in his tent.
on october,greene filed a chapter bankruptcy petition the petition at issue in this appeal,in which he claimed the market value of the property,the same amount as the market value he claimed for the property in his initial chapter petition in exempt pursuant to the nevada homestead statute.wells again filed an objection to the claim of exemption,challenging the validity of the homestead exemption and also contending that,even if the homestead was valid,it should be reduced to pursuant to p,because the homestead was acquired within days of the filing of the petition.
the bankruptcy court for the district of nevada concluded that greene homestead was a property interest acquired within days of his bankruptcy petition filing,because he filed his declaration of a homestead during that time period.therefore,it held,greene homestead exemption was limited to under section p.see in re greene.greene appealed.
subsequently,the trustee filed a motion for an order authorizing sale of the property free and clear of liens and encumbrances.greene filed an opposition to this motion,arguing,inter alia,that he was entitled to the appreciation in the market value of the property.the bankruptcy court rejected greene contention,finding that there was no increase in the value of the property from the time greene acquired it until the time he filed his petition,and that any increase in value after that was available to the trustee as appreciation.
greene appealed both orders of the bankruptcy court to the district court.the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court in all respects.greene filed a timely notice of appeal to this court.

interpretation of p 
under,a debtor in bankruptcy can exempt certain property from the bankruptcy proceedings and protect that property from creditors.see b.section contains a list of various interests in property that a debtor can exempt.see d.however,the bankruptcy code provides an provision whereby the state can either require the debtor to exempt property under the state law exemptions or grant the debtor the option of choosing between state exemptions and the d exemptions.see b 
in,congress amended the bankruptcy code by enacting section p,which limits a debtor ability to take advantage of the state homestead exemptions.section p provides as follows 
except as provided in paragraph of this subsection and sections and,as a result of electing under subsection b a to exempt property under state or local law,a debtor may not exempt any amount of interest that was acquired by the debtor during the period preceding the date of the filing of the petition that exceeds in the aggregate in value in 
a real or personal property that the debtor or a dependent of the debtor uses as a residence 
b a cooperative that owns property that the debtor or a dependent of the debtor uses as a residence 
c a burial plot for the debtor or a dependent of the debtor or 
d real or personal property that the debtor or dependent of the debtor claims as a homestead.
section p was part of the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of bapcpa,enacted on april,although the bulk of bapcpa became effective on october,section p became effective on the date of enactment.see,in re mcnabb.as greene petition was filed on october,section p applies to this case.
section p was intended to address the and concern by members of congress about the mansion loophole by which wealthy individuals could shield millions of dollars from creditors by filing bankruptcy after converting nonexempt assets into expensive and exempt homesteads in one of the handful of states that have unlimited homestead exemptions in re kane,at.in a report issued in,the national bankruptcy review commission identified the problem and found in deferring to state law exemptions,the current system multiplies the opportunities for forum shopping and prebankruptcy asset conversion.id.at quoting.comm n,bankruptcy the next twenty years,national bankruptcy review commission final report,at.
applying section p,the bankruptcy court the district court the cap does apply in this case,and that greene homestead exemption is limited to the cap amount.in so holding,the bankruptcy and district courts reasoned that the interest stated in section p includes the homestead,which was acquired by greene when he moved onto the property to establish his residence and filed a homestead declaration with the washoe county recorder office.greene contends,to the contrary,that establishing a residence on real property and recording a homestead declaration does not establish a property interest,but rather is a property classification.the phrase amount of interest,as used in section p,greene contends,should be construed as a quantifiable measure and therefore as applicable only to an ownership interest in a property.
the amici brief of certain bankruptcy law professors takes a slightly different analytical tack it emphasizes the use of the term acquire in the statute,and argues that the claiming of a homestead designation on an interest in property is different from the acquisition of the underlying property interest in the property.amici contend that it is only the latter legal event with which section p concerns itself.
we find these analyses helpful,and using them as well as other interpretive aids,conclude that perfection of a homestead exemption does not constitute acquisition of a property interest for purposes of section p.
a recent fifth circuit case,wallace rogers,cir,is a particularly useful starting place in determining the applicability of section p to a claimed homestead exemption.there,the debtor inherited property outside the window prior to filing a bankruptcy petition,and subsequently moved onto it within the period of time,but still before filing her bankruptcy petition.in her petition,the debtor elected to take the texas homestead exemption which had no monetary limit.a judgment creditor objected,asserting that section p applied because the debtor current residence had not been her homestead for the period preceding her bankruptcy petition.the fifth circuit disagreed and allowed the debtor to claim the full homestead exemption.
in construing the term interest as used in section p,the fifth circuit followed the analytical steps required when federal tax lien law affects state property rights.see id.citing united states craft,d.under that doctrine,a court look s initially to state law to determine what rights the taxpayer has in the property the government seeks to reach,then to federal law to determine whether the taxpayers rights qualify as property or rights to property within the compass of the federal tax lien legislation.craft,at.internal quotations omitted.the craft court reasoned 
a common idiom describes property as a bundle of sticks a collection of individual rights which,in certain combinations,constitute property.state law determines only which sticks are in a person bundle.whether those sticks qualify as property for purposes of the federal tax lien statute is a question of federal law.
in looking to state law,we must be careful to consider the substance of the rights state law provides,not merely the labels the state gives these rights or the conclusions it draws from them.such state law labels are irrelevant to the federal question of which bundles of rights constitute property that may be attached by a federal tax lien.
id.at.internal citations omitted,emphasis added.
we agree with the fifth circuit that the craft approach is the proper beginning point in addressing the problem before us.using that framework,we first look to nevada law to determine what greene acquired when he recorded his homestead declaration,and then to section p to determine whether that declaration qualifies as an any amount of interest that was acquired within the compass of section p.
the nevada homestead exemption derives from the nevada state constitution,which provides in relevant part that a homestead as provided by law,shall be the exempt from forced sale under any process of law.contrevo mercury fin.in re contrevo,emphasis in original.reading this provision broadly,the in re contrevo court held that nevada has a constitutional imperative that homestead property be exempt from legal process and placed outside the reach of creditors,and noted that nevada exemptions have historically been absolute and unqualified with a few exceptions.id.as in re contrevo indicates,the substantive right gained via a homestead declaration in nevada,although broad,is a legal protection of the property interest,not an interest in the equity or title of the property 
a second recent nevada supreme court decision reinforces this conclusion.savage pierson,explained that the homestead exemption only protects the amount of equity the debtor holds in the property listed in,so a debtor must have some form of equity in his residence in order to claim a homestead exemption in the residence.savage went on to conclude that a security deposit in a residential lease does not qualify as equity in the property under the state homestead exemption,because the statutory definition of equity contemplates more than a general interest in the property or the right to possession,it contemplates ownership.id.if the debtor has such ownership,then she can choose to protect up to of equity in her property from legal process by invoking the state homestead exemption,as long as she meets the procedural requirements to establish a homestead as defined by.when the requirements are met,a debtor has the substantive right to classify his property as exempt under the state homestead laws.see generally,kent miller,the exercise and preservation of the homestead exemption is held to be a purely personal right which can be exercised or waived by the debtor.
in nevada,then,the role of the homestead exemption is the same as that of the texas exemption analyzed in wallace the homestead exemption and the property interest impressed with that exemption are discrete concepts the former is the debtor legal right to exempt certain property interests from the bankruptcy estate,the latter is the debtor vested economic interest in the property itself.wallace,at.
we now turn to the question whether greene rights to a homestead exemption under nevada law are affected by the provisions of section p.in answering this question,we differ slightly with the fifth circuit in wallace,although our ultimate section p does not limit the homestead exemption that can be claimed under state law if the debtor owned the property before the day the same 
unlike the fifth circuit in wallace,at,we do regard the language of section p as ambiguous.as one bankruptcy court has explained 
what congress meant in p is not entirely clear in this situation.at least one court has held that the phrase in section p encompasses the acquisition of a homestead interest,in re greene,while other courts disagree,in re lyons.there is enough ambiguity to require the statute to be construed.
in re reinhard,at.
the salient terms amount,interest,and acquire are not defined in the bankruptcy code,and although they have common,definitions,those definitions are broad enough to have already generated contradictory lower court decisions on the matter.we therefore can not rely on the statutory language alone,but must also turn to sources,legal dictionaries and legislative history,to shed light on the meaning of section p.see merkel comm r,cir i f the statute is ambiguous,we consult the legislative history,to the extent that it is of value,to aid in our interpretation.internal quotations omitted.
that said,we still begin with the statutory language.see leocal ashcroft,d.first,section p employs the term interest to describe what is acquired by the debtor and can be subject to the monetary limitation.the term interest is defined in black law dictionary as a legal share in something all or part of a legal or equitable claim to or right in property.black law dictionary ed.various forms of relationships to real property are referred to as property interests,including possessory interests,leasehold interests,and ownership interests.such interests are said to run with the land that is,they accompany a conveyance or assignment of land,passing from one purchaser to another through the chain of title.see mobil oil brennan,cir.
unlike such property interests,a homestead right,generally speaking,does not run with the land.instead,a homestead is a personal right or privilege given by constitutional or statutory provisions that ordinarily is dependent on some title or interest in real property,and it does not exist as a separate estate in property independently of such title or interest.corpus juris secundum,homestead footnote omitted.nevada law,for example,defines a homestead as property consisting of various structures to be selected by the husband and wife,or either of them,or a single person claiming the homestead,thus presupposing an existing,previously acquired property right and permitting only certain individuals already holding that right to claim a homestead.thus understood,a homestead is a categorization of a status or a classification,not a property interest.see wallace,at,see also in re lyons,at the homestead is not a quantifiable interest it is a classification of property under state law.
second,the different verbs used in section p provide support for this understanding.subsection p,when stating what interest may be exempted,uses the phrase amount of interest that was acquired.emphasis added.however,when referring to the homestead in section p d,the verb used is different real or personal property that the debtor or dependent of the debtor claims as a homestead.emphasis added.the fact that congress used two different verbs to describe the process through which these two rights are gained by a debtor suggests a substantive distinction 
third,the use of the term amount to qualify interest indicates that the requisite interest must be one capable of quantification.see wallace,at in re lyons,at.further,the exception contained in section p b uses the term interest in a manner that supports the idea of a quantifiable interest.the exception states that the monetary cap will not apply to any interest transferred from a debtor previous principal r
