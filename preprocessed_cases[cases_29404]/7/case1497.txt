gary ozenne appeals from the ninth circuit bankruptcy appellate panel bap denial of his petition for a writ of mandamus.because the bap is not a court established by act of congress under the all writs act,a,we hold that the bap did not have jurisdiction to consider the petition.
several years after his bankruptcy case was closed,ozenne filed a motion for sanctions in the bankruptcy court.dkt.the bankruptcy court ruled that it lacked jurisdiction to grant relief id.and ozenne filed a petition for writ of mandamus before the bap bap dkt.relying on its previous decision in re salter,cir,the bap held that it had jurisdiction pursuant to to consider the petition,and then denied the petition.id.ozenne appealed from that denial.id.
although the question of whether the bap has jurisdiction to address a petition for a writ of mandamus has not been raised on appeal,we are bound to consider jurisdictional defects sua sponte.united states pac.transp,cir.the bap cited subsection a of the all writs act as the source of its authority to decide a writ of mandamus.subsection a states that t he supreme court and all courts established by act of congress may issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.a.
the question therefore is whether the bap is one of the courts established by act of congress.we conclude that the answer is no.
the statute authorizing the bap answers the question.the bap was not established by an act of congress rather,congress gave the judicial council of each circuit discretion to establish a bankruptcy appellate panel service.
the statute authorizing the creation of the bap states that 
t he judicial council of a circuit shall establish a bankruptcy appellate panel service composed of bankruptcy judges appointed by the judicial council to hear and determine,with the consent of all the parties,appeals from certain final judgments,orders,and decrees of bankruptcy judges unless the judicial council finds that 
a there are insufficient judicial resources available in the circuit or 
b establishment of such a service would result in undue delay or increased cost to parties in bankruptcy cases.
b.the statute does not simply mandate that the judicial council establish a bap.instead,a circuit judicial council may establish a bap based on its assessment of the judicial resources available in the circuit and whether the service would cause undue delay or increased cost to the parties.b a b.in addition,the bap continues only so long as the judicial council of the circuit wishes it to.b.the bap is,in effect,a temporary panel to be used only so long as the judicial council chooses to keep it operational.bap membership is also on a temporary basis,as it is staffed by bankruptcy judges who serve by request,in addition to their assigned role as bankruptcy judges.b judicial council of the ninth circuit,amended order continuing the bankruptcy appellate panel of the ninth circuit effective november,as amended may,pg.it has none of the permanency of a court.
pursuant to congressional authorization,the judicial council of the ninth circuit established a bap and has continued the bap service from time to time since then.see judicial council of the ninth circuit,amended order continuing the bankruptcy appellate panel of the ninth circuit.because the bap is a panel service established by the judicial council of the ninth circuit,not a court established by act of congress,it does not have writ power under the all writs act indeed,its service status is demonstrated by the authority of the judicial council of the ninth circuit to terminate the bap at any time.
the bap itself previously concluded it had mandamus power in in re salter,but it was incorrect.in re cardelucci,cir concluding that this court is not bound by a bap decision.in reaching its conclusion,the bap first considered various dictionary definitions of the word establish,such as t o set up on a secure or permanent basis to found,and to bring into existence.in re salter,at,quoting oxford english dictionary online and webster new collegiate dictionary.the bap concluded that under such definitions congress could be said to have established baps because baps did not exist until congress provided the authority for them.id.
although the definitions used by the bap do not differ meaningfully from definitions in current legal sources,see,black law dictionary ed defining establish as t o make or form to bring about or into existence,the bap application of these definitions stretches the meaning of established too far,since under its logic any tribunal whose existence is logically dependent in some way upon action by congress including any tribunal that receives any kind of federal funding or authorization could be empowered under the all writs act.the most obvious meaning of the phrase established by act of congress is that it covers those entities directly created by a congressional act,such as the united states court of appeals for veterans claims.see veterans for common sense shinseki,cir the veterans court also has authority under the all writs act to issue writs necessary or appropriate in aid of its jurisdiction.there is hereby established,under article i of the constitution of the united states,a court of record to be known as the united states court of appeals for veterans claims.the phrase may even be broad enough to include entities created by a third party at the express direction of congress.compare united states draughon,with combest bender.
however,a tribunal created by the independent actions,choices,or judgment of a third party has not been established by act of congress,even if authorization or support from congress was a logically necessary part of the tribunal creation such as a judicial council of the circuit.thus,since the bap was created by the judicial council of the ninth circuit based on its own independent decision and action,the bap was not established by act of congress even though a congressional act first suggested and authorized its creation.
the bap in in re salter also reasoned that it possessed writ power because the purpose of the all writs act was to give federal courts the power to issue writs in aid of their jurisdiction,and since congress has given the bap general appellate powers over appeals from orders and judgments of bankruptcy courts and n othing in limits the powers implied from the fact of the baps creation as an appellate tribunal,the bap powers must include the traditional power to issue writs that aid in their jurisdiction.at.this line of reasoning,however,ignores the bap limited jurisdiction.
the bap could only exercise power under the all writs act insofar as it is in aid of the bap existing jurisdiction because the all writs act does not confer an independent source of jurisdiction.a see,united states denedo,citing clinton goldsmith,t he all writs act and the extraordinary relief the statute authorizes are not a source of jurisdiction.
the bap jurisdiction is contingent upon parties consent.u.b enshrines this consent requirement,stating the bap service will hear and determine,with the consent of all the parties,appeals from final judgments,orders,and decrees.section c specifies how parties express their consent or lack thereof to the bap jurisdiction.while the default position is that appeals from the bankruptcy court proceed to the bap,section c provides both appellants and appellees the opportunity to of having the bap hear their case.c states 
subject to subsections b and d,each appeal under subsection a shall be heard by a judge panel of the bankruptcy appellate panel service established under subsection b unless 
a the appellant elects at the time of filing the appeal or 
b any other party elects,not later than days after service of notice of the appeal 
to have such appeal heard by the district court.
under the statute,appellants can choose to have the district court hear their appeal.otherwise,when appellants appeal to the bap,a notice of appeal issues and a day time period is triggered in which appellees can choose to have the district court hear the case.
petitions brought under the all writs act,however,do not require the consent of the opposing party,which would allow one party to bring unilaterally its case before the bap.petitions for writ of mandamus do not trigger a notice of appeal and election period,and appellees,as a result,never have the opportunity to elect to have the district court hear their case.
the situation in this case is instructive.here,ozenne failed to file a timely notice of appeal pursuant to rule a of the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure.ozenne failure to appeal the bankruptcy court decision meant that the election period was never triggered,and the defendant never had the opportunity to elect to have the district court hear the case.thus,the bap decision to review the petition for writ of mandamus,even though it was ultimately denied,was not in aid of its jurisdiction.
finally,the bap reasoned that since the court of criminal appeals formerly known as the court of military review was created using similar statutory language to that used in connection with the creation of the bap,and since the court of military appeals concluded that the court of criminal appeals was a court created by congress in dettinger united states,the bap should also be considered a court created by congress under the same reasoning.in re salter,at.however,the statutory language under which the court of criminal appeals was created differs significantly from the statutory language under which the bap was created the former states in relevant part that e ach judge advocate general shall establish a court of criminal appeals,a,while the latter states in relevant part that t he judicial council of a circuit shall establish a bankruptcy appellate panel service unless the judicial council finds that a there are insufficient judicial resources available in the circuit or b establishment of such service would result in undue delay or increased cost to parties in cases under title,b emphasis added.the former language allows a judge advocate general no discretion in determining whether to establish a court of criminal appeals,lending credence to the conclusion of the court of military appeals that the all writs act covers the court of criminal appeals.in contrast,a judicial council of the circuit must decide whether to establish a bankruptcy appellate panel service based on its own assessment of judicial resources and costs.this distinction makes all the difference in determining whether,under the all writs act,a tribunal was established by congress itself either directly or by mandatory delegation or instead by a third party such as the judicial council of the circuit at its own discretion.moreover,it is clear that in the former congress was creating a permanent court with permanent judges,while in the latter the panel services was temporary,as the judicial council of the circuit could terminate the panel service at any time,and the judges were not permanent but served for a limited time and served in addition to the official assignment as a bankruptcy judge.
the dissent contends that our opinion neuters the bap.the dissent ignores the bap historically subordinate role within the federal judiciary,and the constitutional issues that would arise should the bap be afforded power under the all writs act.
while congress may create certain federal tribunals pursuant to its constitutionally delegated powers in article i,its authority to do so is not plenary.pipeline constr.marathon pipe line,plurality.article iii of the constitution provides that t he judicial power of the united states shall be exercised by judges who hold their offices during good behaviour,and shall,at stated times,receive for their services,a compensation,which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office.const.art.iii.congress can not diminish the judicial branch power by granting jurisdiction to article i tribunals over cases that are within the judicial power of the united states as described in article iii,and,similarly,can not vest all essential attributes of the judicial power of the united states in an adjunct court shielded from proper review by an article iii court.pipeline,at,plurality.to allow congress to do so undermines the checks and balances built into the tripartite government,as well as the guarantee that the process of adjudication itself remain impartial,because the federal judiciary would no longer stand independent of the legislature.id.at plurality.
guided by these principles,the supreme court in northern pipeline struck down congress broad grant of authority to the bankruptcy courts under the bankruptcy reform act of.id.at plurality.the plurality reasoned that bankruptcy courts under the act unconstitutionally exercised jurisdiction over cases within the purview of article iii courts,and were not subject to sufficient scrutiny by article iii courts.id.at plurality.a full majority of the court,although failing to agree on the scope of the public rights exception that allows congress to assign a narrow category of cases to article i legislative courts,concluded that the act vested all essential attributes of the judicial power in the bankruptcy courts,and the courts were therefore not constitutionally acceptable adjuncts.id.at,plurality see id.at rehnquist,concurring.
in in re burley,decided a few months after the supreme court decision in northern pipeline,our court addressed the bap constitutionality in light of northern pipeline,cir.our court concluded that the bap,unlike the bankruptcy courts under the act,was constitutional.id.at.in reaching that conclusion,our court emphasized that the article iii court of appeals retained the essential attributes of the judicial power.id.at.our court retains that power because we can effectively review the bap decisions de novo,have the authority to render final decisions,and exercise control over the bap in that the bap can be established only by order of the circuit council.id.
after the decision in in re burley,congress passed two more acts affecting the establishment of baps.in congress passed the bankruptcy amendments and federal judgment act of.a,stat,followed by an amendment to the bankruptcy appeals statute in.
while enabling the increased use of baps among the circuits,still limits the bap role within the federal judiciary.jonathan remy nash rafael pardo,an empirical investigation into appellate structure and the perceived quality of appellate review,vand.primarily,the amendments did not erase each circuit discretion in establishing a bap.b.moreover,the bap does not have authority to hear bankruptcy appeals unless the district judges for the district in which the appeal occur s,by majority vote,have authorized the bap to hear and determine appeals originating in such district.b.
the bap also does not retain its own permanent set of judges.instead,the bap is staffed by a rotating set of bankruptcy judges who are appointed at the behest of the judges of the court of appeals of the united states for the circuit in which the bankruptcy court is located,and removed at the behest of the judicial council of the circuit.a,e judicial council of the ninth circuit,amended order continuing the bankruptcy appellate panel of the ninth circuit.the rotating set of judges has narrow jurisdiction to hear appeals from the bankruptcy court.again,the bap only has jurisdiction to hear and determine,with the consent of all the parties,appeals from final judgments,orders,and decrees from the bankruptcy court.b.
the bap limited jurisdiction is identified by congress treatment of the bap as a panel service.b the judicial council of a circuit shall establish a bankruptcy appellate panel service emphasis added.while the dissent would have this court deviate from the statute plain language and grant the bap powers as though congress had established the bap as something other than a panel service,there is no reason to do so.had congress intended for the bap to exercise authority beyond its prescribed role as a panel service,it would have provided for it in the bap authorizing statute.compare b with there is a court of record known as the united states court of appeals for the armed forces.the court is established under article i of the constitution,and there is hereby established,under article i of the constitution of the united states,a court of record to be known as the united states court of appeals for veterans claims,and the president shall appoint sixteen judges who shall constitute a court of record known as the united states court of federal claims.the court is declared to be a court established under article i of the constitution of the united states.
our court,recognizing the bap narrow jurisdiction,has even concluded that the bap decisions are not binding.in re silverman,cir w e treat the bap decisions as persuasive authority given its special expertise in bankruptcy issues emphasis added in re cardelucci,at t his court is not bound by a bap decision bank of maui estate analysis,f d,cir i t must be conceded that bap decisions can not bind the district courts themselves.as article iii courts,the district courts must always be free to decline to follow bap decisions and to formulate their own rules within their jurisdiction.
the bap subordinate role within the federal judiciary is pertinent to our decision.supreme court and our court precedents emphasize that the bap derives its legitimacy from the overview exercised by article iii courts,as well as the bap inability to infringe upon the essential attributes of judicial power.pipeline,at in re burley,at.even though the barriers to article iii review the bap would create by having authority under the all writs act seem innocuous at first blush,they nevertheless chip away at the authority of the judicial branch.stern marshall,see also,quoting reid covert,plurality opinion a statute may no more lawfully chip away at the authority of the judicial branch than it may eliminate it entirely.slight encroachments create new boundaries from which legions of power can seek new territory to capture.first,allowing the bap to entertain writs of mandamus would circumvent the consent requirement in c,effectively preventing a party from seeking review of the dispute by an article iii district judge as allowed by statute.second,such authority would frustrate our court appellate review by putting in place an extra procedural hurdle that respondents would have to surmount in order to receive review.see fed.ninth circuit advisory committee note.
the dissent nevertheless contends that the constitutional issue raised by our decision is congress unconstitutional delegation of authority to the judicial branch.the dissent argues that by allowing the judicial council of the ninth circuit established the bap,congress has impermissibly delegated its authority to the courts.first,congress did not delegate bap establishment to the courts it was delegated to an administrative authority,the judicial council of the circuits.the dissent repeatedly misses this important distinction.it argues congress gave the power to create the bap to the court.but this argument is irrelevant.clearly,this was an administrative responsibility given to an administrative part of our system the judicial council of the circuits.second,because it is a temporary entity existing at the option of the judicial council of the circuit,it does not have the same function or power of a court thus its name as a panel created or disbanded by the judicial council of the circuit.
the supreme court,in addressing concerns in cases involving the judicial branch,has explained that there are two dangers first,that the judicial branch neither be assigned nor allowed tasks that are more properly accomplished by other branches,and second,that no provision of law impermissibly threatens the institutional integrity of the judicial branch.mistretta united states,internal quotations and citations omitted.our decision does not raise either concern.congress has not simply delegated all authority to the judicial councils of each circuit.rather,congress has allowed judicial councils to take stock of the needs within their circuit,and,based on those conclusions,to establish a panel service that is limited in both the subject matter it can adjudicate and its authority to render final decisions.the authorization continues only so long as the judicial council of the circuit on its own decides.b.the supreme court has never held,nor has our court,that congress can not authorize the judicial councils in each circuit to establish a temporary panel service to adjudicate specific,public rights,such as bankruptcy claims.see stern.at defining public rights.
we therefore overrule in re salter and hold that the bap is not a court established by act of congress under subsection a of the all writs act,so it does not have jurisdiction to entertain a mandamus petition.our decision does not leave parties without recourse to mandamus relief from decisions by a bankruptcy judge,since subsection a of the all writs act applies to federal district courts.sec.exch.comm george,cir holding that the district court had the authority to consider petitioner request for relief under the all writs act,and observing that a district court powers under should be broadly construed internal quotation marks omitted.

vacated and remanded.
the all writs act provides that t he supreme court and all courts established by act of congress may issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.a.the majority holds that the bankruptcy appellate panel may not issue writs of mandamus because it is not a court established by act of congress.op.at.oh,the majority is willing,i think,albeit begrudgingly,to admit that the bap is a court it just does believe that it was established directly by act of congress.that last sentence was,of course,a bit of a cheat on my part the statute does actually say that the court must be established directly by congress.but the majority does.op.at.it has added a word to the all writs act that is not there.and,for the reasons i will explain,it is so unnecessary to do so,and it is going to cause us major constitutional headaches.
i just ca go there.i concur in the judgment only,and respectfully dissent otherwise.
i am going to start with an observation even among,this case is a nothing.we are dealing with the denial of a writ of mandamus filed by a party with a penchant for repeat and likely frivolous bankruptcy filings and there are several ways we could and should have disposed of this case.here is what happened.
procedural history 
the crux of ozenne grievance is that his home was sold out from under him in violation of the bankruptcy stay provisions.accordingly,several years after his bankruptcy case had been closed out,he sought to reopen it to seek damages for alleged violations of the automatic stay,made in connection with the sale of his home.in,ozenne filed a motion in the bankruptcy court seeking to set aside the bankruptcy court earlier ruling,which held that under,ozenne could not reopen his case.ozenne reason for reopening the bankruptcy case was his reason for all the numerous motions he has filed to seek damages under,which allows for damages for violation of a bankruptcy stay.the bankruptcy court denied the motion for lack of jurisdiction,on account of ozenne bankruptcy case having been closed for several years at that point.ozenne appealed that decision to the federal district court,which held that t he bankruptcy court was correct to reject ozenne motion,because it was untimely under rule.ozenne then filed a direct appeal to this court,and a panel summarily affirmed.
at that point ozenne filed a motion for sanctions for violations of usc a in the bankruptcy court.in that motion,ozenne argued that a recent decision in the circuit court of appeals has ruled that bankruptcy courts retain jurisdiction to hear violations of usc,even after the underlying bankruptcy case has been dismissed.in other words,the motion sought the same thing ozenne has been seeking for years to reopen his case to determine whether his home was sold in violation of the automatic stay and to collect damages for it.the bankruptcy court held it had no jurisdiction to grant relief.ozenne never filed a notice of appeal.again,another judgment became final.
ozenne then filed a petition for a writ of mandamus with the bap.that petition sought an order from the bap,requiring the bankruptcy court to exercise jurisdiction and hold a trial or hearing for the violations of law under usc.the bap docket shows that the petition received no response from the appellees,and the bap denied it and closed the case out in a matter of eighteen days.in its decision,the bap noted its authority to entertain writs under the all writs act,recited the standard for receiving such relief,but summarily held that ozenne has not met the burden to establish that a writ of mandamus should be issued.ozenne is now before us on a timely filed pro se appeal from that decision.
b.how the majority should have handled this 
first,although not entirely free from doubt given ozenne pro se briefing,this case is likely res judicata.ozenne has been doing the same thing for years.he admits it.his own briefing notes that the bankruptcy court consistently ruled,in,and,that it lacked jurisdiction to reopen ozenne case and grant him relief.i see no substantive difference between what ozenne asked the bankruptcy court to do in his motion and what he asked it again in his motion.his motion ended with a final judgment from this court affirming the district court determination that ozenne could not seek the relief he sought which happens to be the exact relief he sought in his motion in the bankruptcy court and his subsequent mandamus petition before the bap.assuming that ozenne description is correct,he missed the time to file a notice of appeal on the bankruptcy court denial of his motion.so that determination became final.indeed,the number of final judgments telling ozenne no is hard to count his claims strike me as being barred by res judicata.
second,we might also reach the merits and simply affirm because ozenne has not even come close to showing that he is entitled to a writ of mandamus.he cites a single bap case,in re johnson,and that it.ozenne has not shown that his right to the issuance of the writ is clear and indisputable.degeorge dist.court for cent.dist.of,cir internal quotation marks omitted noting that in granting or denying a writ,courts consider whether the petitioner has no other adequate means,such as a direct appeal,to attain the relief he or she desires,will be damaged or prejudiced in a way not correctable on appeal,the district court order is clearly erroneous as a matter of law,the district court order is an error,or manifests a persistent disregard of the federal rules,and the district court order raises new and important problems,or issues of law of first impression.this is an equally plausible grounds to affirm.
finally,as the majority opinion suggests,the bap may have lacked jurisdiction.op.at.the bap appellate jurisdiction is predicated on the consent of the parties before it.see.and the issuance of a writ under the all writs act requires jurisdiction.see granting power courts to issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aide of their respective jurisdictions emphasis added.but at worst,the facts here suggest that we dismiss this case only because we lack evidence of the appellees consent,and therefore the bap did not have jurisdiction to consider this particular writ,not all writs in general.so under that view,we just dismiss the appeal and all go home.
i would resolve this case on any one of the above bases,and thus i concur in the judgment only,insofar as that judgment is that ozenne loses his case.but instead of stopping with the most obvious answers to a most obviously meaningless case,the majority forges ahead,without even calling for briefing,and grinds an axe with which to cut the bap off at the knees.the majority opinion is needless,wrong,and raises serious constitutional concerns with the separation of powers.
the majority labors mightily to avoid making a concession that,if you read carefully,it still winds up making the bap is a court.and really,what else can the majority do the bap is composed of bankruptcy judges,b,serving on a judge panel,id.c.the panel hear s and determine s appeals from final judgments,orders,and decrees of bankruptcy courts.id.a,b.and if not appealed to us,the bap decisions are final and have preclusive effect.in re scovis,cir the bap renders a final order when it affirms or reverses a bankruptcy court final order.the majority strains credulity when it says that the bap does not have the same function or power of a court.op.at.of course it does.in its appellate function,the bankruptcy appellate panel fill s the role of the federal district courts.bank germain,see also a providing for appellate jurisdiction of federal district courts over bankruptcy decisions as an alternative to the bap wellness intern.network sharif,congress has supplemented the capacity of district courts through the able assistance of bankruptcy judges.northern pipeline constr.marathon pipe line,plurality opinion.
the majority scrupulously avoids addressing any of these realities.instead,like uttering bibbidi bobbidi boo to turn pumpkins into carriages,the majority believes that its own incantation panel service and tribunal will transform the bap into something other than a court.i readily concede that calls the bap a panel service.but if the majority believes the bap is not a court,it never says so.indeed,if the majority really thought the bap was not a court at all,it could have written a much shorter opinion,because under the all writs act only courts may issue all writs necessary or appropriate.a emphasis added.had the majority simply declared the bap not a court,it could have saved itself the gymnastics over the word establish in.
i am skeptical that the absence of the magic word court is significant here.like the tax court another article i court the bap function and role in the federal judicial scheme closely resemble those of the federal district courts,which indisputably are courts of law.freytag comm r.the power the bap wields under is not that exercised by some mere tribunal or administrative adjunct,like a special master or an arbitrator.the bap is an alternative to federal district courts for parties appealing from the bankruptcy courts.b,c see also wellness.at.bank,at.by statute,appeals heard by the bap shall be taken in the same manner as appeals in civil proceedings generally are taken to the courts of appeals.c.our own appellate jurisdiction is the same whether the appeal originates in the bankruptcy court,the district court,or the bankruptcy appellate panel.d a.in all respects,the bap is treated by the statutes as equal in authority to the district court and greater in authority to the bankruptcy court.see,id.d b,d,title xii,b a,a,stat,cited in note.the one noticeable difference between these courts jurisdiction is that the consent of the parties is required to establish bap jurisdiction.but the majority can not,by its repeated references to the consent aspect of bap jurisdiction,seriously mean that the bankruptcy courts,for example,cease to be courts when their article iii jurisdiction to adjudicate proceedings hinges on the consent of the parties.see wellness.at roell withrow,noting the civil jurisdiction of the united states magistrate judges to dispose of cases and enter final judgment.is the majority suggesting,sub silentio,that the bankruptcy courts are unconstitutional 
the majority similarly can not dodge the fact that the bap is a court by telling us that it has none of the permanency of a court.op.at.permanency as an attribute inherent to a court is beyond me,in part because i do not know what the majority means by permanency.does it mean populated by life tenured judges if so,then article i courts are not courts.does it mean constitutionally permanent if so,then only the supreme court is a court,see const.art.iii,we do even count because we are good only so long as congress says so,see establishing the jurisdiction of the courts of appeals.the thing is,permanency is relative and tells us little to nothing about whether a body is properly a court.the temporary emergency court of appeals was not permanent and was not meant to be.see economic stabilization act amendments of,stat.creating the temporary emergency court of appeals,to be populated by district and circuit judges appointed at will by the chief justice act of october,stat.abolishing the temporary emergency court of appeals.but it was a court nevertheless.the same can be said of the original emergency court of appeals established during world war ii,see emergency price control act,stat,and district courts which literally last for only the duration of a lawsuit,and state courts with judges sitting pro tem,see,cal.const.const.a.stat.ann.
the point is,what you call an adjudicative body and how long it exists are much less indicative of whether that body is a court than what the body actually does and the powers it possesses.by the latter standard,the bap is a court.
the all writs act provides that courts established by act of congress may issue appropriate writs,such as a writ of mandamus.a.when congress provided for bankruptcy appellate panels,it provided that t he judicial council of a circuit shall establish a bankruptcy appellate panel service unless the judicial council finds that the circuit has insufficient judicial resources or the service would result in undue delay or increase the cost of appeal to parties.id.b.the majority concludes that because of the unless clause,congress did not establish the bap and,accordingly,the bap is not a court established by act of congress,but a tribunal created by the independent actions,choices,or judgment of a third party.op.at.
the text of and the all writs act should be sufficient to decide this issue.the bap is plainly a court established by an act of congress.section authorizes us,through our judicial council,to populate the bap.the flexibility congress gave us not to populate the bap if our peculiar circumstances dictate otherwise does not affect the fact that the court we appoint draws its existence from congressional authorization and direction.our choice to effect or not to effect the panel authorized by congress does not change the fact that the court was created by act of congress.and that is all that the all writs act demands.the bap is a court created by an act of congress and may,in cases where it otherwise has jurisdiction,issue writs under the all writs act.see in re salter,cir.
the majority,because of a vague concern that the definition of established would open up the writ power to any tribunal that receives any kind of federal funding or authorization,op.at,proceeds to graft a new qualifier onto the all writs act that the court be directly established by act of congress,id.at.i do not see that word anywhere in the all writs act,and would accordingly decline to write it into the statute.moreover,the majority concern is unfounded.the all writs act is not an independent grant of appellate jurisdiction,charles alan wright et,federal practice procedure,at ed,but is instead auxiliary in nature in aiding courts to exercise their jurisdiction.marbury madison,cranch,see also in re previn,cir.that means that the jurisdiction of any court must be established and before it can issue an extraordinary writ.this,along with the fact that only courts can use the all writs act,see a,diminishes any concern the majority may be harboring about nameless federal tribunals using the writ power.
finally,the majority says its decision does not leave parties without recourse to mandamus relief from decisions by a bankruptcy judge,since subsection a of the all writs act applies to federal district courts.op.at.this is hollow consolation indeed.today ruling neuters the bap.section allows the parties to choose to have an appeal heard in front of the bap.see b,c,d.but buyer beware.the supreme court can issue writs under the all writs act,a,and so can we,see cal.energy comm johnson,f d,cir,as can the district courts,sec george,cir,as can the bankruptcy courts themselves,bank of panther mountain land,llc in re panther mountain land,llc,cir alderwoods group,garcia,cir in re johns manville,cir.but for reasons never fully explained by the majority,congress purportedly left the bap out in the cold.every other court that can adjudicate the parties claims in a bankruptcy case,except the bap,can issue a writ in furtherance of its jurisdiction to issue stays,injunctions,and orders enforcing its own judgments.under the majority view,congress has established,in justice scalia memorable phrase,a sort of court,vested with some,but not all,of the ordinary powers of a court.united states mistretta,scalia,dissenting.i doubt the majority is correct.
the majority opinion begs an answer to the following question if the bap is not a court established by act of congress,op.at emphasis added,then who,precisely,established this court 
if we accept the majority analysis,the bap was established by the judicial council of the ninth circuit.op.at.this presents us with a second,far more troubling question can congress delegate its power to create courts to the judicial branch the majority says that the answer is yes,and sees no problem.see op.at congress gave the judicial council of each circuit discretion to establish a bankruptcy appellate panel service.id.at concluding that the bap was created by the judicial council of the ninth circuit through an authoriz ation from congress.i am deeply skeptical of the constitutionality of such an arrangement between congress and the judiciary.
first,we have no independent power under article iii to create inferior courts.we are vested only with the judicial power of the united states,const.art.iii,and the judicial power of the united states does not encompass the power to create other courts.it is the power to adjudicate certain cases and controversies that arise between adverse parties,with such exceptions,and under such regulations as the congress shall make.id.art.iii,cls,see also muskrat united states,judicial power,is the power of a court to decide and pronounce a judgment and carry it into effect between persons and parties who bring a case before it for decision.internal quotation marks omitted durousseau united states,cranch,the appellate powers of the court are given by the constitution.but they are limited and regulated by the judicial act,and by such other acts as have been passed on the subject.by contrast,articles i and iii expressly grant the power to establish courts to congress.const.art.i,cl.the congress shall have power to constitute tribunals inferior to the supreme court.id.art.iii,the judicial power of the united states,shall be vested in one supreme court,and in such inferior courts as the congress may from time to time ordain and establish.the distinction between,and classification of,article iii and article i courts also denominated constitutional and legislative courts has been productive of much confusion and controversy.glidden zdanok,plurality opinion.but whatever the constitutional disconnect between those two systems of courts,we have no power to establish a bankruptcy court 
in response,the majority criticizes my premise.it concludes that congress did not delegate bap establishment to the courts it was delegated to an administrative authority,the judicial council of the circuits.op.at.in terms,this is not an important distinction,it is a distinction without a difference.the supreme court has made abundantly clear that its separation of powers approach does not differ as applied to nonadjudicatory activities that congress has vested either in federal courts or in auxiliary bodies within the judicial branch.mistretta,at emphasis added.if the majority wants to argue that the judicial council is not located in the judicial branch,it is paddling upstream.
