background 
a.the sale of the debbie reynolds hotel and casino 
in february,debtor proposed a liquidating plan of reorganization that provided for the sale of substantially all of its assets to central florida investments cfi for.rfi supported the sale,but a committee of debtor unsecured creditors opposed it.rather than approve the sale as negotiated,the bankruptcy court agreed to permit interested parties to appear at a hearing to bid to purchase debtor property for a sum in excess of the price negotiated with cfi.
at the close of bidding,the court awarded cfi the right to purchase the property for.the order accepting cfi bid also gave cfi the right to withdraw from the transaction without penalty by may.after completing its due diligence,cfi exercised this right and terminated the transaction.the right to purchase the hotel then fell to appellee calstar for.
calstar agreed to loan debtor to keep the hotel open while calstar completed its due diligence prior to closing the sale.this postpetition financing was approved by the bankruptcy court on a superpriority basis under c.calstar superpriority loan did not alter the rights of secured creditors,but it gave calstar the right to repayment ahead of all administrative and unsecured claims calstar subsequently decided not to purchase the hotel.it withdrew from the transaction without penalty.
finding itself without any prospective purchasers of the hotel,the bankruptcy court entered an order permitting the sale of debtor assets through public auction.in august,the hotel and all related personal property were sold through public auction for.
b.the settlement agreement between debtor and rfi 
after the sale of the hotel,but before final approval by the bankruptcy court,debtor counsel sought a payment out of rfi secured collateral under the authority of c.section c provides that the trustee may recover from property securing an allowed secured claim the reasonable,necessary costs and expenses of preserving,or disposing of,such property to the extent of any benefit to the holder of such claim.the payment of these reasonable and necessary expenses out of the secured property of a creditor is known as a surcharge.
rfi did not concede that debtor counsel had provided any measurable benefit to its secured collateral.nevertheless,it entered into an agreement allowing debtor counsel to collect a surcharge from its secured property.the surcharge agreement also provided that rfi secured and unsecured claims shall be irrevocably allowed and no debtor,administrative claimant or party in interest may seek to surcharge any of rfi collateral pursuant to c.in effect,rfi attempted to buy closure by agreeing to a surcharge in exchange for assurance that there would be no further challenges to collection of its secured debt.
calstar objected to the settlement agreement on two grounds.first,calstar itself sought to surcharge rfi secured property as repayment for the benefit provided by calstar loan to debtor in may.calstar argued that the immunizing language of the settlement agreement improperly foreclosed calstar right to seek a surcharge under c.in addition,calstar argued that because its loan to debtor was made pursuant to c,it should collect ahead of debtor counsel.therefore,the surcharge agreement between rfi and debtor,whereby debtor counsel would collect the payment,violated calstar rights as a superpriority creditor.
the bankruptcy court approved the agreement in its entirety.the bap,reversing the bankruptcy court,held that the lower court abused its discretion when it approved the immunizing language of the settlement agreement without first determining whether rfi benefitted from the actions of other claimants.in addition,the bap held that the bankruptcy court erred in permitting the distribution of the surcharge directly to debtor attorneys rather than to the estate.this distribution enabled debtor attorneys to get paid on a mere administrative claim ahead of calstar,the holder of a superpriority claim under c.
both rfi and debtor appealed from the bap reversal of the bankruptcy court approval of the settlement agreement.
standard of review 
this court reviews the bankruptcy court approval of a proposed compromise for an abuse of discretion.burton ulrich in re schmitt.however,both the bankruptcy court and the bap interpretation of the bankruptcy code is reviewed de novo.in re celebrity home entertainment,cir in re los angeles int l airport hotel,cir.to the extent that the bankruptcy court approval of the settlement agreement rested on an erroneous interpretation of law,it was,per se,an abuse of discretion.koon united states,d a district court by definition abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law.
the bankruptcy court concluded that rfi could not,as a matter of law,be surcharged under c.it approved the settlement agreement on this basis.the bap reached the opposite conclusion.whether section c permits calstar to surcharge rfi is a question of law subject to de novo review.
discussion 
this case presents two distinct questions arising under section c of the bankruptcy code first,we must determine whether calstar has standing to object to the secured creditor settlement agreement with the.the agreement foreclosed calstar from seeking to surcharge the secured collateral of rfi.following hartford underwriters,we hold that calstar had no standing to seek a surcharge pursuant to c.therefore,calstar can not object to the agreement which prevented it from bringing a surcharge action.we reverse the bap decision holding otherwise.
in addition,we must determine how the in proceeds from the c surcharge should be distributed.we hold that under c,the party that has rendered a benefit to a secured creditor is properly reimbursed for that benefit from secured collateral.we reverse the bap on this issue as well and hold that debtor counsel is entitled to the surcharge consistent with the terms of the settlement agreement.
immunizing language of the settlement agreement 
under hartford underwriters,calstar lacks standing to object to the settlement agreement.
the only objection to enforcement of the settlement the point on which the bankruptcy court and the bap whether the immunizing provision of the agreement improperly abrogated calstar right to seek a surcharge from rfi pursuant to c.hartford underwriters makes clear that calstar can not,under any circumstances,seek such a surcharge because calstar,as a superpriority claimant,has no standing to do so.under hartford underwriters,therefore,the immunizing language of the settlement agreement had no legal effect.since calstar objection to the agreement was based on this language,that objection can not succeed.
