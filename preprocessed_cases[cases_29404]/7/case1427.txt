richard schwartz appeals a bankruptcy appellate panel decision affirming orders of the bankruptcy court directing him to pay attorney fees of and an additional punitive monetary sanction of.we reduce the fee award to.we reverse the monetary sanction.the record contains no support for an imposition so large.the remaining fee award is entirely sufficient to compensate the injured party and deter future misconduct.
the fee award and monetary sanction stem from the filing of an involuntary bankruptcy petition against james kujawa in december.before the petition was filed,kujawa and his construction company were involved in business relationships with schwartz,the appellant in this case and former counsel to kujawa,and paul ebeling.the souring of these relationships and the protracted litigation over the bankruptcy petition resulted eleven years later in the award of attorneys fees and a monetary sanction that are now before us for review.
in,kujawa was hired by paul ebeling to do construction work on the building where schwartz shared office space with ebeling.ebeling owned interests in and managed two companies,billboard café and tridon,which were housed in this same office building.schwartz was legal counsel to these companies and had a financial interest in them.during the time he worked on the building,kujawa retained schwartz as counsel in several matters.in the course of this representation,schwartz gained financial information about kujawa and counseled him on the advisability of filing bankruptcy.
in,disputes arose among the three men.in may,kujawa stopped work on the construction projects.in september,schwartz withdrew as counsel to kujawa.on december,an involuntary bankruptcy petition was filed against kujawa.five creditors filed the bankruptcy petition,alleging due and undisputed debts arising from kujawa construction business.the petition was signed by sidney gould,an attorney who had an office in the same building as schwartz and ebeling.schwartz was not an initial party to the bankruptcy,and his exact role in the filing is disputed by the parties.it appears,however,that schwartz helped to identify creditors,provided some details about kujawa financial dealings,and may have assisted,either personally or through his legal associate,parrot,in preparing the petition.
in answering the petition,kujawa alleged that the bankruptcy filing was in bad faith and that his former attorney,schwartz,and ebeling had organized the creditors to file.kujawa stated that the petition allegations that his wife and daughter were conspiring with him to hide assets were made to embarrass him,and that the bankruptcy sole purpose was to discredit his business.
a flurry of motions by kujawa and his creditors followed.in january,kujawa filed a mechanic lien in a state court against tridon and billboard café to recover money allegedly owed to him from construction work for ebeling.in february,schwartz filed a motion as counsel for tridon and billboard café to intervene as creditors in the bankruptcy.finding these claims subject to numerous factual disputes,the bankruptcy court denied intervention.in re kujawa.at that time,the court granted kujawa motion to disqualify schwartz as counsel in the involuntary bankruptcy,finding that schwartz had gained information from his representation of kujawa that was substantially related to the adverse claims asserted on behalf of tridon and billboard.id.at.the court did permit schwartz to participate in the bankruptcy to pursue his own claim against kujawa for unpaid legal fees.schwartz appealed these decisions,which the district court affirmed in.in re kujawa,slip op.at,july.
the involuntary petition was litigated only intermittently after this,and the case sat totally idle for over three years from to.in this intervening period,the supreme court of missouri undertook an investigation of the propriety of schwartz conduct,at least partially in response to a complaint filed by kujawa and his counsel.on june,the court appointed master,supreme court of missouri senior judge charles blackmar,issued his report on schwartz conduct.judge blackmar found that schwartz had violated the missouri rules of professional conduct by revealing information about kujawa wife and daughter that he had gained in the course of representing kujawa.he also determined that schwartz behaved improperly in assisting in the drafting of the involuntary petition.he recommended that schwartz be reprimanded,stating that he found harsher discipline unnecessary because schwartz had practiced since without further misconduct.the missouri supreme court adopted this recommendation and formally reprimanded schwartz.
in,the bankruptcy court dismissed the petition pursuant to a,a provision authorizing bankruptcy courts to abstain from jurisdiction when so doing better serves the interests of creditors and the debtor.the court noted that although the creditors had met the statutory requirements for an involuntary bankruptcy,this case was primarily a squabble between richard schwartz and his former client james kujawa and could be resolved more appropriately in a state court.in re kujawa,slip op.at.the court retained limited jurisdiction to resolve the issue of costs,attorneys fees,actual and punitive damages,and sanctions.schwartz and the petitioning creditors appealed this decision to the district court,which affirmed the abstention.in so doing,the district court stated that it was shocked by the conduct of schwartz and remanded to the bankruptcy court for a determination as to an appropriate award of sanctions.in re kujawa.
on june,the bankruptcy court held a hearing on fees,damages,and sanctions and ordered schwartz to pay kujawa in attorneys fees.at that time,the court also directed schwartz to provide additional financial information to be used in shaping a monetary sanction.schwartz had previously filed a financial statement with the court,but this information was only partially complete.schwartz responded by arguing that because he had not pleaded inability to pay as an affirmative defense,the court could not require him to submit financial information.on august,the bankruptcy court withdrew its order for additional financial information and ordered schwartz to pay a monetary sanction of.on december,the bankruptcy appellate panel for the eighth circuit affirmed both the award of fees and the monetary sanction.in re kujawa.
we review decisions to impose attorneys fees and monetary sanctions under the standard.cooter gell hartmarx,d grunewaldt mut.life ins.in re coones ranch,cir the bankruptcy court recited three bases for its authority to award kujawa attorneys fees federal rule of bankruptcy procedure,and its inherent authority.in ordering the monetary sanction,the bankruptcy court relied solely on rule similar to federal rule of civil procedure.on review,the bankruptcy appellate panel held that rule and inherent authority were alternative,and equally suitable,bases for both the fee award and the monetary sanction.regardless of whether the legal authority for imposing these sanctions is rule or inherent authority,we believe abuse of discretion is the correct standard.in re clark,cir applying standard to review sanctions awarded under rule,section a,and court inherent authority blue of army,cir,cert.denied,d,finding review proper where sanctions imposed pursuant to four theories.
schwartz urges this court to find that almost every element of the fee award was excessive and should not have been allowed.we have carefully reviewed the fee report of kujawa attorneys and each of schwartz arguments.as a general matter,we agree with the bankruptcy court that attorneys fees were an appropriate sanction in this case,and that most of the fees awarded were properly allowed as being the direct result of schwartz unethical behavior.however,our review did reveal three instances of work for which it is unreasonable to order schwartz to pay.
first,we find that it was an abuse of discretion to award fees billed by counsel for time spent speaking with the press.kujawa counsel charged in fees for four hours of conversations with the louis.apparently,these interviews were
