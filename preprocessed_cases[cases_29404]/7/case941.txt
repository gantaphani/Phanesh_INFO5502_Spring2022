in july of,american homepatient,american filed for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code.despite objections by a group of secured lenders to american proposed plan of reorganization,the bankruptcy court imposed the plan on the lenders pursuant to the bankruptcy code cramdown provisions set forth in b.the bankruptcy court further concluded that the appropriate cramdown interest rate for the lenders was,and it fixed their collateral value at million.
displeased with these rulings,the lenders appealed the order of confirmation to the district court.american responded by filing a motion to dismiss the lenders appeal on the grounds of equitable mootness.the district court denied american motion,but then concluded on the merits that the bankruptcy court had properly determined both the cramdown interest rate and the collateral value.both parties appealed.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
american is a company based in brentwood,tennessee.it specializes in providing home healthcare services and products and has more than affiliates and subsidiaries in states.over the course of its operations,american borrowed a significant amount of money.most of this debt was incurred between and,when american invested in dozens of new branch offices.the lenders in this case are entities that loaned money to american during this time frame.although the parties disagree as to the exact total owed to the lenders,both sides acknowledge that the principal balance is in the range of to million.
following american voluntary filing for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code in july of,the company and its affiliates filed a joint plan of reorganization.american filed a second amended joint plan of reorganization in january of.this amended plan was approved by all but the lenders in the present case.american then sought to have the plan confirmed pursuant to the bankruptcy code cramdown provisions set forth in b,which allow a reorganization plan to go into effect notwithstanding the fact that it has not been accepted by all of the impaired classes.
the bankruptcy court held a hearing on the lenders claims.during this hearing,the court heard from various witnesses who testified as to the appropriate cramdown interest rate to be applied to the lenders allowed secured claim.the bankruptcy court was ultimately persuaded by the testimony of american expert witness david rosen,who opined that the appropriate cramdown interest rate was,which was equal to the interest rate on a treasury note plus.it determined that the lenders proposed interest rate of was inappropriate because it would result in a windfall to the lenders.
the bankruptcy court also heard testimony regarding the lenders collateral value in order to determine the amount of the lenders allowed secured claim.patrick hurst,another of american expert witnesses,testified that the value of this collateral was between and million.the lenders expert witness,gerald benjamin,opined that the correct valuation was between and million.after weighing this conflicting evidence,the bankruptcy court found that hurst testimony was significantly more credible.it then fixed the lenders collateral value,and thus their allowed secured claim,at million.
on may,the bankruptcy court overruled the lenders objections and directed american to submit a proposed order confirming the amended reorganization plan.this confirmation order was entered by the bankruptcy court on may.the lenders subsequently appealed to the district court and petitioned first the bankruptcy court and then the district court for a stay of the confirmation order.this request was denied by both courts,and the lenders did not seek a stay from this court.as a result,the amended reorganization plan became effective on july.
on august,american filed a motion to dismiss the lenders appeal before the district court on the basis of equitable mootness.the district court denied the motion,but affirmed the bankruptcy court decision to confirm the plan on the merits.this appeal by the lenders and by american followed.

in appeals from the decision of a district court on appeal from the bankruptcy court,the court of appeals independently reviews the bankruptcy court decision,applying the clearly erroneous standard to findings of fact and de novo review to conclusions of law.zirnhelt madaj in re madaj,cir citations and quotation marks omitted.furthermore,when a question in the bankruptcy context involves a mixed question of law and fact,we must break it down into its constituent parts and apply the appropriate standard of review for each part.wesbanco bank barnesville rafoth in re baker getty fin,cir citation and quotation marks omitted.
american motion to dismiss on equitable mootness grounds 
american argues in its that the lenders are equitably estopped from pursuing this appeal.in bankruptcy proceedings,a case that is equitably moot is not technically moot,but rather equitable mootness occurs where the plan of reorganization is substantially consummated,and where it is no longer prudent to upset the plan of reorganization.guardian sav.loan ass arbors of houston assocs.in re arbors of houston assocs,wl,at cir,unpublished citation omitted.
this court has yet to delineate with clarity the appropriate standard for addressing claims of equitable mootness.generally,w hen determining the mootness of an appeal of a bankruptcy reorganization order,this court inquires as to whether the plan has been substantially consummated at the time of the appeal,and,if so,whether piecemeal modification of the bankruptcy reorganization plan is possible or desirable.unofficial comm.of,in re eagle picher,wl,at cir,unpublished citation and quotation marks omitted.this court in city of covington covington landing.partnership,cir,on the other hand,cited with approval two other formulations of the governing standard.one is employed by the seventh circuit,in which the reviewing court asks whether it is prudent to upset the plan of reorganization at this late date,id.quoting in re unr,cir,and the other is utilized by the fifth circuit,in which the court examines whether a stay has been obtained whether the plan has been substantially consummated and whether the relief requested would affect either the rights of parties not before the court or the success of the plan.id.citing manges bank in re manges,cir.the court in city of covington,however,concluded that the record before it was inadequate to support equitable estoppel,at,so it did not explicitly adopt a formula for this equitable doctrine.arbors of houston assocs,wl at.
we are now squarely faced with the issue.after due consideration,we adopt the fifth circuit standard quoted above,which we believe presents the clearest synthesis of the relevant factors.under this standard,the first factor to consider is whether a stay has been obtained.the lenders concede that they did not pursue a stay of the confirmation order in this court.american argues that this fact establishes that the lenders assumed the risk that the appeal would be equitably mooted.the lenders,for their part,argue that to pursue a stay before the sixth circuit would have been futile because of the high burden required for injunctive relief.from a strategic perspective,they argue,pursuing such a stay made little sense.
this court has in the past acknowledged that t he failure to seek a stay is not necessarily fatal to the appellant ability to proceed.city of covington,at see also unr,cir r equesting a stay is not a mandatory step comparable to filing a timely notice of appeal.in sum,while this first factor weighs somewhat against the lenders,their failure to seek a stay before this court is not fatal.
the next factor to be considered is whether the plan has been substantially consummated.city of covington,at.again,the lenders have conceded that the plan is likely already consummated.this second factor thus weighs unequivocally against the lenders.
the last,and most important factor,is whether the relief requested would affect either the rights of parties not before the court or the success of the plan.see id.here,the parties disagree.american argues that the lenders appeal,if successful,will unravel the entire reorganization plan.but the lenders argue that none of the actions undertaken with the consummation of the plan needs to be reversed for this court to grant the relief that the lenders seek.
the bankruptcy court disagreed,commenting that 
t he lenders do not quibble with the attainability of the financial projections of the debtor.instead,they contend,that given the highly leveraged nature of the debtor operations,and the owed to the senior secured debt holders,that the debtor can not generate enough cash to service the debt or pay down the principal.on these financial projections,the lenders are correct if it is assumed that the lenders secured debt is and the interest rate is to be paid in excess of.however,on the financial projections of the debtor in light of a secured debt,at an approximately interest rate,the debtor plan is not only feasible,but reasonable.
emphasis added.this comment indicates that the bankruptcy court was of the opinion that accepting both the lenders suggested collateral valuation and their cramdown interest rate would result in an infeasible reorganization plan.
the problem,however,with finding this statement conclusive on the equitable mootness issue is that the bankruptcy court did not find that the lenders claims taken individually would unravel the entire confirmed plan.moreover,other observations made by the bankruptcy court arguably support the lenders position.for example,when reviewing the lenders claims about an cramdown interest rate,the bankruptcy court simply noted that a n interest rate of results in a windfall to the lenders.it did not comment either way on the feasibility of such a proposal.likewise,when addressing the lenders argument,the bankruptcy court found american expert to be more persuasive and credible.but it again did not comment on the feasibility of adopting the lenders higher valuation.
the lenders further observe that t he houlihan lokey financial projections clearly show the ability to pay at a interest rate in deferred payments over time.this argument relies heavily on complex accounting procedures that strain the brain.essentially,however,the lenders argue that american objections to the proposal by the lenders are based on a static analysis of the debtor revenue and obligations.the lenders,by contrast,maintain that taking into account future projections combined with an increasing interest rate would enable american to pay at a interest rate without thwarting the plan other terms or affecting american obligations to third parties.american,for its part,did not directly counter the complex accounting presented by the lenders.it suggests only that accepting the lenders position would unravel the entire confirmed reorganization plan.
in sum,although the lenders did not seek a stay before this court,and although the reorganization plan has been substantially consummated,the lenders have presented a plausible argument that american might be able to pay at a interest rate without affecting the success of the confirmed plan.we will therefore err on the side of caution and deny america motion to dismiss the appeal on the grounds of equitable mootness.this brings us to the merits of the lenders appeal.
c.the cramdown interest rate 
the lenders first substantive argument is that the district court erred in applying the coerced loan theory to determine the appropriate cramdown interest rate.they further contend that the cramdown interest rate of is too low.instead,they submit that the bankruptcy court should have applied a blended interest rate of.this complex issue is further complicated by the recent supreme court case of till scs credit,d plurality opinion.
as an initial matter,a judicial cramdown is an available option when one or more classes refuse to accept the plan.collier on bankruptcy ed.the cramdown provisions set forth in b allow courts,despite objections,to confirm a reorganization plan if the plan does not discriminate unfairly,and is fair and equitable,with respect to each class of claims or interests that is impaired under,and has not accepted,the plan.this statutory provision,however,does not specify how bankruptcy courts are to calculate the appropriate cramdown interest rate for lenders.till,at.chapter provides little guidance as to which of the rates of interest congress had in mind when it adopted the cram down provision.
in its assessment,the bankruptcy court relied on several sixth circuit cases calling for the application of the coerced loan theory in determining cramdown interest rates.see household auto.fin.burden in re kidd,cir applying the coerced loan theory in a chapter context memphis bank trust whitman,cir same.under the coerced loan theory,courts treat any deferred payment of an obligation under a plan as a coerced loan and the rate of return with respect to such loan must correspond to the rate that would be charged or obtained by the creditor making a loan to a third party with similar terms,duration,collateral and risk.collier on bankruptcy c ii b.courts must therefore use the current market rate of interest used for similar loans in the region.memphis bank trust,at.this court has concluded that b ankruptcy courts are generally familiar with the current conventional rates on various types of consumer loans.and where parties dispute the question,proof can easily be adduced.id.
the bankruptcy court therefore proceeded to determine,based on its assessment of the credibility and reliability of the expert witnesses,what best accomplishes the market rate under the coerced loan theory.in this analysis,it was most persuaded by david rosen,one of american expert witnesses.rosen testified that,under the coerced loan theory,the appropriate level of interest to provide the lenders with the present value of their claim is the treasury bill interest rate plus basis points.this resulted in the appropriate interest rate under the coerced loan theory being fixed by the bankruptcy court at per annum.
the lenders,however,contend that application of the coerced loan theory was improper in light of till,d.in that chapter case,the supreme court evaluated the four widely used methods of calculating the cramdown interest rate the coerced loan,presumptive contract rate,formula rate,and cost of funds approaches and found that all but the formula rate suffered from serious flaws 
these considerations lead us to reject the coerced loan,presumptive contract rate,and cost of funds approaches.each of these approaches is complicated,imposes significant evidentiary costs,and aims to make each individual creditor whole rather than to ensure the debtor payments have the required present value.for example,the coerced loan approach requires bankruptcy courts to consider evidence about the market for comparable loans to similar though nonbankrupt inquiry far removed from such courts usual task of evaluating debtors financial circumstances and the feasibility of their debt adjustment plans.in addition,the approach overcompensates creditors because the market lending rate must be high enough to cover factors,like lenders transaction costs and overall profits,that are no longer relevant in the context of and cram down loans.
instead,the court endorsed the use of the formula approach.under this approach,the bankruptcy court 
begins by looking to the national prime rate,reported daily in the press,which reflects the financial market estimate of the amount a commercial bank should charge a creditworthy commercial borrower to compensate for the opportunity costs of the loan,the risk of inflation,and the relatively slight risk of default.because bankrupt debtors typically pose a greater risk of nonpayment than solvent commercial borrowers,the approach then requires a bankruptcy court to adjust the prime rate accordingly.
id.at.the court further observed that adopting the formula approach entails a straightforward,familiar,and objective inquiry,and minimizes the need for potentially costly additional evidentiary proceedings.id.at.
