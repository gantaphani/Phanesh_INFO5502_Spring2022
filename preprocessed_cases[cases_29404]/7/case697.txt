in this case we must resolve whether a bankruptcy trustee can avoid a transfer of potentially exempt property on the ground that the debtor transferred the property with the intent to hinder,delay,or defraud his creditors under.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the trustee may do so.
the parties agree on the essential facts.in,kenneth smoot began working for csx transportation in virginia.as a condition of his employment,smoot joined the united transportation union the union.in the early,in order to supplement his income during periods of unemployment or from csx,smoot established an unincorporated entity known as glass apple,which offered home repair and other services.
in april,after a series of unpleasant dealings with csx and the union in virginia,smoot transferred his employment with csx to ohio.fifteen months later,smoot suffered a injury when the flooring of a locomotive engine gave way causing damage to smoot knees and body.as a result of the accident,smoot underwent knee surgery in and could not work for parts of and.due to his health and other personal problems,in june,smoot left his position with csx,sold his home in ohio and returned to virginia.
csx and the union subsequently brought suit against smoot for violations of the federal wiretapping act,supp.ii,in connection with smoot illegal of a meeting,which had been convened to consider smoot grievances against csx and the union.smoot,in turn,filed suit against csx under the federal employer liability act fela,et,seeking compensation for his injury.
in january,smoot incorporated glass apple as a virginia corporation.smoot testified at his bankruptcy hearing that he did this in the hope of establishing a family business and a potential source of income for himself and his family because he believed that,due to his injury,he would no longer be able to perform manual labor.the incorporation papers listed smoot as the president of glass apple,his wife katina as the vice president,his son,cory,as the secretary and treasurer,and smoot and his wife as the company directors.katina smoot owned of glass apple stock,and smoot two children owned,in equal amounts,the remaining smoot himself owned no glass apple stock.through its various divisions,glass apple engaged in a diverse set of operations,ranging from home repair to music production to investment.one of these divisions,home check services,handled the company finances.
on march,the united states district court for the northern district of ohio found smoot liable to csx and to the union under the wiretapping act.the court took the issue of the amount of damages under advisement.three months later,smoot and csx entered into an agreement settling smoot fela claim against csx in connection with his injury.pursuant to the settlement agreement,csx agreed to pay smoot in exchange for a release of all of smoot claims against the railroad.after deducting amounts for advances and other outstanding debts,csx deposited a net amount of into a bank account held jointly by smoot and his wife at a credit union in ohio.that same day,smoot from the joint account at the credit union to home check services bank account in virginia.
in august,the ohio district court ordered smoot to pay in damages to csx and in damages to the union.the following month,the district court ordered smoot to pay csx an additional in attorney fees.
during the summer and fall of,smoot made several purchases using funds from the home check services bank account,including cars for his wife and daughter and a motorcycle for his son.smoot also wrote checks from this account to himself and to his son cory for wages.in addition,smoot loaned cory from the home check services account,which cory used to make a down payment on a house.during this same period,smoot wrote two checks from the home check services account made payable to first union in the amounts of and these funds were deposited into a first union bank account held in the name of glass apple.
in december,the union brought suit against smoot,his family members,and glass apple in the circuit court of chesterfield county,virginia seeking to set aside these transfers as fraudulent or voluntary and to have these assets made available for satisfaction of its judgment against smoot.the union also filed an ex parte petition for attachment.after the union posted the necessary bond,the virginia court issued a writ of attachment,ordering the county sheriff to attach by levy the specified property.shortly thereafter,csx filed a petition to intervene in the suit.
before the state court could hold a hearing on its writ of attachment,smoot filed a petition for chapter bankruptcy.the bankruptcy schedules,as amended,claimed an exemption in the amount of for the funds smoot received in connection with the settlement of his fela suit against csx.lynn tavenner was appointed bankruptcy trustee.in january,tavenner filed this adversary proceeding objecting to smoot discharge in bankruptcy and seeking to avoid and recover the transfers made with the checks drawn on the home check services account on the ground that,inter alia,smoot transferred the funds with the intent to defraud his creditors.tavenner also objected to smoot claimed exemption of the.
after holding a hearing on the trustee objections,the bankruptcy court issued a written opinion declaring that the trustee could avoid the transfers and recover the funds,and denying smoot a discharge in bankruptcy.the district court upheld the bankruptcy court decision,and smoot then appealed to this court.
in bankruptcy actions,we review the district court judgment and the bankruptcy court conclusions of law de novo we review the bankruptcy court findings of fact for clear error.see chmil rulisa operating in re tudor,ii,cir.in assessing the bankruptcy court findings of fact,we must give due regard to the opportunity of the bankruptcy court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.
indisputably,had smoot left the proceeds from the settlement of his fela suit against csx in his account,he could have exempted those proceeds from his bankruptcy estate under virginia law,which creates a statutory exemption for money recovered in a personal injury action.see ann.michie this case,therefore,presents the novel issue of whether transfers of property that would have been exempt from the bankruptcy estate under state law can be the subject of an avoidance and recovery action by the bankruptcy trustee,and whether a debtor may be found to have transferred such property fraudulently.
initially,we must determine whether transfers of property that would have been exempt from the bankruptcy estate under state law can be the subject of an avoidance and recovery action by the bankruptcy trustee.
as the bankruptcy court noted,in its thorough and opinion,courts hold divergent views regarding whether transfers of exemptible property can be avoided by trustees.kapila fornabaio in re fornabaio.some courts have followed the no harm,no foul approach,holding that the trustee can not avoid the transfer because,absent the transfer,creditors could not have reached the property,and thus the transfer did not harm them in any way.see id.at jarboe treiber in re treiber.a majority of courts have rejected this approach,however,noting that under the bankruptcy laws,as revised in,all property,including potentially exempt property,is part of the bankruptcy estate until the debtor claims an exemption for it consequently,a transfer of potentially exempt property could harm creditors because it might not have actually been exempted from the bankruptcy estate.see,lasich wickstrom in re wickstrom.for two reasons,we believe that the majority transfers of exemptible property are amenable to avoidance and recovery actions by bankruptcy better reasoned.
first,g of the bankruptcy code apparently anticipates this result.see g.that statute permits the debtor to exempt property recovered by the trustee under certain circumstances,namely if the debtor could have exempted such property had it not been transferred and if the transfer was involuntary and the debtor did not attempt to conceal the property.see id.section g is,thus,premised on
