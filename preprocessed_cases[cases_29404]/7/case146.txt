this case raises important questions about the ability of bankruptcy courts to subordinate claims arising from stock redemption installment payments that trace their origin to retirement plans.after reviewing recent supreme court precedents,we hold,as a general matter,that bankruptcy courts may not use their powers of equitable subordination to downgrade stock redemption claims on a categorical basis instead,they must evaluate the propriety of equitable subordination case by case.taking this general approach,we hold,more specifically,that the stock redemption note at issue note delivered in partial liquidation of the retirement benefits of a retiring employee under an employee stock ownership not be equitably subordinated because the debtor has not made a particularized showing of special circumstances such as misconduct on the part of the note holder.consequently,we reverse the contrary rulings of the courts below,vacate the order appealed from,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
the material facts are not in dispute.the debtor,merrimac paper company,is a delaware corporation that maintains its principal place of business in massachusetts.the appellant,ralph harrison,worked for the debtor in an executive capacity from to.when the debtor adopted an employee stock ownership plan esop in,the appellant became a participant.
the esop was qualified under the employee retirement income security act of erisa.see d see also e.pursuant to its terms,the debtor established a trust and proceeded to make variable annual contributions to it in amounts designated from time to time by its board of directors.the trust invested the funds on behalf of participating employees,primarily in the debtor stock.the trust maintained an individual account for each participant,specifying his or her share of the investments held in trust.over time,the esop and through it,the debtor employees as a class came to own the majority of the debtor issued and outstanding common stock.
the esop provided that upon a participating employee separation from service,the vested portion of that employee individual account would be distributed to him or her in the form of the debtor stock.because the stock was not publicly traded,a retiring employee had the option either to retain the stock received or,at any time within fifteen months of the distribution date,to compel the debtor to redeem it at fair market value a step known as the put option.upon an employee exercise of the put option,the debtor could elect to pay for the redeemed stock in substantially equal annual payments over a period not to exceed five years.if the debtor chose to make installment payments,it was required to pay interest on the deferred balance and to furnish adequate security 
at the time of the appellant retirement in,his esop account held approximately of the debtor common stock.he indicated an intention to exercise the put option.following an appraisal,the appellant shares were valued at.
on july,the appellant formally exercised the put option.in simultaneous transactions,he constructively received the shares and sold them back to the debtor,which gave him a promissory note for the note.this amount equaled the appraised value of the shares less a cash advance paid earlier to the appellant.the note bore interest at a rate of per annum and called for the principal balance to be amortized in three equal annual installments.
the appellant received the first installment payment on january.the debtor thereafter encountered financial difficulties and failed to make the next annual payment.on september,the appellant accelerated the note and brought suit in a massachusetts state court for breach of contract based on the failure to pay.a few days later,the appellant attached the debtor real estate the attachment to secure payment of the balance owed on the note.
the appellant state court complaint did not mention erisa.he remedied this omission in january of,when he instituted a second suit in the federal district court.his federal court complaint named the debtor,the esop,and the esop trustees as defendants and averred,inter alia,that these defendants had denied him erisa benefits specifically,the unpaid balance due on the note and,in the bargain,had failed to fulfill their fiduciary duties under erisa.the debtor countered by removing the state court action to the federal court on the ground that it constituted part and parcel of the same case or controversy as the newly filed federal action.see.
two months later,the debtor filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code.see.the docketing of the bankruptcy petition automatically stayed the appellant two pending actions.see id.a.the appellant filed a timely claim in the bankruptcy proceedings and noted on the claim form that he sought erisa benefits.he attached to the claim copies of both the note and the state court complaint.
on june,the debtor commenced an adversary proceeding against the appellant in an effort to subordinate his claim.see b,c.it also sought to have the attachment transferred to the bankruptcy estate for the benefit of creditors generally.see id.c.the debtor ensuing motion for summary judgment characterized the appellant claim as a stock redemption claim but did specify that it had its genesis in an esop retirement distribution.while its summary judgment motion was pending,the debtor filed its proposed plan of reorganization.that plan contemplated that the claims of general unsecured creditors would have priority over stock redemption claims whether secured or unsecured,regardless of their origin.as the debtor could only pay a fraction of the value of the general unsecured claims,this meant that the note would be extinguished and the appellant would receive nothing on it.
the appellant opposed both the summary judgment motion and the reorganization plan,arguing among other things that payment of employee benefits pursuant to an esop is qualitatively different than a stock redemption and that,even if the court treated his claim as a stock redemption claim notwithstanding its roots,equitable subordination was not available in the absence of any inequitable conduct on his part.the appellant also launched a counteroffensive he asked the district court to withdraw the adversary proceeding,challenging the bankruptcy court jurisdiction on the ground that the adversary proceeding required the resolution of erisa issues.see d stating that a district court shall withdraw such a proceeding if it requires consideration of both bankruptcy law and other federal law.concomitantly,the appellant asked the bankruptcy court to lift the automatic stay insofar as it pertained to his pending actions.
this counteroffensive bore no fruit.the district court denied the motion to withdraw the adversary proceeding on july,holding that the proceeding did not involve a substantial question of erisa law.the bankruptcy court denied without prejudice the appellant motion to lift the automatic stay.the court explained that,in its view,many if not all of the issues presented in the original litigation would be rendered moot by its resolution of the matters pending in the bankruptcy court.
on november,the bankruptcy court granted the debtor summary judgment motion and subordinated the appellant claim.in re merrimac paper,merrimac i.the court considered the appellant to have made two claims,namely,a straightforward claim for payment of the note and an erisa claim unrelated to the note.see id.at.with respect to the latter claim,the court remarked that it had looked to the complaint in the original federal court action and considered the claim to be for damages that arise from the appellant sale of stock to merrimac.id.at.
in evaluating these claims,the bankruptcy court first considered section b of the bankruptcy code,which requires subordination of any and all claims arising from rescission of a purchase or sale of a security of the debtor.the court found that the claim under the note arose from the enforcement of a debt,not the sale of a security.id.at.accordingly,the claim could not be subordinated under section b.id.at.conversely,the court characterized what it described as the unrelated erisa claim as one arising out of the sale of stock and,thus,found it to be within the purview of section b.id.at.consequently,that claim was subordinated.id.at.
the court then turned to the question of equitable subordination.see c authorizing a bankruptcy court to subordinate any and all claims for equitable reasons.the court ruled that,under traditional principles of equitable subordination,all claims based on stock redemption notes must be subordinated.id.at.hence,insofar as the appellant claim was based on the note,it had to be equitably subordinated.id.at.consistent with these holdings,the court transferred the appellant interest in the attachment to the bankruptcy estate,see c,and confirmed the debtor plan of reorganization 
the appellant unsuccessfully appealed the subordination order to the district court.see in re merrimac paper,merrimac ii see also c.this timely appeal followed 
ii.analysis 
although we serve as a second tier of appellate review,we cede no special deference to the district court initial review.in re bank of new engl,cir.rather,we review directly the bankruptcy court determination,scrutinizing its findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.in re carp,cir.the application of the bankruptcy code to the facts as found or,as here,to undisputed facts presents a mixed question of law and fact,reviewable for clear error unless the bankruptcy court analysis was based on a mistaken view of the legal principles involved.id.at see also in re indep.eng g,cir.
the threshold question here involves the precise nature of the claims that are subject to review.the debtor argues that we should review only the propriety vel non of equitable subordination of the note claim,as any erisa claim distinct from the note claim was never properly pleaded or,if properly pleaded,was waived.the appellant disputes this characterization of the record,but insists that,in all events,such issues are superfluous.he submits that were we to reverse the bankruptcy court ukase equitably subordinating the note claim,he will obtain complete relief whether or not his erisa claim was properly pleaded or punctiliously preserved.
we agree with the appellant.and because we hold that equitable subordination of the note claim was unwarranted here,see text infra,we need not decide independently the propriety of the bankruptcy court subordination of what it viewed as the appellant separate erisa claim under section b.
equitable subordination.
section c of the bankruptcy code provides in pertinent part that a bankruptcy court may,under principles of equitable subordination,subordinate for purposes of distribution all or part of an allowed claim to all or part of another allowed claim.c.the code does not elaborate upon the nature of these principles,but the supreme court has made clear that in administering this section,the starting point should be the compendium of principles of equitable subordination that existed prior to when congress enacted the bankruptcy code.see united states noland,d.this is not to say that section c froze law in place.the federal courts have latitude to tweak preexisting equitable principles and to develop new ones.see id.at.
the contours of equitable subordination are well delineated in a fifth circuit opinion,in re mobile steel,cir an opinion that the noland court deemed influential,at.first,equitable subordination demands that the claimant be found to have engaged in inequitable conduct.mobile steel,at.second,the misconduct must have either resulted in injury to creditors or given the claimant an unfair advantage.id.third,equitable subordination of the claim must not be in conflict with the provisions of federal bankruptcy law.id.this court has adopted mobile steel as the gold standard for section c cases.see in re columbus realty trust,cir.
in the case at hand,the debtor questions the applicability of the mobile steel criteria.it points to an older body of precedent in this circuit holding that stock redemption claims,as a class,are subject to equitable subordination without any showing of inequitable conduct on the claimant part.see matthews pullen,cir keith kilmer in re piano,cir.this line of authority derives from the general precept that stockholders may not receive any of the assets of an insolvent corporation until the corporation creditors are paid in full.see,in re geneva steel,cir under the absolute priority rule,unsecured creditors stand ahead of investors in the receiving line and their claims must be satisfied before any investment loss is compensated.the driving force behind decisions such as matthews and keith is the desire to prevent stockholders from subverting this precept by structuring hastily engineered stock redemption agreements as a means of substituting debt for equity and,thus,sharing company assets ratably with creditors.see keith,at holding that a stockholder,contracting with the corporation for the benefit of himself,may not through an executory contract,cease to be a stockholder,and become a creditor,to share in competition with other creditors in the assets of the corporation when bankrupt see also matthews,at clarifying that keith applies even though the parties acted in good faith and the corporation was solvent when the stock redemption agreement was executed.
keith and matthews long predated both the bankruptcy code and the enactment of erisa.nevertheless,lower courts have taken the position that such categorical subordination remains appropriate under section c with respect to claims emanating from stock redemption agreements.see,in re main brewing,in re new era packaging,in re spm.the primary support for the continued application of these hoary precedents comes from statements made during floor debates incident to passage of the bankruptcy bill,whose sponsors noted,in joint statements,that existing case law would help to establish the principles of equitable subordination.see cong.rec.statement of edwards,reprinted in,cong.rec.statement of deconcini,reprinted in,see also spm,at quoting joint floor statement for proposition that,under existing case law,a claim is generally subordinated if the claim itself is of a status susceptible to subordination,such as a penalty.those courts believed that stock redemption claims,like penalties,were susceptible of subordination based on their essential nature.so too the bankruptcy court in the instant case,which accepted this reasoning in subordinating the appellant claim.merrimac i,at.
the district court was more cautious.it recognized that we had not reaffirmed our precedents since the passage of section c,but ultimately concluded that the categorical rule of keith and matthews would survive.merrimac ii,at.the court based this conclusion on our affirmance,without opinion,in liebowitz columbia packing,aff,cir table.see merrimac ii,at.
liebowitz,however,is a very slender reed.our opinion is unpublished and unpublished opinions have no precedential force.see united states meade,cir see also cir.a.thus,our affirmance in liebowitz is of no consequence.more importantly,two supreme court cases decided subsequent to liebowitz dispel any notion that a bankruptcy court must categorically impose equitable subordination merely because a claim arises out of a note taken in connection with a redemption of corporate stock.
the first of these cases is noland.there,the internal revenue service irs filed a claim for a noncompensatory tax penalty against a bankrupt corporation.noland,at.such a claim ordinarily would be entitled to first priority in bankruptcy as an administrative expense.see b c,a.although the bankruptcy court found no misconduct on the part of the irs,it ordered the penalty claim equitably subordinated under section c to avoid the perceived unfairness of allowing the irs to take precedence over secured and unsecured creditors who had given value to the business.the sixth circuit affirmed,looking to the legislative history of the bankruptcy code and holding that a tax penalty claim could be subordinated,even in the absence of inequitable conduct on the claimant part.i
