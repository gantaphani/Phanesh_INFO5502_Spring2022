opinion of the court 
this bankruptcy appeal presents a question with potentially implications for the states administration of their criminal justice systems.it is also one of first impression in this circuit.the issue is whether the debt to a state of a bond surety for a defendant who fails to appear is dischargeable in the surety chapter bankruptcy.we decide the question here only in the context of the case before us the bond surety is a relative of the defendant.
we conclude that the decision of the district court,holding such a debt dischargeable,contradicts the plain meaning of the applicable statute.in light of the problems that such a holding might inflict upon the functioning of the bail release system,we will reverse the district court decision.
david nam david,the son of the debtor,gi nam nam,was charged in philadelphia,pennsylvania,on september,with a number of offenses,including murder,robbery and burglary in connection with the shooting death of anthony schroeder during a march robbery.bail was set at million,conditioned on a cash payment by the surety and an agreement by the defendant and the surety to assume legal responsibility for paying the full amount of the bail to the commonwealth of pennsylvania.by a certification of bail and discharge,dated january,executed by both nam and david,nam agreed to serve as surety for the bail.the operative portion of the certification reads as follows 
we the undersigned,defendant and surety,our successors,heirs and assigns,are jointly and severally bound to pay the commonwealth of pennsylvania in the sum of one million dollars.we are bound by the conditions of this bond as shown on both sides of this form.
pursuant to the terms of the bond,both nam and david agreed that the latter would appear in court at all required times and that nam,as surety,would notify the court in writing of any change in david address.the certification also states,if defendant performs the conditions as set forth herein,then this bond is to be void,otherwise the same shall remain in full force and this bond in the full sum thereof shall be forfeited.additionally,both nam and david authorized the entry of a judgment by confession against them in the amount of the bond,regardless of whether a default of the bond conditions occurred.
on march,david nam failed to appear in court for a status listing in his criminal case.consequently,on april,the court of common pleas of philadelphia,criminal section,ordered the bail bond forfeited pursuant to the terms of the bond agreement,the pennsylvania rules of criminal procedure,and local court rules the criminal court entered a judgment against nam as surety on the forfeited bond in the amount of the bail,plus court costs the notice of entry of judgment against nam,which bears the caption of david criminal case,reads in pertinent part 
bail in the amount of has been sued out and judgment entered in the amount of including cost of due to failure of the above named defendant to appear for trial on in room cjc filbert 
you may reduce your financial responsibility by producing the defendant forthwith and filing a petition with the clerk of quarter sessions to vacate,in total or in part,the judgment against you.
when david was released on bond,nam provided him with living quarters and the necessities of life.some time before his status hearing,david fled to south korea where his paternal grandmother resides.it appears that,once david had fled to korea,nam followed him there and paid a lawyer to represent david.see krasny gi and yeoung nam.indeed,nam testified at a creditors hearing before the trustee on august,that he had provided david with such assistance.see id.at david remains a fugitive.
on may,nam petitioned for bankruptcy under chapter of the bankruptcy code.nam listed the city of philadelphia as the creditor on a claim in the amount of,arising from the bail bond security.on august,the city of philadelphia filed a complaint in adversary,alleging that,although nam had listed the bail bond judgment as an unsecured claim in the schedule he had filed in the bankruptcy case,such debt was not in fact dischargeable pursuant to a.on september,nam filed a motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to.b,arguing that the bail bond debt was dischargeable.
ii.procedural history 
the bankruptcy judge granted nam motion to dismiss on december.the bankruptcy court rejected the city arguments that the judgment against nam satisfied the elements of a and that forfeited bail bonds must be exempted from discharge in order to safeguard the integrity of the bail and criminal justice systems.the court construed a narrowly,holding that it only exempts from discharge obligations imposed upon the debtor as punishment for his wrongdoing and that the judgment against nam arose because a condition of the bond was breached and not because the surety is being punished.
the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court judgment,holding that a excepts from discharge only sanctions that are penal,as opposed to civil,in nature and that result from the debtor own wrongdoing.the district court further found that nam never assumed any independent obligation to produce david in court and,thus,that nam committed no wrongdoing.consequently,the court held the debt dischargeable.moreover,the district court enunciated a more general proposition concerning the application of a a judgment against a surety,arising from a forfeited bail bond,will be exempted from discharge under a only if the surety played some affirmative role in the defendant failure to appear.this appeal followed.
iii.jurisdiction 
the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction under title of the united states code,b,as a complaint to determine the dischargeability of a debt.the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to a and we have jurisdiction of this appeal pursuant to c and.we exercise plenary review over a district court bankruptcy decision.commonwealth of.of environmental resources clinical laboratories,cir.
iv.discussion 
the sole statutory provision at issue in this appeal is the exception to discharge provided by a,which states in pertinent part 
a a discharge under section of this title does not discharge an individual debtor from any debt 
to the extent such debt is for a fine,penalty,or forfeiture payable to and for the benefit of a governmental unit,and is not compensation for actual pecuniary loss,other than a tax penalty 
a emendations added.in order to determine whether a debt is dischargeable under a,we must determine whether such debt meets the three requirements of the section.in re rashid,cir.here,the parties do not dispute that nam debt is payable to and for the benefit of a governmental unit either or both the commonwealth of pennsylvania and the city of philadelphia or that the million bail bond debt is not compensation for any pecuniary loss by such governmental entities or any other party consequently,we need only concern ourselves with the construction of the first prong of a the fine,penalty or forfeiture provision.the city argues that nam debt is a forfeiture of the bond amount arising from david failure to appear and,therefore,falls within the plain language of the statute.nam on the other hand contends that the statute only creates an exception for penal debts,a category into which nam debt assertedly does not fall.
following the teaching of the supreme court,we have held that the starting point of any statutory analysis is the language of the statute itself.commonwealth of.of environmental resources clinical laboratories,cir,citing.of pub.welfare davenport,d kelly robinson,d.consequently,our analysis of the fine,penalty or forfeiture prong of a must begin with the plain language of the statute.
on its face,the judgment against nam seems to come within the plain meaning of the term forfeiture.for example,forfeiture is defined in black law dictionary as a divestiture of specific property without compensation a deprivation or destruction of a right in consequence of the nonperformance of some obligation or condition.black law dictionary ed.forfeiture is defined by webster dictionary as the divesting of the ownership of particular property of a person on account of the breach of a legal duty and without any compensation to him the loss of property or money on account of one breach of the terms of an agreement,bond,or other legal obligation.webster third new international dictionary.clearly,the judgment against nam arose from david nonperformance of his obligation to appear in court and nam breach of his duty to produce david for trial.moreover,the judgment does not compensate the city for any pecuniary loss suffered but instead serves as an incentive to the surety to prevent the defendant flight and to produce him insofar as the surety is capable.
the district court,however,attempted to construe a using traditional canons of construction.we find that this attempt at construction results in fact in writing the term forfeiture out of the statute.
as a preliminary matter,we note that the district court conclusion that a forfeiture must be penal in order to come within the exception conflicts with the plain language of the statute.nothing in that language equates a forfeiture with a penalty.quite the contrary,penalty and forfeiture are two distinct terms within the phrase fine,penalty,or forfeiture.citing kelly robinson,d and in re collins,cir,the district court reasoned that a excepts from dischargeability only those forfeitures which are penal sanctions that result from the debtor wrongdoing.finding no such qualification in a,we disagree with the district court reasoning.we do not interpret kelly to imply that the fine,penalty or forfeiture prong of a is restricted in scope to except from dischargeability only obligations of a penal nature.furthermore,to the extent the fourth circuit so interpreted kelly in in re collins,we decline to adopt a similar rule here.
the kelly court addressed the question whether restitution obligations,imposed as conditions of probation in state criminal proceedings,are dischargeable in proceedings under chapter of the bankruptcy code.kelly,at.the supreme court held that such restitution obligations,although not excepted expressly by a,fall within the a exception and,therefore,are not dischargeable.see id.at.the supreme court based this holding on findings that a creates a broad exception for all penal sanctions and restitution obligations such as the one at issue in kelly constitute penal sanctions.id.at.kelly,therefore,stands for the proposition that a excepts from dischargeability some penal sanctions that technically are neither fines nor penalties nor forfeitures.however,it does not follow logically from this proposition that a excepts only sanctions of a penal nature.
the kelly court addressed the penal nature of restitution obligations and the history,object and policy of a because the plain language of that statute fails to address restitution obligations expressly.the instant appeal is distinguishable from kelly insofar as forfeitures the type of obligation alleged to be at excepted expressly from discharge by a.because a expressly excepts forfeitures without regard to penal nature,we need not address this characteristic in assessing the applicability of a to nam alleged forfeiture.
returning to the district court use of the canons of statutory construction,we find its reliance on the canon ejusdem generis to lead to an erroneous interpretation of the statute.according to that canon,where general words follow specific words in a statutory enumeration,the general words are construed to embrace only objects similar in nature to those objects enumerated by the preceding specific words.united states weadon,cir.nevertheless,the district court attempt to render forfeiture a more general term than penalty is strained and unconvincing.the alternative dictionary definitions of forfeiture which the district court cites span varying degrees of generality.although black dictionary characterizes forfeiture as a comprehensive term,it also defines it as a divestiture of specific property language which resembles that dictionary alternative definitions of penalty in both its broadness and its specificity penalty is an elastic term with many different shades of meaning but is nevertheless generally confined to pecuniary punishment.black law dictionary,ed.
it is not necessary to make here the numerous similar observations possible with respect to the dictionary definition of fine it suffices merely to note that the generality of the terms in question can not be ascertained with any reliability on the basis of their dictionary definitions and that it is difficult to discern any lexical justification for the assertion that forfeiture is a more general term than penalty.it follows that the canon ejusdem generis is inapplicable to this case.moreover,even were it applicable,it could not be used to reach the result of the district transformation of the term forfeiture into ejusdem generis can not be employed to render general words meaningless.ferrara dimercurio,paul mercury ins,cir,quoting united states alpers.
similarly flawed is the district court application of the maxim noscitur a sociis to subsume the term forfeiture within the earlier term penalty.the supreme court has stated that t he maxim noscitur a sociis,that a word is known by the company it keeps,while not an inescapable rule,is often wisely applied where a word is capable of many meanings in order to avoid the giving of unintended breadth to acts of congress.folger adam,jv,cir,quoting jarecki searle,d.put differently,the maxim provides that the meaning of an ambiguous statutory term may be derived from the meaning of the accompanying terms.in re continental airlines,cir.were the maxim applicable here,it would indeed be possible to hold that the term forfeiture should be read as penal forfeiture in light of the term proximity to the word penalty.a.however,noscitur a sociis can have no application in this context because w hen congress has separated terms with the conjunction or,it is presumed that congress intended to give the terms their separate,normal meanings.in re continental airlines,at,quoting garcia united states,d.consequently,we are again referred to the plain meaning of the term forfeiture which,as we have indicated supra,encompasses debts such as nam.
state law context and history 
as is often the case,such an analysis of the plain meaning of the statutory language in a vacuum,while helpful,can not of itself provide an adequate guide to the proper construction of the statute.to buttress the preceding discussion,we now turn to the context of a and its history.as nam points out in his appellate brief,absent explicit congressional intent to incorporate state law,the meaning of a term in a federal statute is a question of federal law.see in re wilson,accord in re gianakas,cir federal law determines dischargeability under a.nevertheless,this fact does not render the characterization of debts such as nam under applicable state law wholly without meaning.although the label that state law affixes to a certain type of debt can not of itself be determinative of the debt character for purposes of the federal dischargeability provisions,such designations are at least helpful to courts in determining the generic nature of such debts under the law that most directly governs their creation,whether they are penal or civil,fines or forfeitures.
in the case of nam debt,pennsylvania law defines a judgment entered against a surety as a result of his failure to produce the defendant in court as a forfeiture.rule a a of the pennsylvania rules of criminal procedure,entitled forfeiture,authorizes the bail authority to order the case or other security forfeited as a sanction for the defendant violation of a condition of the bail bond.local court rules also use the term forfeiture rule of the philadelphia court rules for the criminal division of the court of common pleas authorizes the court to order bail to be forfeited when the defendant fails to appear for court and states that the surety is obligated to produce the defendant at all required court appearances under penalty of forfeiture of his bail bond.consequently,the district court correctly conceded that the million judgment against nam is characterized as a forfeiture under state law.
the history of a strongly suggests that congress intended the sort of forfeiture entered against nam to come within the exemption from dischargeability set forth in that section.section a came into being in,when congress enacted the present bankruptcy code.the parties to this litigation do not dispute that,in enacting the code,congress codified case law exempting certain penalties and forfeitures from discharge under the former bankruptcy act of.moreover,such codified case law included a line of authority holding that obligations against sureties arising from forfeited bail bonds were nondischargeable.in what follows,we will review the fundamental historical rationale for and the development of a against the background of the prior act case law from which that statute emerged.
in general,a discharge granted to a debtor in a chapter bankruptcy proceeding voids all judgments previously applicable to the debtor,except for debts that are exempt from discharge under,which expresses congressional policy that certain debts should be excluded from discharge because of overriding public policy relating to the type of the debt,the manner in which liability for it was incurred,or the underlying social responsibility that it represents.bankruptcy service,lawyers edition,ch.code,at west.such d ischargeability exceptions reflect a decision by congress to allow certain competing public interests to override the fresh start purpose of bankruptcy.id.as the supreme court has stated,congress evidently concluded that the creditors interest in recovering full payment of debts in the categories encompassed by a outweighed the debtors interest in a complete fresh start.grogan garner,d.
although the act contained no provision specifically forbidding the discharge of fines,penalties,or forfeitures due the government,it did provide that certain types of debts were nondischargeable.see bankruptcy act of,repealed.pursuant to of the act,penalties or forfeitures owed to the government were only allowed as a claim in bankruptcy to the limited extent that such penalties or forfeitures compensated the government for a pecuniary loss.section provided 
debts owing to the united states,a state,a county,a district,or a municipality as a penalty or forfeiture shall not be allowed,except for the amount of the pecuniary loss sustained by the act,transaction,or proceeding out of which the penalty or forfeiture arose.
stat,repealed.
it is evident then that in enacting this provision,congress intended to protect general creditors against the reduction of debts owed them by limiting the debts allowable to the government to its actual pecuniary losses.a leading treatise on bankruptcy explained the policy considerations underlying in the following terms 
it is perfectly conceivable that a bankruptcy law is anxious not to curtail this sovereign power to mete out punishment and therefore treats claims for penalties on a footing of equality with,if not of precedence over,other claims.yet there is on the other hand the natural tendency and task of the bankruptcy law to mitigate as far as possible the losses to be sustained by creditors,and under this aspect there is an undeniable equity in the postulate that participation in the estate should be denied to a creditor who has neither in some degree contributed to the distributable funds,by the governmental protection on which taxation is supposed to be based,nor has suffered a pecuniary loss by parting with something in money worth.it is this consideration for the bankrupt creditors that pervades.
collier on bankruptcy,at ed.
the notion that the conflicting interests of protecting the government power to punish and defending the rights of general creditors should be thus balanced is a recurring theme of the case law under the act.see,simonson granquist,d stating that plainly manifests a congressional purpose to bar all claims of any kind against a bankrupt except those based on a pecuniary loss.so understood,this section,which has been a part of the bankruptcy act since its enactment in,is in keeping with the broad aim of the act to provide for the conservation of the estates of insolvents goggin united states,of claims w hen congress,in,drew a distinction between a penalty of forfeiture,on the one hand,and the pecuniary loss sustained,on the other,we think it meant that an arbitrarily set amount should not be put in competition with the claims of the ordinary creditors of the bankrupt,vacated on other grounds.
thus,under bankruptcy statutes and judicial decisions,penalties and forfeitures owed to the government were,for the most part,not allowed as claims.the correlative question whether such debts should be dischargeable was firmly settled by the judiciary long before the enactment of the code in.because penalties and forfeitures owed to the government were essentially not allowable,courts generally exempted them from discharge as a way of holding debtors responsible for such penalties and forfeitures while avoiding interference with the results of state criminal proceedings.see united states ron pair,d kelly,at.clinical laboratories,at.as the kelly court stated,d espite the clear statutory language,most courts refused to allow a discharge in bankruptcy to affect the judgment of a state criminal court.kelly,at.this principle of nondischargeability of penalties and forfeitures payable to the government and not in remuneration of a pecuniary loss was so uniformly accepted by that congress incorporated it into the code as an explicit statutory exception to dischargeability in a.ron pair,at.kelly,at,quoting collier on bankruptcy,at ed.id.at.recognizing that a codified the judicially created exception to discharge for fines,penalties and forfeitures.
the line of authority underlying this exception is an old and venerable one,stretching back to the turn of the twentieth century.in in re caponigri,judge learned hand addressed the issue whether a claim of the united states on a forfeited recognizance for bail in a criminal case,asserted against a debtor who had acted as surety for a defendant who fled,was allowable,given that it constituted a penalty or forfeiture under former.significantly,in caponigri,as in the instant case,the debtor was a surety for the criminal defendant and not the defendant himself.judge hand held that the recovery on a recognizance for bail is essentially the recovery of a penalty,and is a forfeiture.at.judge hand adhered to the concept of a penalty being by definition unrelated to any pecuniary loss the amount of a penal obligation,he wrote,is measured neither by the obligee loss nor by the valuation placed by him upon what he has given in exchange.id.
in the years that followed,caponigri came to be viewed as controlling authority on the question of the allowability of forfeited bail bonds.see,in re lake,am.more significantly,however,the caponigri decision provided an analytical framework for defining debts.this framework was applied to determine the allowability of types of penalties and forfeitures other than bail bonds.many cases applied judge hand penalty test to find obligations to be disallowed where the obligations were imposed for coercive or regulatory purposes and were not proportionate to any actual pecuniary loss.see,in re james butler grocery,in re erlin manor nursing home,in re idak.
moreover,the reasoning of caponigri was applied to dischargeability as well as to allowability.as early as,a court in new york held that claims by governments against sureties for judgments on forfeited bail bonds were nondischargeable under the act.see in re weber.see also commonwealth mcmillen.accord.in weber,the debtor sought the discharge of a judgment entered against him on a forfeited bail bond.following judge hand decision in caponigri,the court found the obligation not to be allowable.see weber,at,at.the court went further,however,ruling that because the obligation was not allowable,it was also not dischargeable it could not have been intended by the bankruptcy act that a bankrupt should be discharged of the payment of a debt which was not allowable.id.
both and legally,we
