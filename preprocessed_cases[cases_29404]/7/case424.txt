this appeal presents an issue of first impression in our court can a payment to a creditor pursuant to a wage order entered at a debtor request reduce the creditor new value defense and thereby increase preference liability the same as it would if the payment had been made 
under the bankruptcy code,the trustee may avoid certain preferential transfers made by a debtor to a creditor in the days before its bankruptcy petition was filed.see b.a creditor who gives the debtor new value subsequent to a preference payment,however,may use what is referred to as the new value defense to offset an otherwise avoidable preference.see id.c.the new value defense is not applicable to the extent that,thereafter,the debtor makes an otherwise unavoidable transfer to the creditor on account of the value received.id.c b.we hold that where an otherwise unavoidable transfer is made after the filing of a bankruptcy petition,it does not affect the new value defense.for this reason,we will affirm the order of the district court affirming the bankruptcy court.
background 
the facts giving rise to this appeal are undisputed.friedman,the debtor filed for bankruptcy under chapter of the bankruptcy code on january,and thereafter the case was converted to one under chapter of the bankruptcy code.in the days prior to filing for bankruptcy the preference period,the debtor made payments for personnel to roth staffing appellee totaling.after these preferential transfers,but before the petition was filed,roth staffing provided services valued at to the debtor.the money owed for these services remained unpaid as of the date the bankruptcy petition was filed.
on january,the debtor filed a motion in bankruptcy court seeking authority to pay its employees and independent contractors collectively,employees,wages,compensation,and related benefits.it stated that as of the petition date,it had approximately employees and outstanding obligations to them in the amount of approximately million.the debtor represented to the court,inter alia,that if its employees were not compensated at least in part for the services that had been provided,there would likely be an epidemic of employee departures a deterioration in morale.mot.of debtors and debtors in possession for an order authorizing the debtors to pay prepetition wages,compensation,and employee benefits pursuant to sections a and b of the bankruptcy code,in re friedman.it argued that this would substantially and adversely impact its businesses and result in immediate and irreparable harm to the creditors and estates.id.
the debtor asked the court to invoke its power under a of the bankruptcy code to enable the trustee to make the payments to employees pursuant to b.section a states,in relevant part the court may issue any order,process,or judgment that is necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this title.a.section b provides that a trustee,after notice and a hearing,may use,sell or lease,other than in the ordinary course of business,property of the estate.id.b.
the court granted the debtor motion the wage order.pursuant to the wage order,and after filing its bankruptcy petition,the debtor paid to roth staffing on account of staffing services.
on march,friedman liquidating trust flt or appellant,the successor in interest to the debtor,commenced this action in bankruptcy court,seeking to avoid and recover transfers made to roth staffing as preferences,pursuant to b of the bankruptcy code.this section states 
except as provided in subsections c and i of this section,the trustee may avoid any transfer of an interest of the debtor in property 
to or for the benefit of a creditor 
for or on account of an antecedent debt owed by the debtor before such transfer was made 
made while the debtor was insolvent 
a on or within days before the date of the filing of the petition or 
b between ninety days and one year before the date of the filing of the petition,if such creditor at the time of such transfer was an insider and 
that enables such creditor to receive more than such creditor would receive if 
a the case were a case under chapter of this title 
b the transfer had not been made and 
c such creditor received payment of such debt to the extent provided by the provisions of this title.
in its answer to flt complaint,roth staffing asserted the affirmative defense of new value,pursuant to c of the code,which reads 
the trustee may not avoid under this section a transfer 
to or for the benefit of a creditor,to the extent that,after such transfer,such creditor gave new value to or for the benefit of the debtor 
a not secured by an otherwise unavoidable security interest and 
b on account of which new value the debtor did not make an otherwise unavoidable transfer to or for the benefit of such creditor 
id.c.roth staffing claimed that because it had provided subsequent new value to the debtor in an amount exceeding the preferential transfers made,flt could not avoid these transfers.
flt responded by arguing that roth staffing new value defense had to be reduced by the payment of that the debtor had made pursuant to the wage order.flt argued that this otherwise unavoidable transfer reduced roth staffing new value defense to,and therefore entitled flt to recover on its preference claim.
the bankruptcy court held that because flt payments made pursuant to the wage order occurred after the bankruptcy petition was filed,these payments could not enter into the preference calculation.because the bankruptcy code does not set forth a cutoff for when an otherwise unavoidable transfer should be considered in computing new value,the court looked to caselaw.the court concluded that the cutoff should be the petition date,relying on language from our opinion in in re new york city shoes,describing the three requirements for establishing a new value defense as follows 
first,the creditor must have received a transfer that is otherwise voidable as a preference under b.second,after receiving the preferential transfer,the preferred creditor must advance new value to the debtor on an unsecured basis.third,the debtor must not have fully compensated the creditor for the new value as of the date that it filed its bankruptcy petition.
cir hereinafter new york city shoes emphasis added.the bankruptcy court found our opinion in new york city shoes to be controlling,and,therefore,held that since the otherwise unavoidable transfer was made after the petition date,flt was not entitled to recover on its preference claim.the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court order denying summary judgment for flt,but stated that it found our language in new york city shoes regarding the bankruptcy petition date to be dicta.nevertheless,the district court explained that it would follow new york city shoes because we described the new value defense test outlined in that case as a holding in a subsequent opinion,in re winstar communications,inc,cir hereinafter winstar communications this court has held that c imposes three requirements the debtor must not have fully compensated the creditor for the new value as of the date that it filed its bankruptcy petition.emphasis added.the court reasoned that while the language from winstar communications could also be construed to be dicta,it was reluctant to find that what we said twice,and once referred to as a holding,was dicta.
flt now appeals the district court decision.it argues that the bankruptcy court and by extension,the district court erred in relying on dicta from new york city shoes rather than the plain language of c of the bankruptcy code allowing roth staffing to double dip contrary to policies underlying bankruptcy law by asserting a new value defense even though it did not replenish the debtor estate and failing to follow our holding in in re kiwi international air,cir hereinafter kiwi air,which,it urges,requires us to account for material events occurring after the commencement of a bankruptcy case in performing the preference analysis.
ii.standard of review 
our standard of review of a district court review of a bankruptcy court decision is plenary.winstar commc ns,f d at.we exercise the same standard of review as the district court in reviewing the bankruptcy court determinations.id.we review the bankruptcy court legal determinations de novo,its factual findings for clear error,and its exercises of discretion for abuse thereof.in re goody family clothing,inc,cir.
iii.discussion 
as a threshold matter,we must determine whether we are bound by prior third circuit precedent on the question presented here.if a determination by our court is not necessary to our ultimate holding,it properly is classified as dictum.calhoun yamaha motor,cir.it is well established that we are not bound by our court prior dicta.galli new jersey meadowlands comm n,cir.the district court correctly noted that on both occasions when we previously addressed this question,our statement of the law may well have been dicta,and not a holding,because neither new york city shoes nor winstar communications involved a payment on new value.therefore neither we,nor the bankruptcy court nor district court,would be bound by these opinions.we examine these opinions more closely below.
new york city shoes and winstar communications 
in new york city shoes,we were faced with the question of when a postdated check given by a debtor to a creditor should be deemed transferred for purposes of section c.at.the answer to this question bore on whether new value had been given before or after a preferential transfer,and therefore whether the new value defense was applicable.none of the relevant transactions or dates in the case occurred.therefore,when we announced the test for a defense under c,and stated that the third requirement was that the debtor must not have fully compensated the creditor for the new value as of the date that it filed its bankruptcy petition,id.at,the language we included regarding the petition date was not germane to our analysis.this language was dicta,and consequently not binding upon future courts.
nevertheless,in winstar communications,we referred to the test announced in new york city shoes as a holding.at.reference to the third requirement was again,however,immaterial to our disposition of the case.in winstar communications,the primary questions with respect to the new value defense were whether new value had been extended after the preferential transfer,and whether new value had been extended on an unsecured basis.id.we quoted new york city shoes for the principle that new value must be extended after a preferential transfer on an unsecured basis.see id.at.because none of the relevant transactions occurred,our statement regarding the petition date was not pertinent to our analysis.the statement was,again,dicta and we are not bound by it here 
having established that no prior opinion binds us on the question presented,we turn to flt other arguments.flt contends that we need look no further than the text of the bankruptcy code in determining whether or not to consider payments.we agree however,in doing so,we reach a different conclusion from the one appellant urges regarding the plain meaning of the statute.
b.the plain language of c b 
when statutory language is plain,the sole function of the courts at least where the disposition required by the text is not absurd is to enforce it according to its terms.hartford underwriters ins.union planters bank,see also parker nutrisystem,cir where the statutory language is unambiguous,the court should not consider statutory purpose or legislative history.here,c b is silent as to when a payment must be made by a debtor to defeat a creditor new value defense.must it have been made before the petition date do other provisions of the bankruptcy code inform this issue district and bankruptcy courts are nearly equally divided on this issue compare in re phoenix rest,holding that payments made pursuant to critical vendor order could not be used to offset new value in re schabel,holding that new value must remain unpaid at time of filing of bankruptcy petition in re thurman,inc,finding that new value must remain unpaid as of petition date,rather than date court adjudicates preference action in re braniff,following majority rule articulated in new york city shoes that new value remain unpaid as of petition date and in re energy,citing new york city shoes for principle that payments by debtor do not limit new value defense with in re furr supermarkets,hereinafter furr supermarkets holding that cutting off preference calculation at petition date makes no economic sense in re login.book,hereinafter login b oth the plain language and policy behind the statute indicate that the timing of a repayment of new value is irrelevant.in re mmr holding,an unavoidable transfer on account of new value extended subsequent to a preference should limit the use of c by the amount of the unavoidable transfer,as without a reduction in the new value offset,the transferee would be receiving double use of the new value and in re mgmt,holding that payments on new value must be considered under c.
the fact that courts are divided in their interpretations of c b does not mean,however,that the provision is necessarily ambiguous.see in re price,cir j ust because a particular provision may be,by itself,susceptible to differing constructions does not mean that the provision is therefore ambiguous.a provision is ambiguous,when,despite a studied examination of the statutory context,the natural reading of a provision remains elusive.id.we have previously noted that in interpreting the bankruptcy code,the supreme court has been reluctant to declare its provisions ambiguous,preferring instead to take a broader,contextual view,and urging courts to not be guided by a single sentence or member of a sentence,but look to the provisions of the whole law,and to its object and policy.id.at quoting kelly robinson.context is therefore key in determining the meaning of a particular provision and whether or not it is ambiguous.see official comm.of unsecured creditors of cybergenics,ex rel.cybergenics chinery,cir en banc as the supreme court has often noted,s tatutory construction is a holistic endeavor,and this is especially true of the bankruptcy code.quoting united sav.ass of timbers of inwood forest,ltd,see also alli decker,cir holding that courts may look to statutory context in making threshold ambiguity determination.if,after close examination of the statutory context and underlying policy goals,the plain meaning of a provision is still unclear,we then turn to practice and legislative history to find meaning.see in re price,at.these tools of construction,however,are tools of last resort.id.
appellant argues that the statute plainly indicates that a debtor payment offsetting new value may occur at any time,either pre or,as long as it is a transfer made after the new value is extended.appellant bases this interpretation on the code silence,in that it lacks any specific language containing a temporal limitation.because the drafters could have set forth a cutoff date,but did not,appellant urges there is no limit.this reading has some appeal,but does not take into account the context in which the provision is found.if we read the statute in this manner,the time period involved would be totally such that any payment,at any time,could defeat a new value defense.did congress really intend there to be no limit to when a payment defeating a new value defense could be made in determining whether a preference has occurred we think not.
however,we rest this conclusion primarily on the context and policy of the code,rather than specific language,as we discuss below.we,therefore,do not rely on two arguments appellee makes hinging on single words and phrases in c.for example,appellee contends that the word transfer as used in c refers back to b,which states that in order for a transfer to be avoidable,it must have occurred within the days preceding the petition date appellee urges that the later use of transfer must mean that the later word is also modified by the day phrase.while in two instances in c transfer is clearly modified in a way referring back to the day period,in the last instance,referring to the otherwise unavoidable transfer issue here,it is not.the mere addition of the word unavoidable does not give us any reason to think that such a temporal limitation should apply.thus,this argument is without merit.
appellee rests on similarly shaky ground where it argues that the use of the word debtor rather than estate or might indicate that the provision only refers to activity.several other courts have found this argument persuasive but it does not withstand scrutiny.not only does the bankruptcy code fail to define a debtor as a,as opposed to,entity,see,but also many other provisions in the code refer to debtors in the context.see,id.referring to attorneys representing a debtor in a case under the title and describing a debtor duties.we must conclude that appellee argument,therefore,is not persuasive on this issue.
rather than focusing,as the parties do,on the presence or absence of individual words and phrases within c b,we take a broader approach to our analysis,examining the provision in the context of the bankruptcy code as a whole.
statutory context 
we find numerous contextual indicators in the code that point to the petition date as a cutoff for analysis of the new value defense.first,as a general matter,is titled preferences,and therefore suggests that it concerns transactions occurring during the preference period,which is by definition,the days before the filing of the petition.it would make sense that the calculation of the amount of the preference,and application of any new value reduced by subsequent transfers,would relate to that time period 
second,appellee urges that the fact that the preference test known as the hypothetical liquidation test must be performed as of the petition date points to that date as the cutoff for determining new value.we agree.the hypothetical liquidation test requires courts to compare the payment received by a creditor during the preference period with what the creditor would have received if the payment had not been made and the debtor assets were liquidated and distributed to creditors to the extent provided by the provisions of the title.b.courts have held that this test should be performed as of the petition date even though the statute does not specify the date to be used.see,in re union meeting partners,holding that hypothetical liquidation analysis must be conducted as of date bankruptcy petition is filed see also collier on bankruptcy ed stating that b codifies holding from palmer clay products brown,in setting petition date as date to be used in hypothetical liquidation analysis.extending preference analysis past the petition date would be inconsistent with b.
third,the statute of limitations for filing a preference avoidance action under in a voluntary case begins to run on the petition date this supports the notion that the cause of action accrues as of that date.see.if congress had intended to allow for transactions to affect the impact on the estate,it is likely that it would have crafted a different statute of limitations.the fact that the statute of limitations for a preference avoidance action under generally begins on the petition date suggests that the calculation of preference liability should remain constant.if we read c b to allow payments to defeat a new value defense,the calculation of preference liability could change depending on when the preference avoidance action was filed.
fourth,appellee argues that extending the preference analysis past the petition date would be inconsistent with the test articulated in c.this provision provides a defense from preference liability for a creditor with a floating lien on a debtor inventory and receivables,so long as the creditor did not improve its position during the preference period.notably,the provision includes the phrase as of the date of the filing of the petition.appellee avers that because congress specifically articulated an intention in an analogous defense to preference liability to confine the analysis to activity,we should assume it had the same intention with respect to the new value defense.the converse could be argued,however namely,that this omission from c was intentional,since congress knew how to set forth a relevant time period when it thought it applied.still,on balance,we believe that the policy of improvement of position prior to the petition date is central to the concept of preference.we find this provision to bolster our reasoning.
lastly,if we allow payments to affect the preference analysis,it would seem logical also to consider extensions of new value to be available as a defense.however,the vast majority of courts that have considered this issue have concluded that new value advanced after the petition date should not be considered in a creditor new value defense.see in re bellanca aircraft,cir in re rocor int l.in re george transfer,in re sharoff food,in re mgmt,in re jolly n,in re vunovich,see also in re kumar bavishi,cir cowen,dissenting noting trend among courts to exclude advances of new value from preference analysis norton bankruptcy law and practice p ostpetition extensions of unsecured credit to the debtor are not encompassed by c and may not be utilized to protect prior preferential transfers.but see in re keydata,approving without discussion setoff of service against preferential transfers.although c only specifies that new value be given to a debtor subsequent to a preference payment,courts have read the petition date into the statute as a cutoff.at least one court has found that the logic leading to the conclusion that new value should not be considered in the preference analysis also applies to the issue before us.see in re murray,wl,at.june,t he trustee would have the court conclude that payments remain in play while advances of new value are excluded from the analysis under c.logically,and as a matter of statutory consistency,the trustee argument fails.
while,as we noted above,a number of courts have come out the other way on the issue before us,none has made a convincing contextual argument.see furr supermarkets,at resting primarily on policy grounds,as we discuss below login,at same in re mmr holding,at stating that a voidable is avoidable,and concluding that i t simply does not matter that the avoidable transfer subsequent to the extension of new value is a pre or avoidable transfer in re mgmt,at rejecting argument that just because recovery of transfer is under means that it can not be considered in calculating amount of preference.thus we believe that the context of the code supports the conclusion that payments by a debtor do not affect a creditor new value defense.
appellant argues that the policies underlying the preference provision and the new value defense should compel us to conclude that payments defeat a new value defense.for the reasons that follow,we disagree.
the supreme court has articulated two policies underlying 
first,by permitting the trustee to avoid transfers that occur within a short period before bankruptcy,creditors are discouraged from racing to the courthouse to dismember the debtor during his slide into bankruptcy.the protection thus afforded the debtor often enables him to work his way out of a difficult financial situation through cooperation with all of his creditors.second,and more important,the preference provisions facilitate the prime bankruptcy policy of equality of distribution among creditors of the debtor.
union bank wolas,quoting,at,cong.admin.news.the court has also stated that it is not our role to second guess how congress has balanced these sometimes competing policies in different provisions of the code.see id.at whether congress has wisely balanced the sometimes conflicting policies underlying is not a question that we are authorized to decide.
while the supreme court cites to congressional records to capture the essence of the provision,we find a more complete quote from the committee report to be helpful 
a preference is a transfer that enables a creditor to receive payment of a greater percentage of his claim against the debtor than he would have received if the transfer had not been made and he had participated in the distribution of the assets of the bankrupt estate.the purpose of the preference section is.first,by permitting the trustee to avoid prebankruptcy transfers that occur within a short period before bankruptcy,creditors are discouraged from racing to the courthouse to dismember the debtor during his slide into bankruptcy.the protection thus afforded the debtor often enables him to work his way out of a difficult financial situation through cooperation with all of his creditors.second,and more important,the preference provisions facilitate the prime bankruptcy policy of equality of distribution among creditors of the debtor.any creditor that received a greater payment than others of his class is required to disgorge so that all may share equally.the operation of the preference section to deter the race of diligence of creditors to dismember the debtor before bankruptcy furthers the second goal of the preference of equality of distribution.
at,cong.admin.news.notably,this explanation of the purpose focuses on the period to deter the race of diligence of creditors to dismember the debtor before bankruptcy furthers the goal of equality of distribution.id.we require those who received a greater payment than others of his class to disgorge so that all may share equally.id.thus,it makes sense that the equality should be measured,and inequalities rectified,as of the petition date.
the new value defense as part of the preference analysis serves two underlying purposes.as we stated in new york city shoes,first,the section is designed to encourage trade creditors to continue dealing with troubled businesses second,it is designed to treat fairly a creditor who has replenished the estate after having received a preference.at emphasis omitted quoting in re almarc.appellant mischaracterizes the objective of c in stating that t he most relevant inquiry,and policy consideration is whether the alleged new value replenishes the estate.appellant br.at as appellee points out,appellant conflates the formula for calculating new value with the objective of the new value defense,which is to treat fairly a creditor who provides new value.new york city shoes,at.
appellant urges that if payments by a debtor are not considered in the court analysis of a creditor preference liability,the creditor will receive a windfall and will be unjustly favored over other creditors.see appellant br.at.appellant argues that the debtor estate is not replenished when the debtor makes a transfer to the creditor after the petition date,and that the creditor unfairly receives double payment,once,and once indirectly as an offset against its preference liability to the estate.id.at.appellant cites a number of cases in support of this proposition.see,in re acquisition,llc,at allowing both new value credit and payment of a b claim elevates the claim of that creditor and results in double payment to that creditor.login,at t he policy behind the new value exception that the estate be replenished by the new value would be defeated if a creditor were allowed to keep a preferential payment of its debt on account of a new value contribution to the estate and also receive repayment of that contribution.in re mmr holding,at stating that without considering transfers on account of new value in calculating new value offset,the transferee would be receiving double use of the new value once as consideration for the unavoidable transfer which effects a reduction,and once as an offset to the prior preference which would also reflect a reduction.
however,this replenishment argument misses the mark.first,it is clear that even if a creditor is paid for new value it provided,the creditor still replenished the debtor estate during the preference period,and therefore aided the debtor in avoiding bankruptcy to whatever extent possible.in re commissary operations,at t he possibility that a debtor may pay a creditor b claim does not negate the value represented by the claim that the creditor provided to the debtor.the deliveries benefit the estate regardless of whether the b claimants are paid at a later date for those deliveries.second,appellant reference to a creditor double dipping is misleading because it implies that the creditor is receiving payment for goods or services that were never provided,or that the creditor is being paid twice.by examining appellant argument in the factual context of the instant case,it becomes clear why the argument fails.here,the creditor provided services on credit during the preference period.after the debtor bankruptcy petition was filed,the trustee paid the creditor some of the money owed,pursuant to the wage order.all of the money the creditor received was for goods and services actually provided.the creditor,therefore,was never unjustly enriched as appellant seems to suggest.
appellant also urges that cutting off preference analysis at the petition date results in unequal treatment of creditors.indeed,a number of courts have followed this line of reasoning in finding that events should enter into preference liability calculations.see,in re acquisition,llc,at the policy consideration equal treatment of creditors weighs heavily in favor of denying new value credit for allowed and paid b claims.one bankruptcy court in the district of new mexico,presented with the exact question before us,came to this conclusion by applying different rules regarding the treatment of payments to a hypothetical preference recovery scenario and then adopting the rule that resulted in the most equal treatment of creditors.furr supermarkets,at.in furr supermarkets,the bankruptcy court decided that treating events as relevant to c defenses would result in absolutely equal treatment of all unsecured claims and therefore was in accord with the policies underlying the code.the court reasoned that a creditor who is repaid for new value should be treated identically to a creditor who is repaid.
if it is a rule in bankruptcy that all creditors must be treated equally,surely the exceptions swallow the rule.it could be said that some creditors are treated more equally than others.there are special provisions for aircraft leases and shopping center leases,and some claims are given priority over others.the balancing of interests in,for instance,wage orders,has been held to justify the type of unequal treatment condemned in cases that would include the payment in the preference analysis.see,in re primary health,holding payments pursuant to court order allowing debtor to pay employee wages and benefits to be out of reach of.inequality per se is not to be avoided indeed,reasoned and justified inequality sometimes prevails,usually based on what is in the best interest of the estate for this reason,the courts positing that the interpretation that results in absolutely equal treatment of all unsecured claims is the most reasonable interpretation of section c,furr supermarkets,at,are misguided.
moreover,we submit that the cases ruling that payments should be counted so as to achieve replenishment and equality have lost sight of the real policy objectives as noted above.nowhere is the goal or rationale of replenishment set forth.nor is equality as such to be achieved.rather,if a creditor has been preferred,he must disgorge so that all may share equally.at.in other words,it is all about deterring the race of diligence,and setting things straight,before bankruptcy.as the eighth circuit court of appeals noted 
the general avoidance portion of the bankruptcy code was intended to facilitate the prime bankruptcy policy of equality of distribution among creditors of the debtor.nevertheless,the subsequent advance rule,section c,was not enacted to ensure equitable treatment of creditors,but rather is intended to encourage creditors to deal with troubled businesses.
in re bellanca aircraft,at citations omitted.
in addition,we have held that the policy underlying is that of equal distribution among similarly situated creditors.in re first jersey,cir emphasis added.as we noted above,the bankruptcy code does not give equal treatment to the claims of all creditors,but rather carves out special treatment for creditors or claims of certain kinds.for example,b claimants,ostensibly similar to general unsecured creditors,are af
