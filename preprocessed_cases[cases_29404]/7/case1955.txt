this appeal presents the question of whether the requirements in b for commencing an involuntary bankruptcy petition are elements of subject matter jurisdiction.we granted rehearing en banc to reexamine the issue.after review and en banc briefing,we conclude that b requirements are not subject matter jurisdictional in nature and therefore can be waived.
background 
trusted net bankruptcy 
in this bankruptcy case,appellant trusted net media holdings,llc trusted net is the debtor and appellee the morrison agency,morrison is one of trusted net creditors.on april,morrison filed an involuntary bankruptcy petition against trusted net,requesting liquidation of trusted net assets pursuant to chapter of the bankruptcy code.morrison petition listed morrison as the only petitioning creditor of trusted net,and described morrison claim against trusted net as trade in an amount n ot less than.
morrison involuntary petition stated that morrison was eligible to file this petition pursuant to b.as detailed below,b permits the commencement of an involuntary bankruptcy case against a debtor by three or more creditors holding,undisputed claims against that debtor,or by a single holder of a,undisputed claim if there are fewer than twelve such creditors of the debtor.b.at the time morrison filed its involuntary petition against trusted net,b also required that the petitioning creditors,undisputed claims against the debtor aggregate at least.see b 
trusted net,whose assets were at that time under the control of a receiver,filed no response to the involuntary petition.thus,the bankruptcy court entered an order for relief on may,and appointed a chapter trustee.the trustee marshaled trusted net assets in preparation for liquidation.the bankruptcy case proceeded through administration for two years.
trusted net motion to dismiss 
in april,david huffman,an officer and controlling member of trusted net,filed a motion to dismiss the bankruptcy case,arguing that the involuntary petition failed to satisfy b and that failure divested the bankruptcy court of subject matter jurisdiction.huffman was a creditor of trusted net as to his deferred salary.huffman motion to dismiss argued,among other things,that morrison petition violated b in two ways morrison claim against trusted net was subject to a bona fide dispute,and therefore morrison did not hold a,undisputed claim against the debtor and morrison petition was insufficient because trusted net had twelve or more creditors holding,undisputed claims.the chapter trustee opposed the motion.after a hearing,the bankruptcy court denied huffman motion to dismiss on may.no appeal was taken from the bankruptcy court denial of huffman motion to dismiss.
another two years later,in april,five of trusted net creditors,including morrison but not including huffman,settled with the trustee as to the amount of their respective claims.huffman objected to the settlement of the claims of three of the creditors,including morrison.on july,the bankruptcy court overruled huffman objections and approved the settlements.
shortly thereafter,and more than four years after commencement of the bankruptcy case,trusted net through counsel retained at huffman behest filed a motion to dismiss the entire bankruptcy case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.similar to huffman motion two years earlier,trusted net argued that b requirements must be met for the bankruptcy court to have subject matter jurisdiction,and that morrison petition violated b because at the time of the involuntary petition,morrison was not the holder of a,undisputed claim,and morrison involuntary chapter petition was not joined by three holders of,undisputed claims.
on october,the bankruptcy court denied trusted net motion to dismiss.as to trusted net jurisdiction argument,the bankruptcy court concluded that b of the bankruptcy code was not jurisdictional and that any argument by the debtor that the petitioning creditor claims are the subject of a bona fide dispute or that more than one petitioning creditor was required to put this debtor into bankruptcy has been waived.
trusted net appeal 
trusted net appealed the bankruptcy court ruling to the district court.the district court affirmed,finding the bankruptcy court order to be thorough,and correct in every respect.trusted net appealed to this court 
ii.discussion 
in this appeal,trusted net does not contest the bankruptcy court finding that trusted net,through its delay,waived its b arguments that morrison claims are subject to bona fide dispute and that three or more petitioning creditors were required,assuming the requirements are nonjurisdictional.rather,trusted net raises a single jurisdictional issue whether b requirements for involuntary bankruptcy petitions must be met to give the bankruptcy court subject matter jurisdiction.we first set forth the statutory framework for bankruptcy court jurisdiction and the commencement of involuntary bankruptcy cases.next,we discuss the circuit split on the issue.we then explain why b requirements are not subject matter jurisdictional.
statutory scheme 
congress established the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy courts in title.kontrick ryan,d.section of title provides that the district courts shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction of all cases under title the bankruptcy code,and original but not exclusive jurisdiction of all civil proceedings arising under title,or arising in or related to cases under title.a b.
section of title provides that the bankruptcy courts are a unit of the district court.id.pursuant to a,e ach district court may provide that any or all cases under title the bankruptcy code and any or all proceedings arising under title or arising in or related to a case under title shall be referred to the bankruptcy judges for the district.id.a.section b then provides that bankruptcy courts may hear and determine all cases under title and all core proceedings arising under title,or arising in a case under title,referred under subsection a of this section,and may enter appropriate orders and judgments,subject to appellate review by the district court.id.b thus,bankruptcy court jurisdiction exists,by reference from the district courts,in three categories of proceedings those that arise under title,those that arise in cases under title,and those related to cases under title.cont l bank of miami sanchez in re toledo,cir citation omitted see also eastman kodak atlanta retail,in re atlanta retail,cir,cert.denied,d.
in turn,title,the bankruptcy code,contains nine chapters.chapter governs liquidation and is the substantive chapter operative in this case.chapter,entitled case administration,contains b,the procedural statute at issue chapter has four subchapters,including subchapter i,entitled commencement of a case.see.sections and of subchapter i concern the commencement of,respectively,voluntary bankruptcy cases and joint cases filed by a debtor and his or her spouse.see id.section of subchapter i,at issue here,addresses the commencement of involuntary cases.see id.
although bankruptcy cases often are commenced on the debtor own initiative,section of the bankruptcy code allows creditors in some instances to hale a debtor into bankruptcy court by filing an involuntary petition.william norton,william norton iii,norton bankruptcy law practice ed.section a provides that a n involuntary case may be commenced only under chapter or of this title,and only against a person that may be a debtor under the chapter under which such case is commenced.a.section b,the subsection with which we are primarily concerned,sets forth the prerequisites for commencing an involuntary petition,specifically who is qualified to do so,as follows 
an involuntary case against a person is commenced by the filing with the bankruptcy court of a petition under chapter or of this title 
by three or more entities,each of which is either a holder of a claim against such person that is not contingent as to liability or the subject of a bona fide dispute,or an indenture trustee representing such a holder,if such claims aggregate at least more than the value of any lien on property of the debtor securing such claims held by the holders of such claims or 
if there are fewer than such holders,excluding any employee or insider of such person and any transferee of a transfer that is voidable under section,or a of this title,by one or more of such holders that hold in the aggregate at least of such claims 
id.b emphasis added footnotes omitted 
once the involuntary petition has been filed,h provides that i f the petition is not timely controverted,the court shall order relief against the debtor in an involuntary case under the chapter under which the petition was filed.id.h moreover,c states that after the filing of an involuntary petition,other creditors with,unsecured claims may join in the petition as if they were original petitioning creditors,as follows 
after the filing of a petition under this section but before the case is dismissed or relief is ordered,a creditor holding an unsecured claim that is not contingent,other than a creditor filing under subsection b of this section,may join in the petition with the same effect as if such joining creditor were a petitioning creditor under subsection b of this section.
circuit split 
as mentioned above,the circuit courts are split on whether the requirements of b must be satisfied to convey subject matter jurisdiction over an involuntary case upon the bankruptcy court or whether,instead,they are merely substantive matters which must be proved or waived for petitioning creditors to prevail in involuntary proceedings.rubin belo broad.in re rubin,cir.in other words,do the commencement requirements of b in title address the jurisdictional power of the court to hear an involuntary case,or does title contain the jurisdictional grant and do b requirements simply constitute elements that must be established to sustain an involuntary proceeding 
the ninth circuit concluded that both the bona fide dispute and requirements of b can be waived and are not subject matter jurisdictional.see id.at mason integrity ins.in re mason,cir.the ninth circuit reasoned that the bankruptcy court is vested with general power under title to exercise jurisdiction of all cases under title,as well as exclusive jurisdiction of all the property of debtors in such cases.rubin,at quotation marks and citation omitted.thus,the ninth circuit determined that p etitioning creditors can not prevail unless they show that their claims are not subject to bona fide disputes,but the bankruptcy court is not without jurisdiction prior to this determination.id.
most other courts to consider the issue likewise have concluded that b filing requirements are not subject matter jurisdictional.see,dunlop tire rubber earl tire,in re earl tire,in re saunders,in re marketxt holdings,in re coppertone commc ns,in re alta title.but see in re paczesny,in re onyx,in re first energy leasing,in re new mexico.
the leading commentators agree.see alan resnick henry sommer,collier on bankruptcy ed.the better argument is that the requirement of b can be waived,which suggests that it is not a jurisdictional requirement.william norton,william norton iii,norton bankruptcy law practice ed.like the requirement,the requirement of b is not jurisdictional,but goes to the merits.if the point is contested,petitioners can not prevail unless they show that their claims are not subject to bona fide dispute,but the bankruptcy court is not without jurisdiction prior to the determination.
the second circuit,on the other hand,concluded that b requirements are subject matter jurisdictional.key mech.bdc llc in re bdc llc,cir.it reasoned that w hether an alleged debtor is properly before the bankruptcy court in an involuntary case is a threshold determination that should be made at the earliest possible stage of the proceedings.id.the bona fide dispute requirement of b,as a prerequisite to bringing an involuntary position,is such a threshold determination.id.thus,the second circuit stated,the requirement that a petitioning creditor claim not be subject to a bona fide dispute is both an element of the condition upon which a controverted order for relief may be entered and a necessary prerequisite for the bankruptcy court jurisdiction.id.quotation marks and citations omitted.
both parties here also cite our precedent in all media properties,best in re all media properties,cir.unit a may,aff g,but disagree on whether all media actually and squarely determined that b requirements are subject matter jurisdictional because this court sitting en banc is not bound by prior decisions of a panel of this court or its predecessor,see powell barrett,cir en banc,we need not revisit all media.instead,we reach our own conclusions as to the proper interpretation of b.
to determine whether b requirements are jurisdictional,we must consider the distinction between two sometimes confused or conflated concepts subject matter jurisdiction over a controversy and the essential ingredients of a federal claim for relief.arbaugh y h,d.subject matter jurisdiction involves the court power to hear a case and therefore can never be forfeited or waived.id.at.at citation omitted.indeed,courts have an independent obligation to determine whether jurisdiction exists,even if no party raises the issue,and if the court determines that subject matter jurisdiction is lacking,it must dismiss the entire case.id.but,the failure of a cause of action does not automatically produce a failure of jurisdiction.steel citizens for a better env t,d.to implicate subject matter jurisdiction,a statutory requirement must speak not just to the parties substantive rights,but also to a particular court power.rockwell int l united states,d.
only congress may determine a lower federal court jurisdiction.kontrick ryan,d.therefore,the supreme court has instructed that courts should look to whether congress has included jurisdictional language in the statute in question,stating 
if the legislature clearly states that a threshold limitation on a statute scope shall count as jurisdictional,then courts and litigants will be duly instructed and will not be left to wrestle with the issue.but when congress does not rank a statutory limitation on coverage as jurisdictional,courts should treat the restriction as nonjurisdictional in character.
arbaugh,at.at emphasis added citations and footnote omitted.the supreme court has called this a readily administrable bright line test.id.at.at.
applying this test in arbaugh,the supreme court concluded that title vii requirement that an employer have fifteen or more employees was not subject matter jurisdictional,but instead related only to the substantive adequacy of a title vii plaintiff claim and thus could not be raised for the first time.id.at.at.in so concluding,the supreme court relied on these points the threshold does not speak in jurisdictional terms or refer in any way to the jurisdiction of the district courts title vii has an express jurisdictional provision,which is in a different part of the statute from the requirement nothing in title vii statutory language suggests congress intended courts to assure themselves sua sponte that the requirement was met and interpreting the requirement to be subject matter jurisdictional,and thus permitting with this provision to upset a prior judgment on the merits,would cause unfairness and waste of judicial resources.id.at.at brackets omitted.
under this standard,we conclude that the language of b does not evince a congressional intent to implicate the bankruptcy courts subject matter jurisdiction.as in arbaugh,the statute does not speak in jurisdictional terms.id.at.at.section b contains no explicit reference to its requirements being jurisdictional in nature and never uses the word jurisdiction.instead,it merely states that an involuntary bankruptcy case is commenced against a person by the filing with the bankruptcy court of a petition under chapter or that meets certain requirements.b.
