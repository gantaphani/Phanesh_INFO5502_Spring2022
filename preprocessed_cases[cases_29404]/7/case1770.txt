we are presented in this case with a question of first impression does the doctrine of laches apply to nondischargeability complaints brought under a b and federal rule of bankruptcy procedure b when unscheduled creditor david selinger sought a determination of the dischargeability of his state court default judgment against chapter debtor thomas beaty,the bankruptcy court granted summary judgment in beaty favor based on his affirmative defense of laches.on appeal,the bankruptcy appellate panel bap reversed on the ground that laches is never available as an affirmative defense in a a b action.for the reasons discussed below,we disagree with the bap holding that laches is never available.however,because beaty is unable to establish the elements of a laches defense in this case,we hold that the bap was correct in reversing the grant of summary judgment in his favor.
the relevant facts are not in dispute.in september,thomas and nancy beaty filed a chapter bankruptcy petition.nine months earlier,in january,david selinger had filed a complaint in a california state court against a real estate development company and does,alleging,inter alia,fraudulent concealment with malice.at the time selinger filed his action,he and the beatys did not know each other.unaware that they had any connection to selinger or his lawsuit,the beatys did not list selinger as a creditor on their bankruptcy schedules.in january,the bankruptcy court granted the beatys a discharge.
in march,selinger substituted thomas beaty beaty for one of the unnamed does in his state court action.on june,after beaty had been served the summons,complaint and substitution order,and after beaty had failed to appear and answer,the state court entered a default judgment against him.the judgment stated that beaty conduct in injuring selinger had been fraudulent,willful,malicious,and in conscious disregard of selinger rights.the court awarded general damages and specified that punitive damages would be determined at a later date.on june,in response to a state court order that he appear at a judgment debtor examination,beaty filed a notice of injunction against further proceedings,to which he attached a copy of his bankruptcy discharge.the notice stated that t he effect of this discharge of debtor is equivalent to an automatic injunction against creditors from commencing or continuing any lawsuit or enforcement of any judgment.nothing further occurred in the state court action.
one year later,on august,selinger filed a pro se adversary proceeding seeking to revoke the beatys discharge under.in june,the bankruptcy court granted summary judgment to the beatys in that action.it later denied selinger motion for reconsideration.the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court dismissal in april.
in april,just over six years after the beatys discharge was issued and just shy of five years after beaty filed the notice that informed selinger of beaty discharged status,selinger,again acting pro se,filed a second bankruptcy complaint against beaty.this complaint,the subject of the present appeal,alleged that the default judgment was nondischargeable under a,and.the complaint noted that selinger was not listed as a creditor in beaty petition,received no notice that the case would be closed,and had no knowledge of the case until after the discharge,and therefore could not have made a timely filing of proof of claim or request for determination of dischargeability.in his briefing to us,and to the courts below,selinger suggested that he filed this second complaint when he did because a month earlier,the united states supreme court,in cohen de la cruz,d,had held that punitive damages are not dischargeable in bankruptcy.his complaint sought a declaration that the default judgment debt was nondischargeable under a b a modification of the discharge order to allow continued prosecution of the state court action for a determination of punitive damages and a ruling that any future award of punitive damages would be nondischargeable.
in september,the bankruptcy court granted a motion by beaty to dismiss selinger a b complaint on a ground not relevant here.in march,the bap reversed and remanded.on remand,beaty answered the complaint.the answer admitted that selinger was an unscheduled creditor who had no knowledge of the bankruptcy proceeding in time to file a timely nondischargeability complaint,and asserted laches as an affirmative defense.beaty argued that selinger had formal notice of the discharge no later than june and that his delay in bringing the nondischargeability action was unreasonable and prejudicial.he noted that selinger had lost an earlier action objecting to the beatys discharge and that the present a b action was brought only after selinger learned of a change in the law that might benefit him.
beaty moved for summary judgment based on laches.selinger moved for summary judgment based on issue preclusion and moved to strike portions of beaty answer,including the portion containing his laches defense.the bankruptcy court granted beaty motion,denied selinger motions,and dismissed selinger complaint with prejudice.the court noted that laches has long been recognized as a means to protect a party from unreasonable,prejudicial delay and is an equitable defense available when properly pled.it held that selinger was guilty of laches by failing to bring a section nondischargeability complaint for over five years after first learning beaty had filed bankruptcy.it stated 
here,selinger delay is inexcusable and was done for tactical reasons.the plaintiff expressed an intent to await a change in the law with regard to dischargeability of punitive damages and to see what would happen with this action in which he objected to beaty discharge.prejudice to the defendant is obvious based upon these facts,and the court rules that the debtor is entitled to a fresh start at this late date,having received his discharge in.
selinger appealed to the bap,which reversed in part and remanded in a published opinion.in re beaty.the majority of the panel held that the equitable doctrine of laches is never a valid defense in a a b adversary proceeding to except from discharge a debt that the debtor failed to schedule in time to permit the timely filing of a nondischargeability complaint.the panel majority emphasized that federal rule of bankruptcy procedure b provides that a a b complaint may be filed at any time.it wrote that,w hile we may agree that selinger failure to act more promptly is questionable,we are not at liberty to rewrite the plain language of the code or the rules a laches defense to the filing of a a b complaint is in conflict with rule b and therefore is inappropriate.id.at.the majority reasoned that,because a debtor is also allowed to bring an action to determine the dischargeability of a debt himself,see fed.a,debtors like beaty need not wait for creditors to bring such actions,and are therefore able to avert any prejudicial delay.see in re beaty,at.
one bap panel member concurred in the result,but wrote separately to object to the majority conclusion that laches could never apply to a a b action.in his view,there is a potential role for the laches defense in such actions,and t he majority attempt to use the instant appeal,in which laches was incorrectly applied,as the occasion to banish laches from a b risks throwing out the baby with the bath water.id.at klein,concurring.this panel member would have held that laches is available in such actions as a general matter,but would have found that the bankruptcy court abused its discretion in finding laches in this case because selinger was diligent,beaty was not prejudiced by being unfairly deprived of the ability to defend this particular a b action,and any arguable prejudice was the result of beaty attempt to bamboozle selinger by erroneously stating in the notice of injunction that the discharge barred enforcement of any judgment.id.at.
beaty timely appealed the judgment of the bap.

where laches is available as a potential defense,our case law has been less than clear as to the appropriate standard of review of a lower court decision that laches applies in a particular case.a number of opinions have acknowledged the confusion on the issue but have not resolved it.see,jarrow formulas,nutrition now,cir holding that the district court application of the laches factors is entitled to deference,not to be reviewed de novo,but declining to resolve conflict as to whether the abuse of discretion or clear error standard applies danjaq,llc sony,cir declining to address question of proper standard and concluding result would be the same under either clear error or abuse of discretion review apache survival coalition united states,cir we review a district court application of laches for abuse of discretion or clear error.telink,united states,cir holding that review is for abuse of discretion and noting that,while prior panels had used the clearly erroneous standard,f or purposes of this appeal,any distinction that may exist between the two standards is immaterial jackson axton,cir noting t his court has reviewed a grant of summary judgment on grounds of laches both de novo and for abuse of discretion and declining to resolve the conflict because w e would affirm the district court regardless of the standard,rev on other grounds by fogerty fantasy,d.
we here clarify that the appropriate standard of review of a determination of whether laches applies in a particular case is abuse of discretion.this standard,which comports with the equitable nature of the laches doctrine,has been suggested by the supreme court and is used by our sister circuits.see,burnett new york cent,d whether laches bars an action in a given case depends upon the circumstances of that case and is a question primarily addressed to the discretion of the trial court.internal quotations omitted kansas city power light,cir the determination of whether laches applies in the present case was a matter within the sound discretion of the district court,and we,accordingly,review the district court application of laches for an abuse of discretion.city of wyandotte consol.rail,cir sanders dooly county,cir holmes pension plan of bethlehem steel,cir as an equitable doctrine,the decision to apply laches is left to the sound discretion of the district court.consequently,appellate review of a lower court application of the doctrine is limited to a review for abuse of discretion.internal quotations and citations omitted.

the initial question is whether laches is available as an affirmative defense at all in a b cases.this is a question of law.section a b provides for the exception from discharge of certain notably,for purposes of this case,debts involving fraud on the part of the those debts were not listed by the debtor in the schedule of creditors.the bankruptcy code and rules treat these debts differently from debts of the same sort that have been properly scheduled.specifically,a b creates a nondischargeability action for defrauded creditors who were neither listed nor scheduled and had no notice or actual knowledge of the case in time to permit the timely filing of a proof of claim or a timely request for a determination of dischargeability.section c,which provides for the possible exception from discharge of the same kinds of debts in cases of creditors who did receive timely notice is subject to a time limit under rule c.that rule provides that a creditor has days from the first date set for the creditors meeting in which to file the nondischargeability complaint.by contrast,rule b,which governs the timing of the commencement of a b complaints by unscheduled creditors,reads a complaint other than under c may be filed at any time.
the question before us is whether a b,as implemented by rule b,allows the equitable doctrine of laches as a defense.our analysis begins with a recognition of two fundamental tenets of bankruptcy law.the first is the long recognized principle that a chief purpose of the bankruptcy laws is to secure a prompt and effectual administration and settlement of the estate of all bankrupts within a limited period.katchen landy,d citation omitted.the second is the understanding that a bankruptcy court is a court of equity and should invoke equitable principles and doctrines,refusing to do so only where their application would be inconsistent with the bankruptcy code.in re myrvang,cir citing sec united states realty improvement.see also katchen,at.noting bankruptcy courts are essentially courts of equity.these two principles combine to create a presumption that the equitable doctrine of laches,which has as its goal the prevention of prejudicial delay in the bringing of a proceeding,is a relevant and necessary doctrine in the bankruptcy context.
the bap held that the at any time language of rule b overcomes that presumption and removes any equitable limitation on the commencement of a a b action.that holding has some support.for example,the patent and trademark office has consistently held that section of the lanham act,which provides that a cancellation action premised on genericism,abandonment or fraudulent procurement may be brought at any time,precludes a laches defense to such actions.see marshak treadwell,cir citing cases so holding.before congress imposed a statute of limitations on the time for bringing a habeas corpus action,it was understood that the statute providing that a motion to vacate a sentence may be made at any time rendered the doctrine of laches inapplicable.see heflin united states,d stewart,concurring.a few other cases have similarly interpreted at any time language in other statutes.see,sooner fed.sav.loan ass smoot,in re marriage of leslie.
however,the few cases directly reaching this conclusion do so with virtually no analysis as to why such language would eliminate the application of the equitable doctrine,instead simply assuming that the absence of a time limitation also results in the absence of a laches limitation.see sooner,at leslie,at.further,the at any time language in all of these cases is contained in a statute,rather than in a procedural rule implementing a statute.
the bap majority relied heavily on judge concurrence in in re beezley,cir,but that concurrence did not address the question of the applicability of laches to a a b action.rather,it addressed the question of whether a debtor should have to show his good faith in omitting a particular debt from a bankruptcy schedule before the discharge of an omitted debt could be recognized in a a action.see id.at,concurring.requiring such a showing interposes an equitable barrier between the debtor and his discharge that congress simply did not enact in the bankruptcy code,and c ourts are not free to condition the relief congress has made available in the bankruptcy code on factors congress has deliberately excluded from consideration.id.at.but judge concurrence never purported to speak broadly about the applicability of equitable doctrines to a b cases.indeed,he cited very specific legislative history expressly disapproving the equitable notion of debtor good faith.id.at.
in re lyman,the one bankruptcy opinion that the bap considered to have dealt squarely with the issue of the applicability of laches in a b actions,gave no hint as to why the at any time language in rule b should eliminate the laches defense in those actions.the district court in that case provided only the conclusory statement that a debtor who fails to list a creditor loses the jurisdictional and time limit protections of section c and rule c,and t herefore,debtor argument that the complaint should be dismissed pursuant to laches is without merit.id.at emphasis added.in in re santiago,also cited by the bap in this case,the court addressed only the statutory time limitation applicable to a b actions,expressly declining to render any opinion as to whether laches might impose a time limit in these cases.id.at.
for a number of reasons,we hold that laches is available as a defense in a a b action.first,an examination of other bankruptcy actions that are without time limitations reveals that congress nevertheless intended laches to act as a constraint in those actions.for example,a chapter debtor may move to reopen his case and bring a lien avoidance action at any time,and creditors are protected by a laches concept from having to face actions by debtors who prejudicially delay bringing such actions further,in both the chapter and the chapter bankruptcy contexts,courts have recognized that,while the failure to give a creditor notice of the bar date precludes the court from denying the creditor claim for failing to file it before that date,laches may nonetheless bar such a claim if there is unreasonable,prejudicial delay though none of these examples provides a perfect parallel to a b complaints,the application of laches in these contexts demonstrates that bankruptcy actions that may be brought at any time are not per se excluded from application of laches.
second,the at any time language is not found in a b of the code itself.rather,it is found in bankruptcy rule b,which was adopted pursuant to the rules enabling act.like a federal rule of civil procedure,a bankruptcy rule can not create an exception to the bankruptcy code,and it can not abridge,enlarge,or modify any substantive right.in re jastrem,cir quoting b and.we should therefore be extremely reluctant to find in rule b the abolition of the doctrine of laches if a b otherwise would allow it.consistent with the limitation imposed by the rules enabling act,other bankruptcy rules have been read to allow laches,even when those rules provide no time limitation.for example,rule regarding motions to reopen bankruptcy cases does not require that a motion be filed within a certain time period and rule provides that the limitation of rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure does not apply to these motions.but courts have recognized that the motion must be filed within a reasonable time and that laches may apply to a motion to reopen.lawrence king,collier on bankruptcy at ed id.at citing legislative history referencing intent for laches to apply.
third,laches is not a doctrine concerned solely with timing.rather,it is primarily concerned with prejudice.there is thus nothing inherently contradictory about saying that an action that may be brought at any time is nonetheless subject to an equitable limitation based on prejudicial delay.see couveau am.airlines,cir to establish laches a defendant must prove both an unreasonable delay by the plaintiff and prejudice to itself.apache survival coalition,at to establish the defense of laches,a party must show prejudice caused by the opposing party lack of diligence in pursuing its claim.this fact is implicitly recognized in the doctrine that a claim may be barred by laches even if the statute of limitations for the claim has not expired.see jackson,at noting s tatutes of limitations bar claims only upon the passage of time laches bars claims because prejudice would otherwise result to the defendant see also wells united states steel carnegie pension fund,cir noting laches may ripen within a time that is short of the applicable period of limitations maksym loesch,cir noting that,because laches focuses on harm caused by delay,the fact that a plaintiff sued a defendant within the statutory period does not defeat the defense of laches.analogizing to this rule of law,the fact that a creditor has time remaining on his statutory clock indeed,an infinite amount of time,if the clock is set at at any time says nothing about whether his right to bring his action might be limited by laches.in the words of the concurring member of the bap panel in this case,the authorization in rule b for filing such an action at any time does not forbid a court from applying laches in appropriate circumstances in other words,the phrase at any time does not mean at any time no matter what and no matter how inequitable.in re beaty,at klein,concurring.
fourth,it is not hard to imagine a case in which the absence of a laches defense would lead to injustice.it seems highly unlikely that congress intended that a debtor who innocently neglected to schedule a creditor be vulnerable to an ostensible creditor who learned of the bankruptcy case soon after discharge but waited many years for a key witness to die before bringing his a b action.while it is true,as the bap majority noted,that the debtor could avoid such a surprise by seeking a declaration as to the debt dischargeability himself,in some cases such as the one just described the debtor would not know to do so.further,it is nearly always the case that a defendant who invokes laches could have brought an earlier declaratory judgment action against the plaintiff,see,but common sense and a concern for judicial economy prevent this from acting as a bar to a laches defense in other contexts.we see no reason why laches should not be available in bankruptcy when it is available elsewhere.
we note that the question of the application of laches to a b actions would be unusual,in that the at any time language of rule b comes into play only in the specific case of a debtor failure to schedule a creditor.as all of the creditors seeking to bring such actions have,by definition,already been disadvantaged by the debtor failure to schedule them,they might argue that the bankruptcy policy of promptness is forfeited by virtue of the debtor omission,and that laches should be per se unavailable to such a debtor.however,because,as discussed above,laches addresses more than timing,this aspect of a b actions does not necessarily render an application of laches inconsistent with the bankruptcy code.in re myrvang,at.at most,it might warrant more careful consideration of how rather than whether laches is applied.
that is,a concern that the debtor might himself have behaved inequitably is best addressed,not by declaring laches unavailable in all a b cases,but rather by emphasizing the equitable nature of the doctrine in its application in particular cases.i t is hornbook law that one seeking equity must do equity,and that debtors who have unclean hands may not invoke laches.white boston.one could say that every debtor who failed to schedule a creditor had thereby behaved inequitably if that were so,it might rightly be said that laches should be uniformly unavailable to debtors in a b actions.but debtors also omit creditors innocently,inadvertently and in good faith.indeed,by all indications,that is what occurred here,for,as recounted above,thomas beaty was s
