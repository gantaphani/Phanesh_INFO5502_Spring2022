the issue on appeal is whether a debtor in bankruptcy can recover,as damages,attorneys fees for defending against a creditor appeal of a finding that the creditor violated the automatic stay.the bankruptcy code provides that an individual injured by any willful violation of a stay shall recover actual damages,including costs and attorneys fees.k.we recently held that a debtor attorneys fees for work on an adversary proceeding seeking damages for a stay violation were not actual damages under.sternberg johnston,cir.in sternberg,we stated that the proven injury is the injury resulting from the stay violation itself.once the violation has ended,any fees the debtor incurs after that point in pursuit of a damage award would not be to compensate for actual damages under k.id.at.
in this case,we are asked to apply k to a set of facts different than that addressed in sternberg.unlike in sternberg,where a debtor filed an adversary proceeding in pursuit of damages,the debtor in this case is seeking attorneys fees incurred in defense of america servicing company asc appeal of the bankruptcy court determination that asc had violated the automatic stay.because the attorneys fees at issue in this case were incurred for a different purpose than those in sternberg,sternberg does not prohibit the awarding of the attorneys fees at issue here.moreover,following the reasoning in sternberg,the fees at issue in this case fall within the meaning of actual damages in k.therefore,we affirm the bankruptcy appellate panel bap and grant schwartz tallard request for an award of attorneys fees.
asc serviced a mortgage on schwartz tallard home.on march,schwartz tallard filed for chapter bankruptcy,but continued to make mortgage payments.asc believed schwartz tallard had fallen behind on her payments,and moved for relief from the automatic stay to foreclose on the property.on april,following asc motion,the bankruptcy court lifted the automatic stay.schwartz tallard moved to reinstate the stay and the bankruptcy court orally granted the motion on may.asc did not appear at the hearing.on may,asc caused schwartz tallard home to be sold at a trustee sale.it was not until june,after the property had been sold that the bankruptcy court entered the written order reinstating the stay.
on june,schwartz tallard filed a motion asserting that asc had violated the automatic stay in her chapter bankruptcy,and seeking sanctions.schwartz tallard presented evidence that she was current on her mortgage payments through march,but that asc returned her april payment with a letter stating that her loan was in foreclosure.schwartz tallard also established that when the bankruptcy court reinstated the stay,she sent asc the payments for april and may,and enclosed a letter notifying asc of the stay reinstatement.inexplicably,asc rejected the payments,still asserting that the property was in foreclosure.
on february,the bankruptcy court ruled that asc had violated the stay and awarded schwartz tallard damages,including attorneys fees and punitive damages.the bankruptcy court ordered that the property be put back into schwartz tallard name within two days of the order by february.on march,asc appealed that order to the united states district court for the district of nevada.the next day,on march,asc reconveyed the property to schwartz tallard,thereby,according to asc,remedying the stay violation.on appeal,the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court finding that asc had violated the stay,and largely affirmed the bankruptcy court damages award 
schwartz tallard then moved to recover the attorneys fees incurred in litigating asc appeal to the district court.these are the fees at issue in this appeal.the bankruptcy court denied the motion,and schwartz tallard appealed to the bap.the bap held that schwartz tallard attorneys fees for defending asc appeal were actual damages under k.asc now appeals.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review the bap conclusions of law and statutory construction de novo,meaning we independently review the decision of the bankruptcy court.in re su,cir.
the bankruptcy code provides that an individual injured by any willful violation of a stay shall recover actual damages,including costs and attorneys fees.k.however,in sternberg we held that not all attorneys fees associated with a stay violation are recoverable under k.
in sternberg,the debtor in bankruptcy sought to have a state court hold the debtor in contempt for of spousal support.at.the state court was aware of the debtor bankruptcy and had not yet resolved the issue of whether the contempt proceedings violated the stay.nonetheless,the state court entered an order holding the debtor in violation of the divorce decree,and granting a specific monetary judgment for the debtor.id.at.the debtor sought relief from the order in two ways by filing a motion asking the bankruptcy court to vacate the state court order,and by initiating an adversary proceeding against his and her counsel for not acting to remedy the state court order.id.the bankruptcy court granted the debtor motion and vacated the state court order.id.at.the adversary proceeding later went to trial in the bankruptcy court to determine whether the debtor and her counsel had violated the stay,and,if so,the appropriate damages.id.the bankruptcy court ruled in favor of the debtor and her counsel the debtor appealed the district court reversed and found that the and her counsel had violated the stay.id.on remand,the bankruptcy court awarded damages,and the debtor counsel appealed the damages award.id.
in sternberg,we reviewed the damages award and held that the debtor could not recover attorneys fees incurred prosecuting the adversary proceeding under k.id.at.we stated that the proven injury is the injury resulting from the stay violation itself.once the violation has ended,any fees the debtor incurs after that point in pursuit of a damage award would not be to compensate for actual damages under k.id.at.the outcome,we held,was consistent with the financial and purposes of the stay.id.the financial purpose of the stay,as we explained,is to give the debtor time to put his finances back in order,allowing creditors to be satisfied to the extent possible and preventing creditors from pursuing their own remedies at each other expense.id.at.the stay is meant to help the debtor deal with his bankruptcy for the benefit of himself and his creditors alike.we have never said the stay should aid the debtor in pursuing his creditors,even those creditors who violate the stay.the stay is a shield,not a sword.id.the goal of the stay is to create a breathing spell for the debtor,and we reasoned that more litigation was not consistent with that end.id.therefore,we concluded that a damages action for a stay violation is akin to an ordinary damages action,for which attorney fees are not available under the american rule.id.
the sternberg decision overruled prior bap precedent holding that actual damages under k were meant to return the debtor to the position the debtor was in before the stay violation,and that the attorneys fees and costs incurred in prosecuting an adversary proceeding arising from a violation of the automatic stay are recoverable.id.at,citing beard walsh in re walsh,havelock taxel in re pace,vacated in part on other grounds by cir 
the issue here is whether the attorneys fees schwartz tallard seeks relate to her enforcing the automatic stay and remedying the stay violation,sternberg,at,or whether they are more akin to prosecuting an adversary proceeding in pursuit of a claim for damages.schwartz tallard defense of asc appeal differs fundamentally from the independent damages action in sternberg.here,asc appealed not only the damages award,but also the bankruptcy court determination that the stay had been violated.in re schwartz tallard,cir schwartz tallard was required to defend the bankruptcy court decision,not only to protect the award of damages,but also to uphold the bankruptcy court determination that asc had,indeed,violated the stay.sternberg specifically held that any fees a debtor incurs in pursuit of a damage award are not covered.at emphasis added.but here,the debtor was not pursuing a damage award she had already been awarded damages for the breach of the stay.she was,however,remedying the stay violation,within the meaning of sternberg.id.at.but for asc appeal,schwartz tallard litigation of this matter would have been complete.finally,even though the property was reconveyed to schwartz tallard before the parties litigated the appeal,the appeal put both schwartz tallard damages award as well as the finding that the stay had been violated in jeopardy.as the bap noted,schwartz tallard was forced to defend the appeal to validate the bankruptcy court ruling that asc had violated the stay,and to preserve her right to collect the damages awarded by the bankruptcy court.in re schwartz tallard,at.in other words,unlike in sternberg,schwartz tallard was not using the stay as a sword,but as a shield from stay violation.sternberg,at.
because we hold that sternberg does not apply to a situation where a debtor defends herself when a creditor who had violated the automatic stay appeals that finding,schwartz tallard is entitled to recover her attorneys fees as actual damages under k.the plain language of the statute includes attorneys fees in the definition of actual damages,and in the absence of sternberg limitations,there is no reason to contort that language to avoid this result.as we said in sternberg,without a doubt,congress intended k to permit recovery as damages fees incurred to prevent violation of the automatic stay.at.where,as here,the debtor is defending an appeal that seeks to eliminate the finding that the stay was violated,we hold that the fees incurred defending such an appeal meet that congressional purpose and are included in k definition of actual damages.
our decision here is consistent with both the financial and purposes of the automatic stay that we emphasized in sternberg.as to the financial purpose of preserving a debtor resources for creditors,asc appeal compelled schwartz tallard to spend money on litigation that would otherwise have been available to creditors.awarding her attorneys fees under k eliminates this problem.as to the goal of allowing the debtor time to reorganize her finances,we noted in sternberg that m ore litigation is hardly consistent with the concept of a breathing spell.at.here,unlike in sternberg,the additional litigation resulted from asc continued attempts to justify its behavior not from the debtor conduct.awarding schwartz tallard fees as damages under k furthers the goal of the automatic stay it should act to deter stay violators from continuing to disturb the breathing spell the stay aims to create 
iii.conclusion 
because the debtor was not pursuing a damages award,but rather defending asc appeal of a previous finding of stay violation and thereby remedying the stay violation,sternberg,at,sternberg does not prohibit the awarding of attorneys fees at issue here.the decision of the bap,which reversed and remanded the bankruptcy court decision denying schwartz tallard request for an award of attorneys fees,is 
i dissent.our decision in sternberg,properly read,controls this case and requires reversal.however,even if it did not control,we should still reverse.
although these errors are significant,they solely affect the outcome of this case.more troubling is the bap decision to rely upon one of its own cases,notwithstanding the fact that we had previously rejected the statement of law at issue.the implications of such cavalier disregard by the bap for its subordinate status within the federal judiciary are,and merit much greater attention than the majority bestows on them.
america servicing company asc violated the automatic stay in schwartz tallard chapter bankruptcy case.the bankruptcy court issued an order awarding schwartz tallard damages for asc willful violation.asc then returned schwartz tallard property,but appealed from that order on procedural grounds to the district court.the district court mostly affirmed the damages award.schwartz tallard now seeks to recover the attorneys fees she expended in defending the bankruptcy court judgment in that appeal.not convincing the bankruptcy court of her attorneys fees position,she chose to appeal,this time to the bap,which ruled in her favor.in re schwartz tallard,cir.asc appeals from the bap.
this case is governed by k,which allows an individual injured by any willful violation of the automatic stay to recover actual damages,including costs and attorneys fees the bap held under section k that schwartz tallard was entitled to the attorneys fees she paid defending against asc appeal.schwartz tallard,at.first,the bap attempted to distinguish this case from our decision in sternberg johnston,where we rejected the argument that actual damages under section k cover attorneys fees expended for the prosecution of an adversary proceeding to recover damages suffered from a violation of the automatic stay,cir.the bap concluded that the defense of an opposing party appeal is fundamentally different from the affirmative damages action filed by the debtor in sternberg.schwartz tallard,at.unlike in sternberg,said the bap,schwartz tallard was not using the automatic stay as a sword to pursue damages from asc.id.
after attempting to distinguish this case from sternberg,the bap held that schwartz tallard is entitled to her attorneys fees,because her defense of the appeal was consistent with the goals of the automatic stay identified by the court in sternberg,and asc appeal deprive d schwartz tallard of the benefits of her automatic stay,so her defense of the bankruptcy court decision was an extension of her efforts to enforce her automatic stay.id.the bap suggested that schwartz tallard was entitled to attorneys fees because asc stay violation was not remedied until asc lost its appeal.id.at of course,in sternberg,the point at which the stay violation had been remedied was clear in contrast,here,while the property was finally reconveyed to schwartz tallard the day after asc filed its notice of appeal,schwartz tallard was forced to defend that appeal to validate the bankruptcy court ruling.the bap also relied on its prior decision of in re walsh,where it held that c learly,fees and costs experienced by an injured party in resisting the stay violator appeal are part of the damages resulting directly from the stay violation,quoting in re walsh,cir.
the majority now affirms the bap position.the basic structure of the majority opinion is the same as that of the bap.first,the majority attempts to distinguish sternberg.the majority states that we specifically held in that case that any fees a debtor incurs in pursuit of a damage award are not covered by section k.majority op.at emphasis in original.here,however,the majority asserts that schwartz tallard was not pursuing a damage award,was remedying the stay violation,and was not using the stay as a sword.majority op.at.the majority then explains why,in its view,schwartz tallard is entitled to attorneys fees it believes awarding these fees is consistent with the plain language of section k,and in the absence of sternberg limitations,awarding those fees is consistent with both the financial and purposes of the automatic stay that we emphasized in sternberg.id.at.
the majority errs in several respects,but the most significant of its mistakes is its failure to recognize that sternberg controls this case.the majority characterizes the holding of sternberg as any fees a debtor incurs in pursuit of a damage award are not covered as actual damages under section k.majority op.at,quoting sternberg,at emphasis in original.but that is not the holding of sternberg.had the majority correctly applied the actual holding,the majority would have reversed the bap.
in sternberg,we interpreted k,which allows an individual injured by a willful violation of the automatic stay actual damages,including costs and attorneys fees.we stated that the text of the statute did not define actual damages,which we considered an ambiguous phrase.id.in order to define the term,we turned to black law dictionary,which defines actual damages as an amount awarded to compensate for a proven injury or loss,quoting black law dictionary ed.the next sentence is the holding of sternberg the proven injury and thus,actual damages under section k is the injury resulting from the stay violation itself.id.we later made clear that under our precedent the automatic stay is designed to effect an immediate freeze of the status quo.id.at,quoting hillis motors,hawaii auto.dealers ass n,cir.
in this case,the parties were returned to the status quo when schwartz tallard received her property back from asc.that occurred either on the date when the court ordered the property reconveyed,february,or when asc actually reconveyed the property,march.see,in re dawson,cir stating that california rescission law empowers a court to undo a transaction and restore the parties to the status quo ante.that is precisely what the bankruptcy court did here the court undid the foreclosure and thereby placed the parties in the positions they occupied before the stay violation.once the status quo was,the violation of the stay ended.id.if schwartz tallard proven injury is the injury resulting from the stay violation itself,sternberg,at,she can only recover damages suffered before the status quo was by the reconveyance of her property.
the majority confuses this simple and correct analysis.the majority ignores the dictionary definition that underlies our holding in sternberg,and proceeds to misinterpret the next sentence of our decision.majority op.at.in that sentence,we stated that o nce the violation has ended,any fees the debtor incurs after that point in pursuit of a damage award would not be to compensate for actual damages under k.at.the majority contorts this statement by emphasizing the phrase pursuit of a damage award.the majority distinguishes that pursuit from defense of a damages award.majority op.at.the majority argues that if not for asc appeal,schwartz tallard litigation of this matter would have been complete.id.citing the bap,the majority also states that schwartz tallard was forced to defend the appeal to validate the bankruptcy court ruling,and thus schwartz tallard was not using the stay as a sword.id.at.
contrary to the majority,the discussion of the pursuit of a damage award is not the specific h olding of sternberg,which is more properly characterized as i have stated above actual damages is an amount awarded to compensate for proven injury,which in turn is the injury resulting from the stay violation itself.at.in addition,the correct interpretation of the sternberg sentence the majority focuses on compounds its error once the violation of the automatic stay has ended,by march,at the latest any fees the debtor incurs after that point in pursuit of a damage award would not be to compensate for actual damages under k.id.that should end the discussion and we should reverse.
a closer analysis of the facts here serves to illustrate further the majority error.in asc appeal initiated on march,asc did not attempt to reclaim schwartz tallard property,so even if the district court vacated the damages award or held that asc had not violated the automatic stay,schwartz tallard would not have to convey the property to asc.instead,asc argued that the february,order awarding schwartz tallard damages for the stay violation was procedurally and legally improper.whether or not schwartz tallard defended the appeal,she would have kept her property,maintaining the status quo from before asc violated the automatic stay.asc appeal could not disrupt the proper status quo thus schwartz tallard was not remedying the stay violation,majority op.at,which had already been remedied and could not have been disturbed by asc appeal.
it is true that if schwartz tallard had not defended the appeal,she would have lost the damages properly awarded to her for asc violation of the automatic stay.but the same was true in sternberg had johnston,the debtor in that case,not sued the violators of the automatic stay in an adversary proceeding,he may not have ever received the damages award owed him.the adversary proceeding he filed was,just as the bap stated in this case,an extension of his efforts to enforce his automatic stay.schwartz tallard,at.nonetheless,we held in sternberg that a party can only recover actual damages,even though it could be said he is not made whole as a result.at.
our sternberg statement that the automatic stay is a shield,not a sword,id.at,does not change our holding denying damages to a party once it has been returned to the status quo,even if it has to take legal action to recover or defend damages properly owed.under the logic of the majority opinion,it is impossible to understand how the statutory text of section k,which governs both this case and sternberg,requires a bankruptcy court to award attorneys fees to schwartz tallard,but bars a bankruptcy court from awarding attorneys fees to johnston.it simply does not follow.
sternberg controls this appeal.our disposition should be quite simple under our holding in that case.schwartz tallard was entitled to actual damages for asc violation of the automatic stay.the violation of the stay ended when the status quo was when schwartz tallard took back her property,which was march,at the latest.any attorneys fees schwartz tallard paid after that date are not an amount awarded to compensate for proven injury or loss,because the fees did not result from the stay violation itself.sternberg,at.i would reverse the bap because of its misinterpretation of sternberg.
but strangely enough,even if the majority is correct that sternberg is not controlling,we should still reverse the bap.if sternberg does not control,then there is no ninth circuit precedent governing this appeal,and thus there must be an independent legal basis to award schwartz tallard the attorneys fees she seeks.the bap apparently realized this and sought such an independent basis in its own precedent of in re walsh,cir.schwartz tallard,at.the majority can not take refuge in walsh,as it has correctly abandoned the bap improper reliance on that decision because we overruled it in sternberg.majority op.at.of course,we all agree the bap improperly relied on walsh.but the legal sources on which the majority does rely are also not sufficient to grant schwartz tallard attorneys fees.
if sternberg does not control,although i would hold it does,the majority then must independently address whether to award schwartz tallard attorneys fees for her defense of the appeal from the bankruptcy court.we must start with the statute here,we must interpret the statute that allows an individual injured by any willful violation of a stay to recover actual damages,including costs and attorneys fees k.
as we recognized in sternberg,even though the statute specifically allows an individual injured by a stay violation to recover damages that include attorneys fees,congress legislates against the backdrop of the american rule,whereby parties are to bear their own attorney fees.at,citing fogerty fantasy.because of that backdrop,we can only grant attorneys fees when congress uses explicit statutory language.id.at.we require explicit language in a statute to award attorneys fees to a party even if the statute does explicitly award attorneys fees to another class of litigants.id.at suggesting that explicit statutory language is required to award attorneys fees for litigation attenuated from the actual bankruptcy hardisty astrue,cir a statute that creates an exception to the american rule for a single circumstance does not extend to other related situations,and i n the absence of clear statutory text authorizing,we decline to become a roving authority awarding attorneys fees citation omitted.
in this case,therefore,the majority must decide whether to award attorneys fees to schwartz tallard even though this award is not explicitly addressed in section k.such a bold departure from traditional practice usually requires explicit statutory language and legislative comment.fogerty,at see also fulfillment,united parcel,cir explaining that h ad congress aspired to such a radical departure from the american rule,it no doubt would have so indicated with explicit language to that effect.
legislative history that is at best ambiguous is clearly insufficient to alter the accepted meaning of the statutory term,p articularly in view of the american rule that attorney fees will not be awarded absent explicit statutory authority.buckhannon bd.care home.dep t of health human resources,accord kwai fun wong beebe,cir en banc holding that legislative history can not supply a clear statement.in other areas where we require an unequivocal express ion of legislative intent,we do not generally allow inferences from statutory purpose to constitute that unequivocal expression.see,alaska,cir.indeed,we have specifically held that when a party seeking attorneys fees argues that the purpose of a statute supports awarding attorneys fees,we will not award attorneys fees if the cited statutory purpose reduces to competing policy arguments,because s uch a debate is not enough to overcome the absence of statutory text authorizing supersession of the american rule.hardisty,at.
the majority first claims that the plain language of section k includes attorneys fees in the definition of actual damages,and states that there is no reason to contort that language to avoid awarding attorneys fees.majority op.at.though the majority is correct that the text of section k allows attorneys fees as part of actual damages,it incorrectly concludes that this supports its holding.the question in this appeal is whether these attorneys fees are actual damages.the plain language of the statute does not state that attorneys fees expended after the status quo is and thus the violation of the automatic stay is rectified are recoverable as actual damages.as we have recognized,if the plain text of a statute creates an exception to the american rule,we do not expand that text to award attorneys fees in a related circumstance not explicitly covered by the statute.id.at see also sternberg,at refusing to award attorneys fees for litigation attenuated from the actual bankruptcy even though section k specifically authorizes some attorneys fees.there is not explicit statutory language in section k to support the majority conclusion.fogerty,at.
the majority only other legal basis for awarding these attorneys fees is that the fees incurred defending an appeal meet the congressional purpose behind section k in that its decision here is consistent with both the financial and purposes of the automatic stay that we emphasized in sternberg.majority op.at.this inference from legislative purpose can never be explicit statutory language and legislative comment,fogerty,at,and is thus insufficient to demonstrate congressional intent to deviate from the american rule.alaska,at.
indeed,the majority wrongly concludes that allowing schwartz tallard to collect the attorneys fees is consistent with both the financial and purposes of the automatic stay that we emphasized in sternberg.majority op.at.
allowing attorneys fees would not further the financial goals of the automatic stay recognized in sternberg.asc was a creditor of schwartz tallard.we have never said the stay should aid the debtor in pursuing his creditors,even those creditors who violate the stay.sternberg,at.if schwartz tallard had not defended asc appeal,she would never have been able to recover the damages her creditor owed her,but the stay is a shield,not a sword.id.the economic purpose of the stay,to give schwartz tallard time to put her finances back in order,would not be served if she were encouraged to continue to retrieve money from her creditor.
nor does awarding attorneys fees further the noneconomic purpose of the stay recognized in sternberg.more litigation is hardly consistent with the concept of a breathing spell.id.by defending against asc appeal,schwartz tallard only created more litigation attenuated from the actual bankruptcy.id.
i understand that my suggestion that schwartz tallard could have simply not defended asc appeal may seem unfair,but it is perfectly consistent with the breathing spell inherent in the automatic stay.it is also consistent with our recognition that the american rule disfavors granting attorneys fees even though it could be said the debtor is not made whole as a result.id.at.
thus,i do not believe the supposed purposes of the automatic stay divined by the majority clearly weigh in favor of schwartz tallard.like many disputes over statutory purposes,the majority argument and what it calls sternberg policy analysis,majority op.at,at most confronts us with competing policy arguments,which are not enough to overcome the background american rule that each party bears its own costs.hardisty,at.thus,even if sternberg does not control the outcome of this case,i would still reverse the bap because there is no explicit statutory language and legislative comment authorizing a departure from the traditional practice that schwartz tallard should bear her own attorneys fees.fogerty,at.
although the majority errs in affirming the bap,the majority is correct in its footnote to deem the bap reliance on the decision in walsh improper.majority op.at.i agree with the majority on this point for a fundamental reason the bap can not rely upon any of its own precedent that we have overruled without creating serious constitutional problems.
the constitution vests the judicial power of the united states in the supreme court and inferior courts.const.art.iii.the federal judges subject to article iii hold their offices during good behavior,which means they have lifetime tenure unless impeached,and their compensation shall not be diminished during their continuance in office.id.
congress has the power to create certain other federal tribunals under its constitutionally delegated powers found in article i.one type of federal tribunal acts as an adjunct to the article iii federal courts,a term used by the supreme court to describe the role of certain administrative agencies and the magistrate courts.pipeline constr.marathon pipe line,plurality,describing crowell benson,administrative agencies and united states raddatz,magistrate courts.for instance,the magistrate courts are subject to the article iii district courts in the district in which they are located.t he district court has plenary discretion whether to authorize a magistrate to hold an evidentiary hearing,and the magistrate acts subsidiary to and only in aid of the district court,so that the entire process takes place under the district court total control and jurisdiction.raddatz,at.
but congress does not have plenary authority to create federal tribunals.congress can not grant jurisdiction over cases that are rightfully within the judicial power of the united states described in article iii to an article i tribunal without violating the constitution and its separation of powers principle.pipeline,at plurality.likewise,if congress vests essential attributes of the judicial power to an article i adjunct that is not subject to searching review by an article iii court and that can issue binding and enforceable final judgments,the enacting law also violates the constitution.id.at plurality.
under the bankruptcy reform act of,congress dramatically altered the existing bankruptcy system to modernize the bankruptcy laws,at.congress replaced the bankruptcy referees from the bankruptcy act of with bankruptcy judges with far more power to resolve bankruptcy disputes.id.at.the reform act also authorized the judicial councils of the circuits to order the chief judge of the circuit to designate panels of three bankruptcy judges to hear appeals from judgments,orders,and decrees of each bankruptcy court,title ii,adding.these bankruptcy appellate panels,composed of bankruptcy judges,had jurisdiction of appeals from all final judgments,orders,and decrees of bankruptcy courts,as well as interlocutory judgments,orders,and decrees,if the panel granted leave,title ii,adding.under the act,if a judicial council of a circuit authorized a bap,all appeals from decisions of bankruptcy judges had to be heard by that bap,unless all parties stipulated to have the appeal taken to the court of appeals.thomas carlson,the case for bankruptcy appellate panels.only the judicial councils of the first and ninth circuits authorized the b
