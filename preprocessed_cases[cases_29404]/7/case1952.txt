the issues in this appeal are whether a debtor claims for legal relief that arose after the confirmation but before the completion of his plan to pay creditors are property of the estate,under chapter of the bankruptcy code,see a,and whether the bankruptcy court abused its discretion by requiring the debtor to amend his schedule of assets to disclose proceeds of any settlement of those claims,see fed.michael and barbara waldron appeal the judgment that waldron claims for benefits are property of the waldrons bankruptcy estate and the waldrons must disclose any settlement of those claims by an amendment of their schedule of assets.because the plain text of section a establishes that waldron claims are property of the estate and the bankruptcy court has the discretion to require an amendment of the debtors schedule of assets,under federal rule of bankruptcy procedure,we affirm.
background 
the waldrons filed a petition for relief under chapter,and byron meredith became the trustee of the bankruptcy estate.on november,the bankruptcy court confirmed the waldrons plan to pay their creditors.that plan required the waldrons to pay the trustee a month.
waldron suffered personal injuries in an automobile collision on may,before the waldrons had completed their payments under the plan.the bankruptcy court approved both the settlement of waldron claim against the other driver for and the disbursement of that amount to the waldrons as part of their exempt property.waldron also pursued claims for benefits against georgia farm bureau and selective insurance company.the waldrons moved the bankruptcy court for the authority to settle those claims without further approval by the court.the waldrons argued that any proceeds of a settlement would not be property of the estate.
the bankruptcy court ruled that waldron remaining claims were property of the estate and any settlement must be disclosed by an amendment of the debtors schedule of assets and administered in the bankruptcy proceeding.the district court affirmed.

iii.discussion 
we divide our discussion into two sections.first,we address whether waldron claims for benefits are property of the estate.second,we address whether the bankruptcy court abused its discretion when it required the waldrons to amend their schedules of assets to disclose any settlement of waldron claims.
a.waldron claims are property of the estate.
sections a and b of the code define property of the estate in a proceeding under chapter.section a,on the one hand,expansively defines property of the estate to include all property acquired by the debtor after a case commences and until it ends or is converted 
property of the estate includes,in addition to the property specified in section of this title 
all property of the kind specified in such section that the debtor acquires after the commencement of the case but before the case is closed,dismissed,or converted to a case under chapter,or of this title,whichever occurs first and 
earnings from services performed by the debtor after the commencement of the case but before the case is closed,dismissed,or converted to a case under chapter,or of this title,whichever occurs first.
a.section b,on the other hand,returns some property of the estate to the debtor upon confirmation of the plan except as otherwise provided in the plan or the order confirming the plan,the confirmation of a plan vests all of the property of the estate in the debtor.id.b.
the question presented is whether waldron claims for benefits,which arose after confirmation of the waldrons plan to pay their creditors,are property of the estate under section a or whether those claims are vested in waldron under section b.the waldrons argue that,upon confirmation,all of the property of the bankruptcy estate revested in the waldrons by operation of section b and waldron claims,which are not part of the waldrons plan,did not become property of the estate.the trustee responds that waldron claims are property of the estate under section a.
we conclude,based on the plain language of section a,that waldron claims are property of the estate.waldron acquired his claims for benefits after the commencement of the waldrons bankruptcy case but before their case was dismissed,closed,or converted.section a does not mention the confirmation of the debtor plan as an event relevant to what assets are property of the estate,see sec.bank neiman,cir,and section b does not address assets acquired after confirmation.section b does not,as the waldrons argue,automatically vest in the debtor assets acquired after confirmation.if congress had intended for confirmation to so dramatically affect the expansive definition of property of the estate found in section,it knew how to draft such a provision.id.at quoting riddle aneiro in re aneiro,internal quotation marks omitted.
our analysis is not,as the waldrons argue,governed by the estate transformation approach that we adopted in telfair first union mortgage,cir.we adopted that approach to resolve the tension between sections a and b regarding property interests that existed at confirmation 
we read the two sections,a and b,to mean simply that while the filing of the petition for bankruptcy places all the property of the debtor in the control of the bankruptcy court,the plan upon confirmation returns so much of that property to the debtor control as is not necessary to the fulfillment of the plan.
id.at quoting black postal serv.in re heath,cir.the debtor in telfair sought to avoid liability for costs incurred in the collection of mortgage payments owed by the debtor outside his plan.the debtor argued that the mortgage payments were property of the estate protected by the automatic stay and could not be applied to pay the collection costs of the mortgagee,but the obligation to make those payments existed at confirmation and had been disclosed to the bankruptcy court,which allowed the payments to occur outside the debtor plan.the debtor assets used to make those mortgage payments were vested in the debtor at confirmation.
we did not address in telfair entirely new property interests acquired by the debtor after confirmation and unencumbered by any preexisting obligation.we instead stated that confirmation returns so much of that property to the debtor,and that property referred to the property of the debtor placed in the control of the bankruptcy court when the debtor filed his petition.id.new assets that a debtor acquires unexpectedly after confirmation by definition do not exist at confirmation and can not be returned to him then.
we are not alone in our reading of sections a and b.the first circuit also has concluded that assets acquired after confirmation are property of the estate.barbosa soloman,cir.after their chapter plan was confirmed,the debtors in barbosa sold their investment property for a price greater than the value stated in their initial schedules of assets.id.at.the trustee then moved to modify the plan to increase the debtors payments to the unsecured creditors.id.at.the first circuit agreed with the argument of the trustee that,after confirmation,the estate continues to be funded by the debtors regular income and assets as specified in section a.id.at.the court reasoned that this approach harmonizes two apparent inconsistent sections,a and b allows for meaningful plan modification under section and is consistent with the policy underlying chapter.id.numerous district and bankruptcy courts have reached the same conclusion.see,united states harchar,postconfirmation tax refund woodard taco bueno,wl,at,postconfirmation claim for employment discrimination in re drew,proceeds of a mortgage refinancing completed postconfirmation in re pitts,at,life insurance proceeds acquired postconfirmation in re grogg,same in r
