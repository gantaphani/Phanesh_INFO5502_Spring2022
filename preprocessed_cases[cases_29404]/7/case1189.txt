bankruptcy trustee daniel hoseman appeals the entry of judgment in favor of debtor sidney weinschneider.the trustee contends that weinschneider claim for of the profits of burton,asserted by weinschneider in a lawsuit against the company and its principals,is rightfully part of the bankruptcy estate,and the trustee brought this declaratory judgment action to settle the issue.weinschneider argues that his claim against burton is not part of the bankruptcy estate and,even if it is,the trustee signed a waiver of claims against weinschneider as well as a covenant not to sue after the trustee had knowledge of weinschneider lawsuit.because we find that the trustee has waived any right to bring this suit by executing a valid release of claims against weinschneider,we affirm the district court judgment in favor of weinschneider.
sidney weinschneider has been in the business of operating nursing homes since.during the late,he had acquired an interest in four nursing homes in illinois,but by,those homes were experiencing financial and regulatory difficulties.by march,home savings,weinschneider mortgagee,had foreclosed on the mortgages of the four nursing homes then owned by weinschneider,eventually taking over their operation.because of weinschneider experience in operating nursing homes,home savings proposed at some point in that he put together a management team to continue running the homes.
during the summer of,weinschneider approached his friend burton behr about the possibility of managing the homes now owned by home savings.the two met in august to continue their discussions,and it was at this meeting that behr suggested that the two involve harold geiser,a cpa and friend of behr,in their management team.the three apparently met several times throughout september and october of.on september,weinschneider proposed to home savings that a new entity called burton burton,which was to be owned by weinschneider,behr,and geiser,manage the nursing homes.home savings expressed interest in working with the burton enterprise and asked if it could meet with the other members of the proposed management team.weinschneider scheduled this meeting for october.before this meeting took place,on october,weinschneider filed a chapter petition in bankruptcy court.nevertheless,the meeting between weinschneider,behr,geiser,and home savings took place as scheduled.on october,burton was incorporated.on december,burton secured the contract to manage the home savings nursing homes.
sometime in september or october exact date is the subject of weinschneider,behr,and geiser were discussing the formation of burton,the three agreed that weinschneider would own of the new entity,and would receive profits from that ownership interest if burton became the owner or lessee of the nursing homes and if those homes operated at a profit.in return for his interest,weinschneider agreed to continue his efforts to secure for burton a management agreement and purchase option with home savings,and to continue to advise behr and geiser regarding how to manage the nursing homes.the agreement that weinschneider owned of burton was memorialized in a december,letter from behr to weinschneider.
as noted above,weinschneider filed his petition for bankruptcy on october,in the midst of the activity surrounding the formation of burton.on november,weinschneider filed his statement of financial affairs,schedules of assets and liabilities,state of executory contracts with the bankruptcy court.his statement did not list any interest in burton,nor any claims he had against the company.on may,weinschneider chapter case was converted to a chapter case,and daniel hoseman was appointed trustee.
in june,the official unsecured creditors committee filed an adversary action against weinschneider and others seeking,among other things,the turnover of certain property.the trustee,on behalf of the creditors,settled this litigation in the settlement agreement was approved by the bankruptcy court in an order dated july,after proper notice was provided to all creditors.
in december,pursuant to the settlement agreement,the trustee executed a broad release and covenant not to sue.the release provided that the trustee hereby remise d,release d,and forever discharge d all claims,known or unknown,against weinschneider,his wife,and certain trusts.appellant.at.the covenant not to sue stated that the trustee would refrain from instituting,prosecuting or participating in any suit or action,at law or in equity,or to take any action to collect,enforce or recover on any claim,known or unknown,which the bankruptcy estate may,could or have against weinschneider,his wife,and certain trusts.appellant.at.pursuant to the agreement,weinschneider and others turned over one million dollars worth of property to the trustees of weinschneider and his wife estates.
in june the settlement agreement,but prior to the trustee execution of the release and covenant not to filed an amendment to his bankruptcy schedule,indicating that he held a interest in burton.the amendment stated 
debtor amends his schedule to list a acquired claim that is not property of the bankruptcy estate.this amendment is made for disclosure purposes only and does not make this claim property of the bankruptcy estate.the claim is as follows 
claim for a interest in burton and associates,based on an agreement made between debtor,burton behr and harold geiser the debtor claim for this interest is not property of the estate because the interest was acquired after the bankruptcy filing and the debtor did not have any sort of claim for such interest as of the bankruptcy filing.such claim can not be characterized as proceeds or other progeny of property of the bankruptcy estate under code a.likewise,the interest in burton was given to sidney weinschneider in exchange for his services to burton.the value of this claim is listed as unknown because it is highly speculative.debtor had made several demands to formally obtain the interest in burton.it appears that a lawsuit may have to be filed in order to enforce the above described agreement and acknowledgment.
hoseman weinschneider in re weinschneider,b,wl,at,at.a june,letter sent to the trustee in connection with this amendment did not mention any of weinschneider activities or negotiations that occurred prior to the filing of his chapter petition,but the trustee was apparently able to learn additional details about the formation and early activities of the enterprise through later communications with weinschneider attorneys.
in february,weinschneider filed an illinois state court contract action against burton,behr,and geiser seeking his share of burton profits.in december,the trustee executed the release and the covenant not to sue.on february,the trustee sued in bankruptcy court seeking a declaration that the state court lawsuit was the property of the bankruptcy estate.in response to the trustee lawsuit,weinschneider argued that his claim against burton arose after he filed for bankruptcy and was therefore not part of the bankruptcy estate.weinschneider also raised as an affirmative defense the release signed by the trustee in late weinschneider suit had been filed.both parties filed for summary judgment.
the bankruptcy court granted summary judgment in favor of the trustee on his claim that the state court suit was the property of the bankruptcy estate.the bankruptcy court denied both parties motions for summary judgment on weinschneider affirmative defense,finding disputed issues of material fact about whether weinschneider concealed his claim against burton,or whether weinschneider provided false or incomplete information in his bankruptcy filings in an attempt to mislead the trustee.after trial on the defense issue,the bankruptcy court ruled that the trustee action was not barred by the release and covenant not to sue because there was evidence that weinschneider fraudulently induced the trustee execution of the release by making false statements in his amended schedule,rendering the release void.
weinschneider appealed the bankruptcy court decision to the district court,which first held that the question of whether weinschneider claim against burton was part of the bankruptcy estate raised an issue of fact,precluding summary judgment.the district court went on,however,to find that the release and covenant not to sue signed by the trustee in were not fraudulently induced by weinschneider and that those documents,by their terms,barred the trustee suit.the court therefore entered judgment in favor of weinschneider,and the trustee brought this appeal.we affirm the judgment of the district court.

in this appeal,the trustee first argues that the district court erred in reversing the bankruptcy court determination that weinschneider claim against burton and its principals was part of the bankruptcy estate.the bankruptcy court found that weinschneider claim arose out of activities rooted in his prebankruptcy past,holding that the claim was therefore part of the bankruptcy estate.the district court disagreed,finding that,for summary judgment purposes,an issue of material fact had been raised with respect to whether weinschneider interest in burton was secured pre or.we need not consider such intricate questions of timing,however,as the second issue raised in this the release and covenant not to sue that the trustee had executed in bar this dispositive in precluding this suit by the trustee.
applicability of the release and covenant not to sue 
the first argument presented by the trustee is that this lawsuit does not fall within the scope of the release and covenant not to sue.in fact,the trustee goes to great lengths to distinguish the instant suit from one that would be covered by the literal terms of those documents.but both the release and the covenant are phrased in rather broad language.under illinois law,a release is a contract and,as such,is subject to the traditional rules of contract interpretation the intention of the parties,thus,controls the scope and effect of the release,and this intent is discerned from the release express language as well as the circumstances surrounding the agreement.doctor,duree,d,citations omitted.the express language of the release and covenant at issue here is clear and broad enough to remove any doubt as to their application to this lawsuit.the explicit language of the release covers all claims,known or unknown.the covenant not to sue obligates the trustee to decline to institute any suit or action,at law or in equity to pursue a claim against weinschneider.
the trustee argues,however,that a declaratory judgment action is neither an action at law nor a suit in equity and thus is not within the literal terms of the covenant.while this court has noted that declaratory judgment actions are neither legal nor equitable,see moretrench am.groves sons,cir,the trustee fails to consider the additional language in the covenant,precluding him from tak ing any action in pursuit of a claim against weinschneider.thus,even assuming that a declaratory judgment suit is not any suit or action,at law or in equity,we believe that the covenant well as that of the still broad enough to encompass this suit within its prohibition.
the trustee also cites chandler bank of lyons ray,a tenth circuit case,for the proposition that an in personam action against the debtor and an in rem action against the debtor property are distinguishable.cir.in that case,the creditor bank sought to enforce its lien against the property of a debtor subsequent to the debtor discharge in bankruptcy,before which the bank had taken no action in the bankruptcy proceedings to preserve its claim.id.at.the court allowed the suit to go forward despite the discharge,noting that t he bank was simply seeking to establish that its lien could be pursued by the bank.thus it was strictly an in rem action.it did not seek generally to proceed against the bankrupt in an in personam action.therefore,its in rem action on the secured claim survived the bankruptcy.id.at.in this case,the trustee argues that his suit is similarly an in rem action against weinschneider claim,not against weinschneider personally.thus,the argument goes,the applies only to actions against weinschneider,his wife,and certain trusts does not apply.
both the bankruptcy court and the district court rightly rejected this argument.the trustee complaint names weinschneider himself as defendant.the bankruptcy court noted that regardless of the trustee characterization of the suit,it does seek to affect weinschneider rights vis á vis the state court suit.as such,it is a claim against weinschneider.weinschneider,wl,at,at.the district court agreed with this reasoning,and so do we.however the trustee chooses to characterize this suit,the result will potentially alter weinschneider right to bring the claim.unlike an automobile the property at issue in chandler bank,a claim for a share of profits has no real existence apart from the ability of its owner to assert it.therefore,the trustee attempt to assert the claim on behalf of the bankruptcy estate is in reality an action against weinschneider.
formal abandonment procedure 
the trustee next argues that the release of any claim he may have had regarding weinschneider lawsuit against burton is invalid,as the claim was not relinquished pursuant to the formal abandonment procedures set forth in the bankruptcy code because the release and covenant not to sue executed by the trustee were part of a compromise settlement entered into by the trustee with bankruptcy court approval under rule of the bankruptcy code,compliance with the formal abandonment procedures was not necessary in this situation.in addition,bankruptcy trustees regularly make use of releases and waivers in administering bankruptcy estates,and such decisions do not always amount to abandonment of estate property.rather,the giving of a release in exchange for some action by the debtor in this case,the turning over of one million dollars worth of property,as part of a generally beneficial compromise settlement,may be the most efficient and fair means of administering the estate.in any event,compliance with the bankruptcy code abandonment provisions is meant to ensure the fair treatment of creditors,see morlan universal guar.life ins,cir,and we believe that those interests have been adequately protected here.
we first note that bankruptcy trustees,who have a fiduciary obligation to the claimants against the bankruptcy estate,are generally given broad discretion to determine the best way to pursue the administration of the bankruptcy estate,and equally broad discretion to decide whether a compromise may include a release of future claims or a covenant not to preferable to protracted litigation.as one bankruptcy court has noted 
the administration of bankruptcy estates has twin goals of maximization of realization on creditors claims and of prompt and efficient administration of the estate.to carry out this fiduciary duty to meet these goals,the trustee has a discretionary authority to take the actions that are necessary to accomplish them.
