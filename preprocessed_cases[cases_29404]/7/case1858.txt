it been more than four years since any federal judge had authority to hear this case.even so,the litigation grinds on.before the bankruptcy and district courts,the parties have bloodied each other in round after round of motions and arguments through year after year.they now appeal,asking us to sort out their dispute.but an order issued in december remanded this case to state court.that order divested the federal courts of subject matter jurisdiction over the parties dispute.there is nothing left of this case in federal has been for years.long ago the parties should have taken their fight to state court.they must now.
the history of this case is long and tangled,and the genesis of the parties dispute has become shrouded in years of litigation,often over collateral questions.even so,some appreciation of these twists and turns is essential to our legal analysis.
it all began nearly a decade ago when c m properties c m hired burbidge mitchell burbidge,a law firm,to defend it in a lawsuit.litigation begets litigation,of course,and c m,through its counsel,burbidge,added new parties and new claims,and the litigation multiplied.eventually,the multiplicitous matters settled when c m agreed to pay substantial sums to the other parties.but c m was not at all happy with this with its lawyers.
it was then that the real trouble began.in the fall of,c m members contemplated a dollar malpractice action against its old law firm.in the meantime,though,c m business began to crumble and,by december,the company was forced to file for bankruptcy.when it came to disclosing the company assets to its bankruptcy creditors,c m members discussed the need to reveal its potential malpractice claim against burbidge.ultimately,however,c m bankruptcy disclosures did not mention an imminent dollar suit against burbidge,but instead informed creditors that the company might have possible claims of unknown value against a variety of entities and persons,including former professionals.bankruptcy proceedings proceeded quickly,and by the end of september,a reorganization plan was approved.
three months after it emerged from bankruptcy,c m launched a million malpractice suit against burbidge in utah state court.burbidge promptly removed the dispute to the federal bankruptcy court that had overseen c m bankruptcy proceedings.once before the bankruptcy judge,burbidge presented a motion for summary judgment,arguing that c m suit should be dismissed on the basis of judicial estoppel.contending that c m well knew of its potential malpractice claim before its bankruptcy,burbidge submitted that the company deliberately chose to obscure that claim in its bankruptcy disclosures to keep its creditors in the dark about a significant potential asset to which they were entitled.in burbidge view,all this was a calculated effort by c m to keep and pursue the lawsuit for its own benefit after a successful bankruptcy discharge,rather than being forced to hand over the potential suit to company creditors during the bankruptcy process.c m should be judicially estopped from achieving this end,burbidge submitted.
in july,the bankruptcy court held that c m bankruptcy disclosures were inexcusable and most likely criminal.but,the court held,judicial estoppel was not a doctrine recognized at that time in the tenth circuit.for this reason only,the bankruptcy court declined to grant summary judgment to burbidge.naturally,burbidge sought to appeal this ruling to the district court and later petitioned for review in this court by means of a writ of mandamus.but the district court rightly noted at the time and we later agreed that the denial of summary judgment is an interlocutory matter not normally appealable.
back in front of the bankruptcy court after burbidge failed attempt at appeal and mandamus,c m filed a motion to remand the case to the state court where it had begun.in august,the bankruptcy court issued a report and recommendation to the district court agreeing with c m.the bankruptcy court recommended remand for three reasons.first,it reasoned,the district court and,by extension,bankruptcy court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the parties dispute because it was not related to c m original bankruptcy proceeding.second,even if subject matter jurisdiction existed,the court concluded,it was required to abstain from hearing the case under c.third,even if it was not mandatory for the district court to abstain,the court determined that it should exercise its discretion to do so under c and b based upon considerations of comity and equity.aplt.ap.at.as we understand it,then,the bankruptcy court recommended remand under both c,requiring the district court to remand matters over which it lacks subject matter jurisdiction,and b,pursuant to which the district court may remand a removed bankruptcy case on any equitable ground.of course,burbidge sought review of this report and recommendation before the district court.but the district court found burbidge objection untimely and,on december,entered an order fully adopting the bankruptcy court findings of fact and conclusions of law and remanding this case to state court.
one might think that the december order remanding this case to state court would have ended the parties litigation in federal court,leaving the state courts of utah to sort it out.instead,burbidge took the position that the district court remand order somehow transformed the bankruptcy court july denial of summary judgment on judicial estoppel grounds into a final judgment ripe for review.on this basis,burbidge filed an appeal with the district very same court that earlier refused to take an interlocutory appeal on this very issue and more recently remanded the entire case to state the court to review the bankruptcy court previous denial of burbidge motion for summary judgment.in burbidge view,the supreme court decision in city of waco,texas united states fid.guar,permitted the district court to review the bankruptcy judge denial of summary judgment because it was drafted prior to and was separate from the remand decision.mem.in opp.to mot.to dismiss appeal at quotation omitted.
in light of this development,the utah state court that received the parties dispute on remand put its case on hold.why,after all,proceed to the merits of a dispute that a federal court might hold estopped meanwhile,back in federal court,the district court in september reversed and remanded the bankruptcy court denial of summary judgment.the district court noted that,in the time since the bankruptcy court issued its ruling two years earlier finding that judicial estoppel was recognized by the tenth circuit,this court had issued johnson lindon city,cir,adopting the doctrine.see also eastman union pac,cir.in light of this development,the district court decided to send the estoppel question back to the bankruptcy court once again,this time for it to reconsider its previous denial of summary judgment in light of johnson.
in june,after yet another round of briefing and argument,the bankruptcy court issued a new summary judgment decision.given our decision in johnson,and taking its cue from the district court remand order,the bankruptcy court held c m claim judicially estopped,and granted summary judgment for burbidge.aplt.ap.at.the court found that c m failed to disclose the lawsuit in its bankruptcy filings,that its creditors were misled,and that c m should not be permitted to pursue an asset wrongfully denied to its creditors.
not to be outdone,c m appealed the bankruptcy court summary judgment determination to the district court still more briefing and more argument followed.eventually,in october,the district court expressed its disagreement with the bankruptcy court about the proper application of johnson and reversed its grant of summary judgment.dissatisfied,burbidge appealed to us,and merits briefing before us ensued,with each side reiterating its views of the proper application of the judicial estoppel doctrine to the facts of their dispute.
in the course of briefing this appeal,neither party has questioned either our or the district court authority to continue adjudicating this case after remand.but we must.federal courts do not wield plenary jurisdiction,and attention to our subject matter jurisdiction is not a mere nicety of legal metaphysics,but instead rests on the central principle of a free society that courts have finite bounds of authority.catholic conf.abortion rights mobilization,d.we must assure ourselves of federal subject matter jurisdiction even where,as here,both sides wish us to hear their dispute and our inability to do so would,regrettably,add delay and expense to the resolution of an already aged and costly lawsuit.
before us,the parties have proceeded on the view that they have a final order amenable to appellate review.we can not agree.pursuant to d,we can only assume jurisdiction over final orders entered by the district court.in re magic circle energy,cir.we have held that to be final and appealable,the district court order must end the litigation and leave nothing to be done except execute the judgment.id.brackets omitted.all we have in this case,however,is the district court reversal of the bankruptcy court grant of summary judgment on judicial estoppel grounds.by its own terms,the district court decision does not end the litigation on the merits,but decides only that burbidge is not yet entitled to judgment on the basis of judicial estoppel.in this,as in most cases,when summary judgment is denied or reversed,the next step is not to execute the judgment,but to hold a trial.see switzerland cheese ass n,horne,d.the district court order is therefore simply not final 
not only is the district court order not final,it borders on the spectral.everything that has transpired in bankruptcy and district court on the merits of c m malpractice since december,has taken place in the absence of any jurisdiction.once the district court remanded c m malpractice claim to state court,it and the bankruptcy court lost authority to adjudicate the claim merits,including the merits of burbidge judicial estoppel defense.c m malpractice claim resides in state court and any further litigation by the parties in federal court is beside the point,something like playing air guitar rather than the real thing,a sort of mimesis of litigation rather than an actual case or controversy.pierre schlag,spam jurisprudence,air law,and the rank anxiety of nothing happening a report on the state of the art,geo.discussing the art of the air guitar and describing some academic legal writing as air law when imitating the judicial task.it is that a remand order renders the district court without jurisdiction over remanded claims,such that any continued litigation over those claims becomes a futile thing.in re bear river drainage,cir.put differently,the parties can do no more than shadowbox in federal court the main event actually resides in state court.any district court order putatively deciding any aspect of a claim remanded to state court is but an advisory opinion,the expression of stray sentiments by a court powerless to decide anything,or,as one circuit has put it,so much hot air.daniels liberty mut.ins,cir.see also const.art.iii,kromer mcnabb,cir a remand order takes precedence and district court should not take action on pending motions before or after remand charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,fed.prac.proc,at ed.i t is clear that an order of remand to state court ends the jurisdiction of the federal court over the case.quackenbush allstate ins,d when a district court remands a case to a state court,the district court disassociates itself from the case entirely,retaining nothing of the matter on the federal court docket.christopher,cir a district court hearing merits arguments after remanding the case impermissibly intrud es into a matter properly left to the state courts.
allowing continued litigation in district court over a remanded claim risks not just a purely academic opinion about a claim really pending elsewhere,but a host of practical problems.it raises the possibility that the parties will make a mistaken guess about which forum should hear their case and needlessly devote time and resources in the wrong forum.it also leaves cases in legal limbo,partly in federal court,partly in state court,a result that does nothing to advance and much to undermine comity.our case amply illustrates these problems.the parties have spent years,enormous energy,and no doubt heaps of money trying to hash out the potentially dispositive estoppel question in a federal court that is powerless to decide it.meanwhile,the state court that actually possesses jurisdiction over their case understandably halted progress on the matter in deference to the district court claim of authority over the case,waiting patiently for years for some purely advisory signal from the federal system whether it thinks the matter should be dismissed on estoppel grounds or proceed to its merits.so it is that any real progress in this case ground to a halt long ago 
what,then,is an appellate court to do in these strange circumstances when both we and the district court lack jurisdiction to entertain the merits of the parties dispute happily,our precedent points the way,permitting us to treat this appeal as an application for a writ of mandamus,and exercise that authority not to hear the merits but to direct the district court to vacate all orders entered by it and the bankruptcy court after the remand issued on december.see state farm mut.auto.ins.scholes,cir accord christopher,at cir three j farms,alton box bd,cir.indeed,it is one of the traditional and most important offices of the writ to confine an inferior court to a lawful exercise of its prescribed jurisdiction.in re antrobus,cir quoting allied chem.daiflon,d per curiam.

the parties dispute this analysis,contending instead that the supreme court decision in city of waco authorized the district court and bankruptcy court to continue adjudicating burbidge judicial estoppel defense.they assure us that we may take jurisdiction over the merits of their appeal on the same basis.again,we can not agree.decided over years ago in a very different era,city of waco did allow the federal courts to review certain orders in remanded cases.but,by its terms,the decision does not pertain here.we first proceed to outline city of waco holding,and then explain why it bears no application to our case.
as the parties have acknowledged and even underscored,city of waco is a short and somewhat cryptic decision whose import is less than clear,particularly in light of the fact that it predates the enactment of and,modern principles of issue and claim preclusion,not to mention the adoption of the federal rules of civil procedure.see kircher putnam funds trust,d leaving open the continued vitality of city of waco in light of d osborn haley,d scalia,dissenting the continuing vitality of waco is dubious in light of more recent precedents.even so,the supreme court has not explicitly overruled city of waco and we
