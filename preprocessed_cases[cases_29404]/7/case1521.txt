paramjeet and sunita malhotra,a married couple,filed this qui tam action under the false claims act.the district court held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the act public disclosure bar applies.we are asked to decide whether a deposition taken by the office of the united states trustee triggered the bar and,if so,whether the malhotras fall within the original source exception to the bar.
in,the malhotras sought bankruptcy protection under chapter after experiencing difficulties in their real estate business.the bankruptcy court appointed robert steinberg as the trustee to administer the malhotras bankruptcy estate.from their very first meeting with steinberg,the malhotras suspected he was corrupt.they turned out to be right.
the malhotras initial meeting with steinberg took place at their home shortly after steinberg had been appointed trustee.he showed up with a real estate agent named james grace.steinberg informed the malhotras that he would be selling their home and other properties which he oddly referred to as my properties immediately and that grace would be handling the sales.this plan of action struck the malhotras as highly suspicious.they viewed liquidation of their assets particularly a sale of their personal residence as entirely unnecessary to a successful reorganization under chapter.their suspicions increased when steinberg filed an involuntary petition against a company owned by the malhotras,which had the effect of bringing additional properties under steinberg control.and they became still more suspicious when grace referred to steinberg as his partner and mentioned that he and steinberg had worked together on over cases.these red flags convinced the malhotras that steinberg was involved in some kind of scheme whereby he intended to profit personally from their bankruptcy.
their suspicions aroused,the malhotras began investigating steinberg.they reviewed thousands of pages of bankruptcy court and county assessor office records.those records revealed that steinberg,in his capacity as bankruptcy trustee,had employed grace as a real estate agent to sell bankruptcy estate property in scores of cases.when the malhotras took a closer look at some of the sales,they discovered that the properties had been sold for what the malhotras believed was less than fair value.in some instances,presumably to justify the low sales price,steinberg made representations to the bankruptcy court about the condition of the property that,upon investigation,the malhotras believed to be untrue.the malhotras also discovered what they termed straw man transactions instances in which steinberg sold bankruptcy estate property at prices to his associates,who then resold the property a short time later for a large profit.these sales led the malhotras to suspect that steinberg was receiving payment on the side for his role in orchestrating the sales.
the malhotras shared the fruits of their investigation with the office of the united states trustee,the government entity responsible for appointing steinberg as a bankruptcy trustee.the trustee office thanked the malhotras for the information and encouraged them to continue investigating steinberg,which the malhotras did.they reviewed additional bankruptcy court and county assessor office records,visited the properties involved,and interviewed witnesses.those efforts revealed additional suspicious sales involving steinberg and grace,and the malhotras shared this information with the trustee office as well.much to the malhotras frustration,however,the trustee office took no action.
that changed in may,when the trustee office received a letter from one of steinberg former employees.the letter stated that steinberg and an unnamed real estate agent had struck an agreement under which steinberg received a referral fee from the agent in exchange for hiring the agent to sell bankruptcy estate property.the letter prompted the trustee office to launch its own investigation of steinberg.the trustee office ultimately subpoenaed records from a number of real estate agencies,including grace current and former employers,which documented grace payment of referral fees to steinberg over many years.
after receiving these documents,the trustee office deposed grace under rule of the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure.for reasons of administrative convenience,the trustee office noticed grace deposition in the malhotras bankruptcy case.at the time,the malhotras case was the only one still open in which steinberg and grace had worked together while grace was employed by his firm.during the deposition,which the malhotras attended,grace admitted that steinberg would hire him as a real estate agent to sell bankruptcy estate property,and in return grace would pay a percentage of the commissions he earned to steinberg.the trustee office asked grace a handful of questions relating to the malhotras bankruptcy case,but most of the questioning focused on property sales in other bankruptcy cases.
about a year after the grace deposition,the malhotras filed this qui tam action against steinberg,grace,and others under the false claims act.the act authorizes private parties,known as relators,to bring civil actions in the name of the united states against any person who presents a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the federal government.b.the malhotras complaint alleges that steinberg presented fraudulent claims to the bankruptcy court in order to obtain payment of the trustee fee steinberg received for each bankruptcy case he administered.steinberg claims for payment were fraudulent,the malhotras allege,because to obtain payment he falsely certified that he had faithfully performed his duties as trustee.
the malhotras complaint appears to allege two different theories for why steinberg certifications were fraudulent.the first is that he failed to disclose to the bankruptcy court the referral fees he received from grace.the complaint refers to these payments as the kickback scheme.the second theory is that steinberg failed to disclose his role in orchestrating sales to his associates,who then flipped the properties a short time later and paid a share of the profits to steinberg.the complaint refers to these sales as the straw man transactions.had steinberg disclosed either form of misconduct to the court,the complaint suggests,he would not have been paid the trustee fee for each case.
defendants moved to dismiss the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.they argued that the malhotras action is barred by a provision of the false claims act known as the public disclosure bar.that provision was amended in,but at the time relevant here it provided 
no court shall have jurisdiction over an action under this section based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal,civil,or administrative hearing,in a congressional,administrative,or government accounting office report,hearing,audit,or investigation,or from the news media,unless the action is brought by the attorney general or the person bringing the action is an original source of the information.
e a footnote omitted.the statute defined original source as follows 
for purposes of this paragraph,original source means an individual who has direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based and has voluntarily provided the information to the government before filing an action under this section which is based on the information.
defendants brought a factual attack on the complaint allegations.they submitted evidence establishing that the transactions underlying the kickback scheme were disclosed during the grace deposition.defendants argued that those transactions were therefore publicly disclosed as part of an administrative investigation conducted by the trustee office,which triggered e a public disclosure bar and deprived the court of jurisdiction over the malhotras action.the malhotras did not dispute defendants framing of the issue.they made no attempt to argue that the alleged straw man transactions which were not disclosed during the grace deposition provided an independent basis for their cla
