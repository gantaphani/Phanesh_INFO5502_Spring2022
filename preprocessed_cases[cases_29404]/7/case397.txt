this appeal requires us to interpret the automatic stay provision of the bankruptcy code,an exception to that provision,and an exception to that exception.specifically,the question presented,as a matter of first impression,is whether an order obtained by the securities and exchange commission the sec from the united states district court for the southern district of new york richard owen,judge,requiring defendant robert brennan,a debtor in bankruptcy,to repatriate the assets of an offshore asset protection trust violates the automatic stay provision.the sec argues that the order fits within an exception to the automatic stay provision for any action or proceeding by a governmental unit to enforce such governmental unit police and regulatory power.b.brennan contends that the order violates the automatic stay provision because it fits within an exception to this governmental unit exception for any effort to enforce a money judgment.for the reasons stated below,we conclude that the order of the district court must be vacated.
in,the sec began an action in the district court against brennan and first jersey securities,first jersey,a discount run by brennan specializing in the underwriting,trading,and distribution of securities.the sec alleged that first jersey,at brennan direction,had defrauded its customers by inducing them to buy certain securities at excessive prices unrelated to prevailing market prices,with the result that first jersey and brennan gained more than million in illegal profits.in july,following a bench trial held the previous year,judge owen entered judgment in the sec favor the july judgment,finding that brennan and first jersey had perpetrated a massive and continuing fraud on their customers in violation of the federal securities law and ordering them,inter alia,jointly and severally to disgorge approximately million in gains and prejudgment interest.sec first jersey,aff in part rev in part,cir,cert.denied,d.on august,brennan filed a petition for chapter bankruptcy protection.
some time during the trial,before the july judgment was entered against brennan and before he filed for bankruptcy protection,brennan established an offshore asset protection trust in gibraltar,called the cardinal trust,and funded the trust with million in municipal securities brennan three adult sons and the robert brennan foundation,are the beneficiaries of the cardinal trust.nevertheless,the trust terms provide that the trustee has no obligation to make payments to these beneficiaries during the life of the trust.moreover,under the terms of the trust,the principal and accumulated interest revert to brennan after ten years or at some point thereafter as established by the trustee.notwithstanding this reversionary interest,brennan did not list the cardinal trust as property of his estate in his original bankruptcy petition.after law enforcement authorities discovered the existence of the trust,brennan amended his petition to include the trust,but he valued his interest at.
the sec alleges that,notwithstanding brennan bankruptcy and the appointment of a bankruptcy trustee in june,brennan has exercised,and continues to exercise,control over the cardinal trust.specifically,it contends that brennan has used the trust to support a lavish,globetrotting lifestyle and that he has directed efforts to keep the trust out of his creditors reach.the sec notes,in particular,that since entry of the july judgment and brennan filing for bankruptcy,the cardinal trust has been relocated twice,first from gibraltar to mauritius and then from mauritius to nevis.according to the sec,these moves were prompted by a provision in the trust indenture called a flight clause,which requires the trustee to relocate the trust upon occurrence of an event of duress,including government action in any part of the world that attempts to take control of the trust assets or any order,decree or judgment of any court which will or may in any way control,restrict or prevent the free disposal of trust property.
since,several efforts have been made to require brennan to repatriate the assets of the cardinal trust.first,in may,with the support of the sec,the bankruptcy trustee moved in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of new jersey kathryn ferguson,bankruptcy judge for an order requiring repatriation.on june,the bankruptcy court denied the application,but entered an brennan brennan from any action that might cause the transfer of assets of the cardinal trust.second,the bankruptcy trustee commenced an action in the high court of kitts and nevis,then and apparently now the situs of the cardinal trust,seeking to recover the trust assets.on july,the high court dismissed the action for failure to state a claim under nevis law.finally,in april,following a deposition of brennan taken in this action pursuant to rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure,in which brennan repeatedly invoked the fifth amendment to avoid answering questions about his relationship to the trust,the sec moved before the district court for an ex parte order to show cause why brennan should not be held in civil contempt of the july disgorgement judgment and for certain ancillary relief,including repatriation of the cardinal trust.
in its motion papers,the sec argued that relief was warranted for the following reasons 
although the united states bankruptcy court has held that the july judgment rendered by this court may not be discharged in brennan bankruptcy,brennan has not complied with the judgment,and has asserted the fifth amendment in response to all questions about his intent and ability to pay any part of it.both in anticipation of the judgment,and after its entry,he has transferred funds offshore and dissipated assets,and is now living a lavish lifestyle while refusing to disclose how he is financing it.
at the same time,the sec asserted that it is not seeking to collect the judgment now.rather,it is seeking information and the return of assets transferred by brennan so as to preserve them for the benefit of all potential claimants.during an ex parte hearing held on the record before the district court,counsel for the sec reiterated this assertion,stating that the sec was seeking to have all of the assets preserved to the extent possible so they do go moving around the world again.we are not interested in collecting ourselves.your honor,we may only be entitled to a pro rata share of this.
after hearing the sec application,the district court entered an order on april,the april,order requiring brennan to appear on april,to show cause why he should not be held in contempt of the july judgment the contempt order and directing him,inter alia,to repatriate the assets of the cardinal trust and deposit those assets in the court registry no later than april,the repatriation order the day before the deadline for repatriation of the trust,brennan filed a notice of appeal from the repatriation order and moved for a stay pending appeal.the district court denied the stay,but granted an interim stay until april,to allow brennan to seek relief in this court.thereafter,in the course of proceedings before the district court and this court,the date for compliance with the repatriation order was extended to july,and the date of the hearing on the contempt order was adjourned to august.following oral argument on august,during which counsel for brennan represented that brennan was in the process of arranging for repatriation of the cardinal trust,we filed an order nostra sponte staying all proceedings then pending before the district court,including the hearing on the contempt order,as well as that portion of the district court april,order requiring repatriation of the trust.see post at.
on appeal,brennan challenges the april,order of the district court only insofar as it requires him to repatriate the assets of the cardinal trust and place those assets in the court registry.brennan contends that this aspect of the april,order,which we refer to as the repatriation order,is invalid for any one of several reasons because it violates a,the automatic stay provision of the bankruptcy code because it violates principles of res judicata,federal comity,or international comity and because it was entered ex parte in violation of his right to due process of law.we agree with brennan first the repatriation order violates the automatic stay provision of the bankruptcy therefore do not consider his remaining arguments.

section b establishes several exceptions to the automatic stay.one of these exceptions,set forth in subsection b,is at the heart of the dispute in this case.that provision,as amended in,see,stat,provides that the filing of a bankruptcy petition 
does not operate as a stay under paragraph,or of subsection a of this section,of the commencement or continuation of an action or proceeding by a governmental unit to enforce such governmental unit police and regulatory power,including the enforcement of a judgment other than a money judgment,obtained in an action or proceeding by the governmental unit to enforce such governmental unit police or regulatory power.

although the question is a close one,we agree with brennan that the repatriation order fits within the exception to the governmental unit exception and that the order therefore violates the automatic stay.it is well established that the governmental unit exception of b permits the entry of a money judgment against a debtor so long as the proceeding in which such a judgment is entered is one to enforce the governmental unit police or regulatory power.see,nlrb iron works,cir nlrb continental hagen,cir nlrb edward cooper painting,cir eeoc rath packing,cir penn terra,at see also,at,code cong.admin.news at w here a governmental unit is attempting to fix damages for violation of laws with police or regulatory purposes,the action or proceeding is not stayed under the automatic stay.emphasis added.however,these and other cases hold that anything beyond the mere entry of a money judgment against a debtor is prohibited by the automatic stay.see,eeoc mclean trucking,cir holding that the equal employment opportunity commission suit was exempt from the automatic stay until its prayer for monetary relief is reduced to judgment emphasis added edward cooper painting,at o nce proceedings are excepted from the stay by section b,courts have allowed governmental units to fix the amount of penalties,up to and including entry of a money judgment.internal quotation marks omitted emphasis added rath packing,at see also daniel cowans et,cowans bankruptcy law and practice,at steps preparatory to money collection have been properly barred as not within the exception.as we explained in iron works,t he collection of a money judgment after entry is not authorized and requires a separate application to the bankruptcy court.at emphasis added.
the eighth circuit decision in rath packing provides a good example of the distinction between mere entry of a money judgment and proceedings beyond such entry.in that case,the equal employment opportunity commission the eeoc sued rath packing,a meat slaughterer and processor,for violations of title vii.after the eeoc filed suit,but before the district court had entered any judgment,rath packing filed a petition under chapter of the bankruptcy code.thereafter,the district court entered judgment against rath packing in the title vii action,ordering the company,inter alia,to pay in back pay plus interest.on appeal,the eighth circuit held that the eeoc action was not stayed by the automatic stay provision because it was brought pursuant to the eeoc police or regulatory power,see at,and affirmed the district court entry of a money judgment against rath packing,see id.at.however,the court of appeals drew a clear distinction between mere entry of the money judgment and other aspects of the district court ruling 
t he district court did not err in entering a money judgment against rath.the district court,however,went beyond the entry of a money judgment as permitted by b and established a detailed payment plan.the judgment not only awarded eeoc the sum of,but required rath to repay the sum in five equal installments of principal with accrued interest,with the first installment due on february.failure to meet a required installment results in acceleration of the unpaid balance at the option of eeoc.eeoc was also directed to formulate a plan for disbursement of judgment proceeds and to set up a claims system.this plan went beyond the entry of a money judgment and therefore violated a.
id.at emphasis added.the eighth circuit was unmoved by the eeoc promise that during the pendency of the bankruptcy proceedings it will not file an action against rath for contempt for failure to pay or otherwise attempt to actually obtain execution of the judgment.id.according to the court,n either eeoc promise not to collect the judgment nor the possibility that the bankruptcy court will modify the payment plan is sufficient to correct the error.id.at.
it is not,as the dissent suggests,post at,out of mere obeisance to each other side remarks,that various circuits have insisted that the line between police or regulatory power on the one hand,and enforcement of a money judgment on the other,be drawn at entry of judgment.rather,courts have drawn the line there because that is the most logical place for it.when the government seeks to impose financial liability on a party,it is plainly acting in its police or regulatory is attempting to curb certain behavior such as defrauding investors,or polluting groundwater by making the behavior that much more expensive.it is this added expense that deters a party from defrauding or the identity of the entity which it must eventually pay.accordingly,up to the moment when liability is definitively fixed by entry of judgment,the government is acting in its police or regulatory the public interest,it is burdening certain conduct so as to deter it.however,once liability is fixed and a money judgment has been entered,the government necessarily acts only to vindicate its own interest in collecting its judgment.except in an indirect and attenuated manner,it is no longer attempting to deter wrongful conduct.it is therefore no longer acting in its police or regulatory capacity,and the exception to the exception does not apply 
in the present case,it is plain that the district court went beyond the mere entry of a money judgment in entering the repatriation order since the money judgment obtained by the sec against brennan was entered in july.to be sure,the sec asserts that it is not seeking to collect the july judgment,but only to prevent brennan from concealing or dissipating the assets of the cardinal trust.in addition,the sec acknowledges that it may be entitled to no more than its pro rata share of any assets obtained.however,as the rath packing court held,the exception to the exception for enforcement of a money judgment does not depend on a governmental unit profession of good faith.see id.moreover,notwithstanding the sec assertions to the contrary,the record makes clear that the sec is seeking repatriation of the cardinal trust for the purposes of enforcing the july if it does not claim an exclusive entitlement to the trust assets.thus,for example,the sec deposed brennan pursuant to rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure,a rule which governs discovery in proceedings on and in aid of the execution of a judgment.in addition,the sec originally sought the repatriation order as ancillary relief with respect to its motion for an order to show cause why brennan should not be held in contempt of the july judgment,and justified its motion on the ground that brennan has not complied with the judgment.in short,the sec may purport not to claim an entitlement to the full cardinal trust,but it is plainly seeking through the repatriation order to satisfy at least part of the july judgment from the assets of the cardinal trust.accordingly,under the plain terms of b,the repatriation order violates the automatic stay.
we are unpersuaded by the sec arguments against application of the exception to the exception for enforcement of money judgments in this case.first,the sec places heavy reliance on the amendments to the governmental unit exception enacted by congress in.prior to those amendments,the governmental unit exception was embodied in two subsections of b,which provided that the filing of a bankruptcy petition does not operate as a stay 
under subsection a of this section,of the commencement or continuation of an action or proceeding by a governmental unit to enforce such governmental unit police or regulatory power 
under subsection a of this section,of the enforcement of a judgment,other than a money judgment,obtained in an action or proceeding by a governmental unit to enforce such governmental unit police or regulatory power 
b.the chemical weapons convention implementation act of,part of the omnibus consolidated emergency supplemental appropriations act of,amended the exception by,inter alia,combining subsections b and b into one subsection b and expanding the scope of the exception to cover proceedings to obtain possession of property of the estate or to exercise control over property of the estate otherwise stayed by a.see,stat,see also collier,supra,at to discussing the amendments 
the sec argument that these amendments are material to this case is belied by the fact that congress maintained the exception to the exception for enforcement of money judgments.the sec would have us interpret the expansion of the governmental unit exception to cover proceedings otherwise stayed by a to mean that a governmental unit has unqualified authority to seek custody of estate property outside the bankruptcy proceedings.brief of appellee at.however,this proposed exception to the exception to the exception would virtually swallow whole the exception to the exception for enforcement of money judgments.moreover,it would run contrary to the limited legislative history of the amendments,which provides in relevant part that the amendments should not be read to expand the exceptions to the automatic stay to cases where governmental units are merely seeking to exercise control of a debtor property to satisfy debt.cong.rec.statement of conyers,ranking member of the judiciary committee see also cong.rec.statement of gilman on behalf of hyde,chairman of the judiciary committee collier,supra,b,at to the addition of the introductory references to subsection a may have affected the operation of the second phrase,derived from former subsection b.thus,acts to obtain possession or exercise control over property of an estate would not be stayed.this expansion of the exception to stay should be read,however,so that the expansion covers only the enforcement of nonmoney judgments.this would be consistent with the purpose of the amendment and with the limited legislative history of the amendment.emphasis added also id.b,at despite some ambiguities introduced by the amendments,the scope of the governmental unit exception remains largely unchanged.
second,the sec argues that because it seeks only to bring the cardinal trust within the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court and claims an entitlement only to its pro rata share of the trust assets,the repatriation order is not inconsistent with congress purpose in enacting the exception to the exception for money judgments.that is,the sec argues that while the purpose of the exception to the exception for money judgments is to prevent the government from gaining preferential treatment in bankruptcy proceedings to the detriment of all other creditors,t,code cong.admin.news at,accord,at,code cong.admin.news at,its actions in seeking the repatriation order are intended to,and will,benefit all other creditors.however,nothing in the legislative history suggests,let alone shows,that the preferential treatment rationale was congress sole purpose in enacting the exception to the exception.to the contrary,the exception to the exception is also designed to reinforce the scheme of priorities set forth in and to preserve the benefits to a debtor of discharge,see collier,supra,b,at,both of which could be undermined by allowing governmental units to initiate proceedings like the present one.moreover,at bottom,the sec argument that it is not seeking preferential treatment depends on its assertion that it is not seeking to collect the july judgment.as we stated above,however,the exception to the exception for enforcement of a money judgment does not depend on a governmental unit profession of good faith.
in the final analysis,the policies behind as a whole weigh strongly in favor of applying the automatic stay in these circumstances.as noted,the general policy behind the automatic stay is to grant complete,immediate,albeit temporary relief to the debtor from creditors,and also to prevent dissipation of the debtor assets before orderly distribution to creditors can be effected.penn terra,at.in addition,the automatic stay provision is intended to allow the bankruptcy court to centralize all disputes concerning property of the debtor estate so that reorganization can proceed efficiently,unimpeded by uncoordinated proceedings in other arenas.united states lines,at internal quotation marks omitted.section b carves out a limited exception to these policies,see,cong.rec.statement of edwards noting that b is intended to be given a narrow construction accord cong.rec.statement of gilman on behalf of hyde,chairman of the judiciary committee,in order to prevent a debtor from frustrating necessary governmental functions by seeking refuge in bankruptcy court.exxon,at internal quotation marks omitted.here,however,it is undisputed that the type of relief sought by the sec is available through the bankruptcy court indeed,the bankruptcy trustee with the support of the sec tried,but failed,to obtain an order from the bankruptcy court requiring repatriation of the cardinal trust in.thus,it is hard,if not impossible,to argue that brennan is seeking refuge in bankruptcy court.id.internal quotation marks omitted.under these circumstances,therefore,to allow the sec to pursue the repatriation order in the united states district court for the southern district of new york would undermine the policies of the automatic stay provision without furthering the policies behind the governmental unit exception.
in sum,we hold that the repatriation order was entered by the district court in violation of the automatic stay provision of a.in so holding,we emphasize that nothing prevents the sec or the bankruptcy trustee who apparently supports the sec actions in this case from seeking repatriation of the cardinal trust before the united states bankruptcy court for the district of new jersey,where brennan bankruptcy proceedings are pending.understandably,the sec and the bankruptcy trustee may have believed that they could obtain a more sympathetic hearing from the district court,which presided over brennan fraud trial,than from the bankruptcy court,which is charged with responsibility for,inter alia,protecting the interests of all of brennan creditors and which denied an application by the bankruptcy trustee in may for repatriation of the cardinal trust.however,if the bankruptcy trustee and its ally,the sec,were aggrieved by the bankruptcy court ruling on the may application for repatriation,their proper recourse was to appeal that ruling to the united states district court for the district of new jersey,not to bring a new motion for the same relief in the united states district court for the southern district of new york.
the order of the district court is vacated 
the majority holding unduly restricts the government exercise of regulatory authority under of the bankruptcy code.it does so,moreover,where neither the language of the code nor the code underlying purposes require such a restriction.because i believe that the district court order in this case was proper,i respectfully dissent.
during a trial for securities fraud,robert brennan transferred assets of million to the cardinal trust,an offshore trust located in gibraltar.shortly thereafter,on july,the district court ruled that brennan had defrauded investors and ordered him to pay million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest.see sec first jersey,aff in part and rev in part sec first jersey,cir,cert.denied,d.brennan then filed for bankruptcy under title of the bankruptcy code.
in the course of the bankruptcy proceedings,and each time the trust became vulnerable,the trust was moved,first to mauritius and then to nevis.these changes occurred pursuant to a flight clause,which allows the trustee to transfer the trust to another country upon an event of duress duress is defined to include any order,decree or judgment of any court which will or may in any way control,restrict or prevent the free disposal by the trustee of any moneys,investments or property in the trust.
although brennan has contended that he has no control over the trust,when he was deposed in february pursuant to.a,he invoked his fifth amendment right against and refused to answer questions regarding his control over and access to the trust funds.such an answer in a civil proceeding permits the inference that he did control the trust moreover,the securities and exchange commission the commission has constructed a time line showing the coincidence of brennan movements with those of the cardinal trust trustee,and the communications between them which strongly suggests that brennan does indeed exercise control over it.finally,the commission points to brennan extravagant,and to the fact that his other assets are tied up in the bankruptcy proceedings,as evidence that he is dissipating the funds of the trust for his personal use.
in,the commission asked the bankruptcy court to appoint a trustee for brennan bankruptcy estate.see a allowing a bankruptcy court to appoint a trustee if such appointment is in the interest of the creditors.the bankruptcy court found that brennan had not pursu ed potentially valuable claims on behalf of the estate and was not providing adequate financial disclosure,and,therefore,appointed a trustee.in may,the trustee,in cooperation with the commission,asked the bankruptcy court to require that brennan repatriate the assets of the cardinal trust.the bankruptcy court denied this application on june.the bankruptcy trustee subsequently brought an action in the high court of kitts and nevis as the trust was then in nevis to recover the assets of the trust.but that action was dismissed for failure to state a claim under nevis law.
a year and a half later,on march,believing that brennan was about to engage in further overseas travel and that during the course of those travels he would likely transfer the assets of the trust to yet another country,the commission applied to the district court for an order directing brennan to show cause why he should not be held in contempt of the judgment in this case,and requiring him to repatriate the trust and pay its assets into the registry of the court prior to the contempt hearing the commission explained that it is not seeking to collect the judgment now.rather,it is seeking information and the return of assets transferred by brennan so as to preserve them for the benefit of all potential bankruptcy claimants.the assets were to remain in the district court registry until a determination by the bankruptcy court as to whether they were part of the bankruptcy estate and,if they were,they would continue to be held by the court below for distribution by the bankruptcy court.the bankruptcy trustee supported these efforts to repatriate the trust.
after hearing,ex parte,the commission application on april,the district court found that the commission had made a prima facie showing that brennan was in contempt of the court july,order and that the relief sought was warranted.the court therefore granted all of the commission requests and entered an order that brennan show cause why he should not be held in contempt.at the same time,it directed brennan to repatriate the assets of the trust into the registry of the court at least two days prior to an april show cause hearing.
the repatriation deadline was subsequently extended to april,and the show cause hearing to april.on april,brennan sought a stay from the district court,which that court denied.the court,however,granted an interim stay to allow brennan to seek relief in this court.accordingly,brennan moved in our court for a stay pending appeal,but his motion was denied.the district court,nevertheless,granted additional extensions,and,when brennan still did not comply with the repatriation order,it set may as the date for the contempt hearing.after brennan and his sons conveyed to the bankruptcy trustee their interests in a separate property,the repatriation deadline was once again moved,this time to july,and the contempt hearing was likewise delayed,to august.
brennan now appeals the parts of the district court order of april requiring him to show cause why he should not be held in contempt and mandating the repatriation of the cardinal trust.
the crux of the issue before us is whether the district court repatriation order constitutes the enforcement of a money judgment under b.pursuant to a,virtually all proceedings against a debtor in bankruptcy are stayed.an exception is made,however,in b,for the commencement or continuation of an action or proceeding by a governmental unit to enforce such governmental unit police and regulatory power.but this exception does not apply to governmental actions that constitute the enforcement of a money judgment.see id.
the majority,incorrectly in my view,concludes that the commission repatriation order constitutes the enforcement of a money judgment.it notes that several cases hold that anything beyond the mere entry of a money judgment against a debtor is prohibited by the automatic stay.supra at.emphasis in original.but,in fact,none of the cases that the majority cites is in any way binding on us,and only one of them can be said actually to stand for that proposition.all the others involve side remarks made in other contexts.see eeoc mclean trucking,cir addressing the question of whether the suits were brought to enforce eeoc police or regulatory power as an initial matter,not whether some eeoc action beyond entry of the judgment constituted enforcement of a money judgment quotation marks omitted nlrb edward cooper painting,cir addressing the question of whether the entry of a judgment violated the automatic stay.the only case the majority cites that actually holds that anything beyond the entry of a money judgment is automatically eighth circuit decision in eeoc rath packing,cir is,moreover,not at all apposite to the instant case.the judgment against rath packing called for the transfer of funds directly to the eeoc.and the only reassurance the court had that the eeoc would not attempt to actually obtain execution of the judgment,at,during the pendency of the bankruptcy proceedings was the eeoc own unsupported promise.here,in contrast,preventing the actual transfer of funds to the governmental creditor is in no way dependent upon the promise of the governmental unit.the trust assets,were they to be repatriated,would remain in the district court registry.moreover,the commission would have no access to them except through bankruptcy proceedings.accordingly,the majority statement that compliance with would be depend ent on a governmental unit profession of good faith supra at,is simply incorrect.this,as will be shown below,is a crucial difference between our situation and that in rath packing.
not surprisingly,the only case in our circuit cited by the majority is consistent with the above made distinction.its holding is no more than that nlrb unfair labor practice proceedings are proceedings to enforce the nlrb police or regulatory powers.nlrb avenue iron works,cir.the court passing statement that the governmental unit could not yet collect on the money judgment the court had entered was therefore dicta.but significantly,even that dicta provides no support for the majority position.i do not doubt that the collection of a judgment would in the ordinary course constitute the enforcement of a money judgment.in asking the court to seize the assets of the cardinal trust through repatriation,however,the commission in this case does not seek to satisfy,or collect on,its judgment.rather,the commission aims to have the assets brought back in order to place them at the disposal of the bankruptcy court.that in iron works,our court stated that collection would be stayed under b therefore provides no guidance as to governmental actions that,like the repatriation order before us,fall somewhere in between the entry of a judgment and its collection.
the majority prohibition of any governmental action beyond the entry of a money judgment thus fails to find adequate support in the existing case law.it also finds none in the language of b.for the enforcement of a money judgment that is forbidden can as readily refer only to those moves that are meant to favor the governmental action in relation to other creditors as it can to any step that is taken beyond the entry of the judgment.
because neither language nor authority suffices to justify the majority restrictions on the government power to regulate this trust,we must look to the section purpose,to the mischief it was designed to avoid in order to determine its meaning.see,heydon case,eng,noting that the office of all the judges is always to make such construction as shall suppress the mischief,and advance the remedy accord gorris scott,ex.this is the same as examining the majority underlying concerns for a persuasive justification for its decision.once again,however,such an inquiry fails to support the majority result.
the majority emphasizes,rightly,that the policy behind the automatic stay,its function,is to grant complete,immediate,albeit temporary relief to the debtor from creditors,and also to prevent dissipation of the debtor assets before orderly distribution to creditors can be effected.supra at quoting penn terra department of envtl.resources,cir.but this principle does not,as the majority holds,imply that any governmental action is automatically stayed if it requires either the outlay of debtor assets during bankruptcy proceedings or the control of those assets.it only means that the bankruptcy court power over the ultimate distribution of the assets and their allocation among creditors must remain unhampered by such governmental steps.indeed,to hold otherwise contravenes considerable precedent and undermines the very goal the majority holding purports to effectuate.
existing case law provides that even some government actions that require a debtor to expend funds during the pendency of the bankruptcy proceedings are not necessarily enforcements of a money judgment that are automatically stayed.for example,the costs of environmental may be imposed upon debtors despite the automatic stay.see city of new york exxon,cir holding that new york city action under the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act cercla comes within the exception despite the costs of the environmental to the debtor see also penn terra department of envtl.resources,cir holding that the commonwealth injunction against the debtor to correct violations of state environmental protection statutes was excepted from the stay.these cases make clear,therefore,that a financial loss to a debtor does not,on its own,justify applying the automatic stay provision to governmental action brought against a debtor.
it follows,a fortiori,that the fact that brennan stands to lose control of the assets in the cardinal trust does not in itself transform the district court order into an enforcement of a money judgment under b for here,none of the money repatriated is even expended.rather,the enforcement that is prohibited by b occurs,as this court and others have stated in the past,at the time of collection,see iron works,at a plaintiff attempts to seize property of the defendant in order to satisfy the judgment obtained by a.see nlrb continental hagen,cir emphasis added penn terra,at cir.nlrb p i e nationwide,cir.it occurs,in other words,when the government action with respect to the judgment would have the effect of benefitting itself at the expense of other creditors.but,in this case,since the commission will not receive any of brennan repatriated assets unless and until the bankruptcy court has determined their proper disbursement,the repatriation order in no way amounts to a satisfaction or an enforcement of the disgorgement judgment.accordingly,brennan loss of control over the trust,as to which he contends he has no control anyway,does not constitute a satisfaction of the commission judgment and it is certainly not a sufficient reason to subject the repatriation order to the automatic stay.
the notion that it is the desire to prevent steps that might favor the government as creditor over other creditors rather than the effect such actions might have on the debtors control over the relevant assets that motivates b prohibition,also finds support in the several cases in which courts have allowed governmental units to freeze assets or place them in receivership during bankruptcy proceedings.thus,where courts have feared the dissipation of assets still under a debtor control,they have regularly countenanced governmental action to safegu
