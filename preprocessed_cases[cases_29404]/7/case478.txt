opinion of the court 
this bankruptcy appeal presents a question on which new jersey federal bankruptcy and district courts have been divided for more than ten years whether,under c,a chapter debtor has the right to cure a default on a mortgage secured by the debtor principal residence between the time the residence is sold at a foreclosure sale and the time the deed is delivered.having finally been given the opportunity to break what is a virtual tie between the new jersey federal courts,we hold that c does not afford the debtor that right.
on august,appellant vincent connors executed a note and mortgage on his residence at lakeridge drive,matawan,new jersey,in favor of the predecessor in interest of appellee deutsche bank national trust deutsche bank.connors subsequently defaulted on the note,causing deutsche bank to foreclose on march.at a foreclosure sale on november,the property was sold to appellee lakeridge llc lakeridge for lakeridge tendered the required deposit.
on november,connors filed a voluntary petition under chapter of the bankruptcy code.the filing triggered an automatic stay of proceedings under.two weeks later,on november,connors filed a chapter plan,which proposed to cure his arrears on the mortgage.he did not,however,exercise his statutory right to object to the foreclosure sale or redeem within days of the filing of his chapter petition,as is permitted under.and b,respectively.
on january,the period having expired,lakeridge filed a motion to lift the automatic stay to permit it to tender the balance of the purchase price and receive the deed.connors opposed the motion.the bankruptcy court held a hearing and granted the motion,explaining,in its march,letter opinion,that connors no longer had the right to cure the default on his mortgage under c,and that his right to redeem under state law had expired.before lakeridge could tender the balance and receive the deed,however,the court granted a stay pending connors appeal.
the district court affirmed.noting a schism among new jersey courts regarding whether c creates a right to cure a default that expires upon delivery of the deed,the court held that the right to cure expires at the foreclosure sale,and that c allows the debtor to exercise only what additional remedy applicable state law provides.app.at.because connors rights had expired,the court held,the bankruptcy court appropriately granted lakeridge motion to lift the automatic stay.this appeal followed.
the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction,pursuant to b and b,over connors chapter petition.the district court had jurisdiction,pursuant to a,over connors appeal from the bankruptcy court order lifting the automatic stay.see united states pelullo,cir holding that order lifting automatic stay in bankruptcy proceeding is appealable in re comer,cir holding that bankruptcy court order lifting automatic stay is final in the sense that it completes litigation on the question and subjects the property to a foreclosure action in state court.we have jurisdiction,pursuant to d and and federal rule of appellate procedure b,over connors appeal from the district court final order affirming the order of the bankruptcy court.

the sole question we must decide is whether,under c,a chapter debtor has the right to cure a default on a mortgage secured by the debtor principal residence between the time the residence is sold at a foreclosure sale and the time the deed is delivered.
a.the unambiguous language of c supports the gavel rule 
section of the bankruptcy code sets forth the minimum requirements for a mandatory chapter plan,at.subsection b broadly permits the plan to provide for the curing or waiving of any default,and subsection b permits the plan to provide for the curing of any default within a reasonable time and maintenance of payments while the case is pending on any unsecured claim or secured claim on which the last payment is due after the date on which the final payment under the plan is due.b.subsection c limits the broad sweep of subsections b and b by providing,in relevant part,as follows 
a default with respect to,or that gave rise to,a lien on the debtor principal residence may be cured under paragraph or of subsection b until such residence is sold at a foreclosure sale that is conducted in accordance with applicable nonbankruptcy law 
since the enactment of subsection c as part of the bankruptcy reform act of,new jersey bankruptcy and district courts have disagreed over whether c gives a chapter debtor the right to cure a default on a home mortgage between the time the residence is sold at a foreclosure sale and the time the deed is delivered.one line of cases holds that c guarantees the right to cure a default on a home mortgage only until the gavel falls at a foreclosure sale courts frequently refer to this view as the gavel rule.the other line of cases maintains that a residence is not sold within the meaning of c,and the debtor has the right to cure a default,until the deed is delivered to the winning bidder this view is commonly known as the rule.
we start with the language of the statute.united states ron pair,d idahoan fresh advantage produce,cir.some courts have found ambiguity in the phrase,that is conducted in accordance with applicable nonbankruptcy law.in simmons,for instance,the court found the phrase ambiguous because it is not readily apparent whether congress intended the phrase to apply only to the event of sale,or to the entirety of the sale process,including the giving of a deed.at.we are unpersuaded that the phrase is ambiguous indeed,to find ambiguity would be to deny the words their plain meaning.the word that is a relative pronoun that restricts and,therefore,modifies,the preceding noun,foreclosure sale.thus,when the statute refers to a foreclosure sale that is conducted in accordance with applicable nonbankruptcy law,it clearly refers to a foreclosure sale that complies with procedures.see new castle county hartford acc.indem,cir t he question is not whether there is an ambiguity in the metaphysical sense,but whether the language has only one reasonable meaning when construed,not in a hypertechnical fashion,but in an ordinary,common sense manner.we agree with those decisions that have reached this conclusion without resorting to legislative history.see,cain,at hric,at see also simmons,at finding that canons of statutory construction,as well as common sense,mandated the same reading,but also considering legislative history 
we must also determine what it means for a residence to be sold at a foreclosure sale.deconstructing this phrase further,we must determine the meaning of foreclosure sale a term that appellees contend is synonymous with the foreclosure auction,but that connors insists refers to the entire foreclosure process,terminating with the delivery of a deed.the bankruptcy code does not define foreclosure sale,so we must give it its ordinary meaning.liberty,ford motor,cir.
outside of cases applying the rule,the term foreclosure sale is broadly understood to mean the foreclosure auction.first,the preposition at in sold at a foreclosure sale signifies a discrete event,rather than an ongoing process.see chisholm,wl,at.second,at least one new jersey bankruptcy court has taken judicial notice of the fact that new jersey foreclosure practitioners refer to the foreclosure auction as the sale.hric,at.third,the new jersey statute setting forth the procedures governing sheriffs sales specifically refers to the auction as the foreclosure sale.see requiring the successful bidder to deposit percent of the purchase price immediately upon the conclusion of the foreclosure sale.fourth,new jersey rules governing sheriffs sales treat sale as synonymous with the auction,and distinguish between the sale and the delivery of the deed.see.requiring notice to be served at least days prior to the date set for sale specifying the place of the sale permitting obj
