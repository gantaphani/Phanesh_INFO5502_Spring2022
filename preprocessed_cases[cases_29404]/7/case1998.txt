in this bankruptcy appeal,we decide that a secured creditor can not collaterally attack a confirmed chapter plan,even though the plan conflicted with the mandatory provisions of the bankruptcy code,when the secured creditor failed to object to the plan confirmation or appeal the confirmation order.we also hold that a secured creditor claim for mortgage arrearage survives the confirmed plan to the extent it is not satisfied in full by payments under the plan,or otherwise satisfied under the terms a,because to permit otherwise would deny the effect of b,which,in effect,prohibits modifications of secured claims for mortgages on a debtor principal residence.the bankruptcy court confirmed the plan at issue and,after the plan confirmation,granted the debtor objection to the creditor allowed claim,thereby reducing the secured claim for mortgage arrearage to the amount provided for in the confirmed plan,but denied the creditor motion to dismiss the chapter bankruptcy.the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court.for the following reasons,we affirm in part and reverse in part.
background 
on november,carmen bateman filed a chapter bankruptcy petition and confirmation plan in the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of florida.on december,universal american mortgage company universal timely filed proof of a secured claim,pursuant to,in the amount of the claim was for arrearage on a first mortgage that was secured by bateman principal residence.bateman did not file an objection to universal proof of claim.on february,the first creditors meeting was held universal did not attend.on february,bateman filed an amended confirmation plan the plan.the initial plan and the amended plan both provided for payment to universal of.the confirmation hearing was set for february universal did not attend.
on march,the bankruptcy court entered the confirmation order,which contained the amount to be paid to universal over the course of the chapter plan.universal did not at any time object to the plan confirmation.universal did not appeal the confirmation order to the district court,even though the plan erroneously provided for the payment of the disputed amount contrary to its timely filed proof of claim 
over a year after the plan was confirmed,the bankruptcy trustee noted that universal filed proof of claim did not match the plan amount.the trustee contacted bateman and thereafter,on may,bateman filed an objection to universal proof of claim,to which universal responded.on july,universal filed a motion to dismiss the bankruptcy because the plan failed to comply with the bankruptcy code.
the bankruptcy court sustained bateman objection and denied universal motion to dismiss,holding in part that a s a matter of substance the chapter plan provided an objection to the claim which placed a duty on universal to pursue the matter if the was not acceptable.at.because universal did not object to the plan as confirmed,the bankruptcy court gave the plan res judicata effect and found that universal was bound to the amount for its claim.in doing so,the bankruptcy observed that 
the binding effect on the confirmation order establishes the rights of the debtor and creditors as those which are provided in the plan.it is therefore incumbent upon creditors with notice of the chapter case to review the plan and object to the plan if they believe it to be improper,they may ignore the confirmation hearing only at their peril 
a creditor that had the opportunity to object that the plan did not meet the standards for confirmation,which provide the protections congress deemed appropriate for the various types of creditors may not later assert any interest other than that provided for it by the confirmed plan.
id.at quoting collier on bankruptcy,a ed.noting that universal 
is a successful,organized,mortgage lender and servicer,it elected not to retain an attorney,filed its claim,ignored the chapter plan,corrected chapter plan,failed to attend the creditors meeting,the confirmation hearing,and had the right to timely proceed after the order of confirmation.creditor s,especially lending institutions like the mortgagee,must follow the administration of the bankruptcy estate to determine what aspects of the proceeding that they may want to challenge.
the bankruptcy court held that universal 
lien passes through the bankruptcy proceeding,however the amount of the arrearage is res judicata.upon successful completion of the chapter plan or upon earlier payment of the arrears in the sum of,the mortgagees must as a matter of law provide that the mortgagor is current in her mortgage account.her principal sum owed on the mortgage,the date the sum of has been paid to the mortgagee must be the same as if no delinquency had ever occurred.the mortgagee may not seek at any future time to charge back against the debtor or any successor any portion of the difference between the and the claimed amount of.the mortgagee waived its rights to contest the amount of the arrearage and is bound by the confirmed plan.
universal filed a motion to reconsider,which the bankruptcy court denied.universal appealed to the united states district court for the southern district of florida,which affirmed the bankruptcy court on the basis that universal was precluded from collaterally attacking the plan,and was bound to the amount provided for in the plan on the grounds of res judicata,because it failed to object previously to the plan.universal timely appealed the district court order,which is now properly before us.
ii.discussion 
universal appeal before us challenges,first,the bankruptcy court sustainment of bateman objection and ruling that universal was bound by the claim amount provided for in the plan,despite the fact that bateman did not file an objection to counter universal proof of claim prior to confirmation.second,universal urges us to find error in the bankruptcy court denial of universal motion to dismiss the bankruptcy because it did not comply with,which it argues requires that a secured claim must be provided for in full as a prerequisite to plan confirmation.thus,universal seeks both to avoid the res judicata effect of the plan confirmation as to its claim and to unravel the bankruptcy altogether as invalidly confirmed.bateman argues that the plan is conclusive as to the treatment of universal claim and it can not be dismissed for such treatment,whether improper or not,at this late stage when universal neither objected to nor appealed from the plan confirmation.we deny both of universal requests,but nevertheless hold that universal secured claim for the mortgage arrearage remains intact.
this appeal pits the procedural requirements and substantive provisions of a,and of the bankruptcy code,against the res judicata effect of a confirmed plan under we now undertake to harmonize these provisions and decide an issue of first impression in this circuit d eterminations of law,whether made by the bankruptcy court or by the district court,are reviewed de novo.equitable life assurance soc y sublett in re sublett,cir.
the issues before us present questions of statutory interpretation and evaluation of the interlocking nature of the bankruptcy code.provisions within a statute are read to be consistent whenever possible.see clark uebersee.if the two provisions may not be harmonized,then the more specific will control over the general.green bock laundry mach,d.with these principles in mind,we navigate the intricacies of the bankruptcy code and bankruptcy procedure to decide universal appeal and whether universal claim survived bateman confirmed chapter plan.
before we reach the issue whether the bankruptcy court properly granted bateman objection to universal proof of claim,we will review the confirmation and claims process to give the issue context in the bankruptcy law and procedure.in general terms,when a debtor initiates a chapter bankruptcy,he or she files a petition and,in many instances simultaneously,a proposed plan.the plan contains the treatment to be afforded each creditor,including whether and how much each is to receive during the course of the plan term.during the petition pendency,before a chapter plan is confirmed,debtor and creditor alike have an opportunity to file claims and litigate any dispute regarding the validity and the amount of such claims.see generally.this is facilitated through filings and scheduled conferences and hearings.upon satisfaction of the plan and completion of the plan term,the debtor is discharged of his or her debts and,in theory,faces a future of solvency.see.the general bankruptcy statutory provisions,to,and the specifics of chapter debts of individuals,to,define the rights and duties of debtors and creditors,whereas the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure dictate how to navigate the process.within this framework,the issue here requires us to harmonize these interrelated provisions.
a.the bankruptcy court sustainment of debtor constructive objection 
title,united states code sets forth the mandatory contents of a chapter plan.generally,the holder of a secured claim is entitled to protection under the bankruptcy code to the extent of the collateral value securing the claim.a.however,b specially prohibits any modification of a homestead mortgagee rights in the chapter plan.because of the protection afforded to mortgagees by b,the protected security interest is not compromised even if the interest is undersecured by the value of the property.nobelman am.savs.bank,d.thus,even if the residential mortgage is undersecured,the plan is prohibited from reducing the mortgagee secured claim at first blush it seems somewhat strange that the bankruptcy code should provide less protection to an individual interest in retaining possession of his or her home than of other assets.the anomaly is,however,explained by the legislative history indicating that favorable treatment of residential mortgagees was intended to encourage the flow of capital into the home lending market.id.at.at stevens,concurring.this is not to say,of course,that the contractual rights of a home mortgage lender are unaffected by the mortgagor chapter bankruptcy.the lender power to enforce its,in particular,its right to foreclose on the property in the event of checked by the bankruptcy code automatic stay provision.id.at.at citing see also.
inclusion of creditors for disbursements under a chapter plan is not an automatic process.if the debtor wants to be discharged of certain liabilities,then the debtor must list the claim amounts and their proposed treatment under the plan.correspondingly,if a creditor wants to ensure it will be provided for in the confirmed plan,it will file a proof of claim.although the filing of a proof of claim may be a prerequisite to the allowance of certain claims,no creditor is required to file a proof of claim but one should be filed only when some purpose would be served.simmons savell,cir citations omitted.an unsecured creditor is required to file a proof claim for its claim to be allowed,but filing is not mandatory for a secured creditor.see fed.a.in fact,a secured creditor need not do anything during the course of the bankruptcy proceeding because it will always be able to look to the underlying collateral to satisfy its lien.in re folendore,cir because an unchallenged lien survives the discharge of the debtor in bankruptcy,a lienholder need not file a proof of claim under section.see also long bullard.holding that a secured creditor can ignore a bankruptcy proceeding because it can always look to the lien to satisfy its claim.
if the secured creditor wants to receive payments under the confirmed plan,it must file the proof of claim in a timely manner.see in re baldridge.the debtor also has an interest in ensuring that a proof of claim is filed,if the secured creditor neglects to do so,because the debtor is the party seeking the protection of the bankruptcy court and the ultimate benefit of the discharge of his or her liabilities.under a,a claim or interest,proof of which is filed under section of title,is deemed allowed,unless a party in interest objects.a proof of claim filed pursuant to federal rule of bankruptcy procedure shall constitute prima facie evidence of the validity and amount of the claim.fed.f.
the prima facie evidence of a proof claim can be rebutted if the debtor files an objection pursuant to federal rule of bankruptcy procedure.if an objection is made as to the amount or validity of the claim,the bankruptcy court will conduct a hearing to determine such,and,if appropriate,will disallow the claim.b.although a does not provide for a time limit to file an objection,it must be filed prior to plan confirmation.in re justice oaks ii,cir in re starling.
universal timely filed a proof of claim before the plan confirmation.accordingly,unless bateman,or any other party in interest,objected to the proof of claim,it is deemed allowed and is prima facie evidence of the validity and amount of the mortgage arrearage.a fed.f.it is undisputed that bateman did not file an objection to universal proof of claim prior to confirmation of the plan.instead,it was not until the trustee notified bateman of the discrepancy between the plan and universal proof of claim over one year after the plan confirmation that she filed an objection to universal proof of claim 
the bankruptcy court decided ex post facto,however,that a s a matter of substance the chapter plan provided an objection to the claim which placed a duty on the mortgagee to pursue the matter if the was not acceptable.at.we disagree.see in re white,cir per curiam refusing to permit a bankruptcy court to determine the validity of a lien in connection with fixing valuation for purposes of confirmation when it did not follow procedure pursuant to rule.
universal properly filed its proof of claim.in fact,because universal has a secured claim,that act was not even necessary or required.indeed,universal decided that it would pursue treatment under the plan for its secured claim for arrearage,therefore,it filed the proof of claim.universal was not the only party with an interest in ensuring that a proof of claim was filed and provided for in the plan.bateman had every incentive to provide for the secured mortgage claim in her chapter plan otherwise,the claim would have survived beyond the confirmed plan and the debtor would no longer have enjoyed the protection afforded by the automatic stay and periodic payments,and could possibly face foreclosure on her property.if bateman disagreed with the amount of the claim,rule provided the procedures by which she could resolve the dispute.
bateman failed to file a timely objection and the amount in universal proof of claim was deemed allowed under.instead,she listed a lower amount as disputed on her proposed plan,without more,and the plan passed through the confirmation process uncorrected.given the deemed allowed language of,the explicit procedures set forth in rule to effect a proper disallowance,the existence of a secured home mortgage claim,and the failure by the debtor here,not the creditor,to follow the proper procedures,we refuse to permit an inconsistent plan provision to constitute a constructive objection by reason of the plan notation of dispute alone,especially where a bankruptcy court does not consider an objection until over a year after the plan confirmation.see in re starling,at to allow the debtor to object,months after the plan has been confirmed,would contradict the finality objective of the confirmation process and would overlook the express language of section a of the bankruptcy code.that the plan states an amount in conflict with the proof of claim demands a resolution of the inconsistency,but a debtor objection is not the appropriate vehicle by which to do so.because the bankruptcy court granted this objection and held that universal was bound to the amount provided in the plan and,in addition,that universal would not be permitted to recoup the balance of the mortgage arrearage,the district court affirmance of its ruling in this regard is reversed.
b.the bankruptcy court denial of universal motion to dismiss 
section a requires the bankruptcy judge to confirm a plan if it meets certain requirements,one of which is that the proposed plan conforms with the requirements of chapter and the applicable provisions of title.a.according to the plain statutory language,is a mandatory provision contemplated by a and the confirmed plan should comply with it.section a,in turn,references secured creditors and mandates plan confirmation if the secured creditor accepts the plan the plan provides that the secured creditor retain its lien and be paid the full amount of the allowed claim or the debtor surrenders the property securing the claim to the creditor.thus,there are three options to the treatment of a secured creditor claim that compel confirmation of a plan,none of which were present in the facts here.first,universal,by filing a proof of claim contrary to the amount indicated in bateman first plan,did not indicate its acceptance of the plan to the detriment of its lien by declining to further participate in the confirmation proceedings.confirmation would have been proper under a if universal conceded to the treatment of its claim under the plan.universal did not accept the plan,however rather,after receiving the first plan,it filed a proof of claim with a different,higher amount.because there was no objection to the proof of claim,universal did not need to act further and the claim was deemed allowed.we will not permit universal reliance on the terms of the bankruptcy code,and universal subsequent silence on the matter,to act as an acceptance under a.there is no indication that universal accepted the plan and we will not treat its actions as comprising such.it is also undisputed that neither universal was provided for in full pursuant to its allowed claim and a b,nor was the property surrendered to it.accordingly,bateman can not claim that the plan confirmation was proper at the outset or was entitled to confirmation because it did not meet the mandatory provisions of and universal did not accept,nor was it alternatively sufficiently provided for,under a 
universal argues that because the plan did not meet the requisites of,which it maintains are mandatory for confirmation,the plan can not be afforded res judicata effect under.title,a provides that t he provisions of a confirmed plan bind the debtor and each creditor,whether or not the claim of such creditor is provided for by the plan,and whether or not such creditor has objected to,has accepted,or has rejected the plan.thus,gives res judicata effect to a confirmed chapter plan.a leading treatise makes clear 
that the binding effect extends to any issue actually litigated by the parties and any issue necessarily determined by the confirmation order,including whether the plan complies with sections and of the bankruptcy code.for example,a creditor may not after confirmation assert that the plan is otherwise inconsistent with the code in violation of section b or section a.

we set forth in in re justice oaks ii,and reiterate here,that res judicata refers to claim preclusion in the sense bateman seeks to apply the doctrine,meaning,i f the later litigation arises from the same cause of action,then the judgment bars litigation not only of every matter which was actually offered and received to sustain the demand,but also of every claim which might have been presented,cir quoting baltimore phillips.preclusion under is somewhat harsher than common law issue preclusion,however.at common law the litigation of an issue is precluded only if that issue was actually litigated and decided and if the determination of that issue was necessary to the judgment in a previous action between the parties.in re starling,at quoting in re sanders.confirmation of a chapter plan by a bankruptcy court of competent jurisdiction,in accordance with the procedural requirements of notice and hearing of confirmation,is given the same effect as any district court final judgment on the merits.in re justice oaks ii,at citing stoll gottlieb.universal proof of claim and the plan listed distribution amount,however improper,was within the definition of claim preclusion because it very well might have been and,as we have articulated should have been,presented before the bankruptcy judge prior to the plan confirmation.see in re starling,at.the plan was improperly confirmed because it conflicted with mandatory provisions.had universal objected to or appealed from the plan confirmation,it would have prevailed without question,given the facts presented to us.universal,however,did not do so and binds creditors to the provisions of the plan.the plan provided that universal be paid monthly a certain amount to fulfill the disputed claim.universal can not now,years later,urge us to dismiss the chapter petition and unravel the plan execution when it otherwise retains its lien in full.
we are persuaded by the reasoning in simmons that a secured creditor lien survives a contrary plan confirmation.at.in simmons,the creditor secured by a statutory construction lien filed a proof of claim with the bankruptcy court.during the course of the confirmation proceedings,neither the debtor nor the trustee objected to the proof of claim prior to confirmation.nevertheless,the chapter plan listed the creditor claim as unsecured but disputed.the fifth circuit held that the notation in the confirmation plan can not be deemed to constitute an objection.id.at the purpose of filing an objection is to join issue in a contested matter,thereby placing the parties on notice that litigation is required to resolve an actual dispute between the parties.the court stated that the plan was erroneously confirmed by the bankruptcy court because,not only did it not appropriately provide for the creditor proof of claim,the plan did not meet any of the prerequisites under a in that the secured creditor did not accept the plan,the plan made no provision that it retained its lien,and the plan did not propose the surrender of the property id.at.
the debtor argued that the effect of the confirmation was to lift the construction lien from the homestead and vest the interest of the property in the debtor free and clear of any claim or interest of any creditor.id.at.the fifth circuit declined that invitation 
after delineating the parameters of the dispute over the meaning of the terms claim or interest,and having observed that the legislative history of section c offers no insight regarding this issue,a leading commentator writes that m atters are further confused by the fact that there appears to be no sound reason for lifting liens by operation of law at confirmation under chapter.collier on bankruptcy,at.nor are we able to discern any reason for such an effect.therefore,we agree with the in re honaker,court conclusion that t he reading of section urged by the debtor would have the debtor materially improve his financial position,by unencumbering secured assets,through the simple expedient of passing his property through the estate.this result has little to recommend it.id.at it would be anomalous indeed were we to permit the debtor a windfall for his mischaracterization of the creditor claim in the plan.
id.at emphasis added.furthermore,the creditor 
failure to interpose an objection to the plan or to appeal the confirmation order should not now be permitted to justify avoidance of a lien securing a claim that was originally deemed an allowed secured claim as a result of the debtor failure to object to the creditor timely filed proof of secured claim.
id.at.rejecting the debtor argument that bound the creditor to the treatment of his claim as provided for in the confirmation plan,the fifth circuit held that the creditor statutory lien on the debtor homestead remained unimpaired by the order of confirmation.id.at.thus,while the validity of the confirmation order itself was not before the court on appeal,the court held that the effect of confirmation under did not invalidate the creditor lien.
for these reasons,if a lien on a mortgage survives the res judicata effect of a confirmed plan,then so must any corresponding arrearage claim,such as one universal asserts here.see in re hobdy,holding,in an identical fact situation,that the general terms of a could not override the specific a claims provision,therefore,the confirmed
