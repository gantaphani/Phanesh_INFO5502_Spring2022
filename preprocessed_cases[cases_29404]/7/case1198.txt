joseph vlasek appeals the district court affirmance of the bankruptcy court refusal to dismiss his bankruptcy petition on the assertion that his mother had fraudulently signed the petition in his name and filed it without his authority.we dismiss vlasek appeal.
in january,joseph vlasek netted in settlement of a lawsuit arising out of an injury he received in an automobile accident.because vlasek was seventeen years old at the time,a minor estate was opened on his behalf and the settlement proceeds were delivered to the estate.two months later,on the occurrence of his eighteenth birthday,the estate was closed,and the sum of was turned over to vlasek.
over the next few years,vlasek started and closed two business and bought four properties in his own name in homewood,illinois.all four properties were mortgaged,and he and his mother moved into one of them.by,the failed businesses and purchases had consumed most of his settlement proceeds.
in april,vlasek girlfriend gave birth to a son.she alleged vlasek was the father,but vlasek denied paternity.so,in october,vlasek girlfriend filed a paternity action,and nearly three years later,an illinois state court found that vlasek was the child father and ordered him to make payments.when he refused to comply with that order,the state court,on august,entered a judgment against vlasek in the amount of.
seven days later vlasek filed a chapter bankruptcy petition,and a month after that,he submitted his bankruptcy schedules.but curiously those schedules did not list the four holdings that vlasek had purchased.it appears that back in while his child mother was still pregnant,vlasek had begun transferring his holdings out of his receiving any compensation.
by questioning vlasek during his mandatory creditor meeting held pursuant to,the trustee learned about the settlement,the four purchases,and the subsequent transfers.he later investigated the circumstances of the property transfers,determined the transfers were voidable,and successfully pursued a action in the bankruptcy court.as a result,the bankruptcy court set aside the transfers.vlasek did not move to alter or amend this order.nor did he seek to appeal the bankruptcy court ruling.
the bankruptcy court obtained an agreement from the trustee that the trustee would not seek to sell vlasek home unless the funds obtained by selling the other three properties proved insufficient to settle all creditor claims.nevertheless,it became apparent that the proceeds from the three property sales would in fact prove insufficient.thus,on november,the bankruptcy court entered an order authorizing the trustee to employ a broker to market vlasek residence.
seven days after the court authorized the trustee to begin preparations to sell vlasek residence,vlasek moved to dismiss his bankruptcy petition altogether.this request came nearly years after the bankruptcy petition had been filed.vlasek alleged that he had never signed his bankruptcy petition,but rather that his mother had fraudulently signed his name.he later claimed that at the time of the bankruptcy filing in august he was mentally result of a injury suffered in the automobile accident.vlasek asserted as proof of his incompetency a later illinois probate court order granting his mother plenary guardianship over his person vlasek asked the court to dismiss his bankruptcy case and void each of the orders it had entered previously.
besides the november,order authorizing the trustee to hire a broker to market vlasek residence,the orders that vlasek also sought to void through dismissal would have included i the order setting aside the four transfers ii a march,order approving the sale of the first of the four properties,located at cedar road,for the sum of and iii a june,order requiring the trustee to abandon the second of the four properties,located at south howe,pursuant to a motion to compel brought by the bank that was foreclosing on that property.vlasek,however,never sought to appeal or stay any of these individual orders at the time they were rendered.
the bankruptcy court promptly conducted an evidentiary hearing on vlasek motion to dismiss.the court admitted into evidence a recording and transcript of vlasek creditor meeting.vlasek also testified during the proceedings,but the bankruptcy court observed that his testimony appeared to have been rehearsed,order at.at the request of the cook county public guardian office who had been invited by the court to participate in the hearings given the illinois state court guardianship action,the bankruptcy court ordered vlasek to submit to a psychiatric evaluation.the evaluation was scheduled for march,and the court deferred ruling on the dismissal motion.vlasek never appeared for the evaluation.
while the dismissal motion was still pending,the court approved the sale of the third of the four properties,located at tipton,for the sum of by order dated january.in spite of the fact that success on his dismissal motion would render void this order also,vlasek sought no appeal from the ruling nor did he seek to stay the sale pending the resolution of the dismissal motion.
on april,the bankruptcy court determined that even if vlasek did not personally sign his name to the petition,he otherwise had adopted and ratified its filing through his course of conduct during the two years of bankruptcy proceedings.he was therefore estopped from raising the issue.furthermore,the bankruptcy court was skeptical of vlasek evidentiary basis for filing the motion,noting that he had only raised the genuineness of his signature and his mother lack of authority to act on his behalf when the sale of their residence appeared imminent.the motion filing also coincided with vlasek and his mother repeated obstructionist efforts to thwart or delay the sale.consequently,the bankruptcy court found that the petition was validly filed and that the trustee ongoing administration of the estate was proper.vlasek took no appeal from the ruling.
instead,a few months later,vlasek filed a motion to vacate all orders relating to any adversary proceedings,which was apparently stylized,like the relief he requested in his motion to dismiss,to contest the court earlier decisions to set aside the four property transfers and any orders approving their sale.the bankruptcy court denied that motion on june.vlasek did attempt to appeal the ruling.nor did he later appeal or seek to stay the bankruptcy court august,order approving the sale of the last of the four residence at street.
the trustee administration of the estate proceeded,and on may,the bankruptcy court approved the trustee final accounting of the disbursement of all estate funds,discharged the trustee,and closed the estate.only then did vlasek file a notice of appeal,seeking to challenge,under the auspice of the may order closing the estate,both the april,ruling on the motion to dismiss and the june,ruling on the motion to vacate.
on review,the district court determined that vlasek could not have appealed the april,denial of his motion to dismiss as a final order,and thus held that he was not barred from appealing that ruling under his current notice.but it also held that the bankruptcy court properly denied vlasek attempt to dismiss his bankruptcy petition,agreeing with the bankruptcy court that the time to challenge his mother allegedly fraudulent filing had long passed by the time the motion was filed and that he had waived any claim of mental incompetence by failing to submit to the psychiatric evaluation.regarding the motion to vacate,the district court held vlasek appeal untimely,because orders approving the sale of assets of the estate are final for purposes of appeal and vlasek did not appeal those decisions within the statutorily mandated time frame.see fed.bankr.a providing that notice of appeal shall be filed within ten days from the date of entry of the judgment,order,or decree.
vlasek seeks review of the district court decision,challenging its affirmance of the bankruptcy court april,order denying the motion to dismiss.he claims that the allegedly fraudulent filing denied him due process.vlasek does not challenge the district court ruling that vlas
