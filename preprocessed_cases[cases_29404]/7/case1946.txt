kohlberg kravis roberts kkr,robinson humphrey robinson humphrey and murray devine company,murray devine collectively appellants appeal the district court order granting huff asset management huff leave to file the fourth amended complaint.for the reasons set forth below,we conclude that we lack appellate jurisdiction.accordingly,we dismiss the appeal.
procedural posture 
huff is an investment management company.in,huff invested approximately on behalf of its clients in subordinated notes notes issued in connection with the leveraged recapitalization of an alabama grocery chain,bruno,bruno.kkr engineered bruno recapitalization.robinson humphrey issued a fairness opinion related to the recapitalization and murray devine issued a solvency opinion in connection with the recapitalization.roughly years later,bruno filed for bankruptcy in delaware.on august,huff filed suit in alabama state court for fraudulent transfer,breach of fiduciary duty,aiding and abetting,and conspiracy.kkr removed the case to the bankruptcy court for the northern district of alabama.in october of,bruno bankruptcy examiner released a report,prepared for kkr in may of,which cited numerous,material accounting flaws in financial statements approved by bruno accountants,arthur andersen.as a result,on may,huff filed a second amended complaint second amended complaint asserting state law claims based on material misrepresentations and omissions in bruno public filings.huff brought the action as an investment advisor and on behalf of certain beneficial owners of the notes.huff federal securities fraud claims were already barred by a three year statute of repose.see c.
thereafter,the alabama bankruptcy court returned the action to alabama state court.appellants removed the case to federal court on the grounds that huff state law claims were by the securities litigation uniform standards act of slusa two weeks later,in an explicit attempt to avoid slusa preclusion,huff filed a third amended complaint third amended complaint asserting only claims for misrepresentations made after bruno stock was from the nasdaq.huff also dropped defendants murray devine and robinson humphrey because they were involved only in misrepresentations made prior to.the district court did not rule on the third amended complaint for three years and three months.
in the interim,in light of developments in a related proceeding,huff moved for leave to file a fourth amended complaint fourth amended complaint.again,huff acknowledged that the fourth amended complaint was an attempt to avoid slusa preclusion.slusa provides for the removal of covered class actions.c.the term covered class action includes any single lawsuit involving a covered security in which one or more named parties seek to recover damages on a representative basis on behalf of themselves and other unnamed parties similarly situated.id.c,f.however,slusa only governs actions filed by fifty or more individually named plaintiffs.f a i i.thus,huff sought to substitute as plaintiffs individual note holders.the fourth amended complaint also murray devine and robinson humphrey as defendants.
on february,the district court denied leave to file the fourth amended complaint and dismissed the case with prejudice.the district court stated that the proposed amendment violated a prior judicial order was untimely was unduly burdensome on kkr and was a waste of judicial resources.on appeal,a prior panel of this court vacated and remanded.the panel rejected the reasoning of the district court but explicitly reserved judgment on whether there were alternate,legitimate reasons to deny leave to amend.on june,after remand,the district court issued an order granting leave to file the fourth amended complaint under the liberal amendment provision in federal rule of civil procedure a.immediately thereafter,the district court observed that slusa was the only asserted basis for federal jurisdiction,and slusa being inapplicable to the fourth amended complaint,the district court remanded to state court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.appellants filed the instant appeal.
in this appeal,appellants challenge the district court ruling granting leave to file the fourth amended complaint.the amendment permitted a substitution of plaintiffs,eliminating huff in his representative capacity and substituting therefor individual plaintiffs.the amendment also murray devine and robinson humphrey as defendants,thus abandoning the attempt in the third amended complaint to drop these two defendants.appellants raise several issues,including,inter alia whether huff is the sole real party in interest whether huff is an indispensable party whether the district court erred in allowing the addition of two defendants after huff deliberately dropped them in the proposed third amended complaint whether the statute of limitations prevents the of these defendants and whether the district court erred in allowing the amendment because it constituted a circumvention of slusa.the foregoing will be referred to in this opinion as the merits issues.however,we must first determine whether we have appellate jurisdiction to entertain these merits issues.
ii.appellate jurisdiction 
an order remanding a case to the state court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise.d the policy of congress opposes interruption of the litigation of the merits of a removed cause by prolonged litigation of questions of jurisdiction of the district court to which the cause is removed.kircher putnam funds trust,d.for over a century now,statutes have accordingly limited the power of federal appellate courts to review orders remanding cases removed by defendants from state to federal court.id.the supreme court has relentlessly repeated that any remand order issued on the grounds specified in c is immunized from all forms of appellate review,whether or not that order might be deemed erroneous by an appellate court.kircher,at.at.
notwithstanding the force of the d bar,the case law has staked out limited exceptions.thus,we may review orders that lead to,but are separate from,orders of remand and have a conclusive effect upon the ensuing state court action.aquamar,del monte fresh produce,cir.this doctrine flows from the supreme court decision in city of waco united states fidelity guaranty.in waco,the defendant impleaded a and removed the case to district court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.the district court concluded that the was an unnecessary and improper party and dismissed the.waco,at.at.after the dismissal,there was no diversity between the remaining parties and the district court remanded the case to state court for lack of jurisdiction.id.the defendant appealed the dismissal of the.the supreme court recognized that no appeal lies from an order of remand.waco,at.at.however,noting that the will be no part of the case which is remanded to the state court,the court concluded that i ndisputably the order of dismissal is the subject of an appeal and,if not reversed or set aside,is conclusive upon the petitioner.id.
in this case,we can assume arguendo but need not decide that this appeal would satisfy waco,because our case law also requires that the order appealed from be final under,and because we hold that the district court order in the instant case is not final.see flohr mackovjak,cir addressing a d issue,and after holding that waco was satisfied,holding we may thus take jurisdiction over mackovjak appeal,provided that the denial of his motion to substitute is a final order within the terms of.see also aquamar,at holding that appealability of the district court order that led to,but was separate from the remand order had to satisfy both the waco doctrine and the finality rule collateral order doctrine accord price j h marsh mclennan,cir powers southland,cir.
section of the judicial code generally vests courts of appeals with jurisdiction over appeals from final decisions of the district courts.cunningham hamilton county,d.the general rule is that a district court order is considered final and appealable only if it ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do
