cedar shore resort,cedar shore,filed for bankruptcy protection after it was served with a shareholder lawsuit.following an evidentiary hearing,the bankruptcy found that cedar shore had filed in bad faith and dismissed its petition.the district affirmed the decision of the bankruptcy judge,and cedar shore appeals from its judgment of dismissal.we affirm.
cedar shore operates a resort facility in oacoma,south dakota.during its early years the resort suffered a series of misfortunes,including a fire,an explosion,harsh weather conditions,and flooding,and cedar shore initially had difficulty generating a profit and fulfilling its loan obligations to its principal lender,norwest bank.the bank did not threaten or initiate any type of foreclosure proceedings against the resort,however,and the parties worked together to modify the loan agreement in a mutually acceptable manner.in norwest amended the loan agreement so that cedar shore would only be required to make interest payments on its debt.
later that year cedar shore hired a consultant who described it as a bankrupt company and urged that it either file for chapter bankruptcy or reorganize its debt.the board of directors unanimously voted not to file.instead,cedar shore worked with norwest to restructure the terms of its loan agreement.under the terms of a plan reached in february,norwest agreed to reduce the corporate debt it was owed by almost million in exchange for a capital contribution by cedar shore shareholders.the cedar shore board scheduled a shareholder meeting for april to vote on the proposal.
before the meeting could take place,shareholders paul and mary pat mueller brought an action in state court against cedar shore,its officers and directors,and its management company.the suit alleged minority shareholder oppression,waste,and mismanagement breach of fiduciary duty and tortious interference with prospective business advantage.the cedar shore board held a meeting on march,to discuss its response to the mueller lawsuit.the members of the board,many of whom had been named as defendants in the lawsuit,did not take any action to investigate the muellers claims.instead,the board voted to file for bankruptcy.
cedar shore filed a petition under chapter on may,and its attorney decided shortly thereafter that the muellers claims were really derivative in nature,that they were actually raised on behalf of the corporation,and that they were meritless.the attorney later testified that he had spent approximately sixty hours doing his analysis.he admitted that his study had not come anywhere close to the type of investigation typically undertaken in similar cases.
cedar shore entered into a settlement agreement with its officers,directors,and management company in which the claims were treated as derivative.see.a.under the agreement cedar shore was to release its claims against the other parties in exchange for their promise not to seek indemnification from it.cedar shore then moved the bankruptcy court to approve the agreement.after the bankruptcy court agreed that most of the claims were derivative and thus belonged to the estate,cedar shore amended the settlement agreement to provide for a payment to each officer and director.
the muellers opposed the settlement agreement and moved to dismiss the bankruptcy petition as being filed in bad faith.cedar shore then moved for approval of a reorganization plan that it filed which was essentially identical to the agreement that it had reached with norwest in february,before the mueller lawsuit.
the bankruptcy court scheduled a hearing to evaluate the motions.the muellers presented evidence that cedar shore had already solved most of its financial problems and that its bankruptcy filing was motivated by a desire to rid itself of their lawsuit rather than to effectuate a legitimate reorganization.cedar shore president edward geddes admitted on cross examination that the corporate revenues in and had significantly exceeded those from previous years and that the management team was pleased with the performance of the resort.he also acknowledged that cedar shore had anticipated operating at a loss for several years and had not expected a profit until.he admitted that shortly before filing for bankruptcy,he had told a group of cedar shore creditors that business was going very well and had exceeded expectations for the year and that the resort was paying all of its bills.the bank had not threatened to sue cedar shore for delinquent loan payments,nor had it instituted any collection proceedings against it.geddes acknowledged that none of cedar shore other creditors had threatened any sort of litigation or collection actions against it.he also admitted that after filing its bankruptcy petition,the corporation had focused most of its efforts on attempting to settle the mueller claims in the confines of the bankruptcy estate rather than on reorganizing its finances.the muellers presented evidence that cedar shore bankruptcy schedules failed to list and value properly all personal property and to account for approximately one million dollars in furnishings and equipment.
cedar shore presented witnesses who testified that the corporation had filed bankruptcy in order to protect its loan restructuring agreement with the bank,not to rid itself of the mueller lawsuit.geddes testified that the bank had indicated that it would not go through with the restructuring agreement unless it was confirmed by the bankruptcy court.according to bank officer terry johnson,norwest feared that cedar shore shareholders would not make their required capital contributions if they were distracted by the lawsuit.johnson testified that the bank wanted court approval of the restructuring agreement in order to ensure the shareholder payments,but he admitted that norwest did not specifically require confirmation of the plan by the bankruptcy court.
after considering the evidence,the bankruptcy court found that cedar shore primary motivation in filing chapter was to protect itself from the shareholder action and dismissed its petition for bad faith under b.the court found that although the resort had suffered numerous financial setbacks during its early years,its financial reports indicated that it was doing better or at least was on the financial track originally projected towards making a profit in the year.the court found that cedar shore had a good working relationship with its bank,that the two parties had negotiated a mutually acceptable loan reorganization agreement,and that all other creditors were apparently satisfied.the court was not persuaded by cedar shore claim that the bank needed court approval to protect the reorganization agreement since there was no evidence that the mueller suit had jeopardized the agreement or that the shareholders would not have made their required capital contributions.the bankruptcy court also found that the petitioner reorganization schedules did not accurately list and properly value all personalty and did not comport with either official forms or bankruptcy code requirements.the inaccurate and cursory nature of these schedules indicated that cedar shore had filed bankruptcy in order to settle the mueller lawsuit,not to effect a legitimate reorganization.the court stated that one indicia of bad faith is when the petitioner primary reason for filing bankruptcy is to avoid a lawsuit.it dismissed cedar shore petition in order to protect the jurisdictional integrity of the bankruptcy court and to prevent the misuse of the bankruptcy reorganization process.
cedar shore appealed the dismissal to the district court pursuant to.the district court affirmed,after concluding that the bankruptcy court had not erred in finding that cedar shore filed its petition in bad faith and had not abused its discretion in dismissing the case.the district court explained that because the bankruptcy court permissibly found that cedar shore did not need the protections of bankruptcy to reorganize,but filed bankruptcy simply to settle the shareholder lawsuit,it did not err.the court concluded that the fact that cedar shore had put forth a legitimate reorganization plan
