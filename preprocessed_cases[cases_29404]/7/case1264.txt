denise patch appeals the judgment of the eighth circuit bankruptcy appellate panel bap.a divided bap affirmed the bankruptcy court sua sponte entry of summary judgment in favor of bryan blocker,trustee for the heirs and next of kin of dillon blocker,concluding that patch unliquidated debt,owed to blocker,is nondischargeable under a.because we conclude that patch debt is dischargeable as a matter of law,we reverse.
this bankruptcy dispute is the product of the extremely tragic death of patch and blocker old son,dillon,who was murdered by patch boyfriend,steven mcbride in march of,patch and mcbride began dating.soon thereafter,the couple leased a apartment in lakeville,minnesota,and began living together.patch had two children from her prior relationship with bryan and a daughter.both children lived in the lakeville apartment with patch and mcbride.patch worked at a daycare center that both children attended.dillon also participated in programming administered by the local school district.
shortly after patch and mcbride leased the lakeville apartment,mcbride began physically abusing dillon.patch,who had received training in identifying and reporting child abuse,knew that mcbride was abusing her son,and she asked him to stop.but mcbride did not stop abusing dillon,and patch did nothing more to prevent the abuse.eventually,daycare personnel suspected that dillon was being abused.when patch was questioned by coworkers about dillon bruises,she removed her children from daycare and quit her job there.patch also regularly cancelled dillon classes to hide his visible bruising,and eventually,she removed dillon from his speech program to prevent discovery of the abuse.after quitting her daycare job,patch began working nights at target.when patch went to work,she left her children at home with mcbride.
on september,patch went to work at target and left her children at the apartment in mcbride care.sometime early in the morning while patch was at work,mcbride called her to tell her that dillon was crying and had hurt himself in a fall.patch left target early and went home to check on dillon.when patch arrived home,she noticed a bruise on dillon forehead.while putting ice on dillon head,patch also observed that dillon was having difficulty breathing and was not speaking normally.more than once,patch told mcbride that she thought they should take dillon to see a doctor,but mcbride told her that consulting a doctor was not necessary.instead,they put dillon to bed and did nothing further.when patch awoke in the morning,she checked on dillon and found him dead.patch called.
the autopsy report prepared by the dakota county coroner indicates that dillon died from injuries to his head and abdomen.acute injuries to dillon head resulted in bleeding on the surface of his brain and mild swelling of his brain.dillon acute injuries to his abdomen included bruising of his pancreas and liver.the report also revealed an acute,rupture and bleeding in the peritoneal cavity.dillon older injuries included bruises and abrasions on his chest and arms consistent with human bite marks multiple broken ribs in varying stages of healing burn marks on his right arm and hand and a tooth that he had swallowed.
both mcbride and patch were criminally charged.mcbride was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.patch pled guilty to manslaughter a form of criminal negligence,see,subd,and she was sentenced to months of imprisonment,double the presumptive sentence.her sentence was enhanced on the basis of aggravating factors,including dillon vulnerability and her failure to obtain medical care for dillon the night before his death.see state patch,no,wl.
in december of,blocker,acting as the trustee for dillon heirs and next of kin,filed a action against mcbride and patch in minnesota state court.count ii of that action alleges that patch negligently entrusted dillon to mcbride,and count iii alleges that patch negligently failed to seek medical care for dillon prior to his death.both counts allege that patch negligent conduct was the proximate cause of dillon wrongful death.in contrast to the count against mcbride,which alleges that he intentionally assaulted dillon and thereby caused his death,the counts against patch allege only negligence and carelessness no intentional tort is alleged,neither is willfulness.patch filed for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code and listed dillon estate as one of her creditors.the action was stayed.blocker then filed a complaint in the bankruptcy court seeking a declaration that patch obligation is nondischargeable because it is a debt for willful and malicious injury under a.patch filed a motion for summary judgment,and after a hearing,with no written memorandum,the bankruptcy court denied patch motion and granted blocker summary judgment sua sponte.on appeal,a divided bap affirmed.patch appeals.blocker elected to take no part in these appellate proceedings.
the sole issue on appeal is whether the bankruptcy court and the bap both erred by concluding that patch debt,resulting from her role in dillon death,is nondischargeable as a matter of law.patch contends that the summary judgment record is insufficient,as a matter of law,to permit a rational trier of fact to find for blocker,and therefore she is entitled to summary judgment.we agree.
like the bap,we review the bankruptcy court entry of summary judgment de novo.see marlar,at.summary judgment is proper if there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c celotex catrett,d.where the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the nonmoving party,there is no genuine issue for trial.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d internal marks omitted.while we view the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and afford that party all reasonable inferences,see id.at,the nonmoving party production of a mere scintilla of evidence in support of his position is insufficient to avoid summary judgment,anderson liberty lobby,d see also matsushita,at.explaining that the party opposing summary judgment must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.
section a of the bankruptcy code exempts certain debts from discharge in bankruptcy,including debts for willful and malicious injury by the debtor to another entity.to establish that a debt is nondischargeable consistent with this exception,the party seeking to prevent discharge must show by a preponderance of the evidence that the debt is for both willful injury and malicious injury.see fischer scarborough in re scarborough,cir.willful and malicious are two distinct requirements,cert.denied,d.
the meaning of willful under a is controlled by the supreme court decision in kawaauhau geiger,d there,the court resolved a circuit split over the meaning of willful,holding that debts arising from recklessly or negligently inflicted injuries do not fall within the compass of a.id.at.because the word willful in a modifies the word injury,the court concluded that nondischargeability takes a deliberate or intentional injury,not merely a deliberate or intentional act that leads to injury.id.at.like the en banc eighth circuit decision it affirmed,the court relied on the restatement second of torts,observing that the a formulation triggers in the lawyer mind the category intentional torts,which generally require s that the actor intend the consequences of an act,not simply the act itself.id.at.quoting the restatement second of torts cmt.a.
the scope of willful injury under a,however,is not limited to circumstances in which the debtor desires to bring about the consequences of his conduct.if the debtor knows that the consequences are certain,or substantially certain,to result from his conduct,the debtor is treated as if he had,in fact,desired to produce those consequences.geiger kawaauhau in re geiger,cir en banc citing the restatement second of torts,cmt.a,aff,d.our geiger opinion makes clear that in this circuit the willful element is a subjective one,requiring proof that the debtor desired
