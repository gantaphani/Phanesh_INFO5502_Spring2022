in the course of united airlines bankruptcy,the bankruptcy judge,seconded by the district judge,allowed united to eliminate the contractual pension rights of its or so retired pilots without a hearing to determine whether they should receive replacement benefits compensation for giving up those rights,which united had given its active pilots.the association representing the retired pilots has appealed.the et parties on both sides of the case can be ignored.recently united emerged from bankruptcy,and it argues that this renders the appeal moot.that is incorrect.all that the retired pilots are seeking in the first instance is a hearing before the bankruptcy judge,and we shall see that the judge could at that hearing deny any relief that would jeopardize united newly recovered solvency.and there is no argument that the confirmed plan resolves the claims made by the retired pilots in this appeal.
united had a frequently amended collective bargaining agreement with the air line pilots association alpa that among other things established pension plans for both active and retired pilots employed by united.the plans provided both and pension benefits the distinctions relevant to this case are that the latter are not insured by the pension benefit guaranty corporation or protected by the provisions of erisa relating to the termination of pension plans.a,b.
normally a bankruptcy trustee,or as in this case a debtor in possession,can freely reject the executory portion of a contract.but section of the bankruptcy code permits the rejection of the executory portion of a collective bargaining agreement only with the approval of the bankruptcy judge after negotiations looking to mutually satisfactory modifications of the agreement,b,and only if the negotiations failing the judge determines that the balance of the equities clearly favors rejection of such agreement.c.wanting to lift the albatross of pension obligations from its shoulders as well as to reduce the pilots wages,united filed an application under section for rejection of the collective bargaining agreement and proceeded to the negotiation phase with alpa.when alpa made clear that it would not represent the interests of the retired pilots in the negotiations,the latter moved the bankruptcy judge to appoint a representative to participate in the negotiations on their behalf.the purpose of the motion is a little obscure.the retired pilots already had a united retired pilots benefit protection association,the appellant.what they really wanted was for the judge to order united and alpa to negotiate with urpbpa as well.the judge refused,and as a result the retired pilots did not participate in the negotiations.the judge refusal is one of the orders that the association is asking us to reverse.
while the section proceeding was going on,united and alpa negotiated an agreement the parties call this the letter agreement to modify the collective bargaining agreement.the modification was intended to eliminate the pension plans created by the agreement but compensate the active pilots,that is,the pilots represented by alpa,by giving them convertible notes valued at million and other consideration,including a pension plan.in exchange for these concessions alpa agreed not to oppose united attempt to terminate the collectively bargained pension plans under,the provision of erisa that governs the voluntary termination of pension plans.
with the agreement to modify the collective bargaining agreement,united application under section to reject the agreement entered a state of suspended animation,since the modification of the collective bargaining agreement by the letter agreement would,if that agreement was approved,give united the relief it wanted without its having to persuade the bankruptcy judge to reject the collective bargaining agreement.
united asked the bankruptcy judge to approve the letter agreement under b,which requires that the bankruptcy judge approval be obtained for contracts made by the debtor during the bankruptcy that are outside the ordinary course of business,as the letter agreement obviously was.the judge gave his approval,and this is the other order challenged on this appeal.the retired pilots argue that he should have approved the agreement without giving them a chance to participate in the negotiations for replacement benefits such participation might,they argue,have resulted in their receiving replacement benefits too.
the order of approval extinguished any rights that the retired pilots might have had under the collective bargaining agreement.it was the equivalent of a final judgment in a suit for breach of contract,and therefore appealable as concluding a severable phase of the bankruptcy proceeding.bank of america,moglia,cir.the earlier order refusing to appoint a representative to negotiate with united and alpa on the retired pilots behalf over replacement benefits to compensate for the modification of the collective bargaining agreement was interlocutory,but interlocutory to the order extinguishing their contract rights and therefore reviewable by us with it.
after the bankruptcy judge approved the letter agreement,united withdrew its section motion for rejection of the collective bargaining agreement.the approval did not,however,terminate the pension plans.for that to happen an application had to be made to and approved by the bankruptcy judge under one of two sections of erisa.under the first,voluntary termination,the employer asks for termination.under the second,involuntary termination,the pension benefit guaranty corporation,which insures vested rights under erisa pension plans,a pension benefit guaranty ltv,d,asks.united started down the road,as we know,but withdrew when the pbgc applied for involuntary termination.the pbgc anticipated that if the pension plans were not terminated,and so continued generating new vested pension rights,the plans would go into default and as the insurer of those rights the pbgc would face a staggering liability.
the bankruptcy judge granted the pbgc application in an order that is currently on appeal to the district court.assuming the order is upheld,the pbgc will become the obligor of the retired pilots vested pension rights,though only to a limited extent.although airline pilots must retire at the age of,the pbgc does not begin to pay full benefits until the retiree reaches the age of.also,as we noted earlier,it does not replace any benefits.and it pays a maximum of in annual benefits to participants in plans terminated,as this one was,in.what is more,while the benefits that pbgc will be paying the active pilots when they retire will be on top of the replacement benefits that united has given them in exchange for the surrender of their rights under the pension plans,the retirees have received no replacement benefits.they do have unsecured claims arising from their contractual pension rights,to the extent they not compensated by the pbgc insurance,but according to the parties the value of those claims has not yet been determined by the bankruptcy court.that a puzzle the retired pilots have debt claims and debt is converted to stock in united plan of reorganization and it is possible to confirm the plan without knowing who gets how much stock.but it not a puzzle we need to unravel in order to decide this appeal.nor do we know what fraction of the claims will actually be paid.all that is clear is that the retired pilots have some financial stake in pursuing this litigation.
in the negotiations leading up to the letter agreement,the active pilots,represented by alpa,received as we know sizable compensation for surrendering their right to fight for their pension rights.the retired employees were bound to receive less.they lost less a retired pilot will have enjoyed the benefit of full pension payments since his retirement,while an active pilot who is near retirement will have been contributing to the pension plan for many years without receiving any benefits.more important,the active pilots had a stick to use against threat of a the retirees did have.but the retired pilots received not merely lower replacement benefits than the active pilots the
