hitachi capital america corporation hitachi appeals from the bankruptcy court order denying its motion to dismiss the voluntary joint bankruptcy petition filed by steven perlin and cristine perlin under chapter of the bankruptcy code.hitachi sought dismissal of the petition under a,on the ground that the perlins had filed the petition in bad faith.the bankruptcy court denied hitachi motion,reasoning that the perlins had been truthful with the court and their creditors and had not engaged in the kind of manipulative conduct at issue in in re tamecki,cir.in considering the motion to dismiss,however,the bankruptcy court refused to consider the perlins substantial income and expenses as evidence of bad faith.the bankruptcy court reasoned that the negative implication of the substantial modifications made to section b by the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of bapcpa or the act,pub,stat,which created a presumption of abuse against debtors having primarily consumer debts who have sufficient income to repay their debts,is that a bankruptcy court may not consider a debtor income and expenses in deciding a motion to dismiss brought under section a.
in this appeal,which the bankruptcy court certified directly to us pursuant to d b,hitachi challenges the bankruptcy court refusal to consider the perlins high income and expenses in assessing good faith.as explained more fully below,we hold that in adjudicating a motion to dismiss asserting bad faith under a,it is within the sound discretion of the bankruptcy court to consider a debtor monthly income and expenses together with any other factors relevant to a debtor good faith in filing for bankruptcy.nevertheless,because we conclude that the facts and circumstances of this case do not support a finding of bad faith,we will affirm the bankruptcy court order denying hitachi motion to dismiss.
steven perlin is a licensed radiologist.in recent years,working only,he has earned an annual income of approximately.at all relevant times,perlin wife,cristine perlin,owned and operated centre medical imaging,llc cmi,the medical imaging company where perlin practiced.together,the perlins expended a considerable amount of money on certain luxury items,such as two lexus automobiles and private school tuition totaling per month.in addition,they have saved more than for their retirement.
in july of,three months before cmi opening,cmi entered into a lease agreement lease with hitachi,whereby hitachi leased to cmi medical diagnostic equipment and other property in exchange for the payment of rent.and perlin executed a personal guaranty guaranty in favor of hitachi,whereby they agreed to guarantee cmi obligations under the lease subject to a limit of.
under the lease,cmi payments were due on a graduated payment schedule.under that schedule,cmi monthly payments ranged from in the first few months of the schedule to beginning with the seventh month and continuing through the end of the lease.
for the first six months of the schedule,cmi met its payment obligations in accordance with the terms of the lease.during that time,however,cmi began experiencing financial difficulties.it failed to meet its own income projections and failed to pay perlin a salary.beginning with the seventh month and forward,cmi failed to generate sufficient cash flow to make the payments due under the lease.
in february of,cmi engaged a medical imaging consultant to reevaluate the income potential of the business.the consultant determined that the original income projections were flawed.around the same time,cmi asked hitachi to renegotiate the payment terms of the lease on two separate occasions.hitachi refused to do so.
in june of,hitachi advised cmi by letter that it had defaulted under the terms of the lease by failing to make the payments due.after an period of forbearance,hitachi demanded that cmi pay the full amount of the indebtedness under the lease and that the perlins pay the full amount of the guaranty limit.cmi and the perlins failed to pay the amounts owed.
on or about august,hitachi filed suit against the perlins and other defendants seeking repossession of the leased equipment and damages.soon thereafter,the perlins filed an answer to the complaint.on or about january,hitachi filed a motion for default judgment against cmi.days later,this bankruptcy case ensued.
on january,the perlins filed a voluntary joint petition under chapter of the bankruptcy code,seeking discharge of their obligation under the guaranty,which stayed the litigation against them.in response to the petition,hitachi filed a motion to dismiss under a,alleging that the perlins had filed the petition in bad faith.hitachi claimed that the following factors supported a finding of bad faith the perlins had submitted allegedly misleading schedules to the court they had timed the filing of their bankruptcy petition around hitachi exercise of its legal rights against them they had artificially inflated their expenses in order to insulate their substantial income they enjoyed a substantial annual income and a lavish lifestyle,which included two luxury automobiles,private school tuition,and substantial retirement savings and they failed to make a good faith effort to repay hitachi as an alternative to seeking discharge.
the bankruptcy court heard evidence and argument of counsel on hitachi motion to dismiss.applying the tamecki framework,the bankruptcy court found that hitachi had presented sufficient information to shift the burden to the perlins to prove that their petition was brought in good faith.upon hearing testimony from the perlins,the bankruptcy court concluded that the perlins had met their burden of proving good faith and,therefore,denied the motion to dismiss.
in reaching its conclusion,the bankruptcy court reasoned that the perlins had been straightforward in their schedules,app.at,and forthcoming with the court and their creditors,id.at.the bankruptcy court found that the perlins substantial expenses were a ctual,but inflated.id.in addition,the bankruptcy court found that this case was distinguishable from tamecki,where the debtor had manipulated the timing of his filing of his petition.the bankruptcy court observed that it d id see tamecki factors here,id.at,and d id see a manipulation,id.
with regard to the perlins substantial income and expenses,the bankruptcy court opined that based upon the legislative history to section a and our comments in tamecki,a debtor ability to repay is not,in and of itself,sufficient to support a bad faith finding.moreover,going one step further,the bankruptcy court suggested that as a result of the recent amendments to section b made by bapcpa,a bankruptcy court is now precluded from giving any consideration to a debtor income and expenses in deciding a motion to dismiss brought under subsection a of section.relying upon a theory of negative implication,the bankruptcy court opined that the presumption of abuse under section b,which arises when a consumer debtor meets a specified test,excludes the possibility that a debtor ability to repay may be considered under section a.in assessing good faith,therefore,the bankruptcy court did not consider the perlins substantial income and high expenses.
upon certification of the bankruptcy court,this court granted hitachi petition,pursuant to d a,to appeal the bankruptcy court order denying hitachi motion to dismiss as to the following issue whether,in deciding a motion to dismiss for cause under a,a bankruptcy court is prohibited from considering a debtor monthly income and expenses when assessing a debtor good faith in filing a bankruptcy petition.
section a provides,in pertinent part,that t he court may dismiss a case under this chapter only after notice and a hearing and only for cause,and provides three examples of cause warranting dismissal.a.although a debtor lack of good faith is not mentioned in the statute,in tamecki,we held that a debtor lack of good faith in filing a bankruptcy petition is a proper cause for dismissal under section a.at.here,the bankruptcy court has certified the question of whether in assessing good faith under section a,a bankruptcy court may consider a debtor income and expenses,to which we turn below.
the first issue we must decide is whether the provisions in section b,which create a presumption of abuse against consumer debtors who have an ability to repay,imply that a bankruptcy court may not consider a debtor income and expenses in adjudicating a motion to dismiss under section a.because the canon of negative implication does not apply in this case,as explained below,we conclude that the new provisions of section b do not impliedly prohibit a bankruptcy court from considering a debtor income and expenses under section a.
the principle that the enumeration of one case excludes another is a canon of statutory interpretation.the canon applies only when the expressed and unmentioned items are part of a commonly associated group or series,united states vonn,d,justifying the inference that items not mentioned were excluded by deliberate choice,not inadvertence.barnhart peabody coal,d.in other words,the expressed item and the unmentioned item should be understood to go hand in hand,thus supporting a sensible inference that congress must have meant to exclude the unmentioned item.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.the canon is only a guide,whose fallibility can be shown by contrary indications that adopting a particular rule or statute was probably not meant to signal any exclusion of its common relatives.vonn,at.see burns united states,d an inference drawn from congressional silence certainly can not be credited when it is contrary to all other textual and contextual evidence of congressional intent.
by virtue of the act,congress enacted an test for consumer filings under section b,and in doing so,has expressed a clear intention to permit bankruptcy courts to consider a consumer debtor income and expenses in deciding a motion to dismiss under that subsection.congress has not created an test for filings under section a.the bankruptcy court suggested that congress singular expression of an intention to authorize bankruptcy courts to consider income and expenses under section b justifies the inference congress did not intend for bankruptcy courts to consider income and expenses under section a.as explained below,such an inference can not be made because congress has not treated consumer filings under section b and filings under section a as part of a commonly associated group or series.vonn,at.
as an initial matter,two separate subsections govern the dismissal of bankruptcy petitions filed under chapter subsection a governs the dismissal of all bankruptcy filings,when adequate cause has been shown,and subsection b governs the dismissal of only those bankruptcy filings involving primarily consumer debts,when granting relief would be an abuse of chapter.a,b.as indicated below,congress codified these two subsections at different times and for different reasons.
subsection a was enacted first,as part of the bankruptcy reform act of the act.at that time,there was no analogous provision to what is now subsection b,relating only to consumer filings.see in re padilla,cir pub,stat.codified as amended at a.it was not until six years later that congress added subsection b through the bankruptcy amendments and federal judgeship act of the act.pub,stat.codified as amended at b.moreover,unlike subsection a,subsection b was enacted as part of a package of consumer credit amendments in response to perceived abuses by consumer filers.see collier on bankruptcy.lh matthew bender,see also observing that there had been a dramatic increase in the number of consumer bankruptcy case filings since the enactment of the bankruptcy act.hence,from a historical perspective,congress has treated consumer filings under section b and filings under section a differently,not as part of a package or commonly associated group or series.vonn,at.
furthermore,the legislative history to the act does not indicate that the modifications to section b imply anything about the dismissal of bankruptcy cases under section a.as stated in the house report,the amendments were intended to respond to many of the factors contributing to the increase in consumer bankruptcy filings,such as lack of personal financial accountability,the proliferation of serial filings,and the absence of effective oversight to eliminate abuse in the system,at,as reprinted in,emphasis added.the amendments to section b effectively tightened the dismissal procedures for consumer filings.there is no indication that congress intended,contrarily,to restrict a bankruptcy court discretion in deciding motions to dismiss under section a.
in summary,we conclude that congress would not have considered its treatment of dismissal procedures for consumer filings under section b to go hand in hand with the dismissal provisions under section a.see peabody coal,at.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.as a result,we conclude that congress adoption of an test applicable to consumer filings under section b was not meant to signal any exclusion of factors from a bankruptcy court consideration of motions to dismiss under section a.
having concluded that the act amendments to section b do not,by negative implication,preclude a bankruptcy court from considering factors in deciding whether to dismiss a bankruptcy petition under section a,there remains the more salient question of whether consideration of factors is consonant with section a itself,as informed by our precedent and the legislative history.
hitachi asserts that in deciding whether to dismiss a bankruptcy petition for lack of good faith under section a,a bankruptcy court should consider a debtor ability to repay his debts.specifically,hitachi contends that a bankruptcy court should consider whether a debtor has substantial income or maintains a lavish lifestyle entailing excessive and continued expenditures,the adjustment of which would result in a substantial amount of net discretionary income.hitachi posits that a debtor who has an ability to repay his debts is not the honest but unfortunate debtor that the bankruptcy code was intended to protect.in response,the perlins contend that the legislative history to section a makes clear that in deciding whether to dismiss a petition for cause,a bankruptcy court may not consider a debtor ability to repay his debts.for the reasons stated below,we hold that,in deciding a motion to dismiss under section a,a bankruptcy court may consider a debtor substantial income and expenses together with other factors in assessing good faith.
in answering a question of statutory interpretation,we normally begin with the statutory language,but because section a does not touch on the question presented,we will begin our analysis by looking to the legislative history to discern congressional intent.see united states gregg,cir where the statutory language does not express congress intent unequivocally,a court traditionally refers to the legislative history and the atmosphere in which the statute was enacted in an attempt to determine the congressional purpose.here,the house and senate committee reports indicate that congress did not intend for a debtor ability to repay his debts to be adequate cause for dismissal of a bankruptcy petition 
the section does not contemplate,however,that the ability of the debtor to repay his debts in whole or in part constitutes adequate cause for dismissal.to permit dismissal on that ground would be to enact a mandatory chapter,in lieu of the remedy of bankruptcy.
at,as reprinted in,at,as reprinted in.as in tamecki,we read the legislative history to mean that a debtor ability to repay his debts out of disposable income is not a sufficient reason to dismiss a bankruptcy petition under section a.as stated by one court,i t is difficult to contemplate how congress could more emphatically have stated that the debtor net worth or future prospects is not cause as the word is used in section for dismissal.in re goulding.
while the legislative history makes clear that a debtor ability to repay his debts is inadequate cause for dismissal,we do not read the history as prohibiting a bankruptcy court from considering a debtor substantial income and
