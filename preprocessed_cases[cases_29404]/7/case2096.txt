facts and proceedings below 
we draw this statement of facts from the verified complaint and the declarations filed in the action.
plaintiff robert morin entered into a written agreement with defendants bert rosenthal and gregory pyfrom forming a limited liability company llc to manufacture and market a spark plug invented by morin.under the agreement morin transferred his rights to the spark plug to the new company,pyromor systems.the agreement stipulated if the company was not manufacturing spark plugs at the rate of at least a year by the end of the first year of the agreement morin could elect to dissolve the company and all its assets including the rights to the spark plug would revert to morin 
the pyromor members and their interests were robert morin,gregory pyfrom,bertram rosenthal and michael kerekes.the only person to contribute any cash to the enterprise was kerekes who put up.rosenthal was appointed manager of the enterprise.morin alleges that without his knowledge rosenthal and pyfrom agreed rosenthal would receive a month for his services as manager and pyfrom,an attorney,would receive a retainer for legal services on behalf of the company 
soon after the parties entered into the llc agreement disputes arose among them over who was and who was not performing their obligations under the agreement.pyromor,rosenthal and pyfrom sued morin alleging breach of contract as well as various business torts and seeking a declaratory judgment morin was not entitled to a return of his rights to the spark plug because he had failed to perform his duties under the agreement.plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed this action but filed a similar action a few months later.
while this litigation was pending rosenthal,as manager of pyromor,filed for chapter bankruptcy on the company behalf.he and pyfrom submitted creditors claims in the sum of based on their compensation agreements with the company.a company controlled by rosenthal then bid for the rights to the spark plug,the company only asset the bid stipulated that upon its acceptance the claims of rosenthal and pyfrom will be deemed satisfied and will be waived.the trustee agreed to accept the bid,there being no others,and with the court permission sold the rights to the spark plug to rosenthal.after the liquidation of pyromor assets,rosenthal and pyfrom dismissed their lawsuit against morin.
morin commenced the present action in the los angeles county superior court against rosenthal and pyfrom.the complaint alleges,among other things,breach of contract,breach of fiduciary duty,fraud,negligence,malicious prosecution and abuse of process.
rosenthal and pyfrom hereafter defendants removed the action to the bankruptcy court and timely filed special motions to strike the complaint as a slapp suit.the bankruptcy court remanded the action and denied the slapp motions without prejudice to refiling them in the superior court.more than days elapsed,however,before defendants refiled the motions.in the interim defendants moved to transfer the case from the west district of the court to the central district.the court granted this motion.defendants then moved to disqualify the central district judge assigned to the case.this motion too was granted.
defendants refiled their slapp motions five days after the case finally found a home in a courtroom in the central district.taking into account the unusual procedural history of the case,the trial court nevertheless determined the motions in the superior court were not timely filed and declined to exercise its discretion to permit late filings.the court awarded sanctions against defendants without specifying any grounds for its order.
we conclude the trial court acted within its discretion in denying the slapp motions but erred in awarding sanctions against the defendants without a written statement of the conduct or circumstances justifying the award.
discussion 
i.the trial court acted within its discretion in denying the slapp motions as untimely.
code of civil procedure has this to say about the timing of a slapp motion the special motion may be filed within days of the service of the complaint or,in the court discretion,at any later time upon terms it deems proper.the motion shall be noticed for hearing not more than days after service unless the docket conditions of the court require a later hearing.
morin filed his action in the superior court on march.defendants removed the action to the bankruptcy court on april.they filed their slapp motions in the bankruptcy court on may.
it is undisputed the original slapp motions were filed in the bankruptcy court within the day time period.the dispute is over whether the slapp motions were timely refiled in the superior court after remand.
the bankruptcy court remanded the action to the superior court on july.morin gave notice of the remand to defendants on july.on july,defendants moved to transfer the case from the superior court west district to its central district.the court granted this motion on september.on september,defendants filed an affidavit of prejudice against the central district judge assigned to the case.that judge ruled the challenge timely and ordered the action transferred to department one of the central district for reassignment.on october,the case was assigned to a new judge.five days later,on october,defendants refiled their slapp motions.in support of the motions counsel for the rosenthal defendants filed a declaration setting out the procedural history we have described above.
after reviewing this procedural history the trial court ruled the refiled motions were not timely.the court concluded the time for filing the motions in the superior court was tolled while the action was pending in the bankruptcy court.the court also concluded the defendants should have filed their motions within days from the date the action was remanded to the superior court but failed to do so.defendants did not file until approximately six weeks after the day period expired.in addition to this failure,the court pointed out defendants could have but did bring a motion requesting the court to exercise its discretion to permit a late filing of the motion.treating oral argument on the slapp motions as a belated request for extra time to file the motion the court ruled the request is not properly brought before the court.the court then went on to say insofar as i can look at the merits of the arguments presented belatedly as an excuse for the late filing of the slapp motion,i find them unpersuasive.the court noted defendants could have filed the motions and set them for hearing in the master calendar department of the west district where the action was originally filed.the motions would then follow the case wherever it might be transferred.the date and department for the hearing on the motions could always be amended.
we agree with the trial court decision the defendants were entitled to a new day period after remand from the federal court in which to refile their slapp motions.we differ from the trial court only in our belief the day period should run from the date the plaintiff gives the defendant notice of the remand,including extra time for mailing if the notice is mailed,rather than from the date of the remand itself.in the present case the additional few days are not significant.courts occasionally have to massage statutory time limits for filings in order to accommodate unusual circumstances the trial court ruling starting the day period after
