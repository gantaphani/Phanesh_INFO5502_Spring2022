bustamante brought an adversarial proceeding in bankruptcy court.bustamante sought a declaration from the bankruptcy court and relief from the automatic stay to the effect that his and campbell purchase of real property of the debtor,cueva,at the foreclosure sale,was valid and was not voided by the automatic stay.bustamante also alleged that the lienholders caused the foreclosure sale to proceed despite receiving notice of cueva bankruptcy,and he sought damages from them under the texas deceptive trade practices act dtpa.cueva counterclaimed against bustamante seeking avoidance of the foreclosure sale under the bankruptcy code automatic stay provision and alleged damages against the lienholders,campbell,and settle pou for violation of the automatic stay.the lienholders counterclaimed against cueva for judicial foreclosure of the lien against the property.
on january,the bankruptcy court entered a final judgment in the adversarial proceeding based on its findings of fact and conclusions of law in its memorandum opinion entered july,and its order supplementing memorandum opinion entered december.the bankruptcy court awarded bustamante an undivided interest in the property based on his status as a good faith purchaser without notice of the bankruptcy at the time of the foreclosure sale,together with judgment for of the accrued rents on the property.the court held that although the foreclosure sale violated,the automatic stay provision of the bankruptcy code,under c of the bankruptcy code bustamante did not have notice of the bankruptcy and therefore was a good faith purchaser,meaning his purchase of a interest of the property was valid.the bankruptcy court awarded the other interest in the property and the rents thereon to cueva,holding that campbell purchase of a interest at the foreclosure sale was void because he had notice of the bankruptcy at the time of the sale.the bankruptcy court held that because campbell purchase was void,campbell transferred no interest in the property to bustamante.the bankruptcy court also determined that bustamante was not entitled to damages under the texas dtpa against the other defendants the lienholders.the bankruptcy court also concluded that cueva could recover attorney fees,rents,and damages from the lienholders and settle pou for the value of the undivided interest in the property that was sold to bustamante and that ocwen could recover the proceeds from the foreclosure sale.
bustamante appealed to the district court,contesting only the denial to him of the property share awarded cueva,rents on it and,alternatively,a lien on the cueva share.bustamante did not dispute or appeal the denial of damages on his dtpa claim.
cueva also appealed.he contested the award to bustamante of a interest in the property and rents associated with that interest.neither bustamante nor cueva objected to or appealed the award of the foreclosure bid proceeds to ocwen.
after the issuance of the judgment of the bankruptcy court and during the course of the district court appeal,the property was sold with the approval of the bankruptcy court.the lienholders received the sales proceeds of in satisfaction of the lien,and settle pou paid the money judgments without prejudice to any issues on appeal.
on march,the district court entered its memorandum and order,holding that the foreclosure sale violated the automatic stay imposed by.observing that no party had sought retroactive annulment of the automatic stay,the district court reversed the award to bustamante of his share in the property.the award to cueva of his interest in the property was affirmed,as was the denial of a lien against the property.because the district court reversed part of the bankruptcy court judgment,it remanded the case to the bankruptcy court for further proceedings.bustamante filed a motion for reconsideration that was denied.
bustamante and settle pou filed notice of appeal to this court.bustamante now appeals the district court ruling in its entirety.he argues that he was entitled to both his interest and campbell interest in the property.settle pou appeals only the district court reversal of the portion of the bankruptcy court judgment awarding of the property and the rents thereon to bustamante.it is settle pou contention on this appeal that the bankruptcy court reached the correct result in this case for the wrong reason,and that its judgment should have been affirmed by the district court,and should now be reinstated by this court.the lienholders argue in favor of affirming the district court.cueva also argues for affirming the district court and makes some additional arguments that relate more to the disposition of the case on remand to the bankruptcy court.
