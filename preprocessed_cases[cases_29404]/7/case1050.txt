discussion 
we review factual findings of the bankruptcy court for clear error and review conclusions of law de novo.in re bonnett,cir.
the ultimate issue that we must decide is whether the bankruptcy court and the district court were correct in holding that emery obligation to pay the chapter trustee under the terms of the illinois circuit court order should not be offset by the allowance of her proof of claim for slander of title against gallo.to resolve this contention,we must address two issues raised by emery whether she has a valid claim for slander of title and whether the bankruptcy court erred in ordering the turnover despite her alleged inability to pay the amount in question.
emery submits that gallo committed slander of title by improperly filing the lis pendens notice.the notice was false,she claims,because gallo does not have a cognizable claim to the sanibel property based on the money judgment from the illinois circuit court.she observes that the court awarded her the sanibel property free and clear of any interest of gallo and that the florida circuit court quieted title,ex.at.emery contends that gallo did not establish that he acted in good faith in filing the lis pendens notice because he presented no evidence regarding his motive for doing so and because he lacked a bona fide claim to the sanibel property.specifically,emery maintains that gallo filed the lis pendens without legal justification because,at the time of filing,there was no ongoing litigation regarding the sanibel property.she further contends that she suffered damages because menkus would have paid her for the sanibel property if it had not been subject to a lis pendens.
we must decide whether gallo committed slander of title when he filed a lis pendens against the sanibel property.to establish a claim for slander or disparagement of title under florida law a party must show the following 
a falsehood has been published,or communicated to a third person when the knows or reasonably should know that it will likely result in inducing others not to deal with the plaintiff and in fact,the falsehood does play a material and substantial part in inducing others not to deal with the plaintiff and special damages are proximately caused as a result of the published falsehood.

we first must consider whether the lis pendens constitutes a falsehood.the supreme court of florida has said that t he purpose of a notice of lis pendens is to alert creditors,prospective purchasers and others to the fact that the title to a particular piece of real property is involved in litigation.s t builders globe,so d,citation and quotation marks omitted see also.stat.lis pendens protect s the plaintiff from intervening liens that could impair any property rights claimed and also from possible extinguishment of the plaintiff unrecorded equitable lien.chiusolo kennedy,so d.it is proper where the proponent can establish a fair nexus between the apparent legal or equitable ownership of the property and the dispute embodied in the lawsuit.id.
emery maintains that the lis pendens notice was false because gallo did not have an equitable interest in the sanibel property.the transfer of the sanibel property,as well as the payment to the bankruptcy trustee,both were governed by the same dissolution order.at the time the illinois circuit court entered this order,it noted that the allocation of marital property was unequal and favored emery,but noted that the inequity of the distribution would be somewhat offset by the payments emery would make to the bankruptcy trustee to fund gallo chapter plan of reorganization in the bankruptcy,ex.at the payment to the trustee was necessary to make the distribution of assets more equitable.the money that emery owed gallo,therefore,was very clearly related to the award of the sanibel property.by november,gallo had complied with the order by transferring his interest in the sanibel property to emery however,emery had not satisfied her responsibilities under the order because she had failed to pay the bankruptcy trustee.gallo has an equitable interest in the sanibel property and could have sought a lien on it in a florida state court as a remedy for emery noncompliance with the dissolution judgment.see wolk leak,so d,affirming circuit court decision to place an equitable lien on the former husband property where the former husband owed alimony and child support under an ohio divorce decree
