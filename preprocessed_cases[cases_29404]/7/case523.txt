opinion of the court 
in this appeal,we must decide under what circumstances a mortgagee may qualify for the protection afforded by b.section b of the bankruptcy code protects a mortgagee from having its mortgage modified in a chapter bankruptcy proceeding.it applies only if the mortgagee claim is secured only by a security interest in real property that is the debtor principal residence.
we have previously examined mortgages under this template and found them ineligible for protection under b.the district court,considering itself bound to do so by our precedent,held that the instant mortgage was modifiable because it fell outside of the protections of b.however,we conclude that the mortgage does qualify for the protection afforded by b because it is secured by rents,which are part of the real property in new jersey,and by an escrow fund for insurance and taxes,which funds are not the property of the debtor once put into escrow.we will,therefore,reverse and remand.
the district court had jurisdiction over the appeal from the bankruptcy court pursuant to a.we have jurisdiction under.our standard of review is plenary because the issues before us involve statutory interpretation and conclusions of law.in re johns,cir.
factual and procedural background 
manuel fernandos filed for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code in,listing as one of his assets his principal residence located at jasam court,toms river,new jersey.two mortgages encumbered the property the first held by litton loan servicing,and a second mortgage held by appellant in the principal amount of.appellant filed a proof of claim for.ferandos filed a motion to cram down the second mortgage,contending that the value of the property was no more than the amount of the first mortgage,and that since the mortgage contained an assignment of rents clause,it failed to qualify for protection of section b and could therefore be crammed down.the bankruptcy court determined that the value of the property exceeded the first mortgage by only and entered an order in favor of the debtor,cramming appellant secured claim down to,based on the bankruptcy court view that the assignment of rents clause constituted additional collateral that would take it out of the ambit of b.in other words,since the claim was not secured only by the residential real property,but also by rents,b did not provide appellant the protection from modification that it needed in order to avoid a cramdown.
the district court considered not only whether the assignment of rents clause constituted additional collateral but also whether the escrow provision of the mortgage rendered it ineligible for section b protection the district court held that our court precedent compelled the conclusion that the assignment of rents and the escrow provision gave additional collateral to the mortgage,thus removing it from section b protection,and accordingly affirmed the bankruptcy court order.
ii.discussion 
we now turn to the precedent on which the district court relied.by way of background,it is clear that the normal treatment of a purportedly secured claim in bankruptcy depends on the value of the collateral,and the claim will be considered to be a secured claim for the amount of the value and as an unsecured claim for the remainder.see in re johns,at in re hammond,cir.thus,a claim that is not fully collateralized can be modified,and the creditor said to be crammed down to the value of the collateral.a.
however,this treatment is proscribed for those secured claims that qualify for antimodification protection under section b,whereby a debtor may 
modify the rights of holders of secured claims,other than a claim secured only by a security interest in real property that is the debtors principal residence,or of holders of unsecured claims,or leave unaffected the rights of holders of any class of claims.
b.the issue,therefore,is whether the claim is secured only by the real property,or whether additional collateral has been taken by the mortgagee to secure the amount due under the mortgage.
the legislative history of b indicates that it was designed to protect and promote the increased production of homes and to encourage private individual ownership of homes as a traditional and important value in american life.in re davis,cir citations omitted.the statute does that by affording protection to home mortgage lenders in order to to encourage the flow of capital into the home lending market.see nobelman am.sav.bank,d stevens,concurring.as the court noted in in re williams,although there is little legislative history available for b,what does exist appears to indicate that by placing particular language into section b congress intended to protect only the residential home market financing industry this court concurs with the cases that hold that the true congressional intent behind the section b exception for claims secured only by an interest in the debtor principal residence is to protect the traditional mortgage lender who provides financing that enables individuals to purchase their home 
on the several occasions that we have had the opportunity to apply b,we have focused on the plain language of the section and have found that the grant of additional collateral sealed the mortgagee fate.in wilson commonwealth mortgage,cir,the mortgage agreement included not only real estate,but also any and all appliances,machinery,furniture and equipment whether fixtures or not of any nature whatsoever now or hereafter installed in or upon the premises.we rejected the argument that the items listed had no independent value,and had little difficulty determining that their inclusion rendered the mortgage subject to modification.wilson,at.
in sapos provident institution of savings,cir,the mortgagee acknowledged that 
the collateral which is the subject of the mortgage includes the residence together with the following described household appliances,which are,and shall be deemed to be fixtures and a part of the realty,and are a portion of the security for the indebtedness herein mentioned,namely,wall to wall carpeting 
in addition,the mortgage was secured by rents,profits,and appliances.id.we stated there that taking personalty,not just realty,as collateral,was fatal.id.at we further warned that if the lender does not want its claim to fall outside of the protection of b,it should not seek to get every last piece of collateral.id.at.
additionally,in in re hammond,cir,we found that the taking of appliances,machinery,furniture,and equipment removed the mortgage from b protection.there we considered not only our previous opinion in wilson,but also the effect of the supreme court intervening ruling in nobelman,which involved a mortgage that granted a security interest in the common areas of a condominium complex,escrow funds,proceeds of hazard insurance,and rents.
in hammond,at,we characterized our reasoning with respect to wilson 
we held in wilson that section b language plainly states that a mortgagee who has an additional security interest gets no protection from the antimodification clause of section b.id.the language of section b is unambiguous.the language of the bankruptcy judge bears repeating if commonwealth wishes otherwise,it should delete such language from its agreements.we also relied on collier on bankruptcy to buttress our holding that creditors who demand additional security interests in personalty or escrow accounts and the like pay a price.their claims become subject to modification.their recourse,if they wish to avoid modification,is to forego the additional security.id.citing collier on bankruptcy p at.
regarding nobelman,we concluded that although the supreme court ultimate ruling was that the mortgage at issue could not be modified,the court there concerned itself not with the nature of the lien on the items of the collateral,but,rather,with a different issue,namely whether section b permits a debtor to modify the unsecured portion of the claim as determined under section a.see hammond,at.in nobelman,at,d,the supreme court rejected the debtor argument and concluded,without discussing the nature of the collateral
