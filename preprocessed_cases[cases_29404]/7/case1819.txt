as is often true in the field of intellectual property,we must apply an antiquated statute in a modern context.the question that we decide today is whether of the patent act,or article of the uniform commercial code ucc,as adopted in california,requires the holder of a security interest in a patent to record that interest with the federal patent and trademark office pto in order to perfect the interest as against a subsequent lien creditor we answer no neither the patent act nor article so requires.we therefore affirm the decision of the bankruptcy appellate panel bap.
factual and procedural background 
the parties stipulated to the relevant facts matsco,and matsco financial corporation petitioners have a security interest in a patent developed by cybernetic services,debtor.the patent is for a data recorder that is designed to capture data from a video signal regardless of the horizontal line in which the data is located.petitioners security interest in the patent was properly prepared,executed by the debtor and timely filed with the secretary of state of the state of california,in accordance with the california commercial code.petitioners did not record their interest with the pto.
after petitioners had recorded their security interest with the state of california,certain creditors filed an involuntary chapter petition against debtor,and an order of relief was granted.the primary asset of debtor estate is the patent.petitioners then filed a motion for relief from the automatic stay so that they could foreclose on their interest in the patent.the bankruptcy trustee opposed the motion,arguing that petitioners had failed to perfect their interest because they did not record it with the pto.
the bankruptcy court ruled that petitioners had properly perfected their security interest in the patent by following the provisions of article.furthermore,the court reasoned,because petitioners had perfected their security interest before the filing of the bankruptcy petition,petitioners had priority over the trustee claim in the patent and deserved relief from the stay.accordingly,the bankruptcy court granted petitioners motion.the bap affirmed.
petitioners then filed this timely appeal.

discussion 
article of the ucc,as adopted in california,governs the method for perfecting a security interest in personal property article applies to general intangibles,a term that includes intellectual property.cal.the parties do not dispute that petitioners complied with article general filing requirements and,in the case of most types of property,would have priority over a subsequent lien creditor.the narrower question in this case is whether petitioners actions were sufficient to perfect their interest when the general intangible to which the lien attached is a patent.the parties also do not dispute that,if petitioners were required to file notice of their security interest in the patent with the pto,then the trustee,as a hypothetical lien creditor under a,has a superior right to the patent.
the trustee makes two arguments.first,the trustee contends that the patent act preempts article filing requirements.second,the trustee argues that article itself provides that a security interest in a patent can be perfected only by filing it with the pto we discuss each argument in turn.
preemption 
the analytical framework 
t he supremacy clause,art.vi,cl,invalidates state laws that interfere with,or are contrary to,federal law.hillsborough county,automated med,d quoting gibbons ogden,wheat.congress may preempt state law in several different ways.congress may do so expressly express preemption.id.at.even in the absence of express preemptive text,congress intent to preempt an entire field of state law may be inferred where the scheme of federal regulation is sufficiently comprehensive to make reasonable the inference that congress left no room for supplementary state regulation field preemption.id.quoting rice santa fe elevator.state law also is preempted when compliance with both state and federal law is impossible,or if the operation of state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress conflict preemption.rasmussen assocs.kalitta flying,cir quoting kewanee oil bicron,d.in all cases,c ongressional intent to preempt state law must be clear and manifest.indus.truck ass henry,cir.
the patent act does not contain preemptive text,so express preemption is not an issue here.concerning field and conflict preemption,the supreme court has adopted a pragmatic approach to deciding whether the patent act preempts a particular state law.bonito boats,thunder craft boats,d.congress,in the patent act,has balanced innovation incentives against promoting free competition,and state laws upsetting that balance are preempted.rasmussen,at.s tate regulation of intellectual property must yield to the extent that it clashes with the balance struck by congress in the patent act.bonito boats,at.emphasis added.
using this form of analysis,the supreme court has held,on numerous occasions,that the patent act preempts a state law that grants protection to a product.see,sears,roebuck stiffel,d compco lighting,d.those cases do not control,however,because we are confronted not with a state law that grants protection to a product but,rather,with a state commercial law that provides a method for perfecting a security interest in a federally protected patent.
that distinction is key because the supreme court has instructed clearly that the patent act does not preempt every state commercial law that touches on intellectual property.for example,in aronson quick point pencil,d,the supreme court observed that commercial agreements traditionally are the domain of state law.state law is not displaced merely because the contract relates to intellectual property which may or may not be patentable the states are free to regulate the use of such intellectual property in any manner not inconsistent with federal law.
the court also has held that the patent act does not preempt a state trade secret law even though the practical effect of the state law is to prohibit the public dissemination of information that,under the patent act,is not eligible for protection.kewanee oil,at.in kewanee,the court examined the purposes of the patent act and the state trade secret law at issue and concluded that the state law did not stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.id.at.quoting hines davidowitz.the court observed that the state law also encouraged invention,but did so by protecting a subject matter that was beyond the patent act horizon therefore,the two systems are not and never would be in conflict.id.at.
it is within this framework that we evaluate the trustee claim.the trustee argues that the recording provision found in requires that the holder of a security interest in a patent record that interest with the pto in order to perfect as to a subsequent lien creditor.section provides 
ownership assignment 
subject to the provisions of this title,patents shall have the attributes of personal property.
applications for patent,patents,or any interest therein,shall be assignable in law by an instrument in writing.the applicant,patentee,or his assigns or legal representatives may in like manner grant and convey an exclusive right under his application for patent,or patents,to the whole or any specified part of the united states.
a certificate of acknowledgment under the hand and official seal of a person authorized to administer oaths within the united states,or,in a foreign country,of a diplomatic or consular officer of the united states or an officer authorized to administer oaths whose authority is proved by a certificate of a diplomatic or consular officer of the united states,or apostle of an official designated by a foreign country which,by treaty or convention,accords like effect to apostles of designated officials in the united states,shall be prima facie evidence of the execution of an assignment,grant or conveyance of a patent or application for patent.
an assignment,grant or conveyance shall be void as against any subsequent purchaser or mortgagee for a valuable consideration,without notice,unless it is recorded in the patent and trademark office within three months from its date or prior to the date of such subsequent purchase or mortgage.
emphasis added.
if the trustee reading of the relevant portion of is correct,then to the extent that article allows a different method of perfection,it would be preempted under either a field or conflict preemption theory that is because recording systems increase a patent marketability and thus play an integral role in the incentive scheme created by congress.recording systems provide notice and certainty to present and future parties to a transaction they work by virtue of the fact that interested parties have a specific place to look in order to discover with certainty whether a particular interest has been transferred.peregrine,capitol fed.savs.loan ass in re peregrine entm t,see also littlefield perry,wall.noting that the patent act recording system is intended for the benefit of the public and that b ona fide purchasers look to it for their protection.if,as the trustee argues,the patent act expressly delineates the place where a party must go to acquire notice and certainty about liens on patents,then a state law that requires the public to look elsewhere unquestionably would undercut the value of the patent act recording scheme.if,on the other hand,does not cover liens on patents,then article filing requirements do not conflict with any policies inherent in the patent act recording scheme.
article itself recognizes the existence of preemption principles.california commercial code a expressly subordinates article requirements to those of federal law.that section provides that article does not apply to any security interest subject to any statute of the united states to the extent that such statute governs the rights of parties to and third parties affected by transactions in particular types of property.section a may be broader than federal preemption doctrine under the patent act.the text of a implies that article requirements are inapplicable to the extent that a federal law governs the rights of a party to a secured transaction,with or without a conflict between the state law and the scheme created by congress in the patent act.levitin painewebber,cir speculating that a of article calls for analysis more sweeping than traditional preemption analysis.
this possible difference in scope does not affect the result in the present case,however.as noted,the trustee argues that required petitioners to record their interest with the pto.if that is true,then the trustee has priority to the patent proceeds,either because there is a clear conflict between the state and federal schemes and the state scheme is preempted,or because the patent act governs the rights of parties to the transaction and a operates to nullify article filing requirements.we turn to that issue now.
the patent act requires parties to record with the pto only ownership interest in patents.
as noted,the patent act recording provision provides that an assignment,grant or conveyance shall be void as against any subsequent purchaser or mortgagee for a valuable consideration,without notice,unless it is recorded in the pto.in order to determine whether congress intended for parties to record with the pto the type of interest that is at issue in this case,we must give the words of the statute the meaning that they had in,the year in which the current version of was enacted see perrin united states,d giving the word bribery,as used in the travel act,the meaning that it had in,when the travel act was enacted.
our task is not an easy one because security interests,and the words used to describe them,have changed significantly since the century.see generally james white robert summers,uniform commercial code,at ed noting that,before the advent of article,the lawyer had to work with a variety of security devices,each governed by its own law.for example,before article,a party could secure property using a pledge,an assignment,a chattel mortgage,a chattel trust,a trust deed,a factor lien,or a conditional sale.grant gilmore,security interests in personal property,at.each type of device carried with it elaborate rules that controlled its use,and each conferred different rights and liabilities upon the contracting parties.see id,at noting that a considerable amount of case law was devoted to the invalidation of security transactions on the ground that one of the specialized devices had been used outside its proper field.article,which was first enacted in,brought the long history of the proliferation of independent security devices to an end.id,at.it did so in part by introducing a body of law that would govern a single,unitary security device the article security interest.white summers,at.
with that history in mind,we must determine whether congress intended to include the kind of transaction at issue in this case within the scope of.the first phrase in recording provision assignment,grant or conveyance refers to different types of transactions.the neighboring clause shall be void as against any subsequent purchaser or mortgagee refers to the status of the party that receives an interest in the patent.therefore,for the trustee to prevail in this case,petitioners transaction with debtor must have been the type of assignment,grant or conveyance referred to in,and the trustee,who has the status of a hypothetical lien creditor,must be a subsequent purchaser or mortgagee.we hold that neither condition is met 
as we will discuss next,our conclusion finds support in the text of,keeping in view the historical definitions of the terms used in the recording provision the context,structure,and policy behind supreme court precedent and pto regulations.we will begin by analyzing the statute text and context,as interpreted by the supreme court.for the sake of clarity,we will discuss the two relevant phrases in the recording provision of separately.
a.the phrase assignment,grant or conveyance concerns transfers of ownership interests only.
the historical meanings of the terms assignment,grant or conveyance all involved the transfer of an ownership interest.a patent assignment referred to a transaction that transferred specific rights in the patent,all involving the patent title,oliver rumford chem.works.noting that an assignment involves a transfer of a patent title waterman mackenzie.explaining that an assignment vests in the assignee title in so much of the patent itself william robinson,the law of patents,at an assignment is a transfer of the entire interest in a patented invention,or of an undivided portion of such entire interest,as to every section of the united states.patents,at generally an assignment of a patent vests in the assignee a title to so much of the patent itself,and transfers to the assignee an exclusive right to do everything under the patent which the patentee himself could do.footnote omitted.
a grant,historically,also referred to a transfer of an ownership interest in a patent,but only as to a specific geographic area.see moore marsh,wall.explaining that grants must convey the exclusive right,under the patent,to make and use,and vend to others to be used,the thing patented,within and throughout some specified district or portion of the united states,and such right must be exclusive of the patentee,as well as of all others except the grantee houdry process universal oil prods,a grant differs from an assignment merely as to the geographical area covered by the agreement.robinson,at noting that the essential difference between an assignment and a grant is the territorial area to which they relate.
although older cases defining the term conveyance in the context of intangible property are sparse,and its historic meaning tended to vary,the common contemporaneous definition was to transfer the legal title from the present owner to another.abendroth town of greenwich,see also,frame bivens,a conveyance is the transfer of the title of land from one person or class of persons to another.i bouvier law dictionary ed.defining conveyance as the transfer of the title of land from one person or class of persons to another i burrill law dictionary ed.defining conveyance as an instrument in writing,by which property or the title to property is transferred from one person to another black law dictionary ed.in the strict legal sense,a transfer of legal title to land.
that congress intended to incorporate the common,contemporaneous meanings of the words assignment,grant,and conveyance into the patent act recording provision can be seen when is examined in its entirety.see fda brown williamson tobacco,d noting that it is a fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme quoting davis.dep t of treasury,d.the first clue is the provision title ownership assignment.see united states kaluna,cir instructing that a statute title is a tool for interpreting the statute meaning.by using the unambiguous words ownership assignment,congress must have intended to introduce the subject that was to follow the ownership of patents and the assignment thereof.
continuing through,the second paragraph states that patents shall be assignable by an instrument in writing.that paragraph goes on to provide that the patentee or the patentee assigns may in like manner grant and convey an exclusive right under his application for patent to the whole or any specified part of the united states.emphasis added.the types of transactions referred to in second paragraph the assignment of a patent,and the grant or conveyance of an exclusive right in a patent in the whole or part of the united the historical definitions of assignment,grant,and conveyance that we just that all involve the transfer of an ownership interest in a patent.
moreover,we presume that words used more than once in the same statute have the same meaning throughout.boise cascade epa,cir.here,the second paragraph of uses the words grant and convey to signify the transfer of an exclusive right in a patent to the whole or any specified part of the united states.we presume,then,that when congress used the words grant or conveyance two paragraphs later in the same statute,congress still intended to refer to ownership interests only.
supreme court precedent supports our view that the terms assignment,grant or conveyance refer to ownership interests only.in waterman,the supreme court analyzed the nature of a patent assignment and mortgage.the plaintiff in waterman assigned to his wife a patent for an improvement in fountain pens.the plaintiff wife then granted back to the plaintiff a license to use the patent.that license was never recorded.the wife then assigned the patent to a third party as collateral for a debt the document concerning this arrangement was filed with the pto.finally,the wife assigned the patent back to the plaintiff.the question for the court was whether the plaintiff had standing to bring an action for infringement of the patent.the court held that only the third party had standing.at.
in resolving the matter,the court noted that a patent owner may convey,assign,or grant one of three interests 
the whole patent,comprising the exclusive right to make,use and vend the invention throughout the united states or an undivided part or share of that exclusive right or the exclusive right under the patent within and throughout a specified part of the united states.a transfer of either of these three kinds of interests is an assignment,properly speaking,and vests in the assignee a title in so much of the patent itself,with a right to sue infringers any assignment or transfer,short of one of these,is a mere license,giving the licensee no title in the patent,and no right to sue at law in his own name for an infringement.
id.at.emphasis added citation omitted.whether a particular conveyance qualifies as an assignment or a license does not depend upon the name by which it calls itself,but upon the legal effect of its provisions,id.at.that is,whether title is passed depends on the rights that were transferred by the contracting parties.only the holder of an ownership interest in the patent had standing to sue.
waterman contains no explicit holding that applies only to a secured transaction that effects a transfer of ownership,but it does imply as much.the court in waterman expressly differentiated between three kinds of transfers of ownership of which it labeled as versions of assignments and everything else,which it referred to as mere licenses.the court did not discuss grants or conveyances separately,but as a matter of logic,they must fall into one of the two overarching and mutually exclusive categories that the court created assignments ownership interests or licenses less than ownership interests and the kinds of transfers of ownership interests discussed by the court and labeled assignments correspond neatly to the historical definitions of the transactions delineated in the statute.see hillman at to observing that the patent act distinguishes assignments of patents of which grants and conveyances are specific types from all other transfers which are called licenses.it is clear,then,that the transactions that the court referred to as effecting a transfer of ownership are the same transactions that congress referred to as an assignment,grant or conveyance.
the court decision in littlefield compels a similar conclusion.in littlefield,a patent holder the defendant granted rights in a patent to a third party the plaintiff,but did so through two separate contracts.the court described the first contract as an absolute conveyance of the patent from the defendant to the plaintiff.in the second contract,the parties reserved some of the rights in the patent to the defendant.at.the plaintiff recorded the first agreement but not the second,and eventually he sued the defendant for infringement.the defendant argued that the plaintiff could not sue him for infringement because the plaintiff held only a license.the supreme court disagreed.
in evaluating the claim,the court examined the two agreements at issue.the court noted that,in determining which party had an assignment and which had a license,it was an important fact that only one of the parts is recorded the record ing of the first contract alone furnishes the strongest evidence of the intention of the parties to give effect to the two instruments as an assignment to the plaintiff.id.at.therefore,under the absolute conveyance,the plaintiff held an assignment,while the unrecorded agreement gave the defendant a mere license.
in summary,the statute text,context,and structure,when read in the light of supreme court precedent,compel the conclusion that a security interest in a patent that does not involve a transfer of the rights of ownership is a mere license and is not an assignment,grant or conveyance within the meaning of.and because provides that only an assignment,grant or conveyance shall be void as against subsequent purchasers and mortgagees,only transfers of ownership interests need to be recorded with the pto.see moraine prods.ici,cir patent licenses are not governed by the patent act,section being inapplicable to licensees.quoting rosenberg,patent law fundamentals keystone type foundry fastpress,cir i t had long passed into the that an assignee acquired title subject to prior licenses of which the assignee must inform himself as best he can,and at his own risk.jones berger,there would seem to be no doubt that a license to use a patent not exclusive of others need not be recorded a subsequent assignee takes title to the patent subject to such licenses,of which he must inform himself as best he can at his own risk.citations omitted sanofi,veterinarian,holding that there is no obligation to record a license with the pto robinson,at a license is not such a conveyance of an interest in the patented invention as to affect its ownership,and hence is not required to be recorded.
in the present case,the parties do not dispute that the transaction that gave petitioners their interest in the patent did not involve a transfer of an ownership interest in the patent.petitioners held a mere license,which did not have to be recorded with the pto.
b.the phrase subsequent purchaser or mortgagee does not include subsequent lien creditors.
the trustee argument fails not only because a security interest that does not transfer ownership is not an assignment,grant or conveyance,but also because he is not a subsequent purchaser or mortgagee.congress intended for parties to record their ownership interests in a patent so as to provide constructive notice only to subsequent holders of an ownership interest.again,we derive our conclusion from the historical definitions of the words,from the context and structure of,and from supreme court precedent.
the historical meaning of purchaser or mortgagee proves that congress intended for the recording provision to give constructive notice only to subsequent holders of an ownership interest.for the sake of convenience,we begin with the definition of mortgagee.
historically,a mortgagee was someone who obtained title to property used to secure a debt.see james schouler,personal property,at ed noting that m ortgages of chattels,then,are to be distinguished at common law from liens and pledges in this sort of transfer of the title conditionally which is carried by the original transaction.a mortgage must be differentiated from a pledge,a term that is absent from the patent act.professor gilmore,in his treatise,security interests in personal property,at,notes that the historical distinction between a pledge and a mortgage was that the mortgagee got title or an estate whereas the pledgee got merely possession with a right to foreclose on default.similarly,judge learned hand wrote,in,that it is everywhere agreed that the significant distinction between a pledge and a mortgage is that in the first the creditor gets no title,while in the second he does.ex parte crombie la mothe,in re german publ soc y,see also leonard jones,a treatise on the law of collateral securities and pledges,at edward white,ed defining a pledge as something more than a mere lien and something less than a mortgage,cited in black law dictionary ed.
that the patent act refers to securing a patent through a mortgage but not through a pledge is significant,for both were common methods of using a patent as collateral.see schouler,at noting that patent rights are constantly interchanged in our business community for the purpose of pledge gilmore,at if it ever was true that only tangible chattels could be pledged,it is well over a century since that proposition had any vitality.generally,the inclusion of certain terms in a statute implies the exclusion of others.united states kakatin,cir.it seems then,that by using the term mortgagee,but not lien or pledge,congress intended in for the patent act recording provision to protect only those who obtained title to a patent.
the term purchaser does not detract from this conclusion.section instructs that an unrecorded assignment,grant or conveyance shall be void as against a subsequent purchaser for a valuable consideration,without notice.the historical definition of a purchaser for value and without notice was a bona fide purchaser.a purchaser who takes a conveyance purporting to pass the entire title,legal and equitable,who pays value and does not have notice of the rights of others to the property.bouvier law dictionary baldwin century ed.the supreme court seems to have accepted this definition as well.see littlefield,at noting that b ona fide purchasers look to the patent act recording provision for their protection.
congress,by stating that certain transactions shall be void as against a subsequent purchaser or mortgagee intended for the words to be read together a purchaser is one who buys an ownership interest in the patent,while a mortgagee is one who obtains an ownership interest in a patent as collateral for a debt.
our previous comments about the context and structure of support our conclusion that congress intended to protect only subsequent holders of an ownership interest.as noted,the title of is ownership assignment,which suggests that the recording provision is concerned only with ownership interests.
similarly,the second paragraph delineates the types of transactions that covers the assignment of a patent,and the grant or conveyance of an exclusive right in the patent to the whole or any specified part of the united involving the transfer of an ownership interest in a patent.it follows that,when congress referred to a subsequent purchaser or mortgagee,it was simply describing the future recipients of those transactions.in one case the recipient bought the interest purchaser,while in the other the recipient loaned money and received the interest as collateral mortgagee.in either case,an ownership interest was transferred.
precedent confirms our reading of the statute.the supreme court has endorsed the view that congress intended to provide constructive notice only to subsequent recipients of an ownership interest in a patent.in waterman,the court observed,as we do,that the patent act refers to a mortgage but not to a pledge.the court noted that,when a party has the status of a mortgagee,
it is not merely the possession or a special property that passes but,both at law and in equity,the whole title is transferred to the mortgagee,as security for the debt,subject only to be defeated by performance of the condition and the right of possession,when there is no express stipulation to the contrary,goes with the right of property.
at.emphasis added.moreover,with title or possession of the property came certain rights in the mortgagee.id.at.but a patent right is incorporeal property,not susceptible of actual delivery or possession.id.at.therefore,when it is provided by statute that a mortgage of personal property shall not be valid against third persons,unless the mortgage is recorded,a recording of the mortgage is a substitute for,and equivalent to,a delivery of possession,and makes the title and the possession of the mortgagee good against all the world.id.at.emphasis added.
the court then observed that,once a mortgagee has recorded the transaction,that party is entitled to grant licenses,to receive license fees and royalties,and to have an account of profits or an award of damages against infringers.id.because the court had already noted that only the holder of an ownership interest in a patent could sue for damages against infringers,it is clear that the court read the term mortgagee to refer to a party who held an ownership interest in the patent.
in summary,the historical definitions of the terms purchaser or mortgagee,taken in context and read in the light of supreme court precedent,establish that congress was concerned only with providing constructive notice to subsequent parties who take an ownership interest in the patent in question.see in re transp.design,interpreting waterman as holding that the patent act is concerned only with transactions that transfer title city bank trust otto fabric,same.
the trustee is not a subsequent mortgagee,as that term is used in,because the holder of a patent mortgage holds title to the patent itself.waterman,at.instead,the trustee is a hypothetical lien creditor the patent act does not require parties to record documents in order to provide constructive notice to subsequent lien creditors who do not hold title to the patent.
public policies that underlie recording provisions can not override the text of the patent act.
the trustee argues that requiring lien creditors to record their interests with the pto is in line with the general policy behind recording statutes.it may be,as the trustee argues,that a national system of filing security interests is more efficient and effective than a system.however,there is no statutory hook upon which to hang the trustee policy arguments.moreover,we are not concerned with the policy behind recording statutes generally but,rather,with the policy behind specifically.
title,as we have demonstrated a
