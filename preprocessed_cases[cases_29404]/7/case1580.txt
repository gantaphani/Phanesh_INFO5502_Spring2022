this appeal involves a dispute between an indian tribe and the trustee of a bankruptcy estate over the rights of access to and occupation of a parcel of land completely surrounded by indian reservation land.the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to and.we have jurisdiction to hear this appeal pursuant to,and we affirm in part and vacate in part.
the center of the parties dispute is section,a parcel of about acres in pinal county,arizona.the land surrounding section is part of an indian reservation reservation belonging to the gila river indian community community,a federally recognized indian tribe.we start with the history of section and the reservation.
the community historically occupied the land that is now arizona.see gila river indian cmty.united states.cl.comm.through the gadsden purchase,the united states acquired title to land from mexico,including what is now section.the following year,congress adopted a law providing that when a survey was completed of the lands within the purchased territory,sections numbered sixteen and in each township,in said territory,shall be,and the same are hereby,reserved for the purpose of being applied to schools in said territory,and in the states and territories hereafter to be created out of the same.act of july,ch,stat.the lands were not literally meant to be sites for school buildings.instead,the state was able to sell and lease them to produce funds supporting its schools.lassen arizona ex rel.highway dep t.in,congress partitioned the territory of new mexico to create the territory of arizona.act of,ch,stat.section became property of arizona when a survey of the land was filed in.see united states pac.transp,cir.
in,congress created a reservation for the community.act of,ch,stat,see also gila river indian.cl.comm at.the reservation did not originally abut section the borders of the reservation were later enlarged through a series of executive orders.of relevance here,an executive order dated november,added to the reservation a parcel of land immediately to the north of section,and an executive order dated june,added to the reservation the land immediately to the south,east and west of section.the result is that since,section has been completely surrounded by reservation land.section can be accessed using road,an road that runs adjacent to the southern boundary of section and crosses reservation land before continuing west to the city of maricopa and east to the city of sacaton.section can also be accessed by murphy road,a road that runs adjacent to the eastern boundary of section and crosses reservation land before continuing south to the city of maricopa,and north for two miles until intersecting with another road at a point within the reservation.
the state of arizona held section until,when it sold the parcel to an individual named hodges,pursuant to a patent conveying the land together with all the rights,privileges,immunities and appurtenances of whatsoever nature and subject to any and all easements or rights of way heretofore legally obtained.section has since been sold several times,each time conveyed by a deed containing similar language.in,a company called s t dairy,owned by the children of michael and debra schugg the schuggs,purchased section and constructed a dairy on the property.in,s t dairy conveyed section to the schuggs.in,the schuggs sought to have section rezoned,from rural to transitional,a change that would allow construction of a housing development.pinal county rejected the schuggs application to rezone section.
also in,the schuggs declared bankruptcy and listed section as their largest asset.grant lyon was appointed the chapter trustee trustee of the schuggs bankruptcy estates.during the bankruptcy proceedings,the community filed a proof of claim asserting,of relevance here,that it had an exclusive right to use and occupy section,authority to impose zoning and water use restrictions on section,and a right to injunctive and other relief for trespass on reservation lands and lands to which it holds aboriginal title.in response,the trustee initiated an adversary proceeding seeking a declaratory judgment that the schuggs estate had legal title and access to section.the district court granted the community unopposed motion to withdraw the reference,thereby transferring the adversary proceeding to the district court.
in the district court,the community moved to dismiss the case on the basis that the litigation should not proceed without the united states as a party.see.the district court denied the motion without prejudice to its renewal.the community then filed an answer and counterclaims against the trustee.the community alleged,as it had in its proof of claim,that it held aboriginal title to section that nonmembers had no right to cross reservation land to access section and had therefore committed trespass to reach the parcel and that it had authority to establish zoning and water use restrictions for section.the community sought declaratory and injunctive relief prohibiting the schuggs from further trespass and compensatory damages for past trespasses.
on for summary judgment,the district court granted the trustee motion in part,ruling that the community did not hold aboriginal title to section.it denied summary judgment on all other issues.
following a bench trial,the district court issued findings of fact and conclusions of law.the district court held that the united states was not an indispensable party under rule.the district court also determined that the trustee had an implied easement over road to access section.it further concluded that the trustee had a right of access over murphy road,either because of an implied easement or because the relevant portion of the road was an indian reservation road that must remain open for public use.the district court held,therefore,that the schuggs had not trespassed on reservation land.the district court rejected the trustee argument that it had a right to access section on the additional ground that and murphy roads were public roads under revised statute,repealed.finally,addressing the community assertion of authority to control the zoning of section,the district court held that the issue was not ripe for decision.the community appeals from the district court judgment regarding necessary and indispensable parties,the trustee rights of access to section,and the rejection of the community assertions of aboriginal title and zoning authority over section.the trustee from the district court judgment that road and murphy road are not public roads under.
we first review the district court determinations,under rule,that this case could proceed without the united states or the individual indian allottees of land abutting section.we review a district court decision regarding joinder for abuse of discretion,but we review legal conclusions underlying that decision de novo.peabody western coal,cir.
a court first determines which parties must be joined under the criteria of rule a.see.a.then,if a party that meets the criteria can not be joined,the court must decide whether,in equity and good conscience,the action should proceed among the existing parties or should be dismissed.b.
the community argues that the united states was a necessary party to the dispute over the community aboriginal title claim and the trustee alleged rights of access to section.the community further argues that,because the united states could not be joined due to sovereign immunity,the case should have been dismissed.of course,the united states may be necessary as to some claims and not others.see makah indian tribe verity,cir indian tribes were necessary to some,but not all,claims asserted in the action.we first determine whether the united states was a necessary and indispensable party to the community aboriginal title claim.we then analyze whether the united states was a necessary and indispensable party to claims regarding the trustee rights of access.
aboriginal title is a permissive right of occupancy granted by the federal government to the aboriginal possessors of the land.united states gemmill,cir.it is mere possession not specifically recognized as ownership and may be extinguished by the federal government at any time,although such extinguishment can not be lightly implied in view of the avowed solicitude of the federal government for the welfare of its indian wards.id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.whether a tribe has aboriginal title to occupy land is an inquiry entirely separate from the question of who holds fee title to land.indeed,it is possible for a party to take title to land subject to an aboriginal right of occupancy.see,beecher wetherby,federal government transferred fee subject to an aboriginal right of occupancy.
with regard to the community claim of aboriginal title,we hold that the united states is not a necessary party under the criteria of rule a.the united states does not claim an interest in section.the united states granted section to arizona and has not since held it either in fee or as a trustee.fee title to the reservation land is held by the united states in trust for the community,but section is not,and has never been,part of the reservation.thus,the united states has no interest in section.
in addition,complete relief can be accorded among the existing parties without joining the united states.see.a.the community claim of aboriginal title is based on a theory that the federal government transfer of section to arizona and hence to all subsequent owners was subject to the community aboriginal title.the community argues that its aboriginal title to section can not be extinguished without the consent of the united states,and that the united states must be joined to obtain that consent.this premise is wrong.the district court did not purport to extinguish aboriginal title.rather,the district court determined whether congress had already extinguished the community aboriginal title.joinder of the united states is not necessary to answer that question.
because the united states is not required to be joined in order to adjudicate the community aboriginal title claims,we need not decide whether such claims can proceed without the united states under rule b.we also need not decide whether the united states has waived its sovereign immunity as to actions regarding aboriginal title.
we next determine whether the united states is necessary and indispensable to adjudication of claims regarding the trustee rights of access to section.in this regard,the trustee does not dispute the district court conclusion that the united states should be joined as a necessary party under rule a.the united states holds legal title to the reservation lands as a trustee for the community,and any right of access to section must run over reservation land.the united states therefore has an interest in the parties right of way disputes because judicial recognition of an easement would impair the government right.united states vascarajs,cir.if the claims regarding rights of access to section are resolved without the federal government participation in this action,the result may as a practical matter impair or impede the government ability to protect the interest.a b i.thus,the united states should be joined under rule a.
the district court concluded,and the trustee does not dispute,that the united states joinder was impossible because it had not waived sovereign immunity.we therefore review whether,in equity and good conscience,the action should proceed among the existing parties or should be dismissed.b.
the community argues that the united states is an indispensable party under minnesota united states.there,the state of minnesota sought to take by condemnation a for a highway over parcels of land that were part of a reservation and allotted to individual members of an indian tribe.id.at.the state named the united states,as holder of the fee in trust,as a defendant along with the individual allottees.id.at.the united states moved to dismiss on the ground that,although it was a necessary party without which the case could not proceed,it could not be sued due to sovereign immunity.id.the court held 
the united states is an indispensable party defendant to the condemnation proceedings.a proceeding against property in which the united states has an interest is a suit against the united states.it is confessedly the owner of the fee of the indian allotted lands and holds the same in trust for the allottees.as the united states owns the fee of these parcels,the right of way can not be condemned without making it a party the fee of the united states is not a dry legal title divorced from substantial powers and responsibilities with relation to the land in the stronger case of a trust allotment,it would seem clear that no effective relief can be given in a proceeding to which the united states is not a party and that the united states is therefore an indispensable party to any suit to establish or acquire an interest in the lands.
id.at internal citations omitted.minnesota did not distinguish between attempts to create new interests in land and attempts to have interests recognized.see also carlson tulalip tribes of,cir united states indispensable party to individuals action to quite title to land claimed by indian tribe as part of reservation.
although an action to establish an interest in indian lands held by the united states in trust generally may not proceed without it,that rule does not apply where the tribe has filed the claim to protect its own interest.we recognized this exception in puyallup indian tribe port of tacoma,cir.in that case,a tribe claimed beneficial title to twelve acres of exposed riverbed,and sued the port of tacoma,which possessed and controlled the land at issue.the port argued that the united states was a necessary and indispensable party,but we disagreed t he rule is clear in this circuit and elsewhere that,in a suit by an indian tribe to protect its interest in tribal lands,regardless of whether the united states is a necessary party under rule a,it is not an indispensable party in whose absence litigation can not proceed under rule b.id.at.we distinguished minnesota and tulalip tribes on the basis that those cases were instituted by for the purpose of effecting the alienation of tribal or restricted lands,not by individual indians or a tribe seeking to protect indian land from alienation.id.at.we recognized that our holding was somewhat incongruous,but it was nevertheless our circuit law whether the tribe is the plaintiff or the defendant in any given suit would not seem particularly relevant in a joinder decision under rule b,according to the factors set forth in the rule.we do not question,however,the distinction established in our circuit for determining indispensability under rule b.see also skokomish indian tribe france,cir united states not indispensable party to trespass and quiet title action brought by indian tribe.
the community argues that the trustee was the aggressor in this litigation because he asserted title to section by listing it as a bankruptcy asset,and because he initiated the adversarial proceeding in bankruptcy court.for purposes of the puyallup exception,however,we conclude that the community effectively initiated this litigation by filing a proof of claim in the bankruptcy court contesting the trustee title and access rights to section.it is true that the filing of a proof of claim does not make the claim disputed or initiate an adversary proceeding.see lundell anchor constr.specialists,cir the filing of an objection to a proof of claim creates a dispute which is a contested matter within the meaning of bankruptcy rule.but we agree with the district court the community really stands in the shoes of a plaintiff in this case.by filing a proof of claim asserting that the estate had no right to occupy or access its most significant asset,the community had to know that there would be an objection which could be litigated only as an adversary proceeding with the community named as the defendant.
the community argues that it was forced to react defensively to protect its rights by filing its proof of claim.the trustee did not seek to alienate section from the community,however it simply listed what it believed was an asset of the schuggs bankruptcy estate.in re,cir by filing the proof of claim,benedor voluntarily subjected the agreement underlying the claim to the bankruptcy court jurisdiction bass olson,cir w hen an adverse claimant comes into a bankruptcy court of his own motion for a determination of title to property,he consents to the entry of an affirmative judgment in favor of the trustee.moreover,the community proof of claim challenged not only the schuggs rights in section,but also asserted the community exclusive right s to use and occupy reservation lands surrounding section,asserted that the community possessed authority to impose zoning and water use restrictions on section,and sought relief for previous trespasses.filing a proof of claim contesting the schuggs right to occupy section did not inherently raise issues regarding access to and zoning of section.such disputes were solely raised by the community.
in light of these several considerations,we hold that the puyallup exception to the minnesota rule applies here.this case is more similar to a tribe seeking to protect indian land from alienation,such that the united states is not an indispensable party,than to a case of litigation instituted by for the purpose of effecting the alienation of tribal or restricted lands.puyallup,at.none of the specific rule b factors suggests that we should carve out an exception to the puyallup exception in this particular case.for example,the government interests are shared and adequately represented by the community.and this case presents significantly different circumstances than those in republic of philippines pimentel,which narrowly held that a particular suit could not go forward when it threatened to prejudice the interests of a foreign sovereign that had invoked sovereign immunity.id.at.the united states is therefore not an indispensable party to this litigation under rule b.
the district court also concluded that individual indian allottees of the land surrounding section were not required parties under rule.the district court observed that the community offered only conclusory statements concerning the individual allottees interest in this action.the district court also observed that,like the united states,the individual allottees were not bound by any judgment in this case.the community disagrees,arguing that these individuals claim an interest relating to the subject of the action,and that this case will impair their ability to protect that interest.
assuming,without deciding,that the individual allottees were required parties under rule a,the litigation could proceed without them under rule b.the allottees interests were adequately represented by the community.there is no reason to believe that the community did not make all of the arguments that would have been made by the individual allottees,or that the individuals would offer any necessary element to the proceedings that the present parties would neglect.washington daley,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
we next turn to the district court rulings on the merits.we review the district court findings of fact for clear error,and review its conclusions of law de novo.adams united states,cir.
we first consider whether the district court erred in holding that the trustee had an implied easement over reservation lands,across road and murphy road,in order to access section.the district court concluded that when section was conveyed to arizona as school land in,an implied easement to access section was also conveyed.this implied easement,the district court determined,then passed to all subsequent owners of section.
the community first argues that the trustee claim to a common law easement is preempted by federal procedures for obtaining rights of way over indian lands.although these procedures were not created until after conveyance of the alleged easement in,the community urges that preemption applies to the claim of the easement now asserted.but nothing in the scheme indicates that congress,in creating procedures for obtaining new rights of way,intended to preempt all claims to previously acquired rights of way,such that holders of easements would have to go through the new procedures.
to support its preemption argument,the community relies on adams united states,cir adams,at and fitzgerald living trust united states,cir.these three cases concerned landowners who claimed easements through national forests.they are of little help here because they dealt with an entirely different statutory scheme under which landowners whose property was surrounded by national forests were guaranteed reasonable access over federal land and therefore did not need a easement to cross it.even there,the presence of a preexisting easement is relevant to whether regulations governing access are reasonable.see fitzgerald,at.
we hold that the trustee claim of a easement to access section is not preempted by the existence of a regulatory scheme for obtaining new easements over indian lands.
we turn now to the merits of the trustee claims.the trustee argued that an implied easement gave the schuggs a right to cross reservation land in order to enter section.the district court agreed,holding that,when section was conveyed as school land to the then territory of arizona,an implied easement to the land also was conveyed,and the implied easement was conveyed to all subsequent purchasers,including the schuggs.
we first examine whether the federal government conveyance of section to arizona,as part of a school land grant,included an implied easement.courts normally construe federal land grants narrowly,under a longstanding rule that unless the language in a land grant is clear and explicit,the grant will be construed to favor the granting government so that nothing passes by implication.fitzgerald,at see also mcfarland kempthorne,cir.however,there is an exception to this general rule where the land grant at issue was made pursuant to legislation of congress designed to aid the common schools of the states in such cases,the grants are to be construed liberally rather than restrictively.wyoming united states,see also oregon bureau of land,cir.
it is true that the statute conveying section to arizona mentions no easement or right of access.but the question is whether the district court properly held there was an implied one.utah andrus dealt with a land grant to utah by the united states on the condition that utah use the proceeds of the granted lands for a permanent state school trust fund.the land so granted was surrounded by federal land.many years later,utah leased the land to a company that wished to mine it but could not do so without crossing federal land.the district court held 
given the rule of liberal construction of school land grants and the congressional intent of enabling the state to use the school lands as a means of generating revenue,the court must conclude that congress intended that utah or its lessees have access to the school lands.unless a right of access is inferred,the very purpose of the school trust lands would fail.without access the state could not develop the trust lands in any fashion and they would become economically worthless.this congress did not intend.therefore,the court holds that the state of utah and utah lessee do have the right to cross federal land to reach section,which is a portion of the school trust lands.
this reasoning is persuasive in granting lands to a state for the purpose of funding schools,the federal government must have intended some right of access to the land or the purpose of the land grants would fail.thus,in koniag,koncor forest resource,we similarly implied a right of reasonable access.f d,cir.in koniag,a partnership made up of indian villages owned surface rights to harvest timber pursuant to a grant from the united states,while the subsurface rights were owned by a regional corporation.we held that the indian partnership had a reasonable right to use the subsurface rock to accomplish its operations.in reaching this conclusion,we examined several factors,including congressional intent,the degree of necessity for the easement,whether consideration was given for the land,whether the claim is against the united states or against a simultaneous conveyee,and the terms of the patent itself.id.here,congress intent in granting section to arizona was to allow arizona to use or to sell the parcel to raise money for the support of public schools.the property would have had little monetary value if there was no right of access to it.
the community argues that we should not follow the reasoning of andrus because there the right of access was implied over federal wilderness land,not across indian land.the community argues that no right of access should be implied over indian land pursuant to the principle deeply rooted in the supreme court indian jurisprudence statutes are to be construed liberally in favor of the indians,with ambiguous provisions interpreted to their benefit.county of yakima confederated tribes bands of yakima indian nation,internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.the community urges that any diminishment of rights in their land must be accomplished by language showing an express congressional purpose to do so.solem bartlett.
the community argument ignores the fact that in,when the federal government granted section to arizona,the lands surrounding section were not indian lands.the community reservation,as created in,did not abut section.land north of section was added to the reservation in,and land to the south,east,and west of section was added to the reservation in.thus,when the federal government granted section to arizona in,an implied easement accompanying the grant would not have interfered with indian land at all.section was not surrounded by indian lands until,pursuant to an executive order specifically providing that the expansion shall be subject to any existing valid rights of any persons to the lands described.by this language,any easements were effectively preserved,including the implied easement to access section.we hold,therefore,that the district court properly implied an easement in the federal government grant of section to arizona,and that easement was not disturbed by the subsequent expansion of the reservation.
the community alternatively argues that even if an implied easement was created in for the benefit of arizona,it would not have silently passed to subsequent purchasers of section.but the deed transferring section from arizona to hodges in than a decade after the land became surrounded by the specified that the purchaser received all the rights,privileges,immunities and appurtenances of whatsoever nature.we have held that the word appurtenance will carry with it an existing easement.fitzgerald,at.subsequent deeds transferring section contained similar language.we therefore hold that the implied easement arizona obtained from the federal government in was effectively conveyed to each subsequent purchaser of section.
the trustee asked the district court to opine on the scope of any easement.the district court held that there was no actual controversy regarding the scope of the trustees easement,and properly declined to issue an advisory opinion on that subject.see generally lujan defenders of wildlife.
the trustee has not shown that there is a live controversy with regard to the scope of any easement.there is no indication that the roads or utilities as they currently exist are inadequate to support the current use of section,or that the trustee has any intent to improve the roads or utilities.the parties may disagree in principle over what activities the trustee may undertake on those roads,but there is as yet no particularized or imminent injury arising out of that disagreement.
the district court held that,in addition to or as an alternative to the implied easement,the trustee has a right to access section across murphy road because that road was an indian reservation road irr open to the public.the district court observed that the community had maintained the road and allowed public travel on it for many years,such that the owners of section came to rely on it.the district court concluded that the doctrine of laches barred the community from arguing that the relevant section of murphy road was not an irr open to the public.
an irr is defined as a public road that is located within or provides access to an indian reservation or other indian land.a.a public road,in turn,is any road or street under the jurisdiction of and maintained by a public authority and open to public travel.id.a.a public authority may include a federal,state or municipal government or instrumentality,or an indian tribe.id.a.irrs generally must be open and available for public use.certain irr transportation facilities a term that includes public roads,owned by the tribes or bia bureau of indian affairs may be permanently closed when the tribal government and the secretary agree.once this agreement is reached,bia must remove the facility from the irr system.id.at c.the irr system means all the roads and bridges that comprise the irr.id.at.
here,the community argues that the part of murphy road running across reservation land is neither publicly maintained nor open to the public.it submits that it once maintained the section of murphy road at issue,but stopped doing so when the bia removed that section of road from the irr inventory in early.the irr inventory is a comprehensive database of all transportation facilities eligible for irr program funding a.the community also asserts that the bia approved its posting of no trespassing signs on the road.it unsuccessfully attempted to introduce evidence in the district court about the bia removal of the relevant section of murphy road from the irr inventory.the district court excluded the evidence on multiple grounds.the community also moved for judicial notice of the bia action,but that motion was denied.
we hold that the district court erred in refusing to take judicial notice of this official action by the bia,which represents the bia opinion that murphy road is not an irr.courts may take judicial notice of facts whose existence is capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy can not reasonably be questioned.radio servs.qwest,cir.it must be taken when a party requests it and supplies all necessary information.d transmission agency of cal.sierra pac.power,cir although that decision is still subject to further administrative and judicial review,and therefore not finally dispositive of any issue in the case,the existence of the ongoing litigation within ferc is an adjudicative fact relevant to this case.further,the existence of the opinion is not in dispute,nor are its contents.therefore,we take judicial notice of the entirety of the decision internal citations omitted.the trustee does not allege that it would be prejudiced by the court taking of judicial notice of the bia action.indeed,the trustee was informed of the bia decision in a matter of days after it was made,and has apparently appealed the bia decision.
the district court decision also conflicts with the primary jurisdiction doctrine,which applies when an otherwise cognizable claim implicates technical and policy questions that should be addressed in the first instance by the agency with regulatory authority over the relevant industry rather than by the judicial branch.clark time warner cable,cir.this doctrine is not designed to secure expert advice from agencies every time a court is presented with an issue conceivably within the agency ambit,but should be used if a claim requires resolution of an issue of first impression,or of a particularly complicated issue that congress has committed to a regulatory agency,and if protection of the integrity of a regulatory scheme dictates preliminary resort to the agency which administers the scheme.id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
we conclude that the district court should not have ignored the bia removal of the relevant portion of murphy road from the irr inventory.instead,the district court should have at least stayed its decision pending ongoing bia proceedings on the issue.see clark,at.bia proceedings on the issue are apparently ongoing.the bia initial decision that the relevant portion of murphy ro
