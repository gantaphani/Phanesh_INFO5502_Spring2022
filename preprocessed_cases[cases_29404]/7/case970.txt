debtors,william and dina behlke,appeal from the decision of the bankruptcy appellate panel bap affirming the bankruptcy court order granting the trustee motion to dismiss this voluntary chapter bankruptcy petition for substantial abuse under b.section b provides that the bankruptcy court,on its own motion or the motion of the united states trustee,may dismiss a case filed by an individual debtor under this chapter whose debts are primarily consumer debts if it finds that the granting of relief would be a substantial abuse of the provisions of this chapter.there shall be a presumption in favor of granting the relief requested by the debtor.
the debtors argue that the bankruptcy court erred in deciding to include contributions as disposable income for purposes of determining the debtors ability to pay and in concluding that there was substantial abuse warranting dismissal under b.the debtors also argue that the bap incorrectly applied an abuse of discretion standard in reviewing the bankruptcy court decision.after a review of the record and the applicable law,we affirm the bankruptcy court decision.
debtors filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy under chapter.the trustee filed a motion to dismiss the case under b,arguing that to grant the debtors a chapter discharge in this no asset case would constitute a substantial abuse because the debtors have disposable income with which to pay their creditors.the parties stipulated to the underlying facts at the time of the hearing on the motion.on april,the bankruptcy court issued its decision setting forth the stipulated facts,the applicable law,and the reasons for finding that the trustee met its burden of demonstrating that these debtors are not needy and that granting them a chapter discharge would be a substantial abuse of the bankruptcy system.
there is no dispute concerning the stipulated facts,which the bankruptcy court set forth as follows 
in december,william behlke was about to become a partner in a large law firm in california at which he had been practicing for six years.
behlke left california and followed his then wife now his,karen,to ohio in an effort to save his marriage.

in february,behlke obtained employment with rubbermaid in its office of corporate counsel.
the dissolution of the marriage between william and karen behlke became final on april.william and karen behlke had one child from their marriage whose custody they now share.william behlke pays child support of per month.

in january,dina behlke then dina christopher left her employment as a paralegal and began mobile mobile is a business which is employed now exclusively by the law firm of friedman,domiano smith to go to the homes of their various potential personal injury clients throughout northern ohio and obtain the client medical releases and signatures upon retainer agreements.if behlke obtains the requested signatures,mobile is paid a flat fee for behlke services.if not,mobile receives no compensation.mobile is not reimbursed for behlke mileage or expenses.during the years and,behlke traveled throughout medina,cuyahoga,summit,stark,trumbull,portage,mahoning,wayne,carroll,holmes,geauga,columbiana,tuscarawas,ashland and richland counties for work on behalf of mobile

debtors are eligible for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code.
there was no dispute that the debts in this case were primarily unsecured consumer debts.
as the bankruptcy court observed,this court has determined that substantial abuse can be predicated on a showing of either a lack of honesty or a want of need.in re krohn,cir.the trustee did not rely on a lack of honesty,but maintained that the debtors were not needy.examining this question,the bankruptcy court found that the voluntary contributions should be included in disposable income that,including those contributions,debtors had an ability to pay out of future income and that,taken with the other krohn factors,discharge in this case would be a substantial abuse of the bankruptcy system.the bap affirmed on october,and this appeal followed.
standard of review 
we independently review the decision of the bankruptcy court that comes to us by way of appeal from a bankruptcy appellate panel.nardei maughan in re maughan,cir.the bankruptcy court findings of fact are reviewed for clear error,while its conclusions of law are reviewed de novo.nicholson isaacman in re isaacman,cir rembert v.at t universal card servs.in re rembert,cir.mixed questions are to be separated into their component parts and reviewed under the appropriate standard.mayor of baltimore in re,cir,cert.denied,d.finally,the bankruptcy court equitable determinations are reviewed for an abuse of discretion.id.citations omitted.
debtors contend that the bap erred in applying an abuse of discretion standard to the ultimate question of whether there was substantial abuse warranting dismissal,without resolving the question of whether the issue should be reviewed de novo or for an abuse of discretion.while it appears that the bap actually concluded that it would affirm under either standard,ours is an independent review of the bankruptcy court decision.
several circuits have stated,albeit without discussion or analysis,that whether the facts as found by the bankruptcy court constitute substantial abuse is a question of law that is to be reviewed de novo.see stewart united states trustee in re stewart,cir kornfield schwartz in re kornfield,cir first usa lamanna in re lamanna,cir green staples in re green,cir.on the other hand,the eighth circuit bap has held that dismissals for substantial abuse are to be reviewed for abuse of discretion.in re nelson.
while this court has not specifically considered the question of the appropriate standard for reviewing dismissals under b,we have concluded that a decision to dismiss for cause under a will be reversed only for an abuse of discretion because it is an equitable determination.indus.ins,zick in re zick,cir.in discussing the purposes of b,the court in krohn indicated that dismissal for substantial abuse is also an equitable determination.krohn,at b gives discretion to dismiss for abusive filing and allows bankruptcy courts to deal equitably with such debtors.in addition,both a and b provide that the bankruptcy court may dismiss and this permissive language leads to the inevitable conclusion that the decisi
