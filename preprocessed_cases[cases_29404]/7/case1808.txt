background 
in,spfc entered into an indenture agreement the indenture regarding the issuance by spfc of convertible subordinated notes the notes in an aggregate principal amount of approximately million.sections of the indenture are its subordination provisions.they subordinate payment on the notes to payment of senior indebtedness.the indenture defines senior indebtedness as essentially any indebtedness as defined by the contract of spfc that by its terms it is stated to be not superior in right of payment to the notes.indenture at.indebtedness does not include ordinary trade debt,so senior indebtedness does not include it,either.
section of the indenture provides that,when senior indebtedness matures or is in default,no payments may be made to holders of the notes until the senior indebtedness is paid in full or the default is cured.see id.a.section further provides that if any payments are made on the notes in violation of section,those payments must be turned over to the senior indebtedness until the senior indebtedness is paid in full or the default is cured.see id.c.
section of the indenture provides that in the event of dissolution,liquidation,reorganization,or distribution of the assets of spfc,the senior indebtedness must be paid in full before any payments are made on the notes.see id.a.like section,section further provides that if any payments are made on the notes before the senior indebtedness is paid in full,those payments must be turned over to the senior indebtedness until the senior indebtedness is paid in full.see id.c.but section contains an additional provision that section lacks it provides that in the event of dissolution,liquidation,reorganization,or distribution of assets,any payments to which the holders of the notes would be entitled,were it not for the subordination provisions,must be paid to the senior indebtedness,in addition to any payment to which the senior indebtedness is already entitled,until the senior indebtedness is paid in full.see id.b.that is,the senior indebtedness receives a double dividend in the section gets its share plus any share to which the holders of the notes would otherwise be entitled 
the provisions of the plan,as confirmed by the bankruptcy court,mirror the provisions of section of the indenture.that is,the plan provides for the payment of double dividends to senior gets its own share plus the share to which the holders of the notes would otherwise be entitled.see plan b providing that until the claims of senior indebtedness have been paid in full,all distributions of available cash that would be payable to holders of the notes in the absence of the subordination provisions shall be distributed pro rata to the holders of senior indebtedness.
in the bankruptcy court,spieker objected to this provision of the plan on the ground that it enforced section of the indenture,which spieker argued violated e.that provision prohibits the termination or modification of an executory contract,or any right or obligation thereunder,solely on the basis of a provision of the contract that is conditioned on insolvency of the debtor.see e.spieker argued that the indenture was an executory contract,that section purported to modify spfc payment obligations conditioned on spfc insolvency,and that section was therefore invalid under e.
the bankruptcy court approved the plan and rejected spieker argument,apparently on the grounds that under a,a subordination agreement is to be enforced according to its terms and if spieker argument were accepted,it would essentially put all unsecured debt on a par with senior indebtedness.
on appeal,the district court rejected spieker argument as well,but for a different reason.it held that enforcement of section does not violate e,because section does nothing to alter the rights or obligations of the debtor.

iii.discussion 
section of the bankruptcy code deals generally with executory contracts and unexpired leases.it empowers the bankruptcy trustee to assume or reject any executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor,subject to court approval.a.a contract is executory if the obligations of both parties are so unperformed that the failure of either party to complete performance would constitute a material breach and thus excuse the performance of the other.unsecured creditors comm.of robert helms constr.dev.southmark in re robert helms constr.dev,cir en banc citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
section e,the specific provision at issue here,provides 
notwithstanding a provision in an executory contract or unexpired lease,or in applicable law,an executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor may not be terminated or modified,and any right or obligation under such contract or lease may not be terminated or modified,at any time after the commencement of the case solely because of a provision in such contract or lease that is conditioned on the insolvency of the debtor.
e.this section was intended to deal with contractual ipso facto clauses,according to which the insolvency of a party automatically terminates the contract or constitutes a material breach see generally,at,reprinted in,stating that e invalidates ipso facto or bankruptcy clauses,which automatically terminate the contract,or permit the other contracting party to terminate the contract,in the event of bankruptcy see also bruder peaches records tapes,in re peaches records tapes,cal.by invalidating such clauses,e promotes the rehabilitation of the debtor by enabling the bankruptcy trustee to assume and thus continue in force beneficial contracts that otherwise would have terminated automatically or would have been terminated by the other contracting party.see,at,reprinted in,noting that enforcement of ipso facto clauses frequently hampers rehabilitation efforts.in short,the purpose of e is to protect the debtor from the enforcement of unfavorable clauses in executory contracts.
spieker contends that section is invalid under e because the indenture is an executory contract and section modifies spfc obligations under the indenture,conditioned on spfc insolvency.it then argues that,because the plan enforces section,the plan violates a,which requires that a plan comply with applicable provisions of the bankruptcy code.appellees counter that spieker argument must be rejected for various reasons section a of the bankruptcy code requires that the subordination provisions be enforced the indenture is not in relevant respects an executory contract section does not modify spfc obligations under the indenture section is not conditioned on insolvency within the meaning of e and acceptance of spieker argument would upset settled expectations in the capital markets,because the payment of double dividends to senior debt is a standard practice on which market participants have long relied.
it is clear at the outset that spieker argument seeks to apply e in a context in which it evidently was never intended to be used.the po
