common law settlement counsel,statutory and hawaii direct action settlement counsel,and asbestos personal injury appeal from judge koeltl reversal of a bankruptcy court final judgment.bankruptcy judge lifland had required appellees the travelers indemnity company and travelers casualty and surety company together,travelers to pay over million to asbestos plaintiffs based on travelers obligations under certain settlement agreements the agreements.the district court reversed,holding that conditions precedent to payment under the agreements were never met,and that travelers obligation to pay therefore never matured.
because we conclude that the relevant conditions precedent were satisfied,we vacate the district court order and remand with instructions to reinstate the bankruptcy court final judgment.in addition,given that travelers did not timely raise its arguments regarding the agreements conditions that the movants either execute a specific number of releases and deliver them into escrow or dismiss their claims with prejudice,we deem those arguments waived.finally,we hold that the bankruptcy court correctly applied prejudgment interest to the amount owed and that it correctly calculated the total payment due from the appropriate date.
background 
for many years,travelers was the primary insurer for the johns manville corporation manville,once the largest supplier of asbestos and products.in re johns manville manville i,b,b,b,b,b,b,b,b brl,wl,at.in,after health problems triggered litigation,manville,faced with the prospect of tremendous liability,filed a chapter petition for bankruptcy protection and reorganization.in re johns manville manville ii,travelers indem.bailey.
with manville entangled in bankruptcy proceedings,asbestos plaintiffs began to file suits against travelers and other insurers based on the insurers relationships with manville.manville ii,at.at the same time,travelers and other insurers were involved in a dispute with manville,and numerous contribution,indemnity,and cross claims were asserted among manville insurers.manville i,wl,at.
consequently,travelers and the other insurers entered into a settlement agreement with manville.pursuant to the settlement,travelers agreed to contribute roughly million to a trust established as part of the bankruptcy estate the manville trust in exchange for a complete release of manville liabilities.manville i,wl,at.the bankruptcy court provided extensive notice regarding the settlement,and it also appointed a future claims representative fcr to represent future asbestos claimants during relevant proceedings.in re johns manville manville iv,cir.
the bankruptcy court eventually approved the settlement and entered two orders,the insurance settlement order and the confirmation order together,the orders.manville i wl,at.the orders were meant to provide the broadest protection possible to facilitate global finality for travelers as a necessary condition for it to make a significant contribution to the manville estate.id.at.the insurance settlement order released travelers and the other settling insurers from obligations,enjoined all future claims for bad faith or insurer misconduct,and channeled all such claims to the manville trust.id.at.the confirmation order confirmed manville reorganization plan,incorporating the insurance settlement order by reference and enjoining all persons from commencing any action against any of the settling insurance companies for the purpose of,directly or indirectly,collecting,recovering or receiving payment of,on or with respect to any claim or other asbestos obligation id.at internal citation and quotation marks omitted.
despite the orders,asbestos plaintiffs filed more actions against travelers in several states.id.at.the majority of these claims did not allege violations derivative of manville actions instead,they were based on travelers own alleged wrongdoing as manville insurer.although it is a misnomer,see infra note,we will style these claims as the direct actions.the direct actions were brought by three categories of plaintiffs.we will call them the statutory direct action plaintiffs,hawaii direct action plaintiffs,and common law direct action plaintiffs.they asserted two categories of claims.first,the statutory direct action plaintiffs and hawaii direct action plaintiffs alleged,among other things,that travelers conspired to violate state laws prohibiting unfair insurance practices by fraudulently perpetuating a state of the art defense,id.at,and allegedly misrepresenting manville knowledge of asbestos hazards.second,the common law direct action plaintiffs claimed similarly that travelers violated common law duties when it failed to disclose what it knew about asbestos hazards from its relationship with manville.id.at 
relying on the orders,in june,travelers moved before the bankruptcy court to enjoin the direct actions.manville ii,at.the bankruptcy court issued a temporary restraining order against prosecution of certain lawsuits against travelers but also referred the matter to mediation.id.the mediation,conducted by former new york governor mario cuomo,resulted in the three settlement agreements between travelers and the statutory,hawaii,and common law direct action plaintiffs.in re johns manville manville iii,cir manville i,wl,at.in all,travelers agreed to pay up to million to the statutory plaintiffs,up million to the hawaii plaintiffs,and up to million to common law plaintiffs,in three respective funds separate from the manville trust.manville i,wl,at.
under the agreements,the direct action plaintiffs were to be paid from the funds,but only after three conditions were satisfied.id.at.these conditions,described in detail immediately infra,concerned the breadth of an order to be entered by the bankruptcy court clarifying order regarding the interpretation of the orders,the finality of the clarifying order,and various provisions regarding disposal of the direct actions.
first,the agreements required that the bankruptcy court,once it approved the settlements,enter a clarifying order.the statutory and hawaii direct action settlement agreements required that the clarifying order contain prohibitions against claims at least as broad as those contained in exhibit app.at.similarly,the common law direct action agreement required that the clarifying order contain language substantially in the form of exhibit id.at.
exhibit a of each agreement was a proposed clarifying order containing provisions barring all claims against travelers arising out of,or relating to,travelers handling of claims,including contribution and indemnity claims.the proposed clarifying order also expressly barred the new,nonderivative direct actions that were the subject of the settlements.finally,each exhibit a conveyed that the proposed clarifying order is an order clarifying the confirmation order of the orders and that all the barred claims listed within the proposed clarifying order were covered by the confirmation order and permanently enjoined as against travelers,which was released therefrom under the confirmation order.id.at.
second,the clarifying order had to become a final order under the agreements definition,an order from which no appeal is taken,or an order that has been affirmed by the highest court to which such order was appealed or certiorari has been denied and the time to take any further appeal or petition for certiorari shall have expired.id.at.
third,another set of conditions precedent required either the execution and delivery into escrow of at least general releases of claims under the statutory direct action settlement agreement,at least general releases of claims against travelers under the common law direct action settlement agreement,or dismissals with prejudice of all named plaintiffs pending claims against travelers under the hawaii direct action settlement agreement.
with the agreements in place,the parties moved for the bankruptcy court approval in.manville i,wl,at.various third parties filed objections,including chubb indemnity insurance company chubb.chubb issued insurance it never insured complained that any potential contribution and indemnification claims it might have against travelers would be unlawfully barred if the clarifying order were entered by the bankruptcy court.manville ii,at,see also manville iv,at.chubb and the other objectors argued that the bankruptcy court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to enjoin third parties direct actions and related claims against nondebtors.additionally,chubb objected on due process grounds,arguing that it could not be bound by the clarifying order because it had never received constitutionally sufficient notice of the orders.manville iv,at.
on august,the bankruptcy court rejected the objections and approved all three agreements.it also entered the clarifying order the orders.the language of clarifying order was substantially the same as the language contained in each agreement appended exhibit a.the bankruptcy court concluded that it had authority to enter both the clarifying order and the orders,and that the direct actions and related contribution and indemnity claims were barred by the orders manville i,wl,at.
chubb and the other objectors appealed.the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court order in all material respects.it concluded that the bankruptcy court had authority to enter the clarifying order because it had jurisdiction to enter the orders and that the clarifying order interpreted and enforced those orders.manville ii,at.the district court also reasoned that chubb,a sophisticated insurer,received sufficient notice regarding its purported claims.id.at.it determined further that,even if notice in the usual sense was lacking,chubb claims could be foreclosed upon because of the special nature of the remedial scheme at issue reorganization of the bankruptcy estate.id.at.
the objectors appealed again,and this court vacated and remanded,concluding that entry of the orders as interpreted by the clarifying order exceeded the proper bounds of the bankruptcy court jurisdiction insofar as they enjoined claims,nonderivative of the debtor wrongdoing,that did not seek recompense from the manville corpus.manville iii,at.having vacated on these grounds,this court deemed it unnecessary to reach chubb due process argument.id.at.
the supreme court granted certiorari and then reversed.bailey,at.the court held that the direct actions were and always had been barred by the orders,and it concluded that this court had erred in reevaluating the bankruptcy court jurisdiction to enter those orders the orders became final on direct review over two decades ago whether the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction and authority to enter the injunction in was not properly before th e court in id.at.
the court concluded that the clarifying order entry was a proper exercise of the bankruptcy court jurisdiction because it plainly had jurisdiction to interpret and enforce its own prior orders.id.at.the clarifying order,therefore,did not expand the scope of the orders.the court did not determine,however,whether any parties in particular were bound by the orders,nor did it assess the propriety,as a general matter,of a bankruptcy court enjoining claims against nondebtors that were not derivative of the debtor wrongdoing.see id.at.the supreme court remanded for this court to consider whether chubb was bound by the orders and the clarifying order.id.at.
on remand,this court concluded that chubb was not bound by the orders nor,by extension,the clarifying order because it had not been afforded constitutionally sufficient notice of the orders and their attendant proceedings.manville iv,at.underpinning this holding was the determination that the bankruptcy court interpreted the orders to have in personam,not just in rem,effect.id.at.this court expressly refused to determine the effect of this holding on the agreements,however,leaving remaining issues to be resolved by the parties,with the aid of the bankruptcy court.id.at 
in september,counsel for the direct action plaintiffs,claiming that all the conditions precedent had been satisfied,moved before the bankruptcy court to compel travelers to make the payments required by the agreements.travelers objected,contending only that the breadth and finality conditions precedent to payment under the agreements were unsatisfied because chubb was now free to bring claims against it.in re johns manville manville v.
the bankruptcy court granted the direct action settlement counsel motions to compel.see id.at.the court concluded that the disputed conditions precedent had been satisfied.it reasoned that i a clarifying order of the required breadth had been entered in,see id.at ii the order became a final order when it was affirmed by the supreme court,the court of last resort,in bailey on june,id.at and,iii even after manville iv holding that chubb was not bound by the injunctions due to its lack of notice,the order enjoined the breadth of claims,id.it explicitly noted for the record that satisfaction of the conditions precedent was not disputed by travelers.id.at.the bankruptcy court directed travelers to fulfill its payment obligations immediately.id.at.
proceedings regarding the propriety and amount,if any,of prejudgment interest then began.travelers sought to broaden the issues by claiming,for the first time,that the agreements conditions precedent regarding disposal of the direct actions had not been met.the bankruptcy court rejected this attempt on the ground that travelers had not asserted this issue in response to the motion to compel.a final judgment was subsequently issued against travelers requiring it to pay over more than million more than million of which was prejudgment interest.
the district court reversed on february,holding that the disputed conditions precedent had not been satisfied because i the breadth of the language represented in each agreement exhibit a had been narrowed by this court manville iv decision and ii the clarifying order never became a final order as defined in the agreements.in re johns manville manville vi,d.the district court therefore did not determine whether other conditions precedent under the agreements had been satisfied,nor did it rule on matters pertaining to the bankruptcy court award of prejudgment interest.this appeal followed.
discussion 
we review a bankruptcy court decision that has subsequently been appealed to the district court independently.in re baker,cir.in doing so,we accept the bankruptcy court factual findings unless clearly erroneous but review its conclusions of law de novo.id.
a contested conditions precedent 
the interpretation of unambiguous terms is a question of law subject to de novo review.see tourangeau uniroyal,cir.the agreements here are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of new york.app.at.under new york law,a written agreement that is complete,clear and unambiguous on its face must be enforced according to the plain meaning of its terms.greenfield philles records.new york law also requires strict compliance with settlement agreements,which are binding and enforceable contracts between parties.idt tyco.further,e xpress conditions must be literally performed substantial performance will not suffice.mhr capital partners lp presstek.
breadth and finality of the clarifying order 
the parties primarily contest whether i the breadth of the bankruptcy court clarifying order met the breadth requirement in exhibit a of the agreements and ii the clarifying order became final within the definition of the agreements.these questions,of course,govern whether the conditions precedent to travelers obligation to pay have been satisfied.we conclude that they have been satisfied.
under both the statutory and hawaii direct action settlement agreements,the relevant condition precedent requires entry of a clarifying order containing prohibitions against claims at least as broad as those contained in exhibit a app.at.similarly,under the common law direct action agreement,the relevant condition precedent requires the e ntry of an order or orders of the bankruptcy court,issued pursuant to the orders substantially in the form attached hereto as exhibit a id.at.
we begin by observing that the injunctive language found in each agreement appended exhibit a was included,nearly verbatim,in the clarifying order.travelers concedes as much.but travelers argues,and the district court agreed,that this court holding in manville iv diminished the reach of the clarifying order because the order became jurisdictionally void as to chubb,at,which failed to receive constitutionally sufficient notice of the orders.travelers asserts that,consequently,the clarifying order does not contain prohibitions against claims at least as broad as those in exhibit a,because chubb could potentially bring a claim against travelers.brief for appellees at internal quotation marks omitted.we disagree.
the clarifying order injunctive language was affirmed in bailey and has not been altered since.in bailey,the supreme court determined that the bankruptcy court had,in substance,properly interpreted the orders in the clarifying order with respect to the new,nonderivative direct actions the bankruptcy court correctly understood that the direct actions fall within the scope of the orders at.the injunction that bailey approved,therefore,bars not only those traditional claims that sought redress from travelers based on manville own wrongdoing,but also those nonderivative claims against nondebtor travelers that were the subject of the settlement negotiations.the clarifying order,as a restatement of the orders injunction,precludes claimants who have brought any direct actions or related indemnity or contribution claims from further prosecution of those claims against travelers.id.at manville vi,d at.
travelers had maintained that the orders enjoined the direct actions throughout the settlement negotiations,manville i,wl,at,but its position was not vindicated until bailey was issued.bailey thus affirmed the scope of the injunctive language contained within the agreements exhibit as,and the clarifying order bars all such claims all it was meant to do.
the fact that chubb may collaterally attack the applicability of the clarifying order to actions it might bring because it never received constitutionally sufficient notice does not alter our conclusion.the error in travelers reading of the clarifying order stems from the conflation of two separate issues i a party ability to collaterally attack an order for lack of constitutional notice and ii the integrity of that order and the breadth of claims it bars.
travelers reading asks us to adopt an interpretation of the clarifying order that could not reasonably have been intended by the parties,whatever travelers private hopes and dreams,and is not supported by the language of the agreements.the interpretation proposed by travelers would have required the bankruptcy court either to i certify that all potential claimants all entities and individuals on the planet,from now until the end of time have received constitutionally sufficient notice of the orders and their relevant proceedings or ii bar all claimants whether or not they had constitutionally sufficient notice.but neither action could have been intended by sophisticated parties because each would have been well beyond the bankruptcy court power.undoubtedly,that is the reason why no such requirement is found in the agreements terms or their exhibit as,whatever travelers secret or subjective intent.klos lotnicze,cir.
the district court disagreed that travelers position required the bankruptcy court to enter an order clarifying that all direct action claims were enjoined regardless of whether the parties received constitutionally sufficient notice of the orders.manville vi,d at quoting manville v,at.it correctly noted that travelers is not seeking to enforce an injunction against claimants in an unconstitutional manner but is asking only for a recognition that the disputed condition precedent was never fulfilled.however,this argument,like the argument rejected above,proceeds on the erroneous premise that the agreements called for a clarifying order that bound entities without constitutionally sufficient notice.as such,the agreements,or the ensuing clarifying order,would have been a nullity,and common canons of contract construction call upon us to reject such an interpretation,see restatement second of contracts,which is not a difficult task where,as here,such an interpretation finds no support in the language.
moreover,travelers interpretation amounts to a contractual term that is incapable of ever being fulfilled,because some claimant somewhere on the planet could always appear to attack the order collaterally.see id.cmt.b.such an impossible condition with no support in contractual language and clearly not intended by the parties would have rendered the contract a nullity from its inception.see id.
travelers interpretation must be rejected for the additional reason that the parties bargained only for a clarification,not an expansion,of the orders,and the jurisdictional reach of those orders was already at issue at the time of negotiations.leaving aside the separate issue,discussed supra,of whether the bankruptcy court could have extended the orders scope,the portions of the agreements at issue here evidence no intent by the parties that the clarifying order would do so.manville iv,therefore,was rooted in an interpretation of the breadth of the and clarifying orders,but that breadth had already been determined to be coextensive with respect to the issues here and could not have been affected by our decision in that case.
rooted in the orders,the clarifying order could bar claims only by those parties that received constitutionally sufficient notice of the orders and relevant proceedings.as a party to the proceedings leading up to the orders,travelers knew the scope of notice attendant to those proceedings.for example,travelers knew that an fcr was appointed by the bankruptcy court to represent the interests of future asbestos claimants,but that no equivalent fcr had been appointed regarding the interests of future indemnity and contribution claimants.
to be sure,had travelers believed that the bankruptcy court exercised in rem as opposed to in personam jurisdiction in entering the orders,it might also have believed that the clarifying order injunction barred chubb attack.see,manville ii,at.of course,the in personam nature of the jurisdiction exercised by the bankruptcy court in releasing nondebtors from claims demands that any party barred by the orders and by extension,the clarifying order must have received constitutionally sufficient notice accordant with that jurisdiction.
but travelers recognized the possibility of this in its october,submission,travelers argued that the bankruptcy court notice procedures relating to the orders were wholly consistent with the exercise of both in rem jurisdiction and in personam jurisdiction over all chubb entities.manville iv,at.travelers also conceded that the claims underlying the direct actions,which were the subject of the negotiations,were unimaginable during the proceedings that led to the orders.travelers reply brief at,manville v brl app.at.
nonetheless,the pertinent portions of the agreements did not provide for an injunction any greater than that contained within the orders,nor did they address issues of notice or due process.a court will not imply a term where the circumstances surrounding the formation of the contract indicate that the parties,when the contract was made,must have foreseen the contingency at issue and the agreement can be enforced according to its terms.reiss fin.performance.we decline travelers invitation to look beyond the agreements obvious meaning and to consider travelers subjective hopes.
we therefore hold the clarifying order contains an injunction as broad as,or substantially in the form of,that contained in the agreements exhibit as.
b finality 
we next consider whether the clarifying order became final and unappealable after the supreme court ruling in bailey.travelers argues here,and the district court concluded,that when manville iv reversed the district court decision as to chubb,d at,it rendered the clarifying order not final.we conclude,as the bankruptcy court did,that the clarifying order became final under the agreements definition once bailey was decid
