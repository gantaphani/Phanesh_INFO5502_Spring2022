bankruptcy 
the en banc court affirmed the district court judgment,which affirmed the bankruptcy court affirmance of a chapter plan of reorganization,as modified on remand from the district court.
the debtor sought,over a secured creditor objection,to retain and use the creditor collateral in the chapter plan through a cram down.pursuant to a,the creditor claim was treated as secured to the extent of the value of such creditor interest.that value was determined in light of the purpose of the valuation and of the proposed disposition or use of such property.under associates commercial rash,a standard,rather than a standard,applies to valuations.
here,unlike in a typical case,foreclosure value exceeded replacement value because foreclosure would vitiate covenants requiring that the secured property,an apartment complex,be used for housing.the en banc court nonetheless held that,under rash,a required the use of replacement value rather than a hypothetical value derived from the very foreclosure that the reorganization was designed to avoid.thus,the bankruptcy court did not err in approving the debtor plan of reorganization and valuing the collateral assuming its continued use after reorganization as housing.
the en banc court held that the plan of reorganization was fair and equitable,as required by b,because the creditor retained its lien and received the present value of its allowed claim over the term of the plan.the secured claim was not undervalued,and the plan provided for payments equal to the present value of the secured claim.
the en banc court held that the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in finding the plan of reorganization feasible.
finally,the en banc court held that the bankruptcy court did not err in failing to allow the creditor,on remand,to make a second election to have its claim treated as either fully or partially secured under b.
dissenting,judge kozinski,joined by judges and friedland,wrote that the majority misinterpreted rash,and the appropriate value of the secured property was the market price of the building without restrictive covenants.
hurwitz,circuit judge 
when a debtor,over a secured creditor objection,seeks to retain and use the creditor collateral in a chapter plan of reorganization through a cram down,the bankruptcy code treats the creditor claim as secured to the extent of the value of such creditor interest.a.that value is to be determined in light of the purpose of the valuation and of the proposed disposition or use of such property.id.
in associates commercial rash,the supreme court adopted a standard for a valuations.the court held that replacement value,rather than a foreclosure sale that will not take place,is the proper guide under a prescription hinged to the property disposition or use.id.at quoting in re winthrop old farm nurseries,cir.
in rejecting a standard,the court also noted that foreclosure value was typically lower than replacement value.id.at.today,however,we confront the atypical case.because foreclosure would vitiate covenants requiring that the secured property an apartment complex be used for housing,foreclosure value in this case exceeds replacement value,which is tied to the debtor actual use of the property in the proposed reorganization.id.at.but we take the supreme court at its word and hold,as rash teaches,that a requires the use of replacement value rather than a hypothetical value derived from the very foreclosure that the reorganization is designed to avoid.thus,the bankruptcy court did not err in this case in approving sunnyslope plan of reorganization and valuing the collateral assuming its continued use after reorganization as housing.
background 
i.the sunnyslope project 
sunnyslope housing limited partnership sunnyslope owns an apartment complex in phoenix,arizona.construction funding came from three loans.capstone realty advisors,llc,provided the bulk of the funding through an million loan with an interest rate of,secured by a deed of trust.the capstone loan was guaranteed by the united states department of housing and urban development hud,and funded through bonds issued by the phoenix industrial development authority.the city of phoenix and the state of arizona provided the balance of the funding.the city loan was secured by a deed of trust,and the state loan by a deed of trust.
a.the covenants 
to secure financing and tax benefits,sunnyslope entered into five agreements 
to obtain the hud guarantee,sunnyslope signed a regulatory agreement requiring that the apartment complex be used for affordable housing.
sunnyslope also entered into a regulatory agreement with the phoenix industrial development authority,requiring sunnyslope to preserve the status of the project,and use of the units for housing.the agreement provided that its covenants shall run with the land and shall bind the owner,and its successors and assigns and all subsequent owners or operators of the project or any interest therein.the restrictions,however,terminated on foreclosure of the lien of the mortgage or delivery of a deed in lieu of foreclosure.
the city of phoenix required sunnyslope to sign a declaration of affirmative land use restrictive covenants,mandating that units be set aside for families.the restriction ran with the land and bound all future owners and operators but,similarly,would be vitiated by foreclosure.
the arizona department of housing required sunnyslope to enter into a declaration of covenants,conditions,and restrictions.that agreement set aside five units for residents.the agreement ran with the land and bound future owners,terminated upon foreclosure,and was expressly subordinate to the hud regulatory agreement.
finally,in order to receive federal tax credits,sunnyslope agreed with the arizona department of housing to use the entire complex as housing.the tax credits,and restriction on use,would terminate on foreclosure.
b.the default and its aftermath 
in,sunnyslope defaulted on the capstone loan.as guarantor,hud took over the loan and sold it to first southern national bank first southern for million.in connection with the sale,hud released its regulatory agreement.the loan sale agreement confirmed,however,that the property remained subject to the other covenants,conditions and restrictions.
first southern began foreclosure proceedings,and an arizona state court appointed a receiver.in december,the receiver agreed to sell the complex to a third party for million.
ii.the bankruptcy proceedings 
before the sale could close,sunnyslope filed a chapter petition.over first southern objection,sunnyslope sought to retain the complex in its proposed plan of reorganization,exercising the option in a b.a successful cram down allows the reorganized debtor to retain collateral over a secured creditor objection,subject to the requirement in a that the debt be treated as secured to the extent of the value of such creditor interest in the collateral.
the central issue in the reorganization proceedings was the valuation of first southern collateral,the apartment complex.sunnyslope asserted that the complex should be valued as housing,while first southern contended that the complex should instead be valued without regard to sunnyslope contractual obligations to use it as housing,which would terminate upon foreclosure.
in that regard,first southern expert valued the complex at million,making the extraordinary assumption that a foreclosure would remove any housing requirements.first southern expert also opined,however,that the value of the property was only if those requirements remained in place.sunnyslope expert valued the property at million with the housing restrictions in place,and at million without.
during its original proceeding,the bankruptcy court held that,under a,the value of the property was million because sunnyslope plan of reorganization called for continued use of the complex as housing.the court also declined to include in the valuation of the complex the tax credits available to sunnyslope.first southern then elected to treat its claim as fully secured under b.
the bankruptcy court subsequently confirmed the plan of reorganization,which provided for payment in full of the first southern claim over years,at an interest rate of,with a balloon payment at the end without interest.the reorganization plan required the city and state to relinquish their liens,but provided for payment of their unsecured claims in full,albeit without interest,at the end of the years.
the bankruptcy court found the plan fair and equitable under b because first southern retained its lien,would receive an interest rate equivalent to the prevailing market rate,and could foreclose and,therefore,obtain the property without the restrictive covenants should sunnyslope default.the court also found the plan feasible under a,citing sunnyslope financial projections,and noting that the creditor has come in with no evidence of a lack of feasibility.the court concluded that it was more likely than not that sunnyslope could make plan payments based on the history of comparable properties.the court also noted that,when the balloon payment came due,the property would be free of the housing restrictions,making the collateral an even more valuable asset.
after confirmation,cornerstone at camelback llc invested million in the complex.first southern then obtained a stay of the plan of reorganization from the district court pending appeal.the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court valuation of the complex with the housing restrictions in place,but held that the tax credits should also have been considered.both parties appealed.
after first southern unsuccessfully sought a writ from this court prohibiting the bankruptcy court from considering the district court remand pending resolution of the appeals,the bankruptcy court valued the tax credits at million,added that amount to its previous valuation,and the plan of reorganization.first southern attempted to withdraw its b election,but the bankruptcy court denied the request.
first southern again appealed.the district court denied first southern request for a stay and affirmed the reorganization plan as modified.first southern timely appealed to this court,and sunnyslope.
iii.panel opinion 
after the various appeals were consolidated,a divided panel of this court reversed the bankruptcy court order approving the plan of reorganization,holding that the court should have valued the apartment complex without regard to the affordable housing requirements.in re sunnyslope hous,cir.the majority held that,under a,replacement cost is a measure of what it would cost to produce or acquire an equivalent piece of property and that the replacement value of a apartment complex does not take into account the fact that there is a restriction on the use of the complex.id.at.the dissenting opinion,in contrast,argued that a straightforward application of rash compels valuing first southern collateral in light of sunnyslope proposed use of the property in its plan of reorganization as affordable housing.id.at paez,dissenting 
a majority of the active judges of this court voted to grant sunnyslope petition for rehearing en banc,and the panel opinion was vacated.in re sunnyslope hous,cir.see fed.app.
discussion 
the critical issue for decision is whether the bankruptcy court erred by valuing the apartment complex assuming its continued use after reorganization as housing.in addition,first southern contends that the plan of reorganization is neither fair and equitable nor feasible,and that the district court erred in not allowing it to withdraw its b election.
when a chapter debtor opts for a cram down,a creditor claim is secured to the extent of the value of such creditor interest in the estate interest in the secured property.a.the value of that claim is determined in light of the purpose of the valuation and of the proposed disposition or use of such property.id.we established long ago that,w hen a chapter debtor or a chapter debtor intends to retain property subject to a lien,the purpose of a valuation under section a is not to determine the amount the creditor would receive if it hypothetically had to foreclose and sell the collateral.in re taffi,cir.en banc.the debtor is in,not outside of,bankruptcy,so t he foreclosure value is not relevant because the creditor is not foreclosing.id.
in taffi,we noted that our decision was consistent with the approach of all but one circuit the fifth which had adopted a standard in in re rash,cir.en banc.see at.there,the rashes owed on a truck loan when they filed a chapter petition.rash,at.they sought to retain the truck through a cram down,proposing a reorganization plan paying the creditor for the foreclosure value of the truck,which they contended was.id.at.in contrast,the creditor argued the truck should be valued at the price the rashes would have to pay to purchase a like vehicle,estimated at.id.but the fifth circuit disagreed and held that a required the use of foreclosure value.rash,at.
one year after we decided taffi,the supreme court reversed the fifth circuit.the court held,consistent with taffi,that a directs application of the standard,rather than foreclosure value.rash,at the court stated that the value of collateral under a is the cost the debtor would incur to obtain a like asset for the same proposed use.id.at alteration in original.
rash stressed the instruction in a to value the collateral based on its proposed disposition or use in the plan of reorganization.id.at.the court emphasized that,in a reorganization involving a cram down,the debtor will continue to use the collateral,and valuation must therefore occur in light of the proposed repayment plan reality no foreclosure sale.id.at alteration omitted quoting winthrop old farm nurseries,at.the actual use,the court held,is the proper guide,and replacement value is therefore the price a willing buyer in the debtor trade,business,or situation would pay to obtain like property from a willing seller,id.at.
rash also teaches that the determination of replacement value by the bankruptcy court is a factual finding.id.at.we therefore review the valuation determination in this case for clear error.in re jts,cir.we find none.
the essential inquiry under rash is to determine the price that a debtor in sunnyslope position would pay to obtain an asset like the collateral for the particular use proposed in the plan of reorganization.at.first southern does not dispute that there was substantial evidence before the bankruptcy court that it would cost sunnyslope million to acquire a property like the apartment complex including the with similar restrictive covenants requiring that it be devoted to housing.
despite this,first southern argues that the property should instead be valued at its highest and best use housing without any restrictions.but a speaks expressly of the reorganization plan proposed disposition or use.absent foreclosure,the very event that the chapter plan sought to avoid,sunnyslope can not use the property except as affordable housing,nor could anyone else.rash expressly instructs that a a valuation can not consider what would happen after a hypothetical foreclosure the valuation must instead reflect the property actual use.at.
first southern attempts to distinguish rash by noting that foreclosure value is greater than replacement value in this case.but rash implicitly acknowledged that this outcome might occasionally be the case,and nonetheless adopted a standard.see at.we can not depart from that standard without doing precisely what rash instructed bankruptcy courts to avoid assuming a foreclosure that the chapter petition prevented.see id.at.
to be sure,a creditor is better off whenever the highest possible value for its collateral is chosen,and rash did in fact recognize that when a debtor keeps the property and continues to use it,the creditor obtains at once neither the property nor its value and is exposed to double risks the debtor may again default and the property may deteriorate from extended use.id.at.but rash did not adopt a rule requiring that the bankruptcy court value the collateral at the higher of its foreclosure value or replacement value.rather,it expressly rejected the use of foreclosure value,and instead stressed the requirement in a that the property be valued in light
