petitioners filed for chapter bankruptcy and then sold their farm.they proposed a plan under which they would pay off outstanding liabilities with proceeds from the sale.the internal revenue service irs objected,asserting a tax on the capital gains from the sale.petitioners then proposed treating the tax as an unsecured claim to be paid to the extent funds were available,with the unpaid balance being discharged.the bankruptcy court sustained an irs objection,the district court reversed,and the ninth circuit reversed the district court.the ninth circuit held that because a chapter estate is not a separate taxable entity under the internal revenue code irc,it does not incur postpetition federal income taxes.the ninth circuit concluded that because the tax was not incurred by the estate under b,it was not a priority claim eligible for the a a exception.
held the federal income tax liability resulting from petitioners postpetition farm sale is not incurred by the estate under b of the bankruptcy code and thus is neither collectible nor dischargeable in the chapter plan.
a the phrase incurred by the estate bears a plain and natural reading.a tax incurred by the estate is a tax for which the estate itself is liable.only certain estates are liable for federal income taxes.irc and define the division of responsibilities for the payment of taxes between the estate and the debtor on a basis.under those provisions,a chapter estate is not a separately taxable entity.the debtor not the trustee is generally liable for taxes and files the only tax return.the postpetition income taxes are thus not incurred by the estate.
b section of the bankruptcy code and its longstanding interplay with irc and reinforce that whether an estate incurs taxes turns on congress guidance on which estates are separately taxable.the original established that state or local income taxes could be imposed only on the estate in an chapter or bankruptcy,and only on the debtor in a chapter bankruptcy.congress applied the framework of to federal taxes two years later irc and established that the estate is separately taxable in chapter or cases,and not separately taxable in chapter and now chapter cases.the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of subsequently amended,expressly aligning its assignment of state or local taxes with the irc separate taxable entity rules for federal taxes.this court assumes that congress is aware of existing law when it passes legislation,and the existing law at the enactment of a a indicated that an estate liability for taxes turned on separate taxable entity rules.
c chapter,on which chapter was modeled,further bolsters this court holding.established understandings hold that postpetition income taxes are not incurred by the chapter estate under b because they are the liability of the chapter debtor alone.the government has also long hewed to this position.section a,which gives holders of postpetition claims the option of collecting postpetition taxes within the bankruptcy case,would be superfluous if postpetition tax liabilities were automatically collectible inside the bankruptcy.it is thus clear that postpetition income taxes are not automatically collectible in a chapter plan and are not administrative expenses under b.to hold otherwise in chapter would disrupt settled practices in chapter cases.
d none of the contrary arguments by petitioners and the dissent overcomes the statute plain language,context,and structure.there is no textual basis for giving incurred by the estate a temporal meaning,such that it refers to all taxes incurred postpetition.nor does the text support deeming a tax incurred by the estate whenever it is paid by the debtor out of property of the estate.section legislative history is not inconsistent with this court holding,and the court has cautioned against allowing ambiguous legislative history to muddy clear statutory language.see milner department of navy.meanwhile,any cases suggesting that postpetition taxes were treated as administrative expenses are inapposite because they involve corporate debtors,which congress has singled out for responsibilities paralleling those borne by a separate taxable entity trustee.finally,petitioners contend that the purpose of a a was to provide debtors with robust relief from tax debts.there may be compelling policy reasons for treating postpetition income tax liabilities as dischargeable.but if congress intended petitioners result,it did not so provide in the statute.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice sotomayor delivered the opinion of the court.
under chapter of the bankruptcy code,farmer debtors may treat certain claims owed to a governmental unit resulting from the disposition of farm assets as dischargeable,unsecured liabilities.a a.one such claim is for any tax incurred by the estate.b b i.the question presented is whether a federal income tax liability resulting from individual debtors sale of a farm during the pendency of a chapter bankruptcy is incurred by the estate and thus dischargeable.we hold that it is not.
in,congress enacted chapter of the bankruptcy code,et,to allow farmer debtors with regular annual income to adjust their debts.chapter was modeled on chapter,et,which permits individual debtors with regular annual income to preserve existing assets subject to a plan under which they pay creditors out of their future income.hamilton lanning,slip,at.chapter debtors similarly file a plan of reorganization.to be confirmed,the plan must provide for the full payment of priority claims.a.
in the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of bapcpa,stat,congress created an exception to that requirement 
contents of plan 
a the plan shall 
provide for the full payment,in deferred cash payments,of all claims entitled to priority under section,unless 
a the claim is a claim owed to a governmental unit that arises as a result of the sale,transfer,exchange,or other disposition of any farm asset used in the debtor farming operation,in which case the claim shall be treated as an unsecured claim that is not entitled to priority under section,but the debt shall be treated in such manner only if the debtor receives a discharge.
under a a,certain governmental claims resulting from the disposition of farm assets are downgraded to general,unsecured claims that are dischargeable after less than full payment.see a.the claims are stripped of their priority status.
that exception,however,applies only to claims in the plan that are entitled to priority under section in the first place.section lists categories of such claims.two pertain to taxes one category,a,covers prepetition taxes,and is inapplicable in this case.the other,a,covers administrative expenses allowed under section b,which in turn includes any tax incurred by the estate.b b i.thus,for postpetition taxes to be entitled to priority under and eligible for the a a exception,the taxes must be incurred by the estate.
petitioners lynwood and brenda hall petitioned for bankruptcy under chapter and sold their farm shortly thereafter.petitioners initially proposed a plan of reorganization under which they would pay off outstanding liabilities with proceeds from the sale.the internal revenue service irs objected,asserting a federal income tax of on the capital gains from the farm sale.
petitioners amended their proposal to treat the income tax as a general,unsecured claim to be paid to the extent funds were available,with the unpaid balance discharged.again the irs objected.taxes on income from a postpetition farm sale,the irs argued,remain the debtors independent responsibility because they are neither collectible nor dischargeable in bankruptcy.
the bankruptcy court sustained the objection.the court reasoned that because a chapter estate is not a separate taxable entity under the internal revenue code irc,see,it can not incur taxes for purposes of b.
the district court reversed,expressing doubt that irc provisions are relevant to interpreting b.based on its reading of legislative history,the district court determined that congress intended a a to extend to petitioners postpetition taxes.
the court of appeals for the ninth circuit reversed.the court of appeals held that the chapter estate does not incur the postpetition federal income taxes for purposes of b because it is not a separate taxable entity under the irc,and noted that congress repeatedly has indicated the relevance of the irc taxable entity provisions to the bankruptcy code.although sympathetic to the view that the postpetition tax liabilities should be dischargeable,the court of appeals held that the operative language simply failed to make its way into the statute.at.the court of appeals concluded that because the taxes do not qualify under b,they are not priority claims in the plan eligible for the a a exception.
judge paez dissented,siding with a sister circuit that had concluded that congress intended a a to extend to such postpetition federal income taxes.we granted certiorari to resolve the split of authority.
our resolution of this case turns on the meaning of a phrase in b of the bankruptcy code incurred by the estate.the parties agree that a a applies only to priority claims collectible in the bankruptcy plan and that postpetition federal income taxes so qualify only if they constitute a tax incurred by the estate.b b i.
the phrase incurred by the estate bears a plain and natural reading.see fcc,slip,at when a statute does not define a term,we typically give the phrase its ordinary meaning to incur,one must suffer or bring on oneself a liability or expense.black law dictionary ed.see also webster third new international dictionary to become liable or subject to bring down upon oneself random house dictionary to become liable or subject to through one own action bring upon oneself a tax incurred by the estate is a tax for which the estate itself is liable.
as the irc makes clear,only certain estates are liable for federal income taxes.title and address taxation in bankruptcy and define the division of responsibilities for the payment of taxes between the estate and the debtor on a basis.section provides that when an individual debtor files for chapter or bankruptcy,the estate shall be liable for taxes.in such cases,the trustee files a separate return on the estate behalf and t he tax on the taxable income of the estate shall be paid by the trustee.c see also b returns of an estate of an individual under chapter or shall be made by the fiduciary thereof section provides that e xcept in any case to which section applies,no separate taxable entity shall result from the commencement of a bankruptcy case.in chapter and cases,then,there is no separately taxable estate.the debtor not the trustee is generally liable for taxes and files the only tax return.see in re lindsey,bkrtcy.wd it is clear that,pursuant to and,the standing chapter trustee neither files a return nor pays federal income tax infra,at discussing special trustee duties in cases.
these provisions suffice to resolve this case chapter estates are not taxable entities.petitioners,not the estate itself,are required to file the tax return and are liable for the taxes resulting from their postpetition farm sale.the postpetition federal income tax liability is not incurred by the estate and thus is neither collectible nor dischargeable in the chapter plan 
our reading of incurred by the estate as informed by the irc separate taxable entity rules draws support from a related provision of the bankruptcy code,and its longstanding interplay with and.that relationship illustrates that from the inception of the current bankruptcy code,congress has specified on a basis which estates are separately taxable and therefore liable for taxes.that relationship also refutes the dissent suggestion that applying such rules is an incongruous importation of tax law unconnected to bankruptcy principles as congress understood them.post,at opinion of breyer.and it reinforces the reasonableness of our view that whether an estate incurs taxes under b turns on such distinctions.
in the original bankruptcy code,congress included a provision,that set out a division of tax liabilities between the estate and the debtor.bankruptcy reform act of,stat.section b provided that in an chapter or bankruptcy,any income of the estate may be taxed under a state or local law imposing a tax only to the estate,and may not be taxed to such individual.stat.emphasis added see also collier on bankruptcy b i,ed.hereinafter collier b provided that in a case under chapter or the estate of an individual is a taxable entity section d provided,meanwhile,that in a chapter bankruptcy,any income of the estate or the debtor may be taxed under a state or local law imposing a tax only to the debtor,and may not be taxed to the estate.stat.emphasis added.congress thus established that the estate in an chapter or bankruptcy is a separate taxable entity the estate in a chapter bankruptcy is not 
although concerned state or local taxes congress applied its framework to federal taxes two years later.in the bankruptcy tax act of,stat,congress enacted and.section of the irc,much like b in the bankruptcy code,established that the estate is separately taxable in chapter or cases.section of the irc,much like d in the bankruptcy code,clarified that the estate is not separately taxable in chapter and now chapter cases.
in,congress in bapcpa amended and crystallized the connection between the bankruptcy code and the irc.section now expressly aligns its assignment of state or local taxes with the rules for federal taxes,providing in relevant part 
a whenever the internal revenue code of provides that a separate taxable estate or entity is created in a case concerning a debtor under this title,and the income of such estate shall be taxed to or claimed by the estate,a separate taxable estate is also created for purposes of any state and local law imposing a tax on or measured by income and such income shall be taxed to or claimed by the estate and may not be taxed to or claimed by the debtor.
b whenever the internal revenue code of provides that no separate taxable estate shall be created in a case concerning a debtor under this title,and the income of an estate shall be taxed to or claimed by the debtor,such income shall be taxed to or claimed by the debtor under a state or local law imposing a tax on or measured by income and may not be taxed to or claimed by the estate.emphasis added.
thus,whenever the estate is separately taxable under federal income tax law,that is also the case under state or local income tax law,a,and vice versa,b.and given that the bankruptcy code instructs that the assignment of state or local tax liabilities shall turn on the irc separate taxable entity rules,there is parity in turning to such rules in assigning federal tax liabilities.
in the same act,congress added a a.section a a carves out an exception to the ordinary priority classification scheme.but a a did not purport to redefine which claims are otherwise entitled to priority,much less alter the underlying division of tax liability between the estate and the debtor in chapter cases.we assume that congress is aware of existing law when it passes legislation,miles apex marine,and the existing law at the enactment of a a indicated that an estate liability for taxes turned on separate taxable entity rules.
the statutory structure further reinforces our holding that petitioners postpetition income taxes are not incurred by the estate.as a leading bankruptcy treatise and lower courts recognize,b ecause chapter was modeled on chapter,and because so many of the provisions are identical,chapter cases construing provisions corresponding to chapter provisions may be relied on as authority in chapter cases.collier,at in re lopez,bkrtcy.app.panel justice valley nat.bank.we agree.section a,like a,requires full payment of all claims entitled to priority under section under the plan.both provisions the same section of the code,and in turn,the same subsection,b.both are treated alike by irc and.whether postpetition taxes qualify under b in chapter thus sheds light on whether they so qualify in petitioners chapter case.
bankruptcy courts and commentators have reasoned that postpetition income taxes are not incurred by the estate under b because a tax on postpetition income of the debtor or of the chapter estate is not a liability of the chapter estate it is a liability of the debtor alone.collier,at and for over a decade,the government has likewise hewed to the position that since tax liabilities are,in chapter cases,incurred by the debtor,rather than the bankruptcy estate,characterizing such liabilities as administrative expenses is inconsistent with section.irs chief counsel advice,wl,see also internal revenue manual hereinafter irm irs litigation guideline memorandum,wl.we see no reason to depart from those established understandings.to hold the chapter estate liable for a tax when it does not exist as a taxable entity defies common sense as well as congress intent.in re whall,bkrtcy.the same holds true for a chapter estate.
a provision in chapter confirms that postpetition income taxes fall outside b.section a provides that a proof of claim may be filed by any entity that holds a claim against the debtor for taxes that become payable to a governmental unit while the case is pending.emphasis added.that provision gives holders of postpetition claims the option of collecting postpetition taxes within the bankruptcy case an option that the government would never need to invoke if postpetition tax liabilities were already collectible inside the bankruptcy.accordingly,lest we render inoperative or superfluous,hibbs winn,it is clear that postpetition income taxes are not automatically collectible in a chapter plan and,a fortiori,are not administrative expenses under b.
it follows that postpetition income taxes are not automatically collectible in petitioners chapter plan because both chapters b in an identical manner,see a,a,we are cognizant that any conflicting reading of b here could disrupt settled chapter practices.see cohen de la cruz,the court will not read the bankruptcy code to erode past bankruptcy practice absent a clear indication that congress intended such a departure chapter filings outnumber chapter filings.see bankruptcy courts cases commenced during the period ending september,table.aspx estimating and annual chapter and filings,respectively as visited may,and available in clerk of court case file.yet adopting petitioners reading of b would mean that,in every chapter case,the government could ignore and expect priority payment of postpetition income taxes in every plan.
at bottom,identical words and phrases within the same statute should normally be given the same meaning.powerex reliant energy services.absent any indication that congress intended a conflict between two closely related chapters,we decline to create one 
petitioners and the dissent advance several arguments for why the postpetition income taxes at issue should be considered incurred by the estate,notwithstanding the irc separate taxable entity rules.but none provides sufficient reason to overcome the statute plain language,context,and structure.
petitioners primarily argue that incurred by the estate has a temporal meaning.petitioners emphasize that the estate only comes into existence after a bankruptcy petition is filed.thus,they reason,taxes incurred by the estate refers to all taxes incurred postpetition,regardless of whether the estate is liable for the tax and regardless of the chapter under which a case is filed.although all taxes incurred by the estate are necessarily incurred postpetition,not all taxes incurred postpetition are incurred by the estate.that an estate can not incur liability until it exists does not mean that every liability that arises after that point automatically becomes the estate liability.and there is no textual basis to focus on when the liability is incurred,as opposed to whether the liability is incurred by the estate.
alternately,petitioners contend that a tax should be considered incurred by the estate so long as it is payable out of estate assets.income from postpetition sales of farm assets is considered property of the estate.see a.petitioners argue that even if the debtor and not the estate is liable for a tax,the tax is still incurred by the estate because the funds the debtor uses to pay the tax are property of the estate.but that too strains the text beyond what it can bear.to concede that someone other than the estate is liable for filing the return and paying the tax,and yet maintain that the estate is the one that has incurred the tax,defies the ordinary meaning of incur as bringing a liability upon oneself.
the dissent,echoing both of these points,urges that we simply consider the debtor and estate as merged.post,at.the english language,the dissent reasons,permits this reading and do es not require our reading.post,at.but any reading of tax incurred by the estate that is contingent on merging the debtor and estate despite congress longstanding efforts to distinguish between when tax liabilities are borne by the debtor or borne by the estate is not a natural construction of the statute as written.
moreover,these alternative readings create a conflict between b and b.petitioners consider postpetition state or local income taxes,like federal income taxes,to be incurred by the estate under b.see tr.of oral arg.but b requires that such taxes be borne by the chapter debtor,not the estate.it is implausible to maintain that taxes are incurred by the estate when b specifically prohibits such taxes from being taxed to or claimed by the estate.
to buttress their counterintuitive readings of the text,petitioners and the dissent suggest that there is a long history of treating postpetition taxes as administrative expenses entitled to priority.both point to two legislative reports accompanying the enactment of.but neither snippet from which they quote is inconsistent with today holding and we have cautioned against allowing ambiguous legislative history to muddy clear statutory language.milner department of navy,slip,at.
petitioners also point to cases suggesting that postpetition taxes were treated as administrative expenses,united states noland,corporate chapter debtor nicholas united states,corporate chapter xi case under predecessor bankruptcy act.but those cases involve corporate debtors and are therefore inapposite.among estates that are not separately taxable,those involving corporate debtors have long been singled out by congress for special responsibilities see,at even i f the estate is not a separate taxable entity,administrative responsibility can var y according to the nature of the debtor although estates of corporate debtors are not separate taxable entities under and,the irc requires a trustee that has possession of or holds title to all or substantially all the property or business of a corporation to make the return of income for such corporation.b.in effect,congress provided that the trustee in a case may shoulder responsibility that parallels that borne by the trustee of a separate taxable entity.in any event,petitioners do not deny that neither the separate taxable entity provisions nor the special provisions for corporate debtors apply to them.
finally,petitioners and the dissent contend that the purpose of a a was to provide debtors with robust relief from tax debts,relying on statements by a single senator on unenacted bills introduced in years preceding the enactment.see brief for petitioners.they argue that deeming a a inapplicable to their postpetition income taxes would undermine that purpose and confine the exception to prepetition taxes.but we need not resolve here what other claims,if any,are covered by a a whatever the congress intent with respect to a a,that provision merely carved out an exception to the priority classification scheme.the exception could only apply to claims entitled to priority under section in the first place.that scheme was in turn premised on antecedent,understandings about the scope of b and the division of tax liabilities between estates and debtors.see dewsnup timm,when congress amends the bankruptcy laws,it does not write on a clean slate if congress wished to alter these background norms,it needed to enact a provision to enable postpetition income taxes to be collected in the chapter plan in the first place.
the dissent concludes otherwise by an inverted analysis.rather than demonstrate that such claims were treated as priority claims in the first place,the dissent begins with the single senator stated purpose for the exception to that priority scheme.post,at.it then reasons backwards from there,and in the process upsets background norms in both chapters and.
certainly,there may be compelling policy reasons for treating postpetition income tax liabilities as dischargeable.but if congress intended that result,it did not so provide in the statute.given the statute plain language,context,and structure,it is not for us to rewrite the statute,particularly in this complex terrain of interconnected provisions and exceptions enacted over nearly three decades.petitioners position threatens ripple effects beyond this individual case for debtors in chapter and the broader bankruptcy scheme that we need not invite.as the court of appeals noted,congress is entirely free to change the law by amending the text.at.
we hold that the federal income tax liability resulting from petitioners postpetition farm sale is not incurred by the estate under b and thus is neither collectible nor dischargeable in the chapter plan.we therefore affirm the judgment of the court of appeals for the ninth circuit.

chapter of the bankruptcy code helps family farmers in economic difficulty reorganize their debts without losing their farms.consistent with the chapter purposes,congress amended a of the code to enable the debtor to treat certain capital gains tax claims as ordinary unsecured claims.a a.the court holding prevents the amendment from carrying out this basic objective.i would read the statute differently,interpreting it in a way that,in my view,both is consistent with its language and allows the amendment better to achieve its purposes.
chapter of the bankruptcy code helps indebted family farmers and fishermen keep their farms by making commitments to pay those debts in part out of future income.an eligible farmer whose debts exceed his assets may enter chapter bankruptcy,at which point he must develop a detailed plan setting forth how he will pay his debts.that plan must satisfy certain statutory criteria.
a brief overview of these requirements helps to illuminate what is at stake in this case.roughly speaking,the chapter requires that a holder of a secured claim receive the full amount of that claim up to the value of the collateral securing the loan.the claim may be paid over an extended period.if the claim exceeds the value of the collateral,the creditor is given an unsecured claim in the remainder.a,a.
the holder of a priority claim a category that includes,among other things,domestic support obligations,debts for taxes incurred before filing the bankruptcy petition,and administrative expenses must receive the full amount of the priority claim in deferred cash payments paid over the life of the plan.a.
the holder of an ordinary unsecured claim,an unsecured claim of a kind not listed in may receive at least a partial payment from the amount left over after the payment of the secured and priority claims.this amount may well be more than zero,for the plan must provide that the farmer will devote all disposable income as defined by b or property of equivalent value to the repayment of his debts over the next three years sometimes extended to five years.c,b.and that amount must prove sufficient to provide the unsecured creditor with no less than that creditor would receive in a chapter liquidation.a.
once the farmer completes his plan payments,he will receive a discharge even if his payments did not fully satisfy all unsecured claims.the code does not,however,permit all debts to be discharged.there are categories of nondischargeable debts including,for example,secured claims,which creditors can pursue after bankruptcy.a.
for present purposes,it is important to understand that if the debtor owes too much money to his priority creditors,he may not have sufficient assets or future income to pay all his secured creditors and his priority creditors while leaving enough funds over to guarantee unsecured creditors the minimum amounts that chapter requires.if so,the farmer may not be able to proceed under chapter.see a,bankruptcy court will not confirm plan unless it satisfies statutory criteria and debtor will be able to make good on his commitments under the plan.
it is also important to understand that the same kind of problem might occur where the debtor owes the government a large tax debt.in general,postpetition claims are not part of the bankruptcy proceedings.see norton bankruptcy law and practice ed.hereinafter norton.unless the government debt falls within an exception to this general rule,bankruptcy law would leave the government to collect its postpetition claim outside of bankruptcy as best it could.again,the result will be to leave the farmer with fewer assets and income to devote to his chapter plan perhaps to the point where he can not proceed under chapter at all.
with this general summary in mind,it is easier to understand the significance of the question this case presents.the question arises out of an amendment to a chapter provision.the provision as amended says 
contents of plan 
a the plan shall 
provide for the full payment,in deferred cash payments,of all claims entitled to priority under section,unless 
a the claim is a claim owed to a governmental unit that arises as a result of the sale,transfer,exchange,or other disposition of any farm asset used in the debtor farming operation,in which case the claim shall be treated as an unsecured claim that is not entitled to priority under section,but the debt shall be treated in such manner only if the debtor receives a discharge or 
b the holder of a particular claim agrees to a different treatment of that claim.a emphasis added.
the amendment consists of subparagraph a.
at first blush,the amendment seems to relegate the capital gains tax collector to the status of an ordinary unsecured creditor.see ibid.exception applies to claims owed to a governmental unit that arises as a result of the sale of any farm asset if,as petitioners claim,that is so,then it is unlikely that such a debt could stop a farmer from proceeding under chapter,since its treatment as an ordinary unsecured claim means that the farmer will not necessarily have to pay the debt in full.
but if the government and the majority are right,then the capital gains tax falls outside the category of priority claims and therefore falls outside the scope of the amendment in fact,it falls outside the bankruptcy proceeding altogether.and the government then might well be able to collect the debt in full outside the bankruptcy proceeding even if doing so would reduce the farmer assets and future income to the point where the farmer would not be able to proceed under chapter.the question before us is whether we must interpret the amendment in a way that could bring about this result.
congress did not intend this result.in a significant number of instances a chapter farmer,in order to have enough money to pay his creditors,might have to sell farmland or other farm assets at a price that would give rise to considerable capital gains taxes particularly if the family has held the land or assets for many years.if the resulting tax debt were treated as a priority claim,then it might well absorb much of the money raised to the point where depending upon the size of his other debts the farmer might be unable to proceed under chapter.the amendment accordingly seeks to place the tax authorities farther back in the creditor queue,requiring them,like ordinary unsecured creditors,to seek payment from the funds that remain after the priority creditors and secured claim holders have been paid.
the amendment chief legislative sponsor,senator charles grassley,explained this well when he told the senate 
under current law,farmers often face a crushing tax liability if they need to sell livestock or land in order to reorganize their business affairs h igh taxes have caused farmers to lose their farms.under the bankruptcy code,the must be paid in full for any tax liabilities generated during a bankruptcy reorganization.if the farmer ca pay the in full,then he ca keep his farm.this is sound policy.why should the be allowed to veto a farmer reorganization plan the amendment takes this power away from the by reducing the priority of taxes during proceedings.this will free up capital for investment in the farm,and help farmers stay in the business of farming.cong.rec.
see also mertens,law of federal income taxation,supp.this provision attempts to mitigate the tax expense often incurred by farmers who have significant taxable capital gains or depreciation recapture when their low basis farm assets are foreclosed,sold,or otherwise disposed of by their creditors 
the majority,following the government suggestion,interprets the relevant language in a way that denies the amendment its intended effect.it holds that the only income tax claims to which accords priority are claims for taxes due for years prior to the taxable year in which the farmer filed for bankruptcy.we shall call these prepetition tax claims.in the majority view,does not cover income tax liabilities that arise during the year of filing or during the chapter proceedings.we shall call these postpetition tax claims.ante,at see brief for united states the amendment provides farmers relief from only those tax claims that are otherwise entitled to priority under a,namely claims arising from the sale of farm assets bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of,a,stat.amending a to clarify that it only covers income tax claims for taxable years that end on or before the date of the filing of the bankruptcy petition.
the majority then observes that the amendment creates an exception only in respect to priority claims.a the plan shall provide for the full payment of all claims entitled to priority under section,unless emphasis added.ante,at.thus,if without the amendment would not cover postpetition capital gains taxes in the first place,the amendment creating only a exception can not affect postpetition tax claims.an exception from nothing amounts to nothing.
consequently,the majority concludes that postpetition tax claims fall outside the bankruptcy proceeding entirely the tax authorities can collect them as if they were ordinary tax debts and the government efforts to collect them can lead to the very results blocking the use of chapter that the amendment sought to avoid.
therein lies the problem.these results are the very opposite of what congress intended.congress did not want to relegate to status only prepetition tax claims,tax claims that accrued well before the chapter proceedings began.rather,congress was concerned about the effect on the farmer of collecting capital gains tax debts that arose during and were connected with the chapter proceedings themselves.see cong.rec.the amendment will have the effect of reducing the priority of taxes during proceedings emphasis added statement of grassley during a failed attempt to enact the amendment hearing on the bankruptcy reform act of before the senate committee on the judiciary,statement of grassley the amendment also reduces the priority of capital gains tax liabilities for farm assets sold as a part of a reorganization plan emphasis added.the majority does not deny the importance of congress objective.rather,it feels compelled to hold that congress put the amendment in the wrong place.
unlike the majority,i believe the relevant bankruptcy code language can be and is better interpreted in a way that would give full effect to the amendment.in particular,the relevant language is better interpreted so that in the absence of the amendment would cover these postpetition tax claims.hence the amendment creates an exception from what otherwise would amount to a priority claim.and it can take effect as written.
it is common ground that subsection a of covers,and gives priority to,administrative expenses allowed under section b.a,supp.iv.it is also common ground that the relevant definitional section,namely b,defines allowed administrative expenses as including any tax incurred by the estate.b b i ed.but after this point,we part company.
the majority believes that the words any tax incurred by the estate can not include postpetition taxes.it emphasizes that tax law does not treat a chapter bankruptcy estate as a separate taxable entity,as separate from the for federal income tax purposes.this means that there is just one entity the debtor for these purposes.and of the bankruptcy code makes clear that any state and local income tax liabilities incurred by a chapter estate must also be taxed to the debtor.the majority says that these provisions mean that only the debtor,and not the estate,can incu r taxes within the meaning of b b i.ante,at.
in my view,however,these tax law circumstances do not require the majority narrow reading of this bankruptcy code provision.that is to say,the phrase tax incurred by the bankruptcy estate can include a tax incurred by the farmer while managing his estate in the midst of his bankruptcy proceedings,between the time the farmer files for chapter bankruptcy and the time the bankruptcy court confirms the farmer chapter plan.
the bankruptcy estate is in existence during this time.b property of the estate vests in the debtor at confirmation unless the plan provides otherwise.the bankruptcy court has jurisdiction over the farmer assets during this time.see,norton,at broad definition of estate property centralizes all of the estate assets under the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court and,as a matter of both the english language and bankruptcy principles,one can consider a tax liability that the farmer incurs during this period such as a capital gains tax arising from a sale of a portion of his farm assets to raise funds for creditors as a liability that,in a bankruptcy sense,the estate incurs.
the english language permits this reading of the phrase tax incurred by the estate.when the farmer,in the midst of chapter proceedings,sells a portion of his farm to raise money to help pay his creditors,one can say,as a matter of english,that the bankruptcy estate has incurred the associated tax,even if it is ultimately taxed to the farmer,just as one can say that an employee who makes purchases using a company credit card incurs costs for which his employer is liable.
as a matter of general bankruptcy principles as congress understood them,the history of the bankruptcy code revision is replete with statements to the effect that t axes arising from the operation of the estate after bankruptcy are entitled to priority as administrative expenses.emphasis added.see,administrative expenses include t axes incurred during the administration of the estate emphasis added,in general,administrative expenses include taxes which the trustee incurs in administering the debtor estate,including taxes on capital gains from sales of property by the trustee and taxes on income earned by the estate during the case emphasis added cong.rec.the amendment generally follows the senate amendment in providing expressly that taxes incurred during the administration of the estate share the first priority given to administrative expenses generally emphasis added,at senate version of the joint floor statement saying exactly the same.
and importantly,as the majority concedes,ante,at,bankruptcy law treats taxes incurred by corporate debtors while they are in bankruptcy proceedings as tax es incurred by the estate,even though the tax code does not treat the bankruptcy estate of a corporate debtor as a separate taxable entity.see,united states noland,treating chapter corporate debtor postpetition taxes as administrative expenses in re trading,same in re shoe,same in re hillsborough holdings,bkrtcy.md a dministrative expenses should include taxes which the trustee,and,in chapter cases,the,incurs in administering the estate,including taxes based on capital gains from sales of property and taxes on income earned by the estate during the case 
even though,as the majority says,corporate bankruptcies have some special features in particular,a trustee in a corporate bankruptcy is required to file the estate income tax return,it is unclear why these features should have any bearing on the definition of administrative expenses.see ante,at discussing b.indeed,in many corporate chapter bankruptcies,there is no trustee,in which case the,just like an individual chapter debtor,must file the tax return.see,ed.and supp.iv norton,typically,no trustee is appointed in a chapter bankruptcy,and the assumes most of the duties and powers of a trustee,continuing in possession and managing the business until the court determines,upon request of a party in interest,that grounds exist for the appointment of a trustee holywell smith,as the assignee of all or substantially all of the property of the corporate debtors,the trustee must file the re turns that the corporate debtors would have filed had the plan not assigned their property to the trustee emphasis added.
consequently,i can find no strong bankruptcy law reason for treating taxes incurred by a corporate debtor differently from those incurred by an individual chapter debtor.to the contrary,since corporations can file for bankruptcy under chapter,the majority argument implies that the treatment of postpetition taxes in chapter proceedings turns on whether the debtor happens to be a corporation.see b ed.defining family farmer to include certain corporations f only a family farmer or family fisherman with regular annual income may be a debtor under chapter brief for united states,t he estate of a corporate as opposed to individual chapter debtor could be viewed as incurring income taxes collectible as administrative expenses rather than outside the bankruptcy case as required for an individual chapter debtor 
the majority does not point to any adverse consequences that might arise were bankruptcy law to treat taxes incurred in administering the bankruptcy estate,taxes incurred after filing and before plan confirmation as administrative expenses.the effect of doing so would simply be to consider the debtor and estate as merged for purposes of determining which taxes fall within the bankruptcy code definition of administrative expenses,determining for that purpose that the estate may incur tax liabilities on behalf of the whole with the ultimate liability assigned to the debtor,much like a married couple filing jointly,a,or an affiliated group of corporations filing a consolidated tax return.in re lumara foods of america,bkrtcy.nd ohio describing the history of b b i and concluding that the elevation of a tax to an administrative priority is dependent upon when the tax accrued in fact,the very tax provisions that separate the estate from the individual debtor in chapter and chapter proceedings,and,say that the chapter estate is not separate from the debtor for tax purposes a concept consistent,not at odds,with merging the two for this bankruptcy purpose.
nor is the majority reading free of conceptual problems.if we read the phrase tax incurred by the estate as excluding tax liabilities incurred while the farmer is in chapter bankruptcy,we must read it as excluding not only capital gains taxes but also other kinds of taxes,such as an employer share of social security taxes,medicare taxes,or other employee taxes.but no one claims that all of these taxes fall outside the scope of the term administrative expenses.see in re ryan,bkrtcy.treating postpetition employment taxes as administrative expenses in a chapter proceeding irs chief counsel advice may,wl assuming that some postpetition federal taxes can be treated as administrative expenses in a chapter bankruptcy.
in fact,the government,realizing it can not go this far,concedes that many of these other,employer taxes are administrative expenses,but only,it suggests,because they fall within a different part of the administrative expenses definition,namely b a,which says that administrative expenses include the actual,necessary costs and expenses of preserving the estate including wages,salaries,and commissions for services rendered after the commencement of the case.emphasis added.see brief for united states.employment taxes,however,do not fit easily within the rubric wages,salaries,and commissions.they may well be necessary costs and expenses of preserving the estate.but then so are the capital gains taxes at issue here.
finally,the majority makes what i believe to be its strongest argument.ante,at.chapter,it points out,allows individuals typically those who are not farmers or fishermen to reorganize their debts in much the same way as does chapter.and there is authority holding that taxes on income earned between the time the chapter debtor files for bankruptcy and the time the bankruptcy plan is confirmed are not tax es incurred by the estate.see in re whall,bkrtcy.in re brown,wl,bkrtcy.in re jagours,bkrtcy.ed in re gyulafia,bkrtcy.why,asks the majority,should the law treat chapter taxes differently 
for one thing,the issue is less important in a chapter case,for the relevant time period between filing and plan confirmation is typically very short.compare,at most chapter estates will only remain open for or months until confirmation of the plan with brief for neil harl et as amici curiae survey of chapter bankruptcies found the average time from filing to confirmation in a district ranged from nearly five months to over three years.see also norton,at in chapter,the plan must be filed within days after the filing of the petition,unless the time is extended for cause.a chapter plan must be filed no later than days after the order for relief,unless the court finds that an extension is substantially justified footnote omitted.
for another,the issue arises differently in a chapter case.that chapter,unlike chapter,contains a special provision that permits the government to seek priority treatment of all taxes incurred while the bankruptcy case is pending.government can file proof of claim to have postpetition taxes treated as if they had arisen before the petition was filed.
finally,if uniformity of interpretation between these two chapters is critical,i do not see the serious harm in treating the relevant taxes as administrative expenses in both chapter and chapter cases rather than in neither.the majority apparently believes that this would render the provision permitting the government to seek priority treatment superfluous.ante,at.but that is not so.this interpretation would simply limit the scope of operation of to the period of time after the chapter plan is confirmed but while the chapter case is still pending.and that is likely to be a significant period of time relative to the preconfirmation period.see,at m ost chapter estates will only remain open for or months u
