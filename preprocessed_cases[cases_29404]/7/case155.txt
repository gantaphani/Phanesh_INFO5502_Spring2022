chapter debtor judith mcmullen challenges a bankruptcy court ruling that the postpetition complaints lodged against mcmullen,in the massachusetts superior court and with the massachusetts division of registration for real estate agents,by the four did not contravene the automatic stay provisions of bankruptcy code.discerning no error,we affirm.
background 
the case stems from an acrimonious real estate transaction which originated in,when lori sevigny entered into an agreement with lester pryor,a trustee employed by the estate of one mary perry,to purchase a parcel of real estate located in rochester,massachusetts.mcmullen,a licensed real estate agent,acted as the broker for the transaction,and accepted a deposit from lori sevigny and her husband richard.subsequently,the sale fell through,and eventually the property was purchased by a corporation controlled by mcmullen father.the deposit was never returned to the sevignys,and mcmullen insists that she did not have possession of it.
in january,mcmullen initiated chapter proceedings.roger stanford,the attorney for the sevignys,filed a nondischargeability complaint in the chapter case,alleging that mcmullen fraudulently retained their deposit.in her amended creditor matrix,mcmullen listed the sevignys as creditors,but incorrectly listed their address as snipatuit road,rather than.on june,stanford sent the sevignys a letter,explaining that mcmullen had submitted an answer to their nondischargeability complaint,but that her bankruptcy case was being converted from chapter to chapter.the sevignys mistakenly understood the letter to mean that mcmullen was withdrawing her chapter petition,thus terminating her bankruptcy case,but that she might commence a new chapter proceeding in the future.for the next six weeks the sevignys to contact stanford to confirm their understanding of the status of the mcmullen bankruptcy proceeding.
on july,a formal notice of the conversion of the mcmullen case was mailed to the sevignys by the bankruptcy court,and stanford dismissed the nondischargeability complaint.thereafter,the sevignys discharged stanford as their attorney,purportedly for failing to keep them informed about litigation matters.stanford nonetheless failed to withdraw from the bankruptcy court proceeding.the sevignys consulted briefly with another bankruptcy lawyer,but did not retain an attorney.
instead,on july,lori sevigny submitted a complaint against mcmullen before the massachusetts division of registration for real estate agents,claiming that the deposit had been fraudulently retained by mcmullen.lori provided the board with a copy of the purchase and sales agreement expressly designating mcmullen as the custodian of the deposit,as well as a copy of her canceled check for the deposit,which listed an account number and had been endorsed by the seller,lester pryor,but which was not endorsed by mcmullen.absent any evidence that mcmullen had ever had the deposit,the division dismissed the sevigny complaint.
in september,curtis perry hereinafter perry,mary perry son and heir,who had held an interest in the rochester property,decided to assist the sevignys in reclaiming their deposit by procuring an affidavit from lester pryor,supporting perry suspicion that mcmullen had i shortchanged his mother estate by selling the property to mcmullen father corporation for an amount less than the sevignys offer,and ii wrongfully retained the sevignys deposit.perry,and his friend and attorney john williams,procured the pryor affidavit,which asserted that mcmullen and not pryor had received and appropriated the deposit to her own use.
on november,the sevignys retained a new attorney,michael mcglone,who commenced suit against mcmullen in state superior court to recover the.both perry and williams were aware of mcmullen pending chapter case and the resultant automatic stay,but neither informed richard sevigny or mcglone.five weeks later,as soon as mcmullen had notified them of the automatic stay,the sevignys promptly dismissed the superior court complaint.
on december,mcmullen commenced the instant adversary proceeding,alleging that i the sevignys violated the automatic stay by submitting a complaint with the division of registration for real estate agents,and ii perry and williams had aided and abetted the sevignys,in filing the collection action in the superior court notwithstanding the automatic stay.following trial,the bankruptcy court entered its unpublished decision,granting judgment for the defendants on all counts.on appeal,the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court,without opinion,and mcmullen now appeals.
discussiona.the complaint submitted to the division of registration 
mcmullen first contends that the bankruptcy court misapplied bankruptcy code b in determining that the complaint submitted by the sevignys before a state regulatory,the board of never,as a matter of law,constitute a violation of the automatic stay.she cites authority which states that the bankruptcy court must assess each state agency proceeding on a basis in order to determine,inter alia,i whether the state places such importance upon the particular regulatory scheme at issue as to outweigh the public policy objectives sought to be served by the automatic stay,and ii whether the creditor knew of the pending bankruptcy case,yet either intentionally or in bad faith sought to employ the regulatory proceeding as an to collect its disputed claim outside of bankruptcy.mcmullen suggests that the bankruptcy court in this case failed to undertake the requisite inquiry.
following an intermediate appeal to the district court,the findings of fact arrived at by the bankruptcy court are independently reviewed by the court of appeals for clear error its conclusions of law de novo.see in re charlie auto sales,cir.
subsection a of the bankruptcy code ordains that a bankruptcy petition shall operate as an automatic stay of the commencement or continuation,including the issuance or employment of process,of a judicial,administrative,or other action or proceeding against the debtor.bankruptcy code a a.by thus safeguarding the debtor estate from piecemeal dissipation,the automatic stay efficiently ensures that the assets remain within the exclusive jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court pending their orderly and equitable distribution among the creditors,better enabling the debtor fresh start.see in re jamo,cir the automatic stay is one of the fundamental protections that the bankruptcy code affords to debtors.
nonetheless,although the code accords broad scope to the automatic stay,it expressly excepts certain postpetition proceedings from the operation of the stay,including any action brought before a governmental regulatory agency to enforce its police or regulatory powers.see bankruptcy code b,b.this exception discourages debtors from submitting bankruptcy petitions either primarily or solely for the purpose of evading impending governmental efforts to invoke the governmental police powers to enjoin or deter ongoing debtor conduct which would seriously threaten the public safety and welfare,environmental consumer protection regulations.see in re first alliance mortgage,bap cir noting that fundamental policy of b is to prevent the bankruptcy court from becoming a haven for wrongdoers citation omitted see also,pt,at,pt,at,reprinted in.nevertheless,given the expansiveness of subsection a,the exception contained in subsection b is to be narrowly construed.see corporacion de servicios medicos hospitalarios de fajardo mora in re corporacion de servicios medicos hospitalarios de fajardo,cir.
to that end,the courts have devised two interrelated,public policy and pecuniary purpose assessing whether a particular governmental proceeding comes within the subsection b exception.see in re spookyworld,cir corporacion de servicios,in re mohawk greenfield motel.these inquiries contemplate that the bankruptcy court,after assessing the totality of the circumstances,determine whether the particular regulatory proceeding at issue is designed primarily to protect the public safety and welfare,or represents a governmental attempt to recover from property of the debtor estate,whether on its own claim,or on the nongovernmental debts of private parties.see in re fitch.
tested against these criteria,there can be little doubt that the board proceeding brought against mcmullen in the instant case is excepted from operation of the automatic stay by virtue of bankruptcy code b.the complaint alleged that mcmullen,acting as a licensed real estate broker,improperly retained the cash deposit made by the sevignys during the course of the aborted real estate transaction.state law expressly empowers the board to suspend,revoke,or refuse to renew a real estate broker license where the broker has failed,within a reasonable time,to account for or remit any moneys belonging to others which have come into his possession as a broker or salesman.laws ch,d see a a broker shall be responsible for such money until the transaction is either consummated or terminated,at which time a proper account and distribution of such money shall be made.
consequently,we next inquire whether subsection b contemplates that the state power to regulate the licensure of real estate brokers is designed to advance a sufficiently important public policy so as to trump the competing interests fostered by the automatic stay.the state power of licensure,which safeguards the public from wrongful future conduct of corrupt or incompetent professionals,falls squarely within the purview of the subsection b exception to the automatic stay.see,at,reprinted in section b excepts governmental units suing a debtor to prevent or stop violation of fraud,environmental protection,or consumer protection.emphasis added see also,thomassen div.of med.quality assurance in re thomassen,bap cir observing that revocation of medical license for medical malpractice and professional incompetence protects public dep disciplinary comm.for the first judicial dep t in re friedman shapiro,same,concerning revocation of license to practice law fitch,at noting that insurance license revocation proceedings were designed to punish the licensee for his alleged fraudulent conduct,and to deter others from engaging in such activities,rather than to attempt to recover any alleged misappropriated funds or to recompense any insurers christmas.racing comm in re christmas,concerning revocation of horse trainer license beker indus.land and water adjudicatory comm in re beker indus,involving revocation of license to transport phosphate rock.more specifically,these same policy considerations are cited in relation to the revocation or suspension of the licenses of real estate brokers or salesmen.see,sam daily realty,dep of commerce and consumer affairs,state of hawaii in re sam daily realty,holding that state real estate commission suspension of realtor license and imposition of fine were exempt from stay pursuant to b,because the commission interest in this matter is in punishing misconduct and preventing future acts of the type the licensee has been accused granger harris in re harris,same,distinguishing punitive fines against realtor from compensatory awards.further,the board power to revoke or suspend realtor licenses plainly implements commonwealth policy.see greater boston real estate bd.bd.of registration of real estate brokers salesmen,the conduct described in.laws ch,d clearly relates to discipline and to acts which are either criminal or against public policy.emphasis added.
although it is conceivable that a state might assert a purpose in order to mask some improper pecuniary aim,see in re north,most assuredly this case is not such an instance,since neither the commonwealth nor the board could have any conceivable pecuniary interest in property of the mcmullen chapter estate or chapter estate.see spookyworld,at noting that government had no pecuniary interest in enforcing building code.although it is alleged that the sevignys harbored such a pecuniary interest in the recovery of their deposit from mcmullen funds,the suspension,revocation,or refusal to renew a real estate broker license are the only enumerated powers accorded the board.see.laws ch,d hence,the board was neither empowered to compel mcmullen to repay the deposit to the sevignys,nor to award any other restitutionary remedy.see id.any person whose licensure is suspended or revoked shall also be liable to such other punishment as may be provided by law.finally,even if the board were so empowered,it did not order such relief,but instead ultimately dismissed the sevigny complaint on the merits.bd.of governors of fed.reserve syst.mcorp,d noting that order for money judgment may be entered in a proceeding,as long as it is not enforced,and the mere possibility that proceedings ultimately have some effect on the property of the bankrupt estate does not make subject to the automatic stay a proceeding which is otherwise exempt from stay under section b.thus,the disciplinary proceeding before the board was designed to did in fact principally protect the public in the future,rather than to seek recompense for the alleged financial losses sustained by the sevignys.
citing in re byrd,mcmullen maintains that the cases are apposite only if the proceedings are initiated by the government,whereas the board proceedings commenced with the sevignys postpetition filing of a verified complaint.see.laws ch.in byrd,the court stated that a private third party may lodge a prepetition criminal complaint against a debtor,and any proceeding on that complaint would still be exempt from the automatic stay under subsection b,even if the proceeding were designed to recover a private debt.see byrd,at.on the other hand,the court opined that once the bankruptcy petition has been filed the third party can not approach governmental authorities with a complaint,and any proceedings based upon that postpetition complaint would be stayed.id.
byrd is readily distinguishable.first,the byrd complaint involved a criminal proceeding,which implicated unique abstention issues.see id.at we maintain the deep conviction that federal bankruptcy courts should not invalidate the results of state criminal proceedings.this rule reflects a fundamental policy against federal interference with state criminal prosecutions.citations omitted.
even more importantly,the second prong of the byrd or not it offers a sound interpretation of subsection b is mere dicta,since the complainants in byrd had lodged their complaint before the debtor filed for bankruptcy,and the court held that the proceedings on the complaint were not stayed.id.at thus,byrd does not support the mcmullen contention that postpetition proceedings initiated by a private party are outside the subsection b exception to the automatic stay.see municipality of san juan rullan,cir opposed to a court no binding effect in subsequent proceedings in the same or any other case.
the last statement in byrd is not only dicta,but in our view,overbroad.a private party reporting of wrongful conduct to governmental regulatory authorities is neither the commencement of a proceeding under subsection a,nor necessarily an act to collect under subsection a.although we broadly construe the automatic stay in many contexts,the same sound public policy reasons which undergird the subsection b exception counsel against any rule which might dissuade private parties from providing governmental regulators with information which might require enforcement measures to protect the public from imminent harm.mcmullen surmises that the sevignys board complaint was motivated by their desire to force mcmullen into repaying the alleged debt,but the sevignys made no postpetition threat to file a complaint which might constitute an act to collect under a,in re diamond,cir nor was the continued prosecution of the board proceeding made contingent on whether mcmullen repaid the deposit,in re massenzio,at see supra note.
additionally,mcmullen argues that even if these sorts of professional licensing proceedings normally are not stayed by subsection b,the instant case differs in that the sevignys submitted their complaint in bad faith.although we have yet to decide this issue on its merits,we have noted in dicta the tenuousness of the arguments for engrafting such a bad
