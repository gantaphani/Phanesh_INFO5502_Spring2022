on september,sonya salkin,as trustee for the bankruptcy estate,instituted an adversary proceeding in the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of florida.the adversary proceeding sought to avoid a transfer of the real property located at harrison street,hollywood,florida the counsel building,from steven saber,the debtor,to esther slobodinsky,his mother count one of the complaint sought to avoid the transfer of the counsel building from saber to slobodinsky as fraudulent.count one alleged that the counsel building had become the sole subject of a florida land trust agreement on december,and that by august,saber had received assignments of of the beneficial and legal interests in the land trust.therefore,b y virtue of saber ownership of the entire legal and equitable interests in the property,the land trust terminated by operation of law,and saber became the fee simple owner of the property.count one alleged that,subsequently,on july,saber executed an assignment of the beneficial interest in the land trust to slobodinsky.then,on january,he executed a quit claim deed from himself,as successor trustee of the land trust,to slobodinsky,as second successor trustee,thereby purporting to convey the legal interest in the land trust to slobodinsky.the deed was recorded on january.the purported transfer occurred within one year of the bankruptcy,at a time when saber was clearly insolvent thus,count one asked that the court determin e that the subject real property is property of the bankrupt estate and avoid the purported transfer to slobodinsky as fraudulent.
count two of the complaint realleged the allegations of count one,then sought avoidance of the transfer as preferential,because the transfer was perfected by the recording of the quit claim deed within ninety days of the bankruptcy filing and was made at a time that the debtor was demonstrably insolvent the clear effect of the transfer was to allow slobodinsky,if indeed she is a creditor,to have obtained a far greater proportion of the obligation owed to her than any other creditor would receive from a hypothetical chapter liquidation,which is the statutory standard.thus,count two asked for a judgment against slobodinsky,avoiding the transfer of the subject real estate and determining that the same is property of the bankrupt estate.
importantly,the complaint never sought a declaration from the bankruptcy court that the quit claim deed from saber to slobodinsky regarding the counsel building conveyed nothing.although the complaint asserted that,according to land trust law,a merger had occurred in saber on august,thereby making him fee simple absolute owner of the counsel building,the two counts of the complaint operated on the assumption that there had been a conveyance to slobodinsky that needed to be avoided.
slobodinsky answer to the complaint asserted as an affirmative defense that there was no merger of legal and equitable interest which would vest title in the property solely in saber.slobodinsky asserted as an additional affirmative defense that she had been the holder of of the beneficial interest in a valid land trust since.as an alternative affirmative defense,she alleged that she provided consideration for the counsel building,and to the extent that she may not be deemed the holder of the entire beneficial interest under the florida land trust,would be entitled to a constructive trust on the property.slobodinsky did not ask for a declaration that there was no merger in saber and that,therefore,saber quit claim deed actually conveyed a legal interest in the counsel building to her 
on october,salkin moved the bankruptcy court to enter summary judgment avoiding as fraudulent the transfer of the counsel building.salkin again claimed that a merger had occurred in saber on august,when he owned both legal title and beneficial interest in the land trust.salkin contended that the july,assignment of a beneficial interest in the now extinct land trust to slobodinsky was a nullity.for relief,salkin asked that the court determine that title to the harrison street building was fraudulently conveyed by saber to slobodinsky that such conveyance is voidable and is avoided for the benefit of the estate.as in her complaint,salkin failed to ask for a declaration that saber quit claim deed to slobodinsky conveyed nothing.
slobodinsky responded to salkin motion for summary judgment on november,and simultaneously moved for summary judgment against salkin.slobodinsky pleading contended that no merger had occurred according to florida land trust law.slobodinsky thus asked that the court deny the plaintiff motion for summary judgment and enter summary judgment in slobodinsky favor and dismiss counts i and ii in this case with prejudice.
on february,the bankruptcy court,in a memorandum order,ruled on the for summary judgment.the same day,the court issued a partial final judgment,which stated that it was being entered pursuant to the court order on the parties for summary judgment 
the court february memorandum order denied salkin motion for summary judgment against slobodinsky as to the avoidance of the alleged fraudulent transfer of the counsel building.the court reason for denying salkin motion was that there was never a transfer of the counsel building from saber to slobodinsky at all,because a merger had occurred in saber t his court,in conformity with florida case law and with respect to,holds that the merger doctrine operated to terminate the land trust on august,when saber obtained of the equitable interest in the personal property of the land trust and of the legal and equitable interest in the real property of the land trust.because saber was the fee simple absolute owner,the court reasoned,his july,assignment to slobodinsky of all interest in the property held subject to said trust agreement was ineffective in transferring the counsel building or an interest therein to slobodinsky.further,because saber was still the fee simple absolute owner on january,when he executed the quit claim deed as successor trustee of the land trust to slobodinsky as second successor trustee,the quit claim deed was simply a nullity.because no property was transferred to slobodinsky on january,or within one year prior to the petition date,because saber owned the counsel building as of the petition date,and because the counsel building is property of saber bankruptcy estate,the court denied the relief salkin was seeking a judgment avoiding the alleged transfer of the counsel building.
the court did not explicitly rule on slobodinsky for summary judgment,but the parties,in their briefs to us,have treated the bankruptcy court memorandum order as having denied the motion.the question before the bankruptcy court was whether slobodinsky had received the counsel building via a fraudulent transfer.while salkin contended that the transfer was fraudulent and slobodinsky asserted that the transfer was licit,both agreed that there was a transfer.the court disagreed,however,finding that there had been no transfer at all.it thus necessarily rejected slobodinsky motion for summary judgment,even if the rejection was merely implicit.
in its memorandum order,the court did not take the additional step of quieting the title to the counsel building.the court could have done so by forcing slobodinsky to give salkin a quit claim deed to the building,or by issuing a declaratory judgment.thereafter,salkin could have recorded the deed or judgment and the title would have been clear.
on march,slobodinsky appealed the bankruptcy court memorandum order to the district court.subsequently,on may,the bankruptcy court closed the adversary proceeding.with the adversary proceeding closed,salkin assumed that the bankruptcy court had conclusively determined that the counsel building was part of the bankruptcy estate.she therefore moved the court,on may,to approve the sale of the building she amended her motion on june and again on june.the bankruptcy court docket sheet reveals that slobodinsky,as an interested party,objected to the sale.
on june,the bankruptcy court granted salkin motion,approving the sale of the counsel building to abe s
