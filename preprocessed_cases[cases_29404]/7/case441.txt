opinion of the court 
debtor bradley orton appeals from an order by the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania,which affirmed the united states bankruptcy court for the western district of pennsylvania judgment.construing the wildcard exemption in d,those courts held that the trustee for the estate,not the debtor,is entitled to any appreciation in value of the estate assets that surpasses the dollar amount exempted.the bankruptcy court and the district court reasoned that orton had exempted only an interest in an asset,rather than the asset itself,and thus was entitled to merely the dollar amount listed as exempt in schedule c accompanying his bankruptcy petition and not to any future appreciation in value.applying the teachings of the supreme court decision in schwab reilly,we will affirm.
the facts,insofar as they concern us here,are few.orton filed an emergency voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code in january and filed his required schedules and statements shortly thereafter.this appeal concerns two of orton claimed exemptions.on schedule a real property,orton listed his interest in acres of vacant land that is subject to an oil and gas lease.orton stated that the fair market value of the entire parcel was and claimed an exemption for,of the value of the whole.on schedule b personal property,orton listed his interest in royalty interest in the oil and gas lease,to which he assigned a fair market value of one dollar.orton noted on schedule b that no well has been drilled on the property and that no royalties are currently due.on schedule c property claimed as exempt,orton claimed wildcard exemptions for these two interests,pursuant to d,and claimed as exempt the full amount of their value from schedules a and b and.
no party filed objections to these exemptions within the day period prescribed by rule b,federal rules of bankruptcy procedure.the trustee then filed a motion to close the case and to except orton royalty interest in the oil and gas lease from abandonment,thereby preserving her ability to recover any future royalties for the benefit of the estate in the event that a well were ever drilled on the property.orton agreed to close the case,but he objected to the trustee efforts to except the royalty interest from abandonment.orton contended that because a the royalty interest was subsumed in his real property interest,b he had claimed the full,fair market value for each,and c no party had objected to his list of exemptions,he had successfully and permanently removed those assets from the estate,thereby securing for himself the benefits and risks of future ap or depreciation,free from any creditors claims.
after a hearing,the bankruptcy court issued a memorandum and order on may,rejecting orton arguments.the court held that the trustee was entitled to pursue any future increase in value of the oil and gas lease above the amount explicitly stated as exempt in schedule 
on october,the district court for the western district of pennsylvania affirmed the order of the bankruptcy court.after examining the supreme court opinion in schwab reilly,the district court adopted the bankruptcy court reasoning in full.orton timely appealed.
the bankruptcy court had subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to and b.the district court had jurisdiction to review the bankruptcy court order pursuant to id a.we have subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to id.on an appeal from a bankruptcy case,our review duplicates that of the district court and view s the bankruptcy court decision unfettered by the district court determination in re graves,cir.accordingly,we apply a clearly erroneous standard to the bankruptcy court findings of fact and a plenary standard to its legal conclusions.in re handel,cir.
orton contends that he is entitled to any future appreciation in the oil and gas lease value,which may arise from the discovery of fossil fuels and the drilling of a well.but whether orton may collect on such an increase in value depends on our resolution of two preliminary issues whether exempting a dollar amount equal to the full fair market value of an asset wholly exempts that asset from the estate and,if not,whether a debtor may nevertheless pursue the appreciation in value of such assets in which the debtor retains only an interest.we agree with the bankruptcy court and the district court before us that schwab counsels that the answer to both questions is no.we will,therefore,affirm the judgments of those courts.
orton contends that,by claiming as exempt on schedule c the full value of his interests in the oil and gas lease and the real estate as estimated on schedules a and b,he wholly exempted those assets.the issue of whether a debtor listing of the fair market value of an asset fully exempts that asset from the estate is dealt with in and schwab.through dueling interpretations of both,the parties dispute how schwab affects orton attempt to wholly exempt an asset here.we hold that the bankruptcy court and the district court correctly construed schwab,and that orton did not fully exempt his gas and oil royalty interest nor his property interest.
because of their singular importance to this case,we review and the schwab reasoning briefly before turning to the particular contentions before us.when a debtor files for bankruptcy under chapter,all of the debtor assets become the property of the bankruptcy estate.see.section permits the debtor to reclaim certain property as exempt from the estate,subject to statutory limits and requirements.generally,wholly exempted property is excluded from the estate u nless a party in interest objects.see id.l.as distinguished from portions of the code that explicitly permit a debtor to exempt property as a whole,see,id d,c,d wildcard exemption at issue here allows the debtor to exempt an aggregate interest in any property,up to a certain dollar amount,id d emphasis added.
the supreme court squarely addressed the impact of the word interest as it pertains to the nature of assets exempted under d in schwab.the debtor in schwab valued an asset at on schedule b and exempted that same dollar amount on schedule c.the trustee did not object.when the trustee later discovered that the debtor had undervalued the asset,and that its actual value was far above the statutory exemption limit the trustee attempted to claim that additional value for the estate.the debtor contended that,no matter what the actual value of the asset was,she had indicated her intent to wholly exempt the asset from the estate by claiming as exempt on schedule c the same dollar value listed on schedule because of this indication of intent,the debtor continued,the trustee was obliged to object timely if he wished to preserve any of that asset value for the estate.
the schwab court rejected the debtor arguments.because d and define the property claimed as exempt as an interest in the debtor asset,not as the asset itself per se.at,the court held that merely listing as exempt on schedule c the same dollar value of an asset that appears as its estimated value on schedule b does not indicate an intent to wholly exempt that asset from the estate.as a result,a trustee need not object to exempted amounts that fall within the statutory limits to preserve the estate rights to any value above that listed in schedule c.the court clarified that w here,as here,it is important to the debtor to exempt the full market value of the asset or the asset itself,the debtor should declare the value of her claimed exemption in a manner that makes the scope of the exemption clear.id.at.as examples of how to successfully accomplish this,the court suggested that debtors list the exempt value as full fair market value fmv or of fmv.id.
turning to the present case,the bankruptcy court and the district court here both concluded that schwab straightforward holding doomed orton case.other than claiming as exempt in schedule c a dollar amount equal to the full estimated value of his assets in schedules a and b,orton did not take any actions to indicate his unambiguous intent to wholly exempt his assets from the estate.the bankruptcy co
