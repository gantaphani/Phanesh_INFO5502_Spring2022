after bart harrison dye filed for chapter bankruptcy,a dispute arose as to his ownership rights to a family farm.the bankruptcy court determined that dye had earlier deeded the farm to the government in lieu of foreclosure,so he no longer owned it.instead,the court found that he had exercised an option to purchase the farm,and was thus required to pay or forfeit his interest.after dye failed to make the payments for the farm within days,his chapter bankruptcy petition was dismissed.dye appealed and the district court affirmed.he now appeals to this court and we also affirm.
dye filed for chapter bankruptcy protection on august,seeking relief from debts that arose from a mortgage he had taken on his family farm in with the farm service agency fsa predecessor dye relationship with the fsa began in the early when the agency recorded three mortgages against property in which dye and his wife had varying interests.dye experienced financial difficulties and entered into an arrangement with the fsa on september,whereby he and his wife conveyed the farm to the fsa and were released from all personal liability on the mortgages.in other words,this transaction served as a voluntary conveyance in lieu of foreclosure.as part of this conveyance,dye received a credit of for his interest in the farm and the fsa forgave the balance of a loan to dye of in principal and in interest.in order to acquire the farm,fsa also paid alvin dye dye,dye brother,for his interest in a portion of the farm.the fsa recorded the deed in its name and then claims to have rented the farm to others for a period of approximately five years.
in a letter dated december,the fsa advised dye of a new program under which former owners of foreclosed property could enter into a lease back agreement with the fsa.on june,dye entered into a lease of the farm that he formerly owned.under this lease,dye had the right to exercise an option to buy the farm before the expiration of the lease,subject to certain terms and conditions,including the requirement that the balance of the purchase price had to be paid in cash at closing.
the fsa claims that dye exercised the option to purchase the farm by writing to the agency on may.he was sent a standard sales contract to sign and return to the fsa.the fsa never received the contract.instead,dye filed an administrative appeal regarding the purchase price of the farm and certain fish and wildlife easements on the farm.after losing the administrative case,dye filed a petition for review of the administrative determination in district court,and a judgment was entered on april,in favor of the government.in the meantime,dye filed for chapter bankruptcy on august,and asserted in his schedules that he was the owner of the farm and that the usda farm service agency had a first mortgage on the property.dye intent in filing chapter,as revealed by his counsel at the bankruptcy hearing,was to treat the money due under a installment land sales contract as a secured debt and cram it down,stretching the payments out over or years.
during dye bankruptcy proceedings,the fsa asserted ownership of the farm and requested that the court enter an order establishing a time for dye to assume or reject an option to purchase the land.in response,dye claimed that he never relinquished what he perceived to be his equitable interest in the property,and that the transaction resulted in him giving the fsa a deed held in lien of trust.he claims that he lived and worked on the farm ever since the transaction and has made payments to the fsa in the amount of.accordingly,he asserts an equitable interest in the farm and that his arrangement with the fsa constitutes an installment land sales contract.he also denies entering into the lease with an option to purchase,and,naturally,denies sending a letter to exercise any option.
the bankruptcy court rejected dye arguments and on september,pursuant to d,ordered that dye,within days,either assume the option to purchase the farm by tendering the purchase price of or that the option would be deemed rejected.dye did not tender payment,but instead appealed to the district court without requesting a stay of the period.the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court ruling.dye now appeals to this court.
the findings of fact of the bankruptcy court are reviewed for clear error.in re generes,cir.conclusions of law are reviewed de novo.see meyer rigdon,cir.this appeal involves application of d of the bankruptcy code,which provides,in pertinent part 
in a case under chapter of this title,the trustee may assume or reject an executory contract or unexpired lease of residential real property or of personal property of the debtor at any time before the confirmation of a plan but the court,on the request of any party to such contract or lease,may order the trustee to determine within a specified period of time whether to assume or reject such contract or lease.
pursuant to this provision,the bankruptcy judge determined that on june,dye entered into a lease with an option to purchase the farm that he formerly owned.the bankruptcy judge also determined that dye exercised his option to purchase on may,but failed to follow through by tendering the purchase price.these findings formed the framework for the bankruptcy judge decision to order dye to follow through with exercising the option by tendering the purchase price for the farm within days,or to forfeit the option.under the bankruptcy court ruling,dye has forfeited any interest in the farm because he apparently did not have the financing to follow through with the exercise of the option within the period and did not request a stay of the period.
dye does not challenge the bankruptcy court authority under d to order an executory contract or lease to be assumed or rejected.instead,he challenges the lower court underlying findings that he relinquished full title to the farm in to the fsa then entered into a lease with an option to purchase the farm in and finally,exercised the option to purchase in.accordingly,we begin the analysis by reviewing the transaction.
the record reveals that dye and his wife executed a general warranty deed on june,and the fsa recorded this deed in its name on september.dye acknowledges that the transfer was voluntary,but,as best we can tell,he now argues that his conveyance was in fact an equitable mortgage or installment land contract disguised as an absolute conveyance.whether an instrument is a mortgage or absolute conveyance is governed by the intent of the parties at the time the transaction is undertaken,and in assessing intent we may look at extrinsic or parol evidence if necessary.see,matter of willows of coventry.partnership,citing barber barber.
dye offers no evidence,extrinsic,parol,or otherwise,to support his equitable contract theory.an appellant brief must contain appellant contentions and the reasons for them,with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies.fed.a a.but dye cites nothing in the record for this court to review.he claims that he lived on the farm for the entire time after the transaction,and paid the fsa what he refers to as mortgage payments.while this argument is inherently plausible,dye fails to cite the record,and after our independent review we conclude that there is no evidence in the record for this position.dye had the opportunity to develop the record at the lower court level by testimony,affidavit,payment receipts,but did not.the fsa,for its part,has developed the record,at least as to this issue 
the fsa does cite to a copy of a warranty deed in the that indicates that bart dye and donna dye conveyed four tracts of land totaling just over acres to the united states through the fsa.the fsa claims that any payments made by dye were the result of his holdover tenancy.the courts below cited several reasons to support the finding that the transaction constituted an absolute conveyance of dye entire interest in the farm.for example,the district court cited the release from personal liability given by the fsa to the dyes acknowledging the conveyance of the real property.this document provided that dye was rele
