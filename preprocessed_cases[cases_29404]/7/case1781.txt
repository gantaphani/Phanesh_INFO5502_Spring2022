in a case of first impression in this circuit we are called upon to determine whether the person listed on the purchaser line of a cashier check exercises dominion over the funds for the purpose of determining who may be subject to a voidable preference in a bankruptcy adversary action.robert abele,the debtor trustee,seeks to avoid a fraudulent transfer,under,which was made to settle a debt owed to appellee modern financial plans services modern by the debtor husband.the debtor,cynthia cohen cynthia assisted her husband by purchasing a cashier check payable to modern with separate funds not listed as an asset in her husband bankruptcy,and designating her husband,jeffrey cohen jeffrey,as the purchaser on the face of the check.
the trustee appeals the district court decision affirming the bankruptcy court judgment in modern favor.the district court held that jeffrey was the initial transferee of the funds and that modern was the subsequent transferee who accepted the funds in good faith,pursuant to b.we have jurisdiction under d and,and we reverse and remand.we hold that modern was the initial transferee of the funds and is,therefore,strictly liable to the trustee.
the facts of this case are not in dispute.in,jeffrey purchased a mobile home for approximately.modern financed a third of the purchase price,and obtained a security interest in it.jeffrey sold the mobile home in,but failed to repay the loan.modern subsequently filed an action for damages and replevin against jeffrey and the buyer.instead of responding to the lawsuit,jeffrey filed his own chapter petition in july.
in august,modern proposed a reaffirmation agreement in which jeffrey would pay on or before september,and in monthly installments.because of jeffrey financial instability,the agreement required cynthia to guarantee the deferred payment.jeffrey,again,failed to pay modern.in october,modern filed a dischargeability complaint against jeffrey.
over the next seven months,the parties entered into various settlement agreements,none of which were consummated.finally,on march,jeffrey agreed to pay modern within seven days,of which was to cover modern attorneys fees.in exchange,modern agreed to release its lien on the mobile home and dismiss its complaints against jeffrey.jeffrey timely paid modern the full settlement amount,and modern released the lien and dismissed the lawsuits.
to pay the settlement amount,jeffrey gave his bankruptcy attorney a bank of america cashier check made payable to modern counsel.jeffrey was designated as the purchaser on the face of the check.unbeknownst to modern,cynthia had actually purchased the check from bank of america with her own funds.at the time of the purchase,cynthia was insolvent.
in june,cynthia filed her own chapter petition.cynthia trustee subsequently filed a complaint against modern to recover the proceeds of the cashier check alleging that the transfer was voidable,pursuant to a,because cynthia,not jeffrey,made the payment to modern,the payment took place less than one year prior to cynthia bankruptcy filing,and cynthia was insolvent at the time of the transfer.modern moved to dismiss,or for summary judgment,on the ground that cynthia did not transfer the funds to modern and that modern was a subsequent good faith transferee under b.the trustee filed a for summary judgment arguing that modern was the initial transferee under a,and that jeffrey was simply a courier of the funds.
after a hearing on the motions,the bankruptcy court held that modern was the initial transferee,and granted the trustee motion.modern appealed to the bankruptcy appellate panel bap,which reversed the bankruptcy court decision and remanded the case for a determination of whether modern was a good faith subsequent transferee under b.see modern fin.plans servs.abele in re cohen.
on remand,the bankruptcy court determined that modern had no duty of inquiry because the cashier check stated on its face that jeffrey,the obligor,was the purchaser of the instrument.it therefore held b provided modern with a safe harbor and granted judgment in its favor.the trustee appealed to the united state district court for the district of arizona,which affirmed the bap decision that modern was not the initial transferee,and upheld the bankruptcy court holding that modern had satisfied b.accordingly,the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court final order granting modern motion for summary judgment this appeal followed.
in reviewing a district court affirmance of a bankruptcy court decision,we follow the same rule as the district of fact are reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard,and conclusions of law are reviewed de novo.in re cal.trade technical,cir.see also onink cardelucci in re cardelucci,cir.issues of statutory interpretation are also reviewed de novo.see in re cardelucci,at.
a trustee may set aside a transfer of an interest of the debtor if the debtor made the transfer within one year of the date she filed a chapter petition,and if she was insolvent at the time of the transfer.see a.in this case,the parties do not dispute that a fraudulent transfer occurred within the meaning of the statute.if a transfer is voidable under,the debtor trustee may recover from either the initial transferee of such transfer or the entity for whose benefit such transfer was made or any immediate or mediate transferee of such initial transfer.a.
a trustee right to recover differs dramatically depending on which section is applicable.under the first section,t he trustee right to recover from an initial transferee is absolute.schafer las vegas hilton in re video depot,cir citing b.under the second section,the trustee may only recover if the subsequent transferee did not accept the transfer for value,in good faith,and without knowledge of the transfer voidability.id.thus,the good faith exception,or safe harbor,is only available to subsequent transferees.
while the term transferee is not defined by the bankruptcy code,it is generally accepted that a transferee is one who,at a minimum,has dominion over the money or other asset,the right to put the money to one own purposes.bonded fin,european am.bank,cir.see also in re video depot,at same in re bullion reserve of,cir same.in practical terms,the dominion test requires that a transferee be free to invest the whole amount in lottery tickets or uranium stocks.bonded fin,at.dominion is therefore akin to legal control,the right to invest the funds as one chooses,not mere possession.see bowers atlanta motor speedway,cir t he dominion and control test as set forth in bonded requires legal dominion and control over the funds transferred.in re coutee,cir dominion or control means legal dominion or control.
based upon the above definitions,the trustee contends that modern was the initial transferee.we agree.
case law discussing the rights of a remitter,or purchaser,of a cashier check is scant.the most closely analogous case in this circuit,and that relied upon by the district court,the bap,and modern,to argue that modern was not the initial transferee,is in re video depot.
in video depot,jeffrey arlynn,the president of video depot and an active gambler,purchased a cashier check with video depot funds in order to pay off his gambling debt at hilton in las vegas,nevada.the check was made payable to hilton and listed video depot as the purchaser on the face of the instrument.arlynn delivered the cashier check together with a personal check to hilton.several months later,video depot filed for bankruptcy and the company trustee brought a fraudulent transfer claim against hilton.
in determining whether hilton was the initial transferee of the cashier check purchased by video depot,the bankruptcy court considered whether a corporate principal power to direct corporate resources constituted legal dominion or control.holding in the negative,the bankruptcy court held that even though arlynn controlled the business operations of video depot,once the check was issued he did not have legal control over the funds,even though he retained physical possession of the instrument.because the cashier check was construed as a direct transfer from video depot to hilton,arly
