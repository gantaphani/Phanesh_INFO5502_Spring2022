in august,airways filed for bankruptcy.in order to secure the financing necessary to emerge from bankruptcy,airways was forced to terminate the pension plans it administered for its active and retired pilots.a bankruptcy court approved this termination,and this court eventually held that a claim to reverse the termination was equitably moot.in september,airways again filed for bankruptcy.a year later,airways emerged from this second bankruptcy with a second plan of reorganization.
six months after airways emergence from its second bankruptcy,edwin perrow bosiger,brought suit in federal district court contending that airways had improperly terminated his pension during its first bankruptcy.the district court dismissed bosiger claim,holding that it was barred because bosiger failed to file a proof of claim during airways second bankruptcy.after careful consideration,we agree with the district court and affirm its decision.it is simply too late in the day for bosiger to challenge the termination of his pension unwinding airways second bankruptcy at this stage would not only unduly lengthen the airline restructuring,but it would also upset the legitimate interests of those creditors who relied on airways reorganization plan.
in the,airways group,us airways,and the air line pilots association alpa,an international union representing airways active pilots,reached an agreement on retirement benefits.this agreement called for retired pilots to receive,on a monthly basis,a share of their final salary adjusted for the length of their tenure with airways.
in order to provide these monthly benefits,airways established a pension plan referred to as the top hat retirement plan plan.the plan supplemented the retirement income plan for pilots of airways pilots defined benefit plan.the pilots defined benefit plan was a pension plan capped by the internal revenue code,such that it alone could not provide the total retirement benefits promised to airways pilots under the agreement with alpa.
the plan,on the other hand,paid retirement benefits above and beyond those payable by the pilots defined benefit plan.although never memorialized in a written contract,the plan was maintained pursuant to the original collective bargaining agreement and subsequent letters of agreement between airways and alpa.these letters recognized that the plan was necessary to pay benefits which can not be paid from the pilots defined benefit plan due to limitations imposed by the internal revenue code.
on august,airways filed for chapter bankruptcy in order to continue its operations during its reorganization and successfully emerge from chapter,airways needed almost billion in financing.us airways was able to assemble a syndicate of lenders willing to provide this amount,but the lenders were only willing to extend the credit if airways was able to meet certain financial targets.
a major threat to airways ability to access the loans was an escalating pension funding problem,particularly with respect to its pilots,who accounted for a substantial portion of airways outstanding pension obligations.at the same time passenger revenues had dropped precipitously in the wake of the september terrorist attacks,lower interest rates and a poor stock market had greatly decreased the performance of airways defined benefit pension plans,increasing the airline projected contribution to the plans.this left airways with insufficient cash flow to both meet its pension obligations and achieve the financial targets necessary to access the required funding.after exploring various potential solutions to this problem,airways determined that,so long as its pilot pension plans were in place,it would be unable to secure the financing it needed to emerge from chapter.
us airways thus sought to restructure its pilot pension obligations,with its ultimate goal being the termination of the two existing pension plans pilots defined benefit plan and plan and their replacement with a defined contribution plan.to do so,airways petitioned the bankruptcy court to allow a distress termination of its pilots defined benefit plan under the employee retirement income security act erisa,c b ii iv.us airways did not specifically request the distress termination of the plan because it was under the belief that the plan was a top hat plan,terminable simply pursuant to an express agreement between airways and alpa approved by the bankruptcy court.
in march,the bankruptcy court ruled that airways satisfied erisa standards for distress termination.the court therefore allowed airways to terminate the pilots defined benefit plan,subject to a determination that the proposed termination did not violate the collective bargaining agreement with alpa.airways and alpa subsequently issued letter of agreement,which approved the termination of both pilot pension plans.the letter stated that the pilots defined benefit plan will be terminated and merged into a new defined contribution plan available only to active and pilots,while the plan will be terminated,and payments will permanently cease,effective march.
in light of this letter,the bankruptcy court authorized airways distress termination.at about the same time,the bankruptcy court also approved airways reorganization plan,one part of which stated that all retirement plans sponsored by airways will continue in effect except,to the extent terminated in accordance with applicable law,the retirement income plan for pilots of airways,and related top hat plan.finally,on march,airways emerged from bankruptcy,stopped paying benefits on the old pilots defined benefit and plans,and started contributing to the new defined contribution plan for pilots.at this point,retired pilots began to receive benefits from the pension benefit guaranty corporation,which had guaranteed the pilots defined benefit plan.
as airways emerged from bankruptcy,airways retired pilots appealed the district court distress termination decision,seeking to have their old pension benefits restored.but since the retired pilots had neglected to have the termination and reorganization orders stayed,and since the orders had been implemented and relied on by third parties,the district court held that the suit was equitably moot.this court affirmed on the same grounds in in re airways group,cir.
in september,airways again filed for bankruptcy.a year later,in september,airways emerged from its second bankruptcy with a new plan of reorganization.
petitioner edwin perrow bosiger,is a retired airways pilot who,before airways first bankruptcy,had received benefits from both the pilots defined benefit plan and the plan.during airways second bankruptcy,airways notified bosiger by letter of the chapter filing date and the bar date for filing general unsecured claims and entry of the order confirming the second plan of reorganization,the effective date of the plan of reorganization,and the bar date for filing certain administrative and rejection damage claims.though provided with these two notices,bosiger did not file a claim during the second bankruptcy.
bosiger instead chose to bring suit against airways six months later,filing a complaint in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia on march.bosiger argued that airways had improperly terminated the plan during its first bankruptcy because the plan was a top hat plan in name only,and therefore not terminable merely through express agreement between airways and alpa.bosiger therefore contended that he was still entitled to his benefits under the plan.
us airways responded by filing a rule b motion,alleging that bosiger complaint failed to state a claim for various reasons.most relevant to this appeal,airways argued that,even if the termination of the plan was unlawful,bosiger had waived any right to challenge the termination of the plan by failing to file a proof of claim during airways second bankruptcy.
in september,after considering bosiger reply to airways motion to dismiss and argument at a hearing on the matter,the district court granted airways motion.the district court articulated two grounds for its holding.first,the court stated that airways appropriately considered the plan to be a top hat plan.thus,airways had properly terminated the plan during its first bankruptcy,pursuant to its letter of agreement with alpa and the bankruptcy court approval of airways reorganization plan.
second,and in the alternative,the district court held that bosiger claim is barred because he failed to file a proof of claim during airways second bankruptcy.the court reasoned that,to the extent bosiger had a valid claim after the plan was terminated on march,he became a creditor when airways entered chapter a second time in september.thus,bosiger was required to file a proof of claim during the second bankruptcy proceeding his failure to do so led to his claims being discharged along with the rest of airways debts when airways emerged from bankruptcy a second time in september.
bosiger now appeals the district court order dismissing his complaint,arguing that each of the court alternate grounds for its holding constituted error.in particular,bosiger challenges the court finding that the plan was a top hat plan,and argues that his failure to file a proof of claim during airways second bankruptcy should not bar his present suit.
we review bosiger appeal from the district court rule b dismissal de novo,smith sydnor,cir,and affirm.in reaching this decision,it is not necessary for us to address whether airways appropriately classified the plan as a top hat plan,because we find that the district court alternate ground for its holding is sufficient to support our ruling.
as the district court stated,when bosiger failed to file a proof of claim during airways second bankruptcy,any potential claim he had to payments under the plan was extinguished.one of the primary purposes of bankruptcy is the discharge of debts,and the bankruptcy code and rules explicitly several all of a debtor obligations terminate upon the debtor emergence from bankruptcy.bosiger does not contest the fact that he failed to file a claim.instead,he argues that he was not on proper notice of airways second bankruptcy,and it was therefore improper for the district court to dismiss his claim.we find,however,that the district court did not err in determining that bosiger had received adequate notice and properly dismissed bosiger suit on these grounds.
the principal purpose of bankruptcy is straightforward to grant a fresh start to the honest but unfortunate debtor.marrama citizens bank of massachusetts,d quoting grogan garner,d.to this end,successful completion of the reorganization process allows a debtor,burdened with the weight of oppressive indebtedness,to restructure its financial obligations,discharge its debt,and emerge from bankruptcy with a new capital structure that better reflects financial reality.local loan hunt.quoting williams fid.guar.replacing the old capital structure with a new one requires the termination of the rights inherent in the old structure.douglas baird,et,bankruptcy cases,problems,and materials revised ed.
several provisions of the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure and the bankruptcy code work in unison to ensure that debtors receive a fresh start after emerging from bankruptcy.first,bankruptcy rule c requires that claimants against an estate in bankruptcy file timely proofs of claim in order to participate in a reorganization.chemetron jones,cir.failure to bring forward such a broadly as any right to payment,see a before the claims bar date established by the bankruptcy court forfeits a claimant right to participate in a bankruptcy reorganization.see fed.c see also chemetron,at.second,the bankruptcy code specifically states that a bankruptcy court confirmation of a restructuring plan discharges the debtor from any debt that arose before the confirmation of the plan.d a see also united states carolina parachute,cir.third,the bankruptcy code further insulates a debtor from his obligations by stating that the discharge of debts operates as an injunction against the commencement or continuation of an action,the employment of process,or an act,to collect,recover,or offset any such debt as a personal liability of the debtor,whether or not discharge of such debt is waived.a.taken together,these three provisions prevent creditors from hounding a debtor after restructuring,ensuring that the bankruptcy code provides a true fresh start.
in light of the directives of the bankruptcy code and rules,it is clear that bosiger claim for payment under the plan is foreclosed by airways second bankruptcy.if airways improperly terminated the plan during its first bankruptcy,as bosiger alleges,bosiger injury made him an unsecured creditor of airways,and therefore the holder of a claim within the meaning of a,during the second bankruptcy.as the holder of a bankruptcy claim,bosiger was required,under fed.c,to file a proof of that claim with the bankruptcy court before the bar date in order to participate in airways reorganization.he did not do so,and thus,as the bankruptcy court recognized in its bar date order,airways was forever discharged from any and all indebtedness or liability with respect to any claims not brought to the court attention.
although this alone is sufficient to foreclose bosiger claim,the bankruptcy court confirmation of airways second plan of reorganization offers further proof that bosiger claim is barred.in its confirmation order,the bankruptcy court explicitly cited d and stated that airways emergence from bankruptcy served to extinguish all claims and causes of action,whether known or unknown.moreover,the confirmation order mirrors a in further noting that the discharge of airways debts serves to enjoin any person from commencing or continuing any action to collect,offset,or recover any claim discharged under this plan.it is thus clear that airways second bankruptcy discharged any claim bosiger had to payment under the plan.
the bankruptcy court in this the bankruptcy code and rules in recognize the dramatic consequences that would result if bosiger were able to circumvent airways bankruptcy proceedings.to begin,allowing individual creditors to opt out of a formal bankruptcy proceeding in order to bring a subsequent civil lawsuit against a debtor only serves to make bankruptcy proceedings more complex and more costly.such an outcome directly contradicts the supreme court teaching that the prompt and efficient administration and settlement of a debtor estate is a principal goal of bankruptcy law.katchen landy,d.
more importantly,unwinding the finality of bankruptcy upsets not only the expectations of the creditors who actually do participate in the bankruptcy proceedings,but also the reliance interests of the creditors who have advanced funds based on the new capital structure laid out in the reorganization plan.see in re airways group,cir.this upsetting of reliance interests could ultimately reduce the incentives for anyone to participate in the bankruptcy process.if individual,creditors were able to avoid the diminution of their assets inherent in the bankruptcy process by pursuing a separate legal claim,there would be no incentive for anyone to participate in a corporate reorganization.likewise,lenders would be much less likely to extend financing to debtors faced with uncertain liabilities on claims not discharged through their bankruptcy.at the very least,allowing claims such as bosiger would greatly increase the cost of capital to debtors emerging from bankruptcy,diminishing their prospects of becoming viable,liquid enterprises.it is thus no exaggeration to say that the very functioning of the bankruptcy system is dependent on its finality.
it would be difficult for any claimant to challenge directly the critical role played by finality in the bankruptcy process.instead,bosiger simply contests the district court conclusion that he was on notice of airways second bankruptcy.since notice consistent with the due process clause is a prerequisite for the discharge of a creditor debts in bankruptcy,bosiger argues that it was improper to dismiss his claim if he did not receive constitutionally adequate notice.
bosiger argument proceeds as follows.first,bosiger notes that a court is not to consider matters outside th
