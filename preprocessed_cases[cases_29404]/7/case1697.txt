in this appeal,we are presented with the question of whether a bankruptcy court has subject matter jurisdiction to enter a money judgment in a nondischargeability adversary proceeding where the underlying debt has been reduced to judgment in state court.we conclude that it may and affirm the decision of the ninth circuit bankruptcy appellate panel bap.
in,sokoloff,as trustee of camelot medical group,profit sharing plan,obtained a judgment against sasson on a for breach of a promissory note.a california superior court entered judgment against sasson for,plus accrued interest and statutory costs.
before sokoloff could enforce the judgment,sasson filed a motion for reconsideration and obtained a stay of enforcement pending determination of the motion for reconsideration.the stay was granted subject to the condition that sasson not dissipate any assets except in the normal course of business.while the stay was in place and without informing the court of his actions,sasson dissipated the majority of his assets through dissolution proceedings with his wife,purchase of a new property,creation of encumbrance on that property and ultimately by payment to other creditors.the court denied sasson motion for reconsideration,and sokoloff recorded an abstract of judgment.at that point,however,the judgment was uncollectible.
subsequently,sasson filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code,in the northern district of california.his bankruptcy schedule did not mention sasson recent transfer of assets.sokoloff then filed a complaint seeking a determination of nondischargeability of the state court judgment under a and a denial of discharge under a the bankruptcy court rejected the a claim,but found that sasson transfer of assets in violation of the state court stay constituted a willful and malicious injury under a.the court entered a judgment for plus costs and accruing interest.sasson filed an appeal of this decision,but later dismissed it.subsequently,both sasson bankruptcy and the adversary proceeding were closed by the bankruptcy court.
sokoloff continued to pursue collection remedies in bankruptcy court.sokoloff filed a notice of the judgment lien and recorded an abstract of judgment.sokoloff then obtained a writ of execution to the united states marshal and instructed the marshal to levy on sasson wages.sasson filed a claim of exemption,which the court granted in part.
in,sokoloff renewed the judgment.the bankruptcy court issued an abstract of judgment for on july,which was then recorded.subsequently,the bankruptcy court granted sasson motion to reopen his chapter proceedings for sixty days.sasson then filed a motion pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b to vacate the money judgment and to quash the abstract of judgment.in his motion,sasson argued that the bankruptcy court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to enter a new federal money judgment and therefore the renewal of judgment and abstract of judgment were void ab initio.the bankruptcy court denied the motion after a hearing.sasson filed a notice of appeal,which was referred to the bap.the bap affirmed the bankruptcy court,holding that the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction both to enter the judgment of nondischargeability and to determine the amount of damages caused by sasson postjudgment conduct.sokoloff timely appealed the bap decision.

the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction to enter a money judgment in the adversary proceeding.we have long held that the bankruptcy court has jurisdiction to enter a monetary judgment on a disputed state law claim in the course of making a determination that a debt is nondischargeable.cowen kennedy in re kennedy,cir.
our holding in kennedy was firmly grounded.under the original bankruptcy act,stat.repealed as amended through date of repeal bankruptcy act,bankruptcy courts were considered to have equitable jurisdiction to issue orders in aid of a nondischargeability determination.local loan hunt.see also pepper litton.f or many purposes courts of bankruptcy are essentially courts of equity,and their proceedings inherently proceedings in equity.internal quotation marks omitted.
in,congress codified the power of bankruptcy courts,in the exercise of their power to declare debts nondischargeable,to determine the remaining issues,render judgment,and make all orders necessary for the enforcement thereof.bankruptcy act c.when congress enacted the bankruptcy reform act of,stat.bankruptcy code or code,congress removed specific jurisdictional language in favor of a general broad jurisdictional grant.however,in doing so,it clearly intended to incorporate the specific jurisdiction of the bankruptcy courts in addition,the bankruptcy code specifically provides that 
the court may issue any order,process,or judgment that is necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this title.no provision of this title providing for the raising of an issue by a party in interest shall be construed to preclue the court from,sua sponte,taking any action or making any determination necessary or appropriate to enforce or implement court orders or rules,or to prevent an abuse of process.
a emphasis added.thus,the bankruptcy court clearly has the power under the bankruptcy code to determine whether a debt is nondischargeable,to determine the remaining issues,render judgment,and make all orders necessary for the enforcement thereof,and to issue any order,process,or judgment that is necessary or appropriate in carrying out the order of nondischargeability.
in addition to continuation of the bankruptcy court jurisdiction and the specific grant of new powers,the bankruptcy code provided for the exercise of original but not exclusive jurisdiction of all civil proceedings arising under title,or arising in or related to cases under title.b.a bankruptcy court related to jurisdiction is very broad,including nearly every matter directly or indirectly related to the bankruptcy.mann alexander dawson in re mann,cir.the bankruptcy court related to jurisdiction granted by the bankruptcy code derives directly from the bankruptcy clause,which grants congress the power t o establish uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies throughout the united states.congress expanded the bankruptcy court article i jurisdiction by granting federal district courts with original and exclusive jurisdiction of all cases under title.a.thus,at present,the bankruptcy court related to jurisdiction also includes the district court supplemental jurisdiction pursuant to over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within the court original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under article iii of the united states constitution.see montana goldin in re pegasus gold,cir sec.farms int l of teamsters,cir.
even the discharge of a debtor does not automatically deprive the federal courts of jurisdiction over a claim related to the bankruptcy.see kieslich united states in re kieslich,cir.indeed,we have held that a bankruptcy court related to jurisdiction includes jurisdiction over state court actions such as breach of contract,breach of convenant of good faith and fair dealing,and fraud when those claims have a close nexus to the bankruptcy proceeding.in re pegasus gold,at see also celotex edwards,d.we have also held that bankruptcy courts have jurisdiction to enjoin collection actions,even if those actions occur in another country.hong kong shanghai banking simon in re simon,cir.
in addition,bankruptcy courts retain their traditional equitable powers under the bankruptcy code.johnson home state bank,d per curiam t he bankruptcy court retains its broad equitable power to issue any order,process,or judgment that is necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of the code.quotation marks omitted.as the supreme court has instructed,when a creditor files a claim in bankruptcy,the creditor triggers the process of allowance and disallowance of claims,thereby subjecting himself to the bankruptcy court equitable power.langenkamp culp,d quoting granfinanciera,nordberg,d.the bankruptcy court equitable power is not unfettered it must be exercised to carry out the provisions of the bankruptcy code.saxman educ.credit mgmt.in re saxman,cir.however,we have recognized that a bankruptcy court is a court of equity and should invoke equitable principles and doctrines,refusing to do so only where their application would be inconsistent with the bankruptcy code.beaty selinger in re beaty,cir citing in re myrvang,at.
bankruptcy courts have exclusive jurisdiction over nondischargeability actions brought pursuant to a,and.rein providian fin,cir.this is a dischargeability action brought pursuant to a.as we reasoned in kennedy 
if it is acknowledged as beyond question that a complaint to determine dischargeability of a debt is exclusively within the equitable jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court,then it must follow that the bankruptcy court may also render a money judgment in an amount certain without the assistance of a jury.this is true not merely because equitable jurisdiction attaches to the entire cause of action but more importantly because it is impossible to separate the determination of dischargeability function from the function of fixing the amount of the nondischargeable debt.
kennedy,at quoting snyder devitt in re devitt.our sister circuits have reached similar conclusions.porges gruntal in re porges,cir longo mclaren in re mclaren,cir hallahan in re hallahan,cir.given the text and history of the bankruptcy code and the bankruptcy court inherent equitable powers,it is clear,as we held in kennedy,that bankruptcy courts have jurisdiction and power to enter money judgments in adjudicating nondischargeability adversary proceedings.
sasson attempts to distinguish kennedy from this case because kennedy involved an unliquidated claim.kennedy made no such distinction,and there is no principled jurisdictional distinction to be drawn.there is nothing in the text of the bankruptcy code or its history that contains a jurisdictional exception for debts that have been liquidated to judgment.to hold otherwise would be to deprive the bankruptcy court of its exclusive jurisdiction over bankruptcy discharge pursuant to a.as the supreme court has noted,s ince,the issue of nondischargeability has been a matter of federal law governed by the terms of the bankruptcy code.grogan garner,d citing brown felsen,d.the bankruptcy code provides that bankruptcy courts may issue any order,process,or judgment that is necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this title.notably,it does not contain an additional clause stating except when the debt has been liquidated to judgment.
the debtor invoked bankruptcy court subject matter and in personam jurisdiction by filing a voluntary petition in bankruptcy.with the commencement of the case,the bankruptcy court acquired exclusive in rem jurisdiction over all the debtor legal or equitable interests in property wherever located and by whomever held.e commodity futures trading comm co petro mktg.group,cir.by filing a proof of claim,the creditor in this case became subject to the bankruptcy court in personam jurisdiction,and the limitations of the bankruptcy code.in re simon,at.the parties were clearly subject to both subject matter and in personam jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court.
the fact that a debt has been previously liquidated to judgment does not deprive the bankruptcy court of jurisdiction,nor of any of its statutory and equitable power.it may,as we shall discuss in part,have an effect on the form of relief that the bankruptcy court grants in nondischargeability proceedings.however,it does not alter the kennedy jurisdictional analysis.the existence of a state court judgment does not deprive the bankruptcy court of the statutory power to enter a new judgment of nondischargeability.
sasson argues that the doctrine alters this jurisdictional analysis.however,the doctrine did not deprive the bankruptcy court of jurisdiction to enter the money judgment in the nondischargeability adversary proceeding.the doctrine is based on the statutory proposition that federal district courts are courts of original,not appellate,jurisdiction.see.therefore,federal district courts have no authority to review the final determinations of a state court in judicial proceedings.worldwide church of god mcnair,cir.only the supreme court has original jurisdiction to review f inal judgments or decrees rendered by the highest court of a state in which a decision could be had.a.as the supreme court has recently explained,the doctrine is confined to cases of the kind from which the doctrine acquired its name cases brought by losers complaining of injuries caused by judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.exxon mobil saudi basic,d.
application of the doctrine in bankruptcy is limited by the separate jurisdictional statutes that govern federal bankruptcy law.gruntz county of los angeles in re gruntz,cir en banc.the doctrine has little or no application to bankruptcy proceedings that invoke substantive rights under the bankruptcy code or that,by their nature,could arise only in the context of a federal bankruptcy case.id.at.in the exercise of federal bankruptcy power,bankruptcy courts may avoid state judgments in core bankruptcy proceedings,see,may modify judgments,see,and,of primary importance in this context,may discharge them,see.
the doctrine has no application here.sasson is not seeking to have the bankruptcy court review the merits of the state court judgment rather,he is attempting to prevent the bankruptcy court from giving effect to the state court judgment.likewise,the creditor is not seeking modification of the state court judgment it is attempting to save the judgment from bankruptcy discharge.
in entering judgment,the bankruptcy court was exercising its exclusive statutory power to determine whether a debt is dischargeable in a bankruptcy case.see a,a.actions seeking a determination of nondischargeability are core bankruptcy proceedings,see b i,and are not subject to the doctrine.see gruntz,at.the doctrine did not deprive the bankruptcy court of jurisdiction to enter the money judgment in this case.
sasson also argues that the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction to enter a money judgment by operation of the full faith and credit statute,and the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel.unlike the doctrine,these doctrines do not affect the jurisdiction of federal courts.see,eeoc children hosp.med.ctr.of,cir en banc r es judicata is an affirmative defense under the rules of civil procedure.c.it is not a jurisdictional doctrine.moreover,central to the operation of the bankruptcy courts is the idea that the debtor debts,including debts liquidated to judgments,may be modified and discharged.see.
in short,f inal judgments in state courts are not necessarily preclusive in united states bankruptcy courts.gruntz,at.thus,we must reject sasson argument that the doctrines of full faith and credit,res judicata,and collateral estoppel deprive the bankruptcy court of the jurisdiction to enter a money judgment in a discharge order involving liquidated debts.
this does not,of course,mean that the preclusion doctrines do not have any bearing on federal bankruptcy discharge proceedings.the supreme court has stated that collateral estoppel principles do indeed apply in discharge exception proceedings pursuant to a.grogan,at.further,we have held that t he full faith and credit requirement of compels a bankruptcy court in a a a nondischargeability proceeding to give collateral estoppel effect to a prior state court judgment.gayden nourbakhsh in re nourbakhsh,cir per curiam
