the question posed by this case is whether a party failure to timely inform the court of appeals of a settlement that it believes disposes of a pending appeal precludes the party from asserting the affirmative defense of settlement and release in a later proceeding.over its objection,chapter debtor cellular,was ordered to pay an administrative claim of approximately.cellular appealed the order to this court.while the appeal was pending,cellular entered into a settlement agreement that it believed released the claim.rather than advise the court of appeals of the settlement,though,cellular continued to pursue its appeal on other grounds.that effort proved unsuccessful,as we affirmed the award.after it lost on appeal,cellular tried to fend off payment of the award by raising a settlement and release defense.the bankruptcy court and the bankruptcy appellate panel bap both concluded that it was too late for cellular to unveil that argument and ordered disbursement of funds to pay the administrative claim.we agree and affirm,answering yes to the question posed above.
background 
this case arises out of a bankruptcy court order in awarding to channel communications,and john price from the estate of cellular,for attorneys fees and costs incurred in connection with cellular chapter proceedings.the details of that award are not necessary for resolution of the current appeal,but some understanding of the relationship among the players and the genesis of the award may be helpful.
as its name suggests,cellular sold wireless telephone services and equipment in santa barbara,california.it did so as an agent of channel,which was an authorized at t wireless services dealer.cellular was thus a subdealer of at t wireless services in the area.at the time the relevant events began,channel was entirely owned by john price and his wife.cellular had a right of first refusal if price sold channel.
at t sought to terminate its contract with channel,complaining that channel and cellular engaged in improper business practices.to resolve their dispute,price and at t agreed that price would sell a controlling interest in channel to at t.at t and channel took the position that the sale would not trigger cellular right of first refusal because it would involve a transfer of only percent of channel shares,and they left cellular out of the deal.cellular saw things differently and sued at t in state court for interference with its business.cellular also filed a petition for reorganization under chapter in bankruptcy court.
once in bankruptcy court,cellular failed to present a reorganization plan.after the statutory period of exclusivity expired,price,channel,and at t jointly filed a reorganization proposal that permitted the partial sale of channel to at t to go forward and included a payment to cellular of nearly million from the proceeds.the plan also permitted cellular to continue to prosecute its lawsuit against at t.the bankruptcy court approved the plan over cellular objections.
shortly thereafter,channel and price filed an administrative priority claim seeking in attorneys fees and costs pursuant to b for their substantial contribution to cellular reorganization.the bankruptcy court granted the claim,in a reduced amount,over the objection of cellular.it awarded in fees and in expenses,for a total of.cellular appealed to the district court,which affirmed.cellular then filed its first appeal to this court.see cellular,channel commc ns,in re cellular,cir.
after briefing,but before oral argument,cellular executed a settlement agreement with at t,resolving the state court lawsuit.according to cellular,the broad language of the agreement irrevocable release of all claims against cellular held by at t,its subsidiaries,predecessors,or affiliates,also encompassed the administrative claim of channel and price against cellular cellular did not inform this court of the settlement,however,or argue to us that the settlement released the administrative claim that was the subject of the appeal.instead,the questions cellular presented on appeal concerned only the statutory basis for the claim.id.at.specifically,cellular argued that price and channel were ineligible to recover fees and costs under b for their assistance in cellular reorganization because price was not a creditor of the estate,channel did not substantially contribute to the reorganization plan,and price and channel acted in their own self interest.id.at.unaware of the settlement agreement or of its potential impact on the dispute,we issued a published opinion considering and rejecting cellular arguments and affirming the bankruptcy court award in full.id.
shortly after our decision,price and channel filed a motion with the bankruptcy court to disburse the funds held to pay their administrative claim.at that point cellular asserted that the claim had been released by its agreement with at t.in an oral ruling,the bankruptcy court held that the at t settlement agreement did not apply to the administrative claim and ordered disbursement of the funds.the court also noted that,if the release did apply to the administrative claim,as cellular asserted,then the prior appeal was 
moot by the time that it got to the ninth circuit for oral argument,and the argument certainly could have been and should have been raised there.if this ultimately goes back up to the ninth circuit,i wonder what kind of reception it would get when the ninth circuit finds out,well,you were rolling the dice to see if the judge would get reversed.otherwise,you got another arrow in your quiver.i think you have to shoot all the arrows at one time.
cellular appealed again,but chose to present its appeal to the bap rather than to the district court.the bap affirmed the bankruptcy court disbursement order,declining to reach the merits of cellular argument that its settlement with at t released channel and price joint administrative claim on behalf of price.it simply held that cellular had an obligation to raise the release issue when it was before the ninth circuit previously because the alleged release would have mooted the appeal.the bap concluded that cellular had therefore waived the argument.cellular petitioned for rehearing,arguing that a party can not waive a mootness defense because it is jurisdictional.the bap denied the petition,stating that cellular had not raised a mootness defense,only the affirmative defense of settlement and release.cellular timely appealed.
ii.discussion 
we review decisions of the bap de novo.price tr.in re price,cir christian life ctr.litig.def.comm.silva in re christian life ctr,cir.we review the bankruptcy court conclusions of law de novo and its factual findings for clear error.see price,at see also salazar mcdonald in re salazar,cir.
the litigation over this administrative claim has been going on since,and the parties have fought their way over the issue from the bankruptcy court to this court twice,passing through the district court and the bap one time each along the way.as a result,the matter has now been considered by no fewer than eleven judges and is the subject of two published opinions of this court.cellular contends that it has followed proper procedure and that it was appropriate for it to wait to raise its settlement defense when it did.we disagree.
the supreme court has held that all counsel have a duty to bring to the federal tribunal attention,without delay,facts that may raise a question of mootness.arizonans for official english arizona,d internal quotations,citations and emphasis omitted.according to the argument now made by cellular,its settlement with at t released channel and price administrative claim and rendered the litigation moot.that happened while cellular first appeal was pending before this court,as cellular was necessarily aware.cellular had an obligation to inform the court of the settlement and its belief that the claim had been released.
the obligation to inform the court of a potential settlement is of such critical importance to the maintenance of orderly proceedings and to the prevention of needless delay that a lawyer who fails to fulfill that obligation may be personally subject to
