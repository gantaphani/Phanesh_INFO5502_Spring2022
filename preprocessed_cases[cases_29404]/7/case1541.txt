we must decide whether a bankruptcy plan,which allegedly leaves a group of insurers paying more than their fair share on a large number of asbestos personal injury claims,complies with the bankruptcy code.
plant insulation plant is a california corporation that was founded in and made a successful business selling insulation through.beginning in the,there came a flood of lawsuits addressing diseases.see amchem,windsor,d.these inundated court dockets and swallowed several major companies.from the outset of this crisis through,plant was defended from this flood by fibreboard.in the subsequent years,plant insurers defended plant,but the insurers announced that plant coverage was exhausted.by,no insurer was willing to defend or to indemnify plant for asbestos claims.when the last insurer bowed out,over claims were still pending against plant.over additional suits were filed against plant between and.
at the same time that plant was struggling with continual asbestos lawsuits,it began to scale back its business operations.in may,plant president,shahram ameli,who owned of plant,decided to leave plant and start his own insulation contracting business,bayside insulation construction,bayside.at that time,plant transferred its installation and repair business to bayside and ceased operations in its own name.
faced with enormous numbers of asbestos lawsuits,few meaningful assets,no business operations,and no insurance coverage,plant went in search of other options.first,to stem the lawsuit tide,plant negotiated a series of informal standstill agreements with leading members of the california asbestos plaintiff bar.next,in early,plant managed to obtain million in coverage by suing the california insurance guarantee association ciga under policies plant had purchased from an insolvent insurance company.distributions from this fund were made based on a matrix that valued claims according to various metrics.about asbestos claimants were paid from this fund,but many more remained.
at some point along the way,plant decided that its original insurance policies might not be exhausted after all.on january,plant filed an action against its insurers in a california superior court,seeking declaratory relief as to whether the aggregate limits of their policies had truly been exhausted the coverage action.the next day,plant tendered all remaining asbestos claims to these insurers.the insurers have defended these claims under a reservation of rights.the coverage action remains unresolved.
by this time it was clear that plant bankruptcy in particular,a bankruptcy taking advantage of g,discussed below was on the horizon.in september,the asbestos claimants formed an informal committee the pre petition committee.the pre petition committee apparently believed that,in order to ensure that plant could obtain confirmation of a plan under g,plant needed to be resurrected from its current shell into an ongoing and functional business.see,in re combustion eng g,cir describing the ongoing business requirement of g in re asbestos.fortuitously,in april,the pre petition committee learned of plant asset transfer to bayside and notified bayside that the committee considered it to be liable for the debts of plant under theories of successor liability.according to the pre petition committee,if bayside did not agree to merge with plant as part of a contemplated chapter reorganization,it would face a deluge of successor liability suits.although there was some initial resistance to the merger in early,bayside agreed in principle to a plan under which it would merge with plant as part of the confirmation of a chapter plan.
plant filed for chapter bankruptcy on may.plant only meaningful remaining assets are its insurance policies.these insurance policies are held by plant either in the form of cash received from insurers who have repurchased the policies from plant the settling insurers,or in the form of the duties of the remaining insurers the non settling insurers to pay claims of injured persons,which are still under dispute in the coverage action.the settling insurers repurchased their policies under guarantees for complete peace from future litigation.such guarantees,embodied in the plan,include protection from contribution claims that might be brought against them by the nonsettling insurers.the bankruptcy court found these guarantees were necessary to incentivize insurers to settle and they form the crux of the disputes in this case.
before completing this factual and procedural history,a brief note on g would be helpful in understanding the ultimate issues in this appeal.section g was enacted in in light of the approach taken in the celebrated johns manville bankruptcy case.see in re thorpe insulation,cir citing kane johns manville,cir.the johns manville approach refers to the realization that,given the lengthy latency period of diseases,companies facing asbestos risk have no way finally to resolve or even effectively estimate their exposure.furthermore,if such companies collapse and liquidate,untold numbers of future claimants will be left without recovery.present claimants,however,want to get paid quickly and efficiently.the johns manville approach,now codified in g,seeks to use the broad equitable power of the bankruptcy court to resolve the dilemma in a way that is fair for both present and future asbestos claimants.
under g,a fiduciary stands in for the future asbestos claimants,and the court ensures that any proposed plan is fair to them.g b i ii.this is necessary because,under a g plan,the bankruptcy court enters a series of channeling injunctions that can put an end to all present and future asbestos litigation by preventing any entity from taking legal action to collect a claim or demand that is to be paid in whole or in part by a trust created through a qualifying plan of reorganization.collier on bankruptcy.in the typical g plan,present and future asbestos claimants obtain recovery from a trust with a recovery matrix.the trust is established by the plan and is generally funded by insurance proceeds and securities in the reorganized debtor.in theory,by funding the trust with securities of the reorganized debtor,the trust has an evergreen source of value for future asbestos claimants.in re combustion eng g,at.there are a number of special requirements a plan must meet for a debtor to obtain g injunctive relief 
today,the original johns manville case is a distant memory.apart from the presence of asbestos liability,plant situation could hardly be more different than johns manville situation in.unlike johns manville,plant has not been a functioning entity for at least a decade.furthermore,in stark contrast with the situation facing johns manville,the extent of the insurers obligations is far from clear.as a result,the plan in this case is entirely different from the johns manville plan and has apparently been proposed in an attempt to fit within the statute.the questions before us today essentially boil down to whether this arrangement passes muster.
the proposed bankruptcy plan was initially filed on may.it calls for the creation of a johns manville style trust primarily comprised of funds from the settling insurers approximately million in total cash.the trust will also own equity in the reorganized debtor after it has merged with bayside asbestos claimants can seek recovery from the trust and would be paid out according to a matrix that takes into account many factors about individual claimants.
in a notable deviation from the traditional johns manville style g reorganization,the equity interest in the reorganized debtor that the trust would own is not granted to the trust as part of the plan the trust must purchase the interest.the material terms of the transaction are as follows the trust is required to invest million in bayside,in exchange for which the trust would obtain a interest in the company an interest that the bankruptcy court found was worth a mere the trust has a warrant to purchase an additional of bayside at this set price per share the trust would receive a promissory note from bayside in the amount of,secured by the shares of other shareholders the trust would make a revolving loan to bayside in the amount of million bayside would perform all the duties that plant owes to its insurers under the insurance policies,but the trust will reimburse those costs the trust can force bayside to repurchase the trust shares after five years bayside has an option to repurchase the trust shares for the amount invested by the trust plus simple interest at.
in another deviation from the johns manville case and some other g cases,asbestos claimants here whether they seek recovery from the trust or not will still be able to pursue claims against in the tort system.any suits against are to be tendered to the non settling insurers.the channeling injunction,instead of completely enjoining these suits,provides that cases can proceed subject to certain limits.such arrangement,which the plan proponents have dubbed an open system,is necessary because with the uncertainty surrounding the insurance coverage of any given claim and some insurers refusing to claimants may not be able to get full recovery from the trust alone.
in order to provide finality for those insurers who have settled,the plan not only protects them from future liability via the channeling injunction,but also provides for a settling insurer injunction that bars non settling insurers from asserting equitable contribution claims against settling insurers it ensures that settling insurers can not be subject to any liability arising out of suits brought pursuant to the open system even suits from non settling insurers who might have had equitable claims.
the plan also provides narrow protections for the nonsettling insurers who may be subject to tort liability in such open system.first,any judgment against a non settling insurer is to be reduced by any amount previously paid to the claimant by the trust the trust payment credit.second,any judgment against a non settling insurer is to be reduced by the value of any equitable contribution claim that insurer would have had against any settling insurer the judgment reduction credit.these limits are enforced through the channeling injunction.
the non settling insurers objected to many aspects of the proposed plan.after a bench trial,the bankruptcy court overruled all objections.they appealed to the district court,which affirmed confirmation of the plan on october.the non settling insurers timely appealed to this court 
we review the bankruptcy court conclusions of law independently and de novo.see in re dominguez,cir.the standard of review to be applied to the bankruptcy court findings of fact was disputed at the district court and remains in dispute here.when the bankruptcy court is engaged in a core proceeding,its decision is a final decision and its factual findings are reviewed for clear error.in re harris,cir.however,when the bankruptcy court adjudicates a matter,it only has the power to make proposed findings of fact and law that a district court must review de novo.id.at see also c fed.b exhaustively lists all core proceedings.included in that list is confirmations of plans.b l.for this reason,the district court reviewed the bankruptcy court findings for clear error only.
the non settling insurers argue that confirmation of a g plan is a proceeding and findings of fact made there should be treated as only proposed findings under c.to support their argument,they assert that g plans have a unique requirement for their injunctions to be valid and enforceable they must be issued in connection with a plan issued or affirmed by the district court.g a thus,according to the non settling insurers,g confirmations by bankruptcy courts can not be final decisions and must be reviewed de novo.
the requirement in g a that the plan be issued or affirmed by the district court is insufficient to overcome the plain language of b l indicating that plan confirmations are final decisions.in light of this clear directive g a does not create an exception.indeed,the phrase issued or affirmed in g a,read literally,indicates that the review required by this section is in the posture of an appellate court.see black law dictionary ed defining affirm as t o confirm a judgment on appeal emphasis added.we are satisfied that such subsection does not categorically undermine the general rule that plan confirmations are final decisions.
as such,the district court did not err in reviewing the bankruptcy court findings of fact for clear error.we apply the same standard in our review.in re dominguez,at.
one of the key features of the plan is its settling insurer injunction.the bankruptcy court found that settlement with insurers is the only means by which the objectives of section g can be advanced in the present case.further,the bankruptcy court found that in order to persuade insurers to settle,they need to be able to obtain finality from the settlement.without this feature,settling insurers would always be exposed to indirect asbestos liability through contribution suits.there would never be finality,the trust would be underfunded,and asbestos claimants would continue to suffer from the vagaries of the tort system.
to be sure,cutting off the contribution rights of nonsettling insurers is not without cost.the bankruptcy court explicitly found that the non settling insurers equitable contribution rights are valuable and generally enforced.although all parties agree that the non settling insurers are fully compensated for cases that go to judgment by the judgment reduction credit and trust payment credit,the non settling insurers strongly argue that they are losing substantial value in cases that are settled or dismissed without payment 
the non settling insurers proposed a solution a trust backstop,which would pay non settling insurers a dividend on equitable contribution claims directly out of the trust the bankruptcy court concluded that such a backstop would overcompensate non settling insurers and was unnecessary for the plan to meet the requirements of the code.the bankruptcy court expressed concern for the possibility that such a backstop would deplete the amount of the trust available for asbestos claimants and indicated that a ny provision which takes money away from the trust should be imposed only where required by the statute or the constitution.
fundamentally,this is the conclusion with which the non settling insurers take issue.first,they argue that the statute does not permit the injunctions provided for in this case.but even if it does,the non settling insurers assert that general principles of equity,bankruptcy,and federal common law limit the bankruptcy court power to issue injunctions that sweep away the rights of third parties against.
there is little question that few legislative sponsors in congress would have contemplated the enjoining of equitable contribution claims when they drafted g.the section was originally drawn to create a procedure modeled on the in the johns manville case and to strengthen the manville mechanism,at.the channeling injunction in johns manville only enjoined asbestos health claims there was no need to enjoin anything else.johns manville,at.
the non settling argue that a g injunction permissible scope is not much broader than the johns manville case and does not permit any injunction protecting insurers from contribution claims.as with every statute,we start with the text.if the statutory language is unambiguous and the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent,judicial inquiry must cease.in re ferrell,cir quoting robinson shell oil,d.section g b states 
an injunction may be issued under subparagraph a to enjoin entities from taking legal action for the purpose of directly or indirectly collecting,recovering,or receiving payment or recovery with respect to any claim or demand that,under a plan of reorganization,is to be paid in whole or in part by a trust emphasis added.
according to non settling insurers,contribution claims against settling insurers are not to be paid in whole or in part by the trust because they are not claims against the debtor.rather,they are claims against other insurance companies.
although such language is far from clear,we think that the non settling insurers are misreading the statute text.the phrase with respect to is generally understood to be synonymous with the phrases relating to,in connection with,and associated with.see huffington group,llc,cir citing several dictionaries.thus,it is eminently reasonable to paraphrase the statute as follows an injunction may be issued to enjoin entities from taking legal action for the purpose of collecting any payment related to a claim or demand that is to be paid in whole or in part by the trust.furthermore,equitable contribution claims are,themselves,components of asbestos claims which are the kind of claim that the trust does pay.that they are formally brought against different parties does not change the kind of claim that they are.at minimum,we are satisfied that such claims are legal action for the purpose of recovering with respect to asbestos claims.
such interpretation is bolstered by the fact that it is more consistent with the statutory scheme,which explicitly contemplates enjoining claims against the debtor insurers 
a i subject to subparagraph b,an injunction described in paragraph shall be valid and enforceable against all entities that it addresses.
ii notwithstanding the provisions of section e,such an injunction may bar any action directed against a third party who is identifiable from the terms of such injunction by name or as part of an identifiable group and is alleged to be directly or indirectly liable for the conduct of,claims against,or demands on the debtor to the extent such alleged liability of such third party arises by reason of 
iii the third party provision of insurance to the debtor or a related party 
g a emphasis added.the injunction may bar any action against a third party that is alleged to be directly or indirectly liable for the conduct of the debtor,including if their liability arises by reason of their provision of insurance.the settling insurers equitable contribution liability is indirect liability arising by reason of their provision of insurance to the debtor,so it easily falls within this section.
therefore,we agree with the lower courts conclusion that the statute permits this injunction.
although we have concluded the statute permits an injunction protecting the settling insurers,it remains unclear whether it places attendant limits on the bankruptcy court power to enter such an injunction.the parties generally agree that the non settling insurers lose some valuable rights without full compensation.they strongly disagree on whether any compensation is required.the plan proponents argue that g contains no language indicating that enjoined parties need be compensated this statutory silence they interpret as a generally unconstrained authority for the bankruptcy court to issue these injunctions.
the bankruptcy court agreed with the plan proponents concerning the absence of statutory limits on its power,but held itself bound by the principles and rules of equity jurisprudence.young united states,d quoting pepper litton.the court weighed the non settling insurers against the goals of g.after determining that the non settling insurers would lose only a relatively small portion of the value of their contribution rights,and that the proposed alternative would undermine the purposes of the statute,the bankruptcy court deemed the principles of equity satisfied.in turn,the non settling insurers argue that these principles of equity demand full compensation for their loss of rights.
the non settling insurers point primarily to cases outside the g context to support their view that equity requires full compensation for their forfeited rights.most significantly,the non settling insurers highlight the dow corning factors.see in re dow corning,cir.dow corning involved a bankruptcy driven primarily by litigation.id.at.invoking the bankruptcy court general equitable powers,see a,the dow corning plan enjoined future actions against the company insurers or shareholders arising out of tort claims.at.noting that enjoining a creditor claim against a is a dramatic measure to be used cautiously,the court surveyed the cases approving such injunctions and concluded that seven factors must be present.the factors are 
there is an identity of interests between the debtor and the third party,usually an indemnity relationship,such that a suit against the is,in essence,a suit against the debtor or will deplete the assets of the estate the has contributed substantial assets to the reorganization the injunction is essential to reorganization,namely,the reorganization hinges on the debtor being free from indirect suits against parties who would have indemnity or contribution claims against the debtor the impacted class,or classes,has overwhelmingly voted to accept the plan the plan provides a mechanism to pay for all,or substantially all,of the class or classes affected by the injunction the plan provides an opportunity for those claimants who choose not to settle to recover in full and the bankruptcy court made a record of specific factual findings that support its conclusions.
at.the non settling insurers in particular emphasize factors five and six,which require full compensation.
a common theme in the cases on which both the nonsettling insurers and dow corning itself relied is that they do not involve asbestos or injunctions under g.the standards developed in dow corning and applied by other courts are rules constraining the bankruptcy court powers exercised under its general equitable authority,see a.in contrast,the plain language of g explicitly permits injunctions of the non settling insurers claims and nowhere provides for any compensation for their lost rights.
that there is no statutory protection for the non settling insurers contribution claims is emphasized by g b ii.this clause states that the g injunction,to be enforceable,must be fair and equitable with respect to future claimants,in light of the benefits provided,or to be provided,to such trust on behalf of a party protected by the injunction.in enacting this subsection,congress articulated a clearer standard for weighing the equities in the context of an bankruptcy.the statute specifies two classes of persons whose interests the courts must attentively evaluate before issuing an injunction.in the first place,there are the most obvious stakeholders whom the plan must regard solicitously the future asbestos plaintiffs,those who may subsequently assert such demands,those demands that are described in the plan and are to be paid in whole or in part from the trust.id.g b.but the statute instructs the court to focus on another set of actors a set that includes the debtor and such third part ies as its insurers and to account for the benefits they have provided to the trust in exchange for enjoining future claims against them.id.in other words,before it may issue an injunction under g,a court must ensure that the remedy be fair and equitable to future asbestos plaintiffs the parties to be enjoined when viewed in comparison to the benefits provided by the bankrupt and its insurers the parties to be benefitted by the injunction.
section g,unlike the general provision of a,gives the bankruptcy courts more detailed guidance in the exercise of their equitable powers.in crafting these more specific instructions,congress has not commanded that the interests of other third parties,such as the non settling insurers in this case,enter into the calculus.
in any event,however,the bankruptcy court did carefully weigh the benefits of the channeling injunctions against the loss of the non settling insurers rights.the district court even noted that the plan generally conformed to the rigorous standard for enjoining creditors claims enunciated in dow corning.appellants claim that this standard requires a mechanism to pay for all,or substantially all the rights of third parties that the injunction extinguishes.but the plan confirmed by the bankruptcy court provides not unsubstantial protection for the non settling insurers,in the form of the trust payment credit and judgment reduction credit,as outlined above.despite these safeguards,the plan may not fully compensate the non settling insurers for the cost of defending tort claims that it settles prior to judgment and,since most such claims do not proceed to trial,these expenses are by no means trivial.the bankruptcy court nevertheless determined that,in light of the purposes of g,enjoining the non settling insurers contribution claims was fair and equitable to future asbestos plaintiffs and,in providing the finality and protection from future suit,supplied the necessary incentive for insurers to settle in the first place.this inquiry sufficiently satisfies the statutory scheme.
thus,we conclude that,in order for the plan to be confirmable,the injunction needs to be fair and equitable with respect to future asbestos plaintiffs in light of the benefits provided to the trust by the settling insurers.the bankruptcy and district courts properly observed this standard and,moreover,conscientiously accounted for the rights of the non settling insurers whose interests the statute did not explicitly direct them to take cognizance.
section g imposes a number of substantive requirements on the trust that is to be implemented along with the plan 
i the g injunction is to be implemented in connection with a trust that,pursuant to the plan of reorganization 
i is to assume the liabilities of a debtor which at the time of entry of the order for relief has been named as a defendant in personal injury,wrongful death,or actions seeking recovery for damages allegedly caused by the presence of,or exposure to,asbestos or products 
ii is to be funded in whole or in part by the securities of or more debtors involved in such plan and by the obligation of such debtor or debtors to make future payments,including dividends 
iii is to own,or by the exercise of rights granted under such plan would be entitled to own if specified contingencies occur,a majority of the voting shares of 
aa each such debtor 
bb the parent corporation of each such debtor or 
cc a subsidiary of each such debtor that is also a debtor and 
iv is to use its assets or income to pay claims and demands 
g b i.the non settling insurers argue that the court erred in finding that the trust met these conditions with regard to the requirement that the trust be funded with the securities of the reorganized debtor,see g b i ii,and the requirement that the trust be entitled to own a majority of the voting shares of the reorganized debtor.see g b i iii.
as part of the plan in this case,the trust will acquire approximately worth of equity of bayside in the reorganized debtor in exchange for.in addition,the trust will also obtain a note from the reorganized debtor and a warrant to purchase an additional of the company at the same price as the original sale.the bankruptcy court concluded that such arrangement satisfied g requirement that the trust be funded in whole or in part by the securities of the reorganized debtor.
the non settling insurers disagree.they argue that the statute statement that the debtor fund the trust necessarily entails a positive contribution.by removing in cash from the trust in exchange for in equity,they assert that the trust is actually by bayside.
the bankruptcy and district courts reading of the word fund indeed may seem counterintuitive.standard dictionary definitions apparently confirm this observation the first two entries in merriam webster explain that fund denotes a provision of resources or the provi sion of funds or the place ment in a fund.merriam webster collegiate dictionary ed.arguably no such funding in a meaningful way can occur when,on net,value flows out of the trust.
but situating the term in its proper legal context dispels much of the conceptual haze that surrounds our everyday and often equivocal usage.the statute imposes the requirement that the trust be funded in whole or in part by securities of the debtor,g b i ii in other words,these securities will comprise the trust fund to be held and managed by a fiduciary for the benefit of the asbestos claimants.according to its technical sense,trust fund is simply the property held in a trust by a trustee or the corpus,black law dictionary ed,which is further defined as the property for which a trustee is responsible,id.section g refers to fund in the context of a trust,permitting the reasonable inference that the term assumes this specific meaning peculiar to,but also familiar and well defined in,the law of trusts.reading the statute in light of this background suggests that the trust in this case,whose corpus comprises securities of the reorganized debtor,satisfies the requirement.regardless of how much value flows in and out of the trust according to the plan,the fiduciary will end up retaining in the trust fund or corpus the statutorily mandated securities.
this reading of the funding requirement,furthermore,accords with the larger context and purpose of the statute.courts have recognized that g embodies the requirement that the reorganized debtor becomes a going concern,such that it is able to make future payments into the trust to provide an evergreen funding source for future asbestos claimants.in re combustion eng g,at citing cong.rec,statement of senator heflin w hen an company goes into bankruptcy and is faced with present and future claims,the bankruptcy court can set up a trust to pay the victims.the underlying company funds the trust with securities and the company remains viable.thus,the company continues to generate assets to pay claims today and into the future.in essence,the reorganized company becomes the goose that lays the golden egg by remaining a viable operation and maximizing the trust assets to pay claims.
to meet this requirement,all that this particular subsection must accomplish is to ensure that the trust receives a stake,of some value,in the reorganized debtor.the trust must get a piece of the goose that lays the golden eggs,bayside.here,this requirement is met.
in contrast,the requirement suggested by the non settling insurers that the bankruptcy court conduct an inquiry centered around whether the trust obtained a fair deal in the transaction to acquire those securities is plainly embodied elsewhere in the statute,such as the requirements of good faith a or the requirement that the court ensure the injunction is fair and equitable g b ii.furthermore,as the bankruptcy court recognized,the trust is getting a valuable asset from the debtor that dwarfs anything bayside could provide over one hundred million dollars in insurance settlement proceeds.the insurance proceeds are what is really funding the trust,in the sense of that word that the non settling insurers advance.
finally,requiring that the trust obtain a fair deal on the acquisition of these securities would strain the competence of the bankruptcy court as the district court noted below i n many cases shares in a company,and particularly one that has recently emerged from bankruptcy,are of relatively uncertain value.this inherent uncertainty makes it less likely that this section requires the bankruptcy court to weigh the value of the shares that the trust receives from the debtor.
therefore,we are satisfied that the trust purchase of securities in the reorganized debtor meets the requirements of g b i ii.
section g b i iii states that,in order to be confirmable,a trust must own,or by the exercise of rights granted under such plan would be entitled to own if specified contingencies occur,a majority of the voting shares of the reorganized debtor.the bankruptcy court found that this requirement was met because the trust can gain ownership of bayside in two different ways the trust can use its outstanding warrant to purchase an additional of the shares of bayside at the same price it was originally forced to purchase the shares at or if bayside defaults on the note,it is secured by enough outstanding stock in bayside to bring the trust ownership to.the non settling insurers contend that these conditions are illusory,that they offer only technical compliance with the literal terms of the statute,and are rendered irrelevant by bayside standing warrant to repurchase shares from the trust at the original price plus simple interest.
the question at issue is the meaning of
