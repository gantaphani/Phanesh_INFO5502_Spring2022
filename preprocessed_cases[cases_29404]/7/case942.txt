amedisys,and its related entities appeal an order enforcing the automatic stay in bankruptcy,a,against a civil action in which amedisys is the plaintiff.national century financial enterprises,ncfe,the debtor,before its bankruptcy,supplied financing to the health care industry.ncfe bought accounts receivable from hospitals and other health care providers.the arrangement shortened the providers waiting period for payment by insurance companies,medicare,and medicaid.amedisys is a louisiana corporation supplying home nursing services.amedisys participated in a financing plan sponsored by one of ncfe subsidiaries.ncfe and its subsidiaries,including national premier financial services npfs,npf vi,and npf xii collectively,the ncfe entities,filed for chapter bankruptcy in november.in february,amedisys sued jp morgan chase manhattan bank jp morgan in louisiana,seeking to recover about million in accounts receivable held in a jp morgan collection account in the name of npf vi.upon ncfe motion,the bankruptcy court applied the automatic stay in bankruptcy,a,to the louisiana action.amedisys appealed this decision the district court affirmed.because the louisiana action is an act to obtain possession of property of the bankruptcy estate,a,we affirm the bankruptcy court and district court conclusions that the automatic stay applies.
the appeal hinges on the questions of whether amedisys,through the louisiana action,seeks to obtain possession of accounts receivable funds that npf vi,an ncfe entity,held in a jp morgan account and whether in fact these accounts receivable constitute property of the bankruptcy estate.ncfe is an ohio corporation which,until its bankruptcy,was,along with its subsidiaries,the country largest provider of healthcare accounts receivable financing.ja.the district court fully described the contractual relationship between amedisys and the ncfe entities 
amedisys,and its corporate subsidiaries provide home nursing services throughout the southeastern united states.amedisys participated in a funding program operated by ncfe,a company that finances health care providers by purchasing their accounts receivable at a discount.ncfe purchased the receivables with funds raised through selling notes that were backed by the receivables themselves.
ncfe created numerous subsidiaries,known as programs,for the purpose of issuing notes that were secured by pools of receivables and other collateral.the two largest such programs were npf vi,administered by jp morgan chase bank as indenture trustee,and npf xii,administered by bank one,as indenture trustee.under the sale and subservice agreements into which ncfe programs and health care providers entered,receivables would be remitted directly into lockbox accounts and the ncfe program would advance funds to the provider on a weekly basis in payment of the receivables.
amedysis participated in the npf vi program,and its accounts receivable went into lockbox accounts at huntington national bank.the lockbox accounts were in the name of npfs an ncfe amedisys or one of its subsidiaries.those funds were then swept into a collection account at jp morgan in the name of npf vi.though accounts receivable went into the collection account,npf vi did not purchase every account receivable it collected.section of the sale and subservice agreement provided 
the purchaser and the seller acknowledge that certain amounts deposited in the collection account may relate to receivables other than purchased receivables and that such amounts continue to be owned by the seller.all such amounts shall be returned to the seller in accordance with section.
the amounts in the collection account representing receivables that npf vi did not purchase were called overage funds.the trustee jp morgan was supposed to transfer such funds to amedisys on npfs instruction.amedisys states that it normally would receive electronic notice of the amount of any overage funds on tuesdays.
in late october,amedisys became concerned after hearing reports that ncfe was experiencing financial difficulties.on the final thursday of the month,amedisys did not receive the overage funds it expected npf vi would transfer to it.on november,the chief financial officer of amedisys performed an accounting and determined that npf vi owed amedisys approximately million.
dist.op.at,ja.jp morgan duties as trustee of the collection accounts were outlined in section of the sale and subservice agreement the sale agreement,which provided,on each purchase date for amedisys,npf vi shall deliver to jp morgan a written statement setting forth the amount to be paid to amedisys from the purchased account in respect of the purchased receivables and jp morgan shall make such payment in accordance with npf vi instructions.supp.ja.jp morgan was labeled a trustee in this arrangement only because of its fiduciary duty toward holders of the notes.the bankruptcy court,in a different decision from the one appealed here,has determined that jp morgan bore no fiduciary duty toward amedisys.
on november,amedisys sued jp morgan,npf vi,npfs,ncfe,and lance poulsen,the president of nfp vi,in the united states district court for the southern district of ohio the ohio action.in the complaint,amedisys demanded the return of the million in accounts receivable held in the jp morgan collection account.
on november,ncfe and its subsidiaries filed for chapter bankruptcy.on december,the district court transferred the ohio action to the bankruptcy court,as an adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy case.on january,amedisys filed a second amended complaint in the bankruptcy court naming jp morgan,npf vi,ncfe,and npfs as defendants,asserting the following claims 
actual controversies exist between amedisys and jp morgan,and between amedisys and ncfe,concerning amedisys right to have a total of more than million in accounts receivable returned to it.amedisys seeks a declaratory judgment holding that the sale agreement and trust indenture represent one contractual relationship among amedisys,jp morgan,and ncfe.
ii.amedisys seeks a declaratory judgment stating that jp morgan,as an escrow agent,owed fiduciary obligations to amedisys and violated those obligations.
iii.the million in accounts receivable is subject to an express trust established by the sale agreement.
iv.amedisys cash in the possession or control of the ncfe entities,approximately million,is an unjust enrichment occurring by mistake or fraud.the funds should be impressed with a constructive trust requiring that the funds be returned to amedisys.
v.the million in accounts receivable is subject to a resulting trust.
vi.amedisys is entitled to an immediate turnover of its property under.
vii.ncfe breached the sales agreement by failing to return timely and properly receivables.ncfe also breached the agreement by failing to maintain a detailed accounting record.
viii.amedisys is entitled to specific performance of the agreement mandating ncfe to remit to amedisys.
ix.ncfe owed to amedisys a fiduciary duty pursuant to the sale agreement to ensure that amedisys interests in the accounts were properly protected.ncfe breached this duty.
ncfe repeatedly made intentional misrepresentations to amedisys,stating that it would ensure that amedisys funds would be timely released to it.amedisys justifiably relied on these misrepresentations and has been directly injured as a result of the reliance.
on may,the bankruptcy court granted ncfe and jp morgan motions for summary judgment as to all counts in the adversary proceeding except for count vii alleging that ncfe breached the sale agreement.the bankruptcy court determined that although ncfe did not pay for the disputed million in accounts receivable,it did actually purchase amedisys accounts receivable.therefore,amedisys would have only a general contractual claim against ncfe for nonpayment amedisys assertions that it owned the accounts receivable at the time of ncfe bankruptcy,and therefore that the million in the jp morgan collection account was not part of the bankruptcy estate,were unfounded by joint agreement of the parties,count vii was dismissed on april.at this point,the bankruptcy court grant of partial summary judgment became a final,appealable order.amedisys filed a notice of appeal on april,and the appeal is now before the united states district court for the southern district of ohio.
on february,amedisys brought a state court action in louisiana against jp morgan,certain jp morgan employees,and ncfe insurer the louisiana action.ja.on march,the defendants removed the action to the united states district court for the middle district of louisiana amedisys asserted the following claims in the louisiana action 
i.the sale agreement between npf vi and amedisys created an implied contract relating to the course of dealing among jp morgan,npf vi,and amedisys.amedisys seeks specific performance,including refund of the nonpurchased receivables and overage funds.
ii.amedisys was a beneficiary of the trust indenture between npf vi and jp morgan.jp morgan had a duty to return to amedisys receivables and overage funds that were never purchased by npf vi in the first place.
iii.jp morgan breached its fiduciary duty to amedisys to ensure that amedisys rights in the accounts at jp morgan were adequately protected.
iv.jp morgan intentionally misrepresented the truth to amedisys when it claimed that it had taken all actions necessary to release the million in accounts receivable.
amedisys detrimentally relied on jp morgan agreement to comply with npf vi instructions to wire amedisys funds to it.amedisys is therefore entitled to all damages attributable to jp morgan for amedisys detrimental reliance.
vi.jp morgan wrongfully converted the funds owned by amedisys when it refused to remit the funds following amedisys request.amedisys is entitled to any and all damages resulting in sic the conversion of its funds.
vii.t he funds owned by the amedisys entities,over which jp morgan has dominion and control,are impressed with a constructive trust in favor of amedisys.
viii.jp morgan conduct violated the louisiana fair trade practices act.
ix.jp morgan was unjustly enriched by its wrongful retention of the million in accounts receivable belonging to amedisys.
complaint at,supp.ja.
on june,ncfe moved the bankruptcy court for an order enforcing the bankruptcy act automatic stay,a,against the louisiana action.ja the motion alleged,the actions taken by the amedisys entities in connection with the commencement of the louisiana action plainly suggest a coordinated strategy to forum shop and to avoid the application of the automatic stay.ja.ncfe noted that amedisys claims in the louisiana action were virtually identical to those in the ohio action,save for the omission of ncfe and its subsidiaries as defendants in the louisiana action.id.the bankruptcy court,in an opinion dated august,ordered that amedisys immediately cease and desist from any further prosecution of the louisiana action.the court gave two reasons.first,all of the claims in amedisys complaint require a determination of ownership of funds alleged to be ncfe funds.ja.therefore,a finding for amedisys would result in the automatic creation of liability against the debtor because of a judgment against jp morgan.id.second,the court found,the involvement in the louisiana action effectively will act to diminish this bankruptcy estate by causing a duplication of efforts and a waste of judicial time and resources.ja.
amedisys appealed the bankruptcy court determination to the united states district court for the southern district of ohio.the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court.the district court,noting that it is the bankruptcy court province to determine whether the million in accounts receivable is part of the estate,concluded that the louisiana action amounted to no more than an attempt to prove that amedisys owned the accounts at the time of ncfe bankruptcy petition.assuming that sixth circuit precedent requires unusual circumstances in order to extend the scope of the automatic stay to an action against a,the court found that requirement met here,because ncfe constituted the real party in interest in the louisiana action.ja.amedisys timely appealed the district court decision.
we affirm the decision of the district court.the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction to enforce the automatic stay against the louisiana action because,as amedisys concedes in its brief,the motion to enforce constitutes a core proceeding as defined in b.further,the bankruptcy court correctly concluded that the automatic stay in bankruptcy,a,applies to the louisiana action.
amedisys first argues that,in globally staying the louisiana action,the bankruptcy court exceeded its jurisdiction.the bankruptcy court held that it had jurisdiction to enforce the stay because the matter was a core proceeding.ja.amedisys argues that in order for jurisdiction to be proper,the bankruptcy court was required to find that the louisiana action was related to the bankruptcy case.see b.further,amedisys urges,in the event of a judgment against jp morgan in the louisiana action,jp morgan likely would not obtain indemnity from ncfe or its subsidiaries therefore the louisiana action is not related to the bankruptcy case.
the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction to enforce the stay,because ncfe motion to enforce constituted a core proceeding.b provides exclusive district court jurisdiction over all cases under title,and concurrent jurisdiction over civil proceedings arising under title,or arising in or related to cases under title.in turn,a permits district courts to refer bankruptcy cases brought under their original jurisdiction to bankruptcy courts.section b of the same chapter defines core proceedings arising under title,or arising in a case under title to include matters concerning the administration of the estate,motions to terminate,annul,or modify the automatic stay,and other proceedings affecting the liquidation of assets of the estate or the adjustment of the or the equity security holder relationship b a,g,o.
amedisys concedes in its jurisdictional statement,this matter is a core proceeding pursuant to b g.appellant br.at.therefore,ncfe motion to enforce the automatic stay by definition met a narrower jurisdictional test than the related to basis for jurisdiction over proceedings.see in re combustion eng g,cir cases under title,proceedings arising under title,and proceedings arising in a case under title are referred to as core proceedings whereas proceedings related to a case under title are referred to as proceedings.ncfe motion to enforce arose under title,and the bankruptcy court therefore had jurisdiction to enforce the stay.
amedisys argues that the louisiana action does not fall within the automatic stay provisions of a.in order to enjoin the louisiana action against jp morgan,amedisys argues,the bankruptcy court necessarily relied upon its equitable powers under a to issue orders necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of chapter.amedisys also argues that the bankruptcy court failed to identify unusual circumstances justifying a preliminary injunction under a,and that ncfe improperly failed to initiate an adversary proceeding to obtain an injunction under a.these arguments lack merit,because the stay fell within a.the bankruptcy court observed the correct procedures in enforcing the stay.
the courts below properly held that the louisiana action is covered by the automatic stay in bankruptcy.under a,a bankruptcy petition 
operates as a stay,applicable to all entities,of the commencement or continuation of a judicial,administrative,or other action or proceeding against the debtor that was or could have been commenced before the commencement of the case under this title,or to recover a claim against the debtor that arose before the commencement of the case under this title any act to obtain possession of property of the estate or of property from the estate or to exercise control over property of the estate.
property of the estate includes all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in the property as of the commencement of the case.a.the bankruptcy court also has the authority to issue any order,process,or judgment that is necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of the bankruptcy code.id.a.
because the louisiana action seeks to obtain the accounts receivable held in a jp morgan account in the name of npf vi,and because the accounts receivable likely constitute property of the bankruptcy estate,the bankruptcy court properly enforced the automatic stay under a.the district court held that the louisiana complaint,though naming jp morgan as a defendant,seeks a determination that the money in the debtors bank accounts belongs to amedisys.ja.the bankruptcy court similarly concluded that amedisys,through the louisiana action,sought to obtain ownership rights of the disputed accounts receivable.amedisys,on appeal,contends that these holdings were misguided,because the louisiana action concerns only jp morgan failure to follow npfs instructions to remit million to amedisys.amedisys argues that it merely seeks money damages from jp morgan,because jp morgan breached a duty to transfer the property to amedisys.
this argument is unpersuasive.while ncfe is a named defendant only in the adversary proceeding,and not in the louisiana action,this is irrelevant,because amedisys in both actions seeks to obtain possession of the disputed accounts receivable.count i of the louisiana action asserts that the sales agreement created duties in jp morgan and seeks specific performance of that agreement,including refund of the nonpurchased receivables.supp.ja.similarly,count ii avers that amedisys is a beneficiary of the jp trust indenture,and that therefore jp morgan has a duty to return the receivables to amedisys.count vii requests the court to impress the funds in the collection account with a constructive trust in favor of amedisys.supp.ja.the district court correctly found that while only some counts in the complaint pray the court to order jp morgan to remit the disputed accounts receivable to amedisys,every count in the complaint requires the court to adjudicate whether amedisys had a rightful claim to that property.further,the district court properly concluded that amedisys offer voluntarily to stay prosecution of counts i and vii of the louisiana action,would not cure the violation of a.as the district court aptly noted,unless amedisys voluntarily dismissed the allegations in its complaint seeking refund of the accounts receivable,any judgment in amedisys favor in the louisiana action would potentially deplete the property of the bankruptcy estate.ja.
the district court properly concluded that in the louisiana action,amedisys used a constructive trust theory to assert dominion over money in the debtors accounts.ja.if amedisys succeeded on a constructive trust theory,the value of the bankruptcy estate would be reduced.this is because property in which the debtor holds legal but not equitable title as of the commencement of the example,property impressed with a constructive trust under state property of the estate only to the extent of the debtor legal title.d see poss morris in re morris,cir holding that a creditor mere claim of a constructive trust does not constitute an equitable interest in property otherwise belonging to the estate instead,state law must have impressed property with a constructive trust prior to its entry into bankruptcy stevenson bradford in re cannon,cir quoting begier irs,d holding that the a definition of property of the estate excludes property held in trust amedisys contends that its constructive trust claim concerns only its prebankruptcy ownership of the disputed accounts receivable,and that this issue is entirely independent of whether the funds currently form part of the bankruptcy estate.this argument is meritless,because the issues are not independent.whatever determination is made in the louisiana action concerning the prebankruptcy ownership of the accounts receivable will necessarily be relevant to postbankruptcy ownership as well.in the louisiana action,amedisys alleges that during the period of november,jp morgan wrongfully failed to comply with ncfe instructions to refund to amedisys the disputed amount.supp.ja.the fact that the complaint asserts wrongs occurring before the ncfe entities filed for bankruptcy on november,does not alter our conclusion that the complaint demands the return of funds alleged to form part of the bankruptcy estate.see a property of the estate is determined as of the moment the debtor files for bankruptcy.
further,it appears likely that the disputed accounts receivable to which amedisys claims ownership do form part of the bankruptcy estate.amedisys does not dispute that in november,when the ncfe entities filed for bankruptcy,the disputed accounts receivable were located in a jp morgan collection account held by npf vi,an ncfe entity.thus,presumptively,npf vi holds legal title to these funds.no party has made a plausible claim that jp morgan,rather than the ncfe entities,owns the funds.see complaint in louisiana action at,supp.ja jp morgan has no claim,title,or other interest in any nonpurchased receivables or overage funds of the amedisys entities now held by it.jp morgan application for order authorizing compensation at,ja t he amedisys receivables were owned by npf vi,which had purchased those receivables from amedisys.
finally,the bankruptcy court,in a final order currently on appeal to the united states district court for the southern district of ohio,has held that the accounts receivable held in the jp morgan collection account form property of the bankruptcy estate.in granting summary judgment to defendants ncfe and jp morgan on amedisys claims in the adversary proceeding,the bankruptcy court held that the ncfe entities purchased the million in accounts receivable from amedisys.the bankruptcy court found that although ncfe had never paid amedisys for the disputed accounts receivable,this was merely because amedisys had waived its right under the sale agreement to immediate payment.the bankruptcy court rejected with equal force the argument that either ncfe or jp morgan held the receivables in an express or constructive trust for amedisys.the bankruptcy court noted that ncfe bore merely a contractual duty to pay amedisys for purchased receivables ncfe did not hold a fiduciary duty to transfer title in the receivables to amedisys.further,the court held,jp morgan was not even in contractual privity with amedisys much less did it bear any fiduciary duty to amedisys.
we do not purport at this time to resolve in a controlling fashion the issues raised in that appeal.but the bankruptcy court determination that the accounts receivable are part of the bankruptcy estate strongly supports the conclusion that the automatic stay was properly enforced.it is the bankruptcy court province to identify the property of the bankruptcy estate.the bankruptcy court,in its summary judgment decision,persuasively marshaled the complex factual record in this case to conclude that the accounts receivable whose ownership forms the crux of the louisiana action,are property of the estate.reversing the lower courts conclusions that the automatic stay applies,at a time when the bankruptcy court determination of the ownership of the accounts receivable remains a live issue in the summary judgment appeal,would impede the bankruptcy court role in managing the bankruptcy case.
the fact that the louisiana action did not name ncfe as a defendant does not render enforcement of the automatic stay improper.amedisys argues that the automatic stay under section a applies only to the bankrupt debtor,and therefore that a did not support the bankruptcy court decision in this case.appellant br.at.to buttress this assertion,amedisys cites two decisions of this court for the proposition that a bankruptcy court must find unusual circumstances,justifying a preliminary injunction under a,in order to extend the scope of a a automatic stay to encompass claims against not only a debtor defendant,but also nondebtor codefendants.see patton bearden,cir parry mohawk motors of,cir.these cases note that,by extending the stay beyond its statutory terms,the bankruptcy court is not acting under a,but is instead issuing an order in equity necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of the bankruptcy code.a patton,at.the district court,
