this case presents an arcane but important question of first impression in this circuit does the absolute priority rule continue to apply in individual chapter reorganizations after the amendments to the bankruptcy code enacted as part of the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of bapcpa we hold that it does.
factual and procedural background 
in september,david zachary and annmarie snorsky debtors filed a joint voluntary individual chapter petition.the debtors operative plan of reorganization placed their largest unsecured creditor,california bank trust california bank,into its own class of unsecured creditors and proposed to pay it on its claim of nearly.california bank claim was thus impaired under the plan.a b.
california bank objected,arguing that the plan violated the absolute priority rule of b b ii.the bankruptcy judge,disagreeing with the ninth circuit bankruptcy appellate panel bap opinion in in re friedman,cir,sustained the objection,holding that the absolute priority rule still prevails in individual chapter bankruptcies after the enactment of bapcpa 
debtors filed a timely notice of appeal of the bankruptcy court order sustaining california bank objection to their plan.the bankruptcy court certified the appeal,and this court authorized a direct appeal.a,d a.

individual chapter bankruptcies and the absolute priority rule.
individual debtors have two basic options under the code.ice house,llc cardin,cir.they can either liquidate their assets under chapter,or file for reorganization under chapters or.see.a chapter reorganization,however,is only available to individual debtors whose debts fall below certain limits.see e.individual debtors with more debt can only file for reorganization under chapter,which is used primarily by debtors with ongoing businesses.toibb radloff,emphasis omitted.
an individual filing under chapter may confirm a plan of reorganization in one of two ways.the first is by satisfying the bankruptcy court that a plan complies with each of the sixteen paragraphs in a.under this path,o f particular note is the requirement of obtaining the consent of each class of creditor as required by paragraph of a.in re friedman,at.absent unanimous approval of the plan by each class of creditors,a debtor must pursue the second path to confirmation.
under the second path,a debtor can obtain confirmation by satisfying the bankruptcy court that,notwithstanding any creditor objections,the plan is fair and equitable to each creditor class.b.because this nonconsensual method of confirmation is obtained over creditor objection,it is known as a cramdown.in re friedman,at.a debtor may cram down a plan only if it complies with the absolute priority rule in b b ii.put another way,a bankruptcy judge may find that a debtor plan is fair and equitable to an objecting creditor only if the plan complies with the absolute priority rule.
the absolute priority rule is a judicially created concept,with its genesis in early railroad cases.in re friedman,at.it arose from the bankruptcy code statutory requirement,now codified in b,that a reorganization plan be fair and equitable to each class of creditors.the rule provides that a dissenting class of unsecured creditors must be provided for in full before any junior class can receive or retain any property under a reorganization plan.norwest bank worthington ahlers,alteration omitted quoting in re ahlers,cir.the supreme court adopted the absolute priority rule to prevent deals between senior creditors and equity holders that would impose unfair terms on unsecured creditors.in re friedman,at see also pac.ry.boyd.the rule later gained express statutory force,and was incorporated into chapter of the bankruptcy code adopted in as b b ii.norwest,at.
before the adoption of bapcpa in,it was clear that no chapter reorganization plan can be confirmed over the creditors legitimate objections absent certain conditions not relevant here if it fails to comply with the absolute priority rule.id.at that time,the absolute priority rule provided 
t he condition that a plan be fair and equitable with respect to a class of creditors includes the following requirements 
b with respect to a class of unsecured claims 
i the plan provides that each holder of a claim of such class receive or retain on account of such claim property of a value,as of the effective date of the plan,equal to the allowed amount of such claim or 
ii the holder of any claim or interest that is junior to the claims of such class will not receive or retain under the plan on account of such junior claim or interest any property.
b b ii emphasis added.thus,under the bankruptcy code,it was clear that every unsecured creditor must be paid in full before the debtor can retain any property under a plan.ice house,at quoting b b ii.
amendment of the absolute priority rule by bapcpa.
three provisions of the bankruptcy code intertwine to implement the absolute priority rule.first,which was not altered by bapcpa,defines an estate in bankruptcy as comprised of all the property enumerated in that section,wherever located and by whomever held,including all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.a,a emphasis added.under this section,the property of the estate,and,therefore,the property subject to the absolute priority rule in chapter cases,is the property the debtor owned as of the commencement of the case.ice house,at quoting a.
the second relevant provision is,which was added in by bapcpa,stat.section,which only applies to individual chapter proceedings,adds to the property of the estate certain property obtained by the debtor after the commencement of the case 
in a case in which the debtor is an individual,property of the estate includes,in addition to the property specified in section 
all property of the kind specified in section that the debtor acquires after the commencement of the case but before the case is closed,dismissed,or converted to a case under chapter,or,whichever occurs first and 
earnings from services performed by the debtor after the commencement of the case but before the case is closed,dismissed,or converted to a case under chapter,or,whichever occurs first.
a emphasis added.
finally,bapcpa amended the absolutely priority rule itself,adding the underscored language to b b ii 
t he condition that a plan be fair and equitable with respect to a class of creditors includes the following requirements 
b with respect to a class of unsecured claims 
i the plan provides that each holder of a claim of such class receive or retain on account of such claim property of a value,as of the effective date of the plan,equal to the allowed amount of such claim or 
ii the holder of any claim or interest that is junior to the claims of such class will not receive or retain under the plan on account of such junior claim or interest any property,except that in a case in which the debtor is an individual,the debtor may retain property included in the estate under section,subject to the requirements of subsection a of this section.
stat,emphasis added.
the new clauses in subsection b ii plainly create an exception to the absolute priority rule that applies only to a chapter case in which the debtor is an individual.b b ii.but the question is,what is the exception scope or,put another way,what property may an individual chapter debtor retain without running afoul of the absolute priority rule in re friedman,at jury,dissenting.
post bapcpa case law.
a significant split of authorities has developed nationally among the bankruptcy courts regarding the answer to this question.in re maharaj,cir describing division.two conflicting positions have emerged the broad view and the narrow view.id.
