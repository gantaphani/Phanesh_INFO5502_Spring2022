starnet is an intermediary between local telephone networks and the internet.it contracts with internet service providers isps such as earthlink and aol to maintain a a pool of will accept local calls and transfer the data to the isps over lines that starnet owns or maintains.isps then publish local access numbers at which their customers may connect without incurring charges.starnet must in turn contract with local exchange carriers for phone lines and numbers at which the calls may be received and transferred to the network.instead of buying local service from sbc,verizon,and other baby bells spun off from at t in the divestiture,starnet prefers to acquire service from new carriers called competitive local exchange carriers or clecs that have flourished since the telecommunications act of.for reasons we need not relate,these clecs have been able to enter into advantageous financial arrangements with the baby bells that make it less costly for them to operate a service that terminates many calls while originating good description of calls that are bound for an isp numbers.see illinois bell telephone worldcom technologies,cir.so starnet has contracted with these specialized clecs for service.to reduce costs still further,starnet enters into or collocation agreements with these clecs under which starnet modems are placed at the clec premises,and the handover to starnet network occurs there.
today starnet is in bankruptcy.it has sought to escape what are,at least in retrospect,contracts with global naps for service in three markets new england washington,and miami.bankruptcy law allows debtors to reject the executory portions of their contracts,see a,and starnet exercised this option in order to obtain service from other clecs at lower prices.but there was a catch new clecs would assign starnet new numbers.the isps have publicized numbers for their customers to use.a customer who dials such a number and finds it dead because it was one of the numbers that global had furnished will choose another from the isp the replacement may route service to some other network,for major isps contract with multiple intermediaries in large markets.starnet does not want to lose business,so it asked global to port the existing numbers to other clecs.
porting in telecom parlance entails changing the entries in local or national routing tables so that a number invokes the services of a different carrier.the recent changes in the fcc rules that have required cellular carriers to port numbers to their rivals,and carriers to port numbers to local wireless carriers,have drawn public attention to number portability.see cellular telecommunications internet association fcc,in re telephone number portability,first report and order and the agency many decisions,most recently in re telephone number portability,fcc.global refused to port its numbers,observing that the contracts which anyway starnet had rejected imposed no such obligation.global insisted that federal statutes and rules likewise do not oblige it to accommodate starnet demand.it contended that opening these number blocs to porting would require costly changes to its network costs that starnet did not agree to cover and permit erosion of business in the future by making it easier for other customers to jump ship.
bankruptcy judge squires issued an injunction compelling global to port the local numbers to other clecs that had agreed to furnish starnet with service.the injunction rests on b,part of the act.this section requires carriers to provide number portability in accordance with requirements prescribed by the federal communications commission.another provision of that act defines number portability as the ability of users of telecommunications service to retain,at the same location,existing telecommunications numbers without impairment of quality,reliability,or convenience when switching from one telecommunications carrier to another.the fcc first report and order implemented this statute without elaboration,requiring carriers to port numbers to their rivals only at the same location.the agency broached the possibility that in the future it might require porting to new locations and made it clear that carriers are free to furnish this service if they want or agree by contract to do so,but that location portability is not now required.at see also q.subsequent reports have stated that the commission has no current plans to address location portability at this time.in the matter of telephone number memorandum opinion and order on reconsideration.the third and fourth reports the latter in june leave matters unchanged.
the bankruptcy court concluded that starnet had requested porting in order to retain,at the same location,existing telecommunications numbers.location is unaltered,the bankruptcy court stated,because starnet corporate headquarters count as the customer location,and these are not moving.although the modem pools would be moved from global premises,and incoming local calls thus would be terminated at a different place,the bankruptcy court concluded that this would not change the location to which the statute and regulation referred.the district court declined to stay this injunction and,when the judge made it clear that it would be some time before the court could act on global request for plenary review,global filed an appeal to this court and requested a stay.we initially denied that motion but expedited the appeal.the day after oral argument,we entered a stay permitting global to reclaim the numbers it had previously ported in order to comply with the injunction.our stay was conditioned on global willingness expressed in the bankruptcy court and reiterated here to match the price and terms offered by the clecs through which starnet now prefers to obtain service.this opinion explains why we entered that stay and what happens next referral to the fcc so that the agency can clear up an ambiguity in its rules.
no one has a property interest in a phone number.a see also jahn.com,cir.the subscriber has at most a right to use a given number,and whether that number tags along when the customer switches carriers depends on contracts plus rules to be found in statutes and regulations.starnet has no contractual right to only because starnet has repudiated its contracts with global but also because they would not require portability even if they remained in force.lack of an obligation to port the numbers gives global some holdup can demand compensation for porting,or charge a higher price while service continues,but starnet knew this when it got into the deals.terms negotiated ex ante not only price but also global willingness to house the modems,without extra charge,under a collocation agreement may have compensated starnet for the risk that it would be discomfited ex post by the need to pay global for portability,or to abandon the numbers in order to switch carriers.whether or not starnet received compensation ex ante,however,the fact remains that neither a nor anything else in bankruptcy law entitles debtors to more or different services,at lower prices,than their contracts provide.section a gives debtors a right to walk away before the contract end with the creditor entitlement converted to a claim for damages,see nlrb bildisco bildisco,d,not a right to obtain extra benefits without paying for them.in the main,and here,bankruptcy law follows entitlements.see,raleigh illinois department of revenue,d butner united states,d.
thus the bankruptcy judge was right to focus attention on the act and the fcc regulations,which are the only plausible source of an entitlement to portability.section of the act defines the minimum required portability as the ability of users of telecommunications service to retain,at the same location,existing telecommunications numbers.the bankruptcy court held that location for this purpose is the subscriber,in case of a corporation,its headquarters.this is possible,we suppose,but it is implausible.like many other corporations,starnet does business nationwide.it would make little sense and may pose technical difficulties to say that starnet could compel global to port the numbers
