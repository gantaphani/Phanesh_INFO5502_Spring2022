earlier this year we held that united airlines and its unionized pilots had reached a valid bargain in which the pilots union,in order to improve united chance of successful reorganization in bankruptcy,agreed not to oppose its termination of its pension plan.in re ual urpbpa,cir urpbpa i.in exchange for their acquiescence,the active pilots stood to receive million in convertible notes in the reorganized firm,plus a new pension plan.
this agreement contemplated that united would maintain the plan through the end of june,though without making additional monthly contributions to the plan trust fund.during those months,pilots accrued benefits would rise because of additional work credits,and an annual increase would kick in.when the plan ended,all pilots active and retired would continue to receive reduced monthly benefits.termination of a plan does not end anyone right to receive vested benefits it just prevents an increase in those benefits,which will be paid from the trust and,to the extent that fund is insufficient,by the pension benefit guaranty corporation.what the pbgc can pay is limited by b,so vested benefits of retirees such as airline pilots are not fully insured.because the funds in trust for the pilots plan at united were insufficient to pay the promised benefits,termination required the pbgc to step in with a hefty federal subsidy.
the pbgc was unwilling to underwrite the extra benefits that would become vested during the first six months of,benefits that the district court valued at approximately million.it filed an adversary action in the bankruptcy proposing to terminate the plan at the end of.meanwhile united proposed to end the payment of supplemental retirement benefits,from its corporate funds,that exceeded what could be offered through a pension is to say,a plan the benefits of which are taxed to employees as they are paid after retirement,rather than when the work is performed and wages earned.the parties refer to these payments as benefits,but that a misnomer.pension plans,and contributions to them,may or may not be qualified in the sense of deferring income tax from the time wages are earned until the pensions are disbursed particular benefit payments always are taxable income when distributed.we therefore refer to the benefits as supplemental,meaning supplemental to the pension plan,rather than as.the union the air line pilots association,international,or alpa acknowledged that these benefits would end as soon as the pension plan a plan termination limits pension benefits to their vested and insured the parties agreement of january the letter agreement for short stipulated that this meant continuation until a court formally terminated the agreement.alpa insists that this means the date of judicial decision,not the date of the plan termination.
after a considerable delay caused by assignment of the pbgc action to chief bankruptcy judge wedoff,followed by district judge darrah decision after a trial had been held in the bankruptcy court that only a district judge could act on that subject,the matter came to rest with district judge lefkow.she thought that million would be an unreasonable increase in the pbgc liability under a,that conclusion justified termination of the pension plan at the end of.d.but judge lefkow did not release this decision until june.judge wedoff,whose authority over the supplemental pension benefits was secure under b because united request for relief was a core proceeding,concluded in february that it must continue paying while he,then judge darrah,and finally judge lefkow,mulled over the pbgc request to set a termination date in.in october united renewed its request to cease by then the pension plan would have ended even had the pbgc not sought an earlier termination date.judge wedoff again denied this request but allowed united to put the supplemental retirement benefits for october and later months in a segregated account while the pbgc suit continued.united appealed to judge darrah.see a.he dismissed the appeal as unripe because final decision in the pbgc adversary proceeding lay ahead.
we have consolidated four appeals from these decisions.the pbgc,the alpa,and a group of retired pilots the united retired pilots benefit protection association,or urpbpa have appealed from judge lefkow order.united has appealed from judge darrah refusal to decide whether it must pay supplemental benefits for october.judge wedoff entered a separate order requiring united to pay supplemental retirement benefits through february,when its plan of reorganization took effect the plan,judge wedoff held,superseded the letter agreement and allowed united to stop paying at last,even though judge lefkow still had not decided whether the pension plan termination date would be in december or june.united appealed that decision to judge darrah,who affirmed on the ground that,by not taking an interlocutory appeal under a from judge wedoff order in february,united had forfeited any entitlement to further review of its obligations with respect to supplemental benefits.united has filed a notice of appeal from that decision,and both alpa and urpbpa have filed to argue that even the confirmation of the plan did not end united obligation to pay supplemental benefits.we have stayed briefing in those three appeals until the other appeals have been resolved,as our handling of the october supplemental benefits may well resolve the controversy about payment for ensuing months too.
of the four appeals,the pbgc has the distinction of not seeking any the pbgc prevailed in the district court.it proposed a termination date of december,the court ruled in its favor.the pbgc nose is out of joint because the court held a trial and made its own judgment about how much extra it would have cost to keep the plan in force until the end of june,and whether that amount which the court fixed at million,about million less than the pbgc calculation would be an unreasonable increase in federal liability.the pbgc does not want to go through such a procedure again and asks us to hold that,instead of conducting an independent inquiry,the court should have limited review to the administrative record and deferred to the pbgc evaluation.appellate courts do not,however,review language in district judges review judgments,see jordan duff phelps,cir,and this judgment gave the pbgc everything it wanted.a litigant that prevails at trial may not appeal to contend that it should have won faster or cheaper on summary judgment nor may the winner at trial protest what it deems in retrospect to have been needless discovery or rounds of briefing en route.what the pbgc wants from remand directing the district judge to write a different opinion but enter the same not within the judicial power under article iii.fiddling with explanatory language,when the judgment is fixed,would be advisory.
this is not to say that a prevailing litigant must abandon its views on intermediate legal questions.a winner may defend its judgment on any ground preserved in the district court,without need for a cross appeal.see,massachusetts mutual life insurance ludwig,d.the pbgc takes this as a fallback position,even if article iii precludes a remand with instructions to rewrite the opinion while reentering the same judgment.so our first question is whether review should have been deferential,for if the answer is yes then we may affirm on alpa and the retired pilots appeals without further ado.
deference is appropriate when agencies wield delegated interpretive or adjudicatory former usually demonstrated by rulemaking and the latter by administrative adjudication which also may yield rules in fashion.see united states mead,d.the pbgc did not use either rulemaking or adjudication to decide that united plan should be wrapped up at the end of.its decision was made unilaterally and was not.the only authority that the pbgc has under is to ask a court for relief.that implies an independent judicial role.see adams fruit barrett,d.when making its decision a court must respect any regulations issued after rulemaking,but the pbgc has not promulgated any rules pertinent to this subject.nor has it issued the sort of interpretive guidelines that deserve the court respectful consideration even though they lack the power to control.see,christensen harris county,d.all the pbgc had done is commence litigation,and its position is no more entitled to control than is the view of the antitrust division when the department of justice files suit under the sherman act.see,bowen georgetown university hospital,d.as the plaintiff,a federal agency bears the same burden of persuasion as any other litigant.
nothing in c,which describes the judicial function after the pbgc files an action seeking termination,suggests that the court must defer to the agency view.nonetheless,the pbgc insists that we should look past the statutory language and follow pbgc ltv,d,which held that the agency receives deference see chevron natural resources defense council,d to the extent that it has issued opinions interpreting another of its statutes.
section allows the pbgc to revive a terminated pension plan.this is a unilateral act restoration does not require judicial approval,though like other agency action it may be reviewed in court under the administrative procedure act,which requires the court to respect agency action that is not arbitrary,capricious,or in violation of law.in a series of opinion letters,the pbgc concluded that the restoration power should be used when employers create plans.a plan is one that wraps around the federal insurance program and gives current and retired employees substantially the same benefits they would have enjoyed had the original plan not been terminated.ltv pension plan was underfunded by about billion,and when the plan was terminated in ltv bankruptcy the federal insurance fund had to make up about billion of that shortfall.ltv and its unions then negotiated a new pension plan that,when added to the federal insurance benefits,gave workers and retirees the same retirement income they would have enjoyed had the plan not been terminated.investors and workers thus did not share the pain all loss from the employer imprudently high pension promises fell on the taxpayers.the pbgc,following its views,concluded that the procedure amounted to a raid on the treasury and restored the plan under step that ended the federal insurance benefits and required ltv to make up the billion funding shortfall on its own.the supreme court held that by doing this the pbgc did not contradict or abuse its discretion.
although the agency wants us to conclude that ltv entitles all of its acts to chevron deference,that is not what the court held.section enables the pbgc to make orders,which is what leads to deferential review under the apa.section,by contrast,requires the pbgc to initiate litigation.review under the apa differs substantially from the sort of position that an agency must assume when,like any other litigant,it must demonstrate a preponderance of the evidence in order to prevail.see director,owcp greenwich collieries,d.after mead and christensen,the sort of opinion letters to which the court deferred in ltv would receive,not chevron deference,but respectful consideration under skidmore swift.as it happens,the difference between chevron and deference does not matter today,because the pbgc has not issued any opinion letters that bear on the disposition of this litigation.it demands deference not to its policies but to a conclusion that the letter agreement between united and the alpa exposed the insurance fund to an unjustified increase in liability.section c gives the resolution of that question to the judiciary the pbgc participates as a litigant,not as the.
the question that judge lefkow had to resolve was not whether united plan will requirements for a distress termination have been met no matter what the pbgc thinks,and the letter agreement removes the obstacle otherwise present when a agreement is involved,see a,c b ii but what the effective day of that termination would be.the retired pilots appeal fails to reckon with the limits of this litigation.what the retirees want is nothing less than indefinite continuation of the plan.if american airlines can afford a pension plan,the retired pilots insist,then so can united airlines.that water under the bridge,however.urpbpa i holds that united and the alpa were entitled to agree on the plan termination.a companion decision,released today,reiterates that conclusion in rejecting the retired pilots objections to the plan of reorganization,which ends any possibility of resurrecting this pension plan.see in re ual,wl cir.no more need be said about the retired pilots appeal.
while united and its unions were negotiating,united and the pbgc had their own round of discussions.an employer that terminates an underfunded plan becomes liable to the pbgc for the amount of the shortfall.united was in economic distress and could not satisfy that obligation in liquid assets the pbgc agreed to accept about billion of stock in the united.as part of this bargain,the pbgc agreed that united could continue three of its pension plans those covering flight attendants,mechanics,and general office personnel through june.the pbgc reserved its right to seek earlier termination of the pilots plan under a united,which had given the alpa a agreement promising that it would not end the pilots plan before the plans covering other workers kept its bargain and refused to accede to the pbgc demand,which led to the adversary action.now the alpa contends that,by accepting equity securities in lieu of cash on account of the employer shortfall liability,the pbgc has forfeited its right to seek early termination.but how so,when the settlement agreement expressly reserved the right to seek this relief it is not as if united topped up the pension trust to cover the additional benefits that would become vested during the first six months of.it stopped contributing to the pilots plan in,when the bankruptcy began,and the offer of stock in partial satisfaction of the shortfall would not have mitigated the loss to the federal insurance fund from adding six more months of vested benefits in.
so is million,the net cost to the pbgc of continuing the pilots plan through the first six months of,an unreasonable increase in federal liability reasonableness is an issue of fact and is reviewed deferentially on appeal that reasonableness is the ultimate issue does not change that standard.see swint,d.the dispute is,which almost always implies deferential appellate review.see,cooter gell hartmarx,d mars steel continental bank,cir en banc.
the pilots union maintains that million is not an unreasonable increase because it is small in relation to the total obligations of the plan several billion dollars,the assets in the pbgc insurance fund,the cost of an aircraft carrier,or the national government annual budget.that is not,however,the right perspective.any number can be made to look trifling by comparing it with some much larger number,but the exercise is so easy that the comparison is unhelpful.million dollars is substantial by any normal calculation.the district court concluded that the right question is whether the federal treasury receives value for money if not,the marginal outlay is unreasonable.this million would not buy the insurance fund anything of value.nor was it necessary to provide the pilots with a minimally satisfactory retirement they are well compensated even after the termination,since many will receive benefits at the statutory maximum.
the incremental million was a bargaining chip between united and the union to obtain alpa assent to the termination,united offered the pilots an extra six months of benefits to be underwritten by a third party,the pbgc.no wonder it objected.the deal between united and the unions exemplifies the moral hazard to which insurance gives rise.insured parties alter their behavior to take advantage of the payor insurers must respond by making such maneuvers more difficult.that why the pbgc proposed early termination.the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that any extra outlay attributable to the moral hazard created by insurance would be an unreasonable increase in the federal commitment,given the s
