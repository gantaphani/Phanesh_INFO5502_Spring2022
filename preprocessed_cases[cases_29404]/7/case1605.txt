facing a civil judgment debt of more than million,lloyd myles rucker declared bankruptcy and tried to exempt his assets as belonging to private retirement plans under california civil procedure code cpc.rucker had previously placed the assets in pension and k plans funded by his wholly owned corporations.the bankruptcy court denied the exemption on the explicit ground that rucker retirement plans were not designed and used primarily for retirement purposes.the district court saw it otherwise and reversed this judgment.we conclude,after considering the totality of the circumstances,that the bankruptcy court prior decision was not clear error,and we therefore reverse the district court.because the applicable law was not free from doubt,we elaborate our reasons for disagreement with the district court assessment.
in ronald cunning and ronald cunning,collectively cunning,obtained a civil judgment against rucker for million.rucker served months in jail for his criminally fraudulent conduct that gave rise to the judgment.see united states rucker,cir unpublished united states rucker,cir unpublished.with interest,rucker now owes more than million to cunning on the judgment.
in rucker established the lloyd rucker defined benefit pension plan the pension plan and several k plans the k plans.the plans were associated with three of rucker wholly owned corporations the controlled corporations,and rucker was the sole employee beneficiary of his plans.from to rucker aggressively funded the plans both personally and through his controlled corporations.in most of these years rucker wilfully caused the plans to be overfunded,in that contributions to them exceeded the annual limits imposed by the internal revenue code.see a stating that retirement plans must adhere to contribution limits to earn favorable tax treatment.the overfunding amount was about percent of the total value of the plans.also,contributions to the plans by the controlled corporations were markedly substantial in relation to the salaries the corporations paid to rucker,in some instances exceeding his salary.for example,in and the controlled corporations contributed at least more each year to rucker retirement plans than they paid to him in salary.and in and plan contributions were about equal to rucker salary.
rucker plan activities quite plainly violated several internal revenue service irs rules.the bankruptcy court found that rucker repeatedly failed to accurately disclose to the irs contributions made by the controlled corporations.between and rucker contributed more to the k plans than he disclosed to the irs,and in alone he contributed about more to the pension plan than he first reported.the record also shows that in rucker directed a wholly owned offshore corporation to contribute to his plans via a foreign bank account,even though the offshore corporation was not a plan sponsor permitted to contribute to the plans.finally,in the pension plan purchased property on which rucker lived for six months.however,the total rental value of the property for that time period constituted less than four percent of the plan assets.apart from this relatively small constructive rent payment,rucker has not borrowed or withdrawn money from his plans.the general picture is that rucker disregarded irs rules in funding his plans but that he generally did not withdraw money from his plans for his personal use.
when rucker filed for bankruptcy his plans were worth about million.by contrast,rucker has paid cunning virtually nothing on the judgment.rucker has also said that he has no plans to pay any part of the judgment.rucker explained it would be like paying into a black hole.
after cunning increased his collection efforts in,rucker filed for chapter bankruptcy in florida,but he did not meet the venue requirements and the case was transferred to the central district of california.in the california federal bankruptcy court,rucker declared as exempt his assets in all the plans under cpc b,which exempts all amounts held,controlled,or in process of distribution by a private retirement plan.cunning objected to the exemption,claiming that the plans were not exempt because they were not designed or used primarily for retirement purposes.
after a bench trial,the bankruptcy court sustained cunning objection and determined that the plans were not exempt because rucker designed and used the plans primarily to shield his assets from cunning.instrumental in the bankruptcy court reasoning were the facts that rucker overfunded the plans,that rucker took at least one constructive rent payment,and that rucker did not accurately disclose his contributions as required by irs regulations.the bankruptcy court also found explicitly that rucker lacked credibility 
rucker appealed to the district court,which reversed the bankruptcy court and held that although rucker may have created the plans in part to shield assets,he was still entitled to the exemption because the plans were designed and used primarily for retirement purposes.cunning appeals the district court reversal of the bankruptcy court 
the evidence taken together squarely raises the issue of whether a person who funds a retirement plan both for retirement purposes in part and to shelter assets and avoid paying debts in part has acted primarily for retirement purposes.the district court reasoned that if the evidence here showed dual purposes,it nonetheless could not conclude that the funding was primarily to avoid a debt.however,when we look at the totality of circumstances and give deference to the bankruptcy court factual findings after trial,we come to a different conclusion.
this case turns in part on our assessment of the appropriate standards of review.because we are in as good a position as the district court to review the findings of the bankruptcy court,we independently review the bankruptcy court decision.rifino united states in re rifino,cir.we review de novo the bankruptcy court decision on the scope of the exemption for private retirement plans provided by cpc.dudley anderson in re dudley,cir.however,our precedent establishes that whether a plan is designed and used for retirement purposes is a question of fact that we review for clear error.jacoway wolfe in re jacoway,see also simpson burkart in re simpson,cir reviewing for clear error whether the features of a retirement instrument demonstrate that the product primary purpose and effect is a retirement plan under cpc.our conclusion that a clear error standard governs review of the bankruptcy court assessment whether a plan funding is primarily for retirement purposes is a key factor to our evaluation of the merits of the appeal.the district court erred by applying de novo review to the bankruptcy court factual determination that rucker plans were not designed and used primarily for retirement purposes applying the clear error standard,we reach a different conclusion than did the district court,and we reaffirm the bankruptcy court decision.
rucker claims that his plan assets are exempt from his bankruptcy estate and beyond cunning reach because they fall within cpc b,which exempts a ll amounts held,controlled,or in process of distribution by a private retirement plan.a plan used in part to shield assets is still exempt if it was designed and used primarily for retirement purposes.dudley,at.we construe cpc liberally for the benefit of the debtor.lieberman hawkins in re lieberman,cir.in fact,t he very purpose of the exemption is to permit a judgment debtor to place funds beyond the reach of creditors,so long as they qualify for the exemption under the law.schwartzman wilshinsky,th,d.
in deciding whether a plan is designed and used primarily for retirement purposes,a ll factors are relevant but no one is dispositive.bloom robinson in re bloom,cir.many factors previously considered by us and by california courts concern the extent of a debtor withdrawals or loans from the plan.see jacoway,at listing nonexhaustive factors considered by courts when evaluating cpc b,most of which relate to plan withdrawals or loans.courts have also considered a debtor subjective intent in deciding whether the plans have a r
