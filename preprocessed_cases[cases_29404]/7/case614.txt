in this direct appeal from the bankruptcy court,we address a question of first impression in the circuit courts of appeal whether,in light of the amendments to the bankruptcy code,et the code,codified by the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act bapcpa,stat,the absolute priority rule continues to apply to individual debtors in possession proceeding under chapter because we answer that question in the affirmative,we affirm the bankruptcy court order denying plan confirmation.
because this appeal requires us to resolve a pure question of law that has divided the nearly two dozen bankruptcy and district courts that have faced it,we begin by setting forth that background in detail.in subpart a,we recite the history of the absolute priority rule.in subpart b,we describe the statutory provisions relevant to determining whether the bapcpa abrogated the absolute priority rule for individual debtors proceeding under chapter.in subpart c,we discuss the judicial decisions to date addressing that question.
we begin by setting forth the history of the absolute priority rule,which for reasons that will become clear,is significant for our disposition here.the absolute priority rule traces its origins to the latter half of the nineteenth century.the supreme court articulated the earliest version of the rule in response to widespread collusion in the context of railroad reorganizations,just after the civil war.the court announced that stockholders are not entitled to any share of the capital stock nor to any dividend of the profits until all the debts of the corporation are paid,rock island pac.howard,wall.as the supreme court later described,t he rule had its genesis in judicial construction of the undefined requirement of the early bankruptcy statute that reorganization plans be fair and equitable.see norwest bank worthington ahlers,d see also,stat,amending the bankruptcy act to require a finding that a plan is fair and equitable and does not discriminate unfairly in favor of any class of creditors or stockholders for confirmation.in case los angeles lumber products,the court for the first time used the term absolute priority to describe the rule.
although based on the fair and equitable requirements found in of the bankruptcy act the act,the absolute priority rule had itself never been codified under the act in fact,congress expressly prohibited its further judicial application by passing the amendments to the act.see,stat.in modifying the requirements for confirmation of a plan of reorganization under what was then chapter xi of the act,congress amended the act such that c onfirmation of an arrangement shall not be refused solely because the interests of a debtor,or if the debtor is a corporation,the interest of its stockholders or members will be preserved under the arrangement.id.instead,congress provided for confirmation if the plan is for the best interest of the creditors and is feasible.id.
the legislative history to the amendments to the act reflects that congress intended an express repeal of the judicially created absolute priority rule in the context of chapter xi which was designed for small,privately held businesses t he fair and equitable rule can not realistically be applied were it so applied,no individual debtor,and no corporate debtor where the stock ownership is substantially identical with management could effectuate an arrangement except by payment of the claims of all creditors in full.reprinted in.
in,congress passed the bankruptcy reform act of,replacing the act with the code and creating the structure of modern bankruptcy practice.in enacting the code,congress merged many aspects of chapters x and xi as well as the chapter xii of the act into the newly created chapter.see.at,reprinted in,this bill adopts a consolidated chapter for all business reorganizations.in doing so,congress specifically incorporated the absolute priority rule into b b ii ahlers,at.the absolute priority rule,as provided in,remained unchanged until the passage of bapcpa in.
under the provisions of the code,a bankruptcy case under chapter commences with the filing of a chapter petition in the bankruptcy court.commencement of the case creates the bankruptcy estate,which includes,pursuant to a,all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.
after filing a voluntary petition under chapter,a debtor may file a plan of reorganization with the bankruptcy court.a.in addition to numerous other requirements,a reorganization plan must specify classes of claims against the debtor based on specific statutory requirements.a.to be operative,a chapter reorganization plan must be confirmed by the bankruptcy court.a precondition of plan confirmation is that it meet the requirements set forth in a.
of particular import to this case is the requirement,found at a a,that each impaired class of creditors accept the plan.pursuant to b,however,a plan of reorganization may be confirmed over the dissent of an impaired class of creditors using a procedure commonly known as a cram down.the plan can avoid the requirements of a in a cram down procedure if the plan does not discriminate unfairly,and is fair and equitable to the dissenting creditors.b.
the code inclusively sets forth,at b,specific requirements that must be met for a plan to be fair and equitable.among those requirements is the absolute priority rule,the construction of which is central to the disposition of this appeal.prior to,the absolute priority rule as codified was simply that,in order to be fair and equitable,a proposed chapter plan must provide the holder of any claim or interest that is junior to the claims of such dissenting class will not receive or retain under the plan on account of such junior claim or interest any property.b b ii.in other words,if the proposed plan allowed the debtor to retain property,any dissenting creditors must be paid in full in order for the plan to be crammed down.see ahlers,at.
in,congress enacted bapcpa,which we have previously described as an attempt to reduce the spiraling costs to society of bankruptcies.in re ciotti,cir.although congress,in enacting bapcpa,altered the code in numerous respects,our focus is the amendment to b b ii,which contains the absolute priority rule.the code,after bapcpa,now states that to be fair and equitable,a proposed plan must provide that 
the holder of any claim or interest that is junior to the claims of such class will not receive or retain under the plan on account of such junior claim or interest any property,except that in a case in which the debtor is an individual,the debtor may retain property included in the estate under section,subject to the requirements of subsection a of this section.
id.amendment emphasized.
section which was added to the code by bapcpa in turn provides 
a in a case in which the debtor is an individual,property of the estate includes,in addition to the property specified in section 
all property of the kind specified in section that the debtor acquires after the commencement of the case but before the case is closed,dismissed,or converted to a case under chapter,or,whichever occurs first and 
earnings from services performed by the debtor after the commencement of the case but before the case is closed,dismissed,or converted to a case under chapter,or,whichever occurs first.
b except as provided in section or a confirmed plan or order confirming a plan,the debtor shall remain in possession of all property of the estate.
a significant split of authorities has developed nationally among the bankruptcy courts regarding the effect of the bapcpa amendments on the absolute priority rule when the chapter debtor is an individual.some courts have adopted the broad view that,by including in b b ii a to which in turn references,the provision that defines the property of a bankruptcy estate,congress intended to include the entirety of the bankruptcy estate as property that the individual debtor may retain,thus effectively abrogating the absolute priority rule in chapter for individual debtors.other courts,adopting the narrow view,have held that congress did not intend such a sweeping change to chapter,and that the bapcpa amendments merely have the effect of allowing individual chapter debtors to retain property and earnings acquired after the commencement of the case that would otherwise be excluded under a 
to date,one district court,one bankruptcy appellate panel,and five bankruptcy courts have taken the broad view and ruled,although on different grounds,that congress intended abrogation of the absolute priority rule.see in re friedman,spcp group,llc biggins,in re shat,in re johnson,in re tegeder,in re roedemeier,in re bullard.
some of these broad view courts have ruled congress intended abrogation on the basis of the plain language of b b ii.in biggins,for example,the district court reasoned 
s ection says that property of the estate includes,in addition to the property specified in section all property of the kind specified in section that the debtor acquires after the commencement of the case,as well as earnings from services performed by the debtor after the commencement of the case.the plain reading of this statute is that property of the estate,for purposes of section,includes property acquired and earnings earned after the debtor files his or her chapter petition,in addition to property specified in section.
reading these statutes together,property of the estate for purposes of section includes property and earnings acquired both before and after the commencement of the bankruptcy case.
at emphasis added see tegeder,at since broadly defines property of the estate to include property specified in,as well as property acquired and earnings from services performed,the absolute priority rule no longer applies to individual debtors who retain property of the estate under.
the friedman panel majority reached a similar conclusion based on its reading of the plain meaning of the words included and in addition to in 
included is not a word of limitation.to limit the scope of estate property in and would require the statute to read included,except for the property set out in section in the case of b b ii,and in addition to,but not inclusive of the property described in section in the case of.
a plain reading of b b ii and together mandates that the absolute priority rule is not applicable in individual chapter debtor cases.
friedman,at emphasis added footnote omitted.
other courts to adopt the broad view of the bapcpa amendments,however,have done so while rejecting a approach.in shat,for example,that bankruptcy court described the phrase property included in the estate under section as ambiguous but nevertheless concluded that congress intended to abrogate the absolute priority rule for individual debtors.see at.the shat court,relying on roedemeier,reasoned that several other bapcpa amendments to chapter demonstrate that congress intended chapter procedures concerning individual debtors to function more like those found in chapter.id.at citing roedemeier,at.the roedemeier court described the chapter amendments as apply ing only to individual debtors and being clearly drawn from the chapter model.at.
independent of the changes made to the language of b,the shat court identified the following additional amendments that,in its view,support the broad view regarding absolute priority rule abrogation 
changing the mandatory contents of a plan pursuant to a to resemble a 
adding the disposable income test of b to a 
delaying the discharge until the completion of all plan payments as in a 
permitting discharge for cause before all payments are completed pursuant to d,similar to the hardship discharge of b and 
the addition of e to permit the modification of a plan even after substantial consummation for purposes similar to a.
shat,at.the shat court concluded that these amendments were part of an overall design of adapting various chapter provisions to fit in chapter.id.at.accordingly,in its view,reading the amendments to b b ii as eliminating the absolute priority rule for individual debtors would be consistent with the perceived congressional intent to harmonize the treatment of the individual debtor under chapter with those under chapter,which has no absolute priority rule.
in further support of their view that congress intended to make chapter operate for individual debtors similarly to chapter,the shat and friedman courts noted that congress drafted the new to mirror a of the code,which adds certain property to a bankruptcy estate in the chapter context.see friedman,at shat,at.both and are similarly prefaced with the language property of the estate includes,in addition to the property specified in section both also list,in like terms,acquired property and earnings.see.
in addition,the shat court noted its belief that t he broader view saves section b b ii from an almost trivial reading,at a sentiment echoed by the court in roedemeier when it noted the narrow reading of the new exception in b b ii would have little impact on probably most individual debtors ability to reorganize in chapter.at.see tegeder,at,quoting william norton,norton bankruptcy law practice a more narrow interpretation of b b ii would cause this amendment to have little effect.
on the other hand,over a dozen separate bankruptcy courts,including the court below,have adopted the narrow view and held that bapcpa did not abrogate the absolute priority rule in its entirety for individual chapter debtors.see in re arnold,wl.may,in re tucker,wl in re borton,wl in re lindsey,in re kamell,in re draiman,in re maharaj,in re walsh,in re stephens,in re karlovich,in re steedley,wl in re gelin,in re mullins,in re gbadebo.
in reaching these decisions,courts have stated differing rationales as to why the absolute priority rule remains valid in individual chapter cases.beginning with gbadebo,several of the above courts found that the language of b b ii preserved the absolute priority rule in unambiguous terms.see,tucker,wl at draiman,at relying on the plain meaning of b b ii walsh,at quoting gbadebo,at steedley,wl at mullins,at karlovich,at borton,wl at.
after discussing the contrary holding of shat,the gbadebo court,in frequently quoted language,stated 
n otwithstanding the thorough and thoughtful analysis by the shat court,the court is unable to agree with its conclusion.if the court were writing on a clean slate,it would view the language of b b ii as unambiguous.the court would read the phrase included in the estate under section to be reasonably susceptible to only one meaning,added to the bankruptcy estate by.
lindsey,kamell,and gelin,however,held that the language of b b ii was ambiguous.lindsey in particular noted that,if the statute were not ambiguous,there would be no split of authority and the arguments in favor of each position would not be so diverse.at.and both gelin and kamell noted the lack of direct or helpful legislative history for bapcpa on the alteration of b b ii.see gelin,at kamell,at.
a common thread running through many of the narrow view cases is that if congress had intended to abrogate the absolute priority rule for individual chapter debtors,it would have done so in a far less convoluted way,particularly in light of the well established place of the absolute priority rule in bankruptcy jurisprudence.see,kamell,at.these cases note that if congress had indeed had such an intent,it could have simply added the words except with respect to individuals at the beginning of b b ii.karlovich,at.
other narrow view cases take issue with the claim found in broad view cases that congress eliminated the absolute priority rule for individuals to harmonize chapter with chapter.as the karlovich court observed,if that were congress intent,congress would simply have amended the statutory debt ceilings for chapter cases set out in e,and either eliminate them altogether or set them much higher.at.indeed,the court in lindsey reasoned that preservation of the absolute priority rule was more consistent with congressional intent in enacting the bapcpa.t he narrow interpretation is more in line with the primary purpose of bapcpa to improve bankruptcy law and practice by restoring personal responsibility and integrity in the bankruptcy system and ensure that the system is fair for both debtors and creditors.at quoting rep,pt,at internal quotation marks omitted see also gbadebo,at no one who reads bapcpa as a whole can reasonably conclude that it was designed to enhance the individual debtor fresh start.
the bankruptcy court below took a position in line with other narrow view cases.after discussing the position taken by the broad view courts that congress may have intended to harmonize chapter procedures for individual debtors with those of chapter,the bankruptcy court quoted mullins for the proposition that that purpose would have been more expressed by simply stating except that in a case in which the debtor is an individual,this provision shall not apply,rather than by awkwardly referring to.maharaj,at citation omitted.the court further echoed the view taken by the karlovich court that if congress intended for chapter to operate the same as chapter in the case of an individual debtor,congress would have simply amended the statutory debt ceilings for chapter cases set out in e,and either eliminate them altogether or make them much higher.id.
we now turn to the factual background of this case and the proceedings below.ganess and vena maharaj hereinafter debtors are the owners and operators of an auto body repair shop in chantilly,virginia.between and,debtors were the victims of an apparent fraud that left them saddled with considerable debt.because their debts exceeded the limits for proceeding in bankruptcy under chapter of the code,they filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter in the bankruptcy court for the eastern district of virginia debtors have continued to own and operate their auto body shop as debtors in possession throughout these proceedings.
in,debtors filed a chapter plan of reorganization the plan with the bankruptcy court.the debtors plan proposed segregating creditors into four classes class i represented a million claim by access bank,secured by debtors real property class ii consisted of a claim held by an automobile lender and secured by an interest in debtors vehicle class iii contained most general unsecured claims and class iv consisted of access bank unsecured claims.the plan provided that debtors would continue to own and operate their auto body business and use income from the business to pay the general unsecured claims of class iii creditors.
the plan provided that debtors would refinance their loan agreements with access bank,the sole holder of claims in class i and iv.the automobile lender whose claim solely comprised class ii was unimpaired by the plan,as the plan provided that debtors daughter would continue to make payments pursuant to the terms of the automobile financing agreement.the holders of general unsecured claims found in class iii were impaired,with debtors proposing to pay an estimated cents on the dollar over a period of five years to those claims.
ballots were distributed to the creditors impaired by the plan.access bank,the sole holder of claims in class i and class iv,voted to approve the plan.the class ii creditor did not vote.discover bank,the holder of a relatively small class iii unsecured claim,was the only other creditor to return a ballot,and voted to reject the plan.
nevertheless,debtors sought to have the district court engage in a cram down to confirm the plan over discover bank dissent.while acknowledging that under the absolute priority rule,they would not be able to retain their auto body business,debtors argued that the bankruptcy court should adopt the broad view of the bapcpa amendments,and hold that the absolute priority rule no longer applied to individual chapter debtors.debtors maintained that if they were forced to comply with the absolute priority rule,they would have to liquidate their business to effectuate a cram down.without their business,however,they would lack a source of income,and be unable to make payments under the plan.
the bankruptcy court was not persuaded by debtors arguments and agreed with those courts that have held that congress did not intend to abrogate the absolute priority rule in the case of individual chapter debtors.rather,the court adopted the narrow view that the bapcpa amendments merely allowed a debtor to keep earnings and other property acquired after the commencement of the case.maharaj,at citation omitted.although the court expressed considerable sympathy for debtors plight and emphasized that neither the broad nor the narrow analysis is free from doubt,id.at,the court entered an order denying confirmation of the plan.
debtors noted a timely appeal of the bankruptcy court order.on its own motion,the bankruptcy court certified its order for direct appeal to this court pursuant to d a i allowing a direct appeal when the judgment involves a question of law as to which there is no controlling decision of the court of appeals for the circuit or of the supreme court of the united states,or involves a matter of public importance.a panel of this court then authorized debtors direct appeal.see id.
this appeal presents a question of statutory interpretation,which we review de novo.great steaks,cir.as we have emphasized,
t he starting point for any issue of statutory interpretation is the language of the statute itself.united states bly,cir.in that regard,we must first determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute and our inquiry must cease if the statutory language is unambiguous and the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent.id.omission in original quoting united states hayes,cir,rev on other grounds,d internal quotation marks omitted.we determine the plainness or ambiguity of the statutory language by reference to the language itself,the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.united states thompson riviere,cir omission in original quoting robinson shell oil,d.
ignacio united states,cir.furthermore,a statute is ambiguous if it lends itself to more than one reasonable interpretation.newport news shipbuilding dry dock brown,cir.the matter of statutory ambiguity is an important one because i f the statute is unambiguous,our inquiry into congress intent is at an end,for if the language is plain and the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent,we need not inquire further.kennedy joseph ministries,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
accordingly,we begin our analysis by reference to the language of the bapcpa,which we conclude is ambiguous because it is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation.we then look to the specific and broader context within which congress enacted the bapcpa,as well as a familiar canon of statutory construction,the presumption against implied repeal,and conclude that congress did not intend to abrogate the absolute priority rule.thus,notwithstanding the ambiguity of the plain language of the relevant bapcpa provisions,when the bapcpa amendments are viewed in light of the specific context in which they were enacted and the broader context of the bapcpa and the field of bankruptcy law,we arrive at the conclusion that congress did not intend to alter longstanding bankruptcy practice by effecting an implied repeal of the absolute priority rule for individual debtors proceeding under chapter.finally,we consider,and reject,appellants public policy contentions as unfounded.
to determine whether the statutes at issue here have a plain meaning,and are not ambiguous,we begin with the plain language of the provisions at issue,and note that we must read and b b ii both individually and together.specifically,we must determine the meaning of the congressional language property included in the estate under section found in b b ii and property of the estate includes,in addition to the property specified in section found in.
there are two competing constructions of the included in the estate language.on one view,the phrase included in means the equivalent of added to,since property of the estate has long been defined under.on another view,however,this language included in means something closer to referenced in,in which case was merely absorbed and superseded into for individual chapter debtors.see,kamell,at.on the face of the statute,either construction is plausible.
the same is true with respect to the in addition to the property specified in section language found in.court assigned in this case asks us to treat that language as a signpost,used only to note that property is already included in the bankruptcy estate,because it is set aside from the rest of by a comma and a dash,indicating that it is not essential to the statute meaning.br.of court assigned amicus counsel at.stated differently,because independently includes all property in the estate,it would be a redundancy to reinclude that property through the language.on the other hand,several bankruptcy courts have noted that a plausible reading of that language coupled with the included in the estate language indicates that operates in as a subset of.see,friedman,at.by that construction,property,which is referenced by,is literally property included in the estate under.
in light of the foregoing,we conclude that the language of b b ii and lends itself to more than one reasonable interpretation,and thus does not have a plain meaning.perhaps the only thing that is clear and plain is that the courts that have considered this issue have arrived at plausible,competing arguments as to why their respective approaches are consistent with congressional purpose in enacting bapcpa.in short,the meaning of the bapcpa amendments is anything but plain.it is ambiguous.see friedman,at jury,dissenting t he meaning of the words is not plain.there can be more than one cogent interpretation of their meaning and intent.
as we discussed above,in addition to analyzing the plainness or ambiguity the statute language,we must also look to the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.in doing so,we find persuasive the argument that the amendment to b b ii preserved the absolute priority rule as it operated prior to the passage of bapcpa.
p rior to bapcpa,property of the estate did not include acquired property and earnings for individuals and alike.hence,acquired property and earnings could be retained by a chapter debtor,individual and alike,without running afoul of the absolute priority rule.the addition of potentially changed that by adding to the property of the estate of an individual acquired property and earnings.without a corresponding change to b b ii,individual debtors could no longer retain acquired property and earnings if they wished to cram down a plan.by adding the language excepting the property from the absolute priority rule of b b ii,congress merely ensured that the absolute priority rule would be the same as it had been prior to bapcpa and be the same for all chapter debtors.in other words,what congress took from the individual debtor with its hand,it returned for application of the absolute priority rule with its b b ii hand.
karlovich.in this respect we do not agree with the claim,advanced by some of the broad view courts,tegeder,at,that a narrow reading of the amendments renders trivial.to the contrary,the narrow view of brings acquired property into the estate,thereby extending the automatic stay in chapter cases to an individual debtor postpetition earnings and subject ing those earnings to the various tests for confirmation of the chapter plan.gelin,at citation omitted.at the same time,b b ii permits the debtor to retain that property during the chapter proceeding and not put it at risk in a cram down analysis.
in our view,the context demonstrates that congress intended to add property to the estate already established by.this position is supported by the sixth circuit holding in in re seafort,cir,in which the court interpreted a the parallel chapter provision to the sixth circuit interpreted the statute as follows section a expressly incorporates.read together,fixes property of the estate as of the date of filing,while adds to the property of the estate property interests which arise.seafort,at.
strongly supporting our conclusion that the bapcpa amendments did not abrogate the absolute priority rule is the supreme court view,especially in the bankruptcy context,that implied repeal is strongly disfavored.indeed,debtors concede that adoption of their position would represent a significant departure from bankruptcy practice.see debtors opening br.at e limination of the absolute priority rule represents a significant change from law.
as a general matter,repeals by implication are not favored,and therefore,the intention of the legislature to repeal must be clear and manifest.the last best beef,llc dudas,cir quoting tva hill,d see hui castaneda,d as we have emphasized,repeals by implication are not favored and will not be presumed unless the intention of the legislature to repeal is clear and manifest.quoting hawaii office of hawaiian affairs,d.
the canon against implied repeal is particularly strong in the field of bankruptcy law.in interpreting the code,we are mindful that courts will not read the bankruptcy code to erode past bankruptcy practice absent a clear indication that congress intended such a departure.hamilton lanning,d see also hall united states,d same citing cohen de la cruz,d midlantic nat.bank dep t of envtl,d citing swarts hammer.if congress wishes to grant the trustee an extraordinary exemption from nonbankruptcy law,the intention would be clearly expressed,not left to be collected or inferred from disputable considerations of convenience in administering the estate of the bankrupt.palmer massachusetts.if this old and familiar power of the states was withdrawn when congress gave district courts bankruptcy powers over railroads,we ought to find language fitting for so drastic a change.in re timbers of inwood forest,cir we think it unlikely that congress would have adopted such a rule entailing,as it does,major changes in the way in which a reorganization proceeding is conducted without clear,unequivocal statements to that effect in the bankruptcy statute,or,at least,in its legislative history.
in discussing whether congress,in enacting the chandler act of,intended to extend the jurisdiction of bankruptcy courts over certain mortgage lien enforcement actions,the supreme court worried that i f the statute is read to extend the power of the bankruptcy court to the present situation,the four month period governing the delivery of certain property to the bankruptcy court will have acquired a new significance in bankruptcy law.in re john russell.the court continued w e can not help but think that if congress had set out to make such a major change,some clear and unambiguous indication of that purpose would appear.id.
below,we discuss the ambiguous language of the statute and sparse legislative history and conclude that congress made no clear statement of repeal.we go on to consider,and reject,debtors and their amici contention that congress repealed the absolute priority rule with the intent of harmonizing chapter and chapter for individual debtors.
looking to the text of both b b ii and,we find no clear indication that congress intended to abrogate the longstanding absolute priority rule for individual chapter debtors.as we discussed above,the language at issue is ambiguous,and we are unable to draw from it a clear congressional intent to abrogate the rule.to the contrary,we are in agreement with those courts that have concluded that,if congress intended to abrogate such a rule of bankruptcy jurisprudence,it could have done so in a far less convoluted manner.as the kamell court persuasively observed 
t he absolute priority rule or something very like it has been acknowledged as far back as at least the.it has long been held that major changes to existing practice will not be inferred unless clearly mandated.further,as observed by the supreme court when it upheld application of the absolute priority rule in norwest bank worthington ahlers,despite the newly enacted chapter,where,as here,congress adopts a new law it normally can be presumed to have had knowledge of the interpretation given to the old law.from such awkward and convoluted
