on august,christine lazarus and her sister purchased real property in springfield,joint tenants,taking out a loan secured by a mortgage from washington mutual.in a refinancing on june,both sisters executed a promissory note,and a mortgage on the property to secure the note,in favor of greater atlantic mortgage corporation gamc 
on july,gamc paid the funds generated by the note,in the amount of just over,to washington mutual to discharge the latter loan to the sisters and terminate the latter mortgage interest.the new mortgage was recorded on july,in the county registry of deeds.the discharge of the washington mutual mortgage was recorded on august.on september,lazarus filed for chapter bankruptcy.
in january,the trustee in the lazarus bankruptcy case sought to avoid the gamc mortgage on the ground that it constituted a preferential transfer of lazarus property made within the period preceding the filing of the bankruptcy petition.under section b of the bankruptcy code,b 
t he trustee may avoid any transfer of an interest of the debtor in property 
to or for the benefit of a creditor 
for or on account of an antecedent debt owed by the debtor before such transfer was made 
made while the debtor was insolvent 
a on or within days before the date of the filing of the petition or 
that enables such creditor to receive more than such creditor would receive if 
a the case were a case under chapter of this title 
b the transfer had not been made and 
c such creditor received payment of such debt to the extent provided by the provisions of this title.
on cross motions for summary judgment,the bankruptcy judge declined to set aside the mortgage.in re lazarus.the judge said that no creditor could have been prejudiced by gamc delay in perfecting its mortgage because washington mutual left its mortgage on the books until after gamc had recorded its mortgage thus,the property never appeared to be unencumbered.the district court affirmed with a short opinion adopting the reasoning of the bankruptcy judge.
on this appeal,the trustee claims that the mortgage should have been set aside,making the secured property or at least lazarus interest in than any exempted to all creditors.the issues,matters of law that we review de novo,in re dn,cir,are two whether there was a preferential transfer under section b and,if so,whether it was rescued from avoidance by section c,which provides exceptions to section b.
the dispute as to section b is narrowed by agreement that the allegedly preferential transfer was of an interest in property the new mortgage that it was to or for the benefit of a creditor gamc that the lazarus note was an antecedent debt that the transfer was made while lazarus was insolvent and that it was made within days of lazarus later bankruptcy filing.further,unless avoided,the mortgage would give gamc more than it would receive as a general creditor.
gamc purports to dispute this last proposition by saying that it would not have made the loan without the mortgage and so no general creditor was made worse off by the refinancing.this is a different claim of no which we will return.but the fact remains that recognizing the mortgage would give gamc more than it would receive without it,which is why it is fighting to retain the mortgage.
gamc concession that the note was for an antecedent debt requires somewhat more explanation.although the note and mortgage were executed and apparently delivered to gamc on the same day,section e provides that for real property with an exception not here relevant,a transfer is made when it occurs only if the transfer is perfected within days of the actual transfer otherwise it is deemed made only at the time such transfer is perfected.e a,b 
perfection,in this case,required the filing of the mortgage with the local registry of deeds.because this filing occurred days after the initial transfer of funds,section e requires that the transfer be deemed to have occurred on the date of perfection.the mortgage,therefore,secured a debt antecedent to the transfer rather than simultaneous with it.gamc does not dispute this reading of the statute.
what gamc does seriously dispute is that the transferred property interest was that of the debtor.this might seem an odd all,lazarus did grant a mortgage interest in favor of gamc in property she.however,gamc relies on the earmarking doctrine in contending that the transfer ought to be viewed in substance as a transfer of the mortgage from washington mutual to gamc.
where funds received by the debtor are earmarked for another,courts have sometimes held that the funds are not really the debtor property so that the retransfer to the final recipient is not a preference under section b,in re superior stamp coin,cir.in the classic case,one who has guaranteed a debt of the debtor gives the debtor the funds to pay off the creditor and the debtor does so but then goes bankrupt shortly thereafter.
under the earmarking approach,courts view the funds as transferred by the guarantor to the creditor through,but not by,the debtor.if the earmarked funds were treated as those of the debtor,the guarantor payment could often be recaptured from the original creditor as an avoidable preference and the guarantor would then have to pay twice.further,the earmarking approach leaves the estate no worse off than it would have been if the guarantor had advanced nothing to the debtor but paid off the debt directly.
most circuits who have spoken have extended this earmarking concept to situations where a new a funds to the debtor to pay off debts to other creditors,substituting itself for the old creditor in the substitute creditor case,as with the guarantor example,the earmarking doctrine relies on a conceptual view that the payment passing through the debtor hands is not his and that he is merely a kind of bailee.
the bankruptcy judge in this case extended the earmarking approach to the case before us,concluding that there was effectively a transfer of a security interest from washington mutual to gamc without disadvantaging the estate.in re lazarus,at.but use of the earmarking doctrine in this case is not conceptually similar to the guarantor or new creditor cases where it could plausibly be argued that there was merely an arrangement between third parties with no property transfer by the debtor.
rather,in refinancing there are multiple transactions,including a new loan to the debtor,a mortgage back from the debtor to the new lender,a use of the proceeds of the loan to pay off the old loan and the release of the old mortgage.thus,new proceeds are generated,nominally for the benefit of the debtor,and the debtor,by making a new mortgage,transfers a property interest to the new lender 
thus,in this case,lazarus made a new mortgage in favor of gamc,probably on different terms than the original or there would have been no benefit to refinancing.then,when gamc paid off washington mutual loan,the latter released its own mortgage.this did not transfer the old mortgage to gamc it merely meant that gamc mortgage was now first in line rather than a subordinate mortgage.the debtor did not act merely as a bailee with the mortgage passing through her hands from washington mutual to gamc.
thus,the earmarking concept does not provide gamc an escape from the plain language of section b in the case of a transfer of a security interest.although one circuit supports the bankruptcy judge use of the earmarking doctrine in a like case,in re heitkamp,cir see also in re lee,this approach has been justly opposed on the ground that it amounts to ignoring the statutory language to avoid the statutory language,gamc resorts to the underlying policy arguments ably argued by gamc counsel.
gamc first point in response is that although formally the mortgage was given for an antecedent debt,the preexisting creditors would be in about the same position if no refinancing had occurred.nor is there any indication that any new creditor lent money,during the refinancing,believing that the washington mutual mortgage had been released indeed,as the bankruptcy judge noted,the old mortgage was discharged but the discharge was itself not timely recorded.
conversely,if the transaction is deemed an avoidable preference,gamc will still hold the unpaid note but gamc seemingly will lose its status as a secured creditor of lazarus vis Ã  vis the other creditors.this may,or may not,be as bad as a guarantor having to pay twice but it is certainly a penalty.but the penalty is not without a general encourager les is easily avoided by recording within days as the statute directed.
probably other creditors were not prejudiced in this instance but the formal requirements of section were designed to work mechanically,avoiding the necessity of demonstrating prejudice.the code lays down formal requirements with substantive consequences.the litigation in this case is one of the costs of ignoring the statute the costs would be greatly multiplied if in each instance inquiry had to be made as to whether or not prejudice had occurred.
the avoidable preference provision first appeared in the code,framed in general terms.a preference was created when an insolvent debtor made a transfer within four months of filing that enabled a creditor to obtain more than the other creditors in his class.act of july,ch,stat.then,after an abortive experiment in,act of,ch,stat,congress in introduced into the section what was effectively a recording requirement for mortgages,albeit without a grace period.act of june,ch,stat.
in,through the chandler act,congress introduced a more detailed definition of preference,act of june,ch,stat,and in,a grace period for perfection was added act of,ch,stat.the legislative history reveals that this last was designed to create an appropriately rigid time limitation.then,in,the bankruptcy code reduced the time limit for perfection to days,as it remained during the transactions in this case.bankruptcy reform act of,e.
it is one thing to impose a gloss on the statute,such as the earmarking doctrine,that achieves formal compliance with the statute to rescue a transaction where no prejudice occurred.it is another to make lack of prejudice itself a substitute for formal compliance.the history of section just recounted is of amendments that try to make the statute to avoid uncertainty and litigation costs we will not undo that effort.
gamc suggests an alternative route to the bankruptcy judge outcome.section b is itself subject to exceptions set forth in section c.in particular,section c excludes an otherwise avoidable transfer 
to the extent that such transfer was 
a intended by the debtor and the creditor to or for whose benefit such transfer was made to be a contemporaneous exchange for new value given to the debtor and 
b in fact a substantially contemporaneous exchange.
the first of these two requirements is arguably satisfied.the transfer being grant of a mortgage to intended to be a contemporaneous exchange for new value given to the debtor,namely,the loan to lazarus from gamc used to pay off lazarus debt to washington mutual.the question,then,is whether under subsection b the exchange was in fact substantially contemporaneous.
because of the failure to perfect within days,we must under section e b treat the property transfer as occurring on recordation on july,because the debt arose on june when the note was signed or july when the funds were disbursed it is antecedent but by only two or three weeks.gamc says that this is contemporaneous enough the trustee,that the period specified in section e should control.
gamc plight,although of its own making,invites some sympathy,especially because there probably was no prejudice to creditors.at first blush the phrasing of section c the contemporaneous as if it affords us flexibility.however,the seeming flexibility is deceptive.we conclude that to expand the limitation would defy the governing canon of construction and specifically undercut congress purpose.
section c was aimed,as its legislative history shows,at a generic problem those on the verge of bankruptcy still need to buy things,groceries or household items and the fact that checks are used with a brief gap between purchase and payment ought not render the payment avoidable as one made for an antecedent debt,at.
by contrast,section e limit is directed specifically to mortgages and applies even if the loan and mortgage are exchanged simultaneously.congress concern,therefore,was not with whether the exchange was simultaneous or nearly so,but with getting the mortgage recorded within a reasonably brief and predefined period.the aim was to combat secret liens and protect those who might lend in ignorance of the mortgage.
the house report on the amendment,which introduced the modern perfection requirement,explained a s to other creditors and the rest of the outer world,the transfer is not a complete transfer at all until recording this is the bottom principle of the right to legislate against secret liens,at.see generally morris,bankruptcy law reform preferences,secret liens and floating liens.
true,the later grace period was an arbitrary deadlines almost always can result in losing security even where no one was prejudiced.but such deadlines have the benefit of being specific and avoiding litigation about actual prejudice.this was the approach congress chose.to enlarge the deadline for secured interests is to undo congress choice.
the cases on this precise issue are few and are divided.one circuit has flatly rejected the attempt to use section c to extend the period,while another has allowed such an extension,supported by a summary affirmance in another circuit of such an extension by a bankruptcy appellate panel where the delay in perfection was satisfactorily explained but nothing in the latter two cases does anything to answer our concern that this is simply an end run around the limit and so a disregard of congress specific intent.
in statutory construction,the more specific treatment prevails over the general.united states lara,cir diaz cobb,d,lex specialis derogat lex generalis.no direct conflict is required the rationale against applying a general provision in this circumstance is to protect against undermin ing limitations created by a more specific provision.varity howe,d.
our case illustrates this warning.congress has been laboring for many years to devise and refine a specific,largely mechanical test to govern security interests in the context of antecedent debt.the contemporaneousness test was added late in the day to address a much broader generic exchange of goods for check or credit recording and other perfection devices do not exist.the test was assuredly not meant to override the specific requirement.
the judgment must be vacated and the case remanded for further proceedings.the parties apparently disagree about the consequences of triggering section b but those issues have not been briefed to this court and must be litigated at the trial level in the first instance each side will bear its own costs on this appeal.
it is so ordered.
gamc was represented in the papers by its agent,mortgage electronic registration systems,mers,but it simplifies the discussion to treat gamc as the affected party.
after the events in this case,the time period was extended by congress to days,but the amendment has no effect on this case.bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of,codified at e.
