this case concerns the relationship between the new jersey construction lien law and federal bankruptcy law.under new jersey law,if a supplier sells materials on credit to a construction contractor and the contractor incorporates those materials into property owned by a third party without paying the supplier,the supplier can file for a lien on the property in essence,the supplier can step into the shoes of the contractor and collect a debt owed to the contractor from the property owner in order to recoup what the contractor owes to the supplier.
the question this case presents is whether a supplier can file a construction lien under new jersey law when the contractor has filed a petition for bankruptcy,which automatically stays any act to create or perfect any lien against the contractor property.
the suppliers here argue that the construction liens did not attach to the contractor accounts receivable but attached to the interests of the owners of the properties thus,creating the liens was not an act against the property of the bankruptcy estate.on the other hand,the contractor contends that the creation of the liens was intended to collect the portion of the accounts receivable owed by the owners of the properties to the contractor so that the creation of the liens was an act against the property of the bankruptcy estate.
the district court set out in its opinion how,under new jersey law,the value of the liens depended on the amount that the contractor owed to the suppliers under their contracts and on the value of the contractor accounts receivable.the district court then affirmed the bankruptcy court conclusion that the accounts receivable were part of the bankruptcy estate because they complied with the definition of property of the estate under and because the ability of a supplier to create a construction lien depended on the existence of the bankrupt contractor accounts receivable for that reason,the bankruptcy court held that the automatic stay prevented filing the liens.the district court affirmed we agree and will also affirm.
background 
statutory background 
in order to understand the events in this case,some review of the new jersey construction lien law and of bankruptcy law is helpful.
new jersey construction lien law 
under new jersey law,in general,a ny contractor,subcontractor or supplier who provides work,services,material or equipment pursuant to a contract,shall be entitled to a lien for the value of the work or services performed,or materials or equipment furnished in accordance with the contract and based upon the contract price as relevant here,t he lien shall attach to the interest of the owner or unit owner of the real property development the lien itself is limited to the amount that the owner agreed in writing to pay,less payments made by or on behalf of that person in good faith prior to the filing of the lien.
in general,an owner discharges a lien by paying into a lien fund,from which claimants recover what they are owed a claimant is a person having the right to file a lien claim on real property pursuant to the construction lien law.the claimants themselves are split into different tiers.a first tier claimant is a claimant who is a contractor.a second tier claimant is a claimant who is,in relation to a contractor a subcontractor or a supplier.
numerous limitations on the lien fund and lien claims exist.as relevant here,the lien fund shall not exceed in the case of a first tier lien claimant or second tier lien claimant,the earned amount of the contract between the owner and the contractor minus any payments made prior to service of a copy of the lien claim in addition,generally,no lien fund exists,if,at the time of service of a copy of the lien claim,the owner or community association has fully paid the contractor for the work performed or for services,material or equipment provided.finally,each claimant claim is limited to the unpaid portion of the contract price of the claimant contract for the work,services,material or equipment provided.
in the allocation process,if there are both first and second tier claimants,the lien fund is allocated to first tier claimants in amounts equal to their valid claims.thereafter,f rom the allocation to each first tier lien claimant,amounts shall be allocated equal to the valid claims of second tier lien claimants whose claims derive from contracts with that first tier lien claimant.if money is left over in a first tier claimant allocation after the second tier claimants within that allocation are paid,then the first tier claimant receives the rest however,if there are only second tier claimants,the lien fund for second tier lien claimants shall be allocated in amounts equal to that second tier valid claims.in any event,if the total claims exceed the maximum liability of the owner or the maximum allocation to a tier,the allocations are reduced pro rata to the allowable maximum 
bankruptcy law 
a debtor in need of relief may file a voluntary bankruptcy petition,which commences a bankruptcy case the commencement of a bankruptcy case creates a bankruptcy estate that generally consists of all of the property of the debtor filing the petition also automatically stays,among other things,any act to create,perfect,or enforce any lien against property of the estate in general,we interpret the breadth of the stay broadly 
factual and procedural background 
cooper electrical supply and samson electrical supply,sold electrical materials to linear electric,which linear electric incorporated into several construction projects.as of july,the development owners had not fully paid linear electric for its work on these projects,and linear electric had not fully paid cooper and samson for their materials 
on july,linear electric filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code.two weeks later,on july,cooper and samson filed construction liens on the developments into which linear electric had incorporated the materials that it had purchased from cooper and samson.on july,linear electric filed a motion with the bankruptcy court to discharge the liens as violating the automatic stay that resulted from the bankruptcy petition.on july,after hearing argument,the bankruptcy court granted the motion.linear electric then collected the full amounts owed to it by the development owners.on august,the bankruptcy court held that the construction liens were void ab initio for violation of the automatic stay.linear electric has continued to operate as a.
cooper and samson appealed the orders of the bankruptcy court of july and august.the district court affirmed.cooper and samson then appealed to this court.
ii.discussion 
both parties raise procedural issues for the first time in this court.linear electric argues that the case is moot,and cooper and samson argue that the bankruptcy court could not constitutionally resolve the issue in this case in the first instance.we will address those issues before proceeding to the merits of this appeal.
when the bankruptcy court issued an order to discharge the construction liens,cooper and samson requested a stay but were not granted one.linear electric then collected full payment from the development owners.linear electric argues that,as a result,the value of the constructions liens is zero.hence,linear electric concludes that this case is moot and subject to dismissal.
linear electric is correct that we generally can not resolve a dispute once the dispute has become moot,even if mootness was not raised below as it was not here in general a case becomes moot when the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.here,cooper and samson would have no cognizable interest in the liens if no money could be collected through them.
furthermore,linear electric is correct that,under new jersey law,payments from the development owners to linear electric could potentially reduce or eliminate the value that could be collected under the constructions liens.however,such payments do not always do so,and they do not do so here.in general,the value of the lien,the lien fund,and any claimant claim are all determined at the time of filing the lien or service of a copy of the lien claim thus,payments from the development owners after the filing of the lien and the service of a copy of the lien claim do not reduce the value of the lien,the lien fund,or the lien claims.
here,linear electric was paid in full after the bankruptcy court decision,which came after filing and service occurred.thus,the payments to linear electric do not affect the amounts that cooper and samson would recover if the liens were proper.as we discuss supra,cooper and samson,as creditors of linear electric,may recover some amount in relation to the lien amounts under the approved plan of liquidation.moreover,in its order of august,the bankruptcy court,while discharging the liens,recognized that the filing of the liens shall be deemed to have occurred on the date of each such filing and treated as notices under b for the purposes of determining whether a such lien was timely filed under applicable state law and b any such supplier is entitled to the protections of b or other applicable law.as a result,cooper and samson still have an interest in the outcome of this bankruptcy proceeding.the case is not moot.
constitutionality 
cooper and samson argue that the bankruptcy court could not constitutionally enter an order invalidating the construction liens.their argument is based on the limitations imposed by article iii of the constitution.article iii vests t he judicial power of the united states in the judicial branch,the judges of which shall hold their offices during good behaviour,and shall,at stated times,receive for their services,a compensation,which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office.because of this clause,in general,congress may not withdraw from judicial cognizance any matter which,from its nature,is the subject of a suit at the common law,or in equity,or admiralty.hence,courts outside the scope of article iii that is,courts,such as bankruptcy courts,whose judges do not have the life tenure and salary protection guaranteed to article iii judges can not conclusively resolve certain state common law claims between private parties without the consent of both parties however,congress may assign cases involving public rights to non article iii courts public rights cases include cases in which the claim at issue derives from a federal regulatory scheme,or in which resolution of the claim by an expert government agency is deemed essential to a limited regulatory objective within the agency authority.
cooper and samson argue that the bankruptcy court here,as a non article iii court,could not resolve any claim regarding their construction liens,because cooper and samson describe the rights at issue with regard to the construction liens as private rights that are entrusted to article iii courts however,linear electric brought claims alleging violations of the automatic stay imposed by the filing of its bankruptcy.those claims arise under the federal bankruptcy laws as such,any rights at issue are rights created by congress,and such rights are public rights article iii does not prevent a non article iii court from resolving cases regarding public rights thus,the bankruptcy court could constitutionally determine whether the liens violated the automatic stay.
c.the construction lien and the automatic stay 
with regard to the ultimate question,whether the filing of the construction liens violated the automatic stay,we review de novo the legal conclusions of the bankruptcy court and the district court 
linear electric filed for bankruptcy on july,which stayed any act to create or perfect a lien on linear electric property on july,cooper and samson filed their construction liens an act to perfect the liens that,before then,were inchoate merely.the question we decide here is whether filing those liens violated the automatic stay.we hold that it did.as we will explain,the lien claim payment process allows cooper and samson to collect their recovery by subtracting it from linear electric accounts receivable which are due for the value of the materials provided under the contracts.thus,cooper and samson lien was against linear electric property.this analysis is consistent with the reasoning in numerous prior cases,in this court and elsewhere,as well as with the purpose of the automatic stay.cooper and samson arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive.
the lien claim payment process and linear electric accounts receivable 
the lien claim payment process makes clear that cooper and samson liens were against linear electric property specifically,its accounts receivable.under new jersey law,if linear electric did not file its own lien claims alongside cooper and samson the lien allocation would be as follows.cooper and samson would be second tier claimants,and the lien fund would be allocated in amounts equal to their valid claims thus,cooper and samson would be fully paid,and the amount that linear electric is owed by the development owners would be reduced accordingly that is,on its balance sheet,linear electric accounts receivable which are an asset of linear electric would be reduced by the amount paid to cooper and samson.in effect,the lien claim payment process would transfer a portion of an asset of linear electric to cooper and samson.where,as here,a lien will be paid by transferring part or all of an asset from the bankruptcy estate to the lienholder,the lien is against the property of the bankruptcy estate.thus,cooper and samson filing to perfect their liens violated the automatic stay.
prior cases and statutory purpose 
both prior cases and the purpose of the automatic stay support the conclusion that we reach here.in in re yobe electric,the pertinent facts were analogous a subcontractor filed a mechanic lien,similar to the construction lien here,after a general contractor declared bankruptcy.however,in yobe,the subcontractor filed the lien under pennsylvania law,under which the date of filing the mechanic lien related back to the date of visible commencement upon the ground of the work of erecting or constructing the improvement.hence,the lien related back to a time before the petition and fell within an exception to the automatic stay 
the bankruptcy court in yobe,in analysis that we approved distinguished two new jersey cases in which filing a mechanic lien did violate the stay new jersey mechanic liens were effective as of filing,and no relation back applied,so the liens in those two cases were liens and violated the stay the bankruptcy court distinguished those cases on the basis of the different state laws pennsylvania liens relate back,and new jersey liens do not.this distinction would have been unnecessary,however,if the liens were not against property of the bankruptcy estate,because liens that are not against property of the bankruptcy estate are not subject to the automatic stay.if the liens were not against property of the bankruptcy estate,the new jersey cases would have been wrong,not merely distinguishable,and the entire discussion of relation back would have been irrelevant.
thus,yobe supports the conclusion that we draw here.its discussion implies that the liens were against the property of the bankruptcy estate,and it suggests that construction or mechanic liens that do not fall within an exception to the automatic stay by,for example,relating back to a time as the liens here do not violate the automatic stay 
also supporting our conclusion are numerous cases from other courts that have considered enforcement rather than creation or perfection of mechanic liens in similar factual circumstances.in all of these cases,courts have either held or assumed that the liens are against the bankruptcy estate property interests we agree the liens here were against linear electric interests in property.
finally,the purpose of the automatic stay supports our conclusion.in a chapter bankruptcy such as linear electric,a debtor proposes a plan of repayment which divides claims against the debtor into separate classes and specifies the treatment each class will receive.a plan typically specifies that at least some creditors will receive less than
