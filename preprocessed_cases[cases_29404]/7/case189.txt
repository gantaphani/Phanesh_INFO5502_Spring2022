this case involves competing claims of the springfield,massachusetts public schools and the creditors of lan tamers,a bankrupt company,to a dollars.the case arises from the intersection of the federal bankruptcy code and the federal program,created by the telecommunications act of to encourage public schools to connect to the internet.the program subsidizes these internet connections with funds extracted from the telecommunications industry and administered by a private corporation,the universal service administrative company usac.the schools contract with service providers to do the connection work.usac,through the universal service fund usf,either pays the subsidy to the service provider directly if the approved schools have not already paid in full or reimburses the schools for part of the cost if the projects have been approved and the schools have paid the service provider for the work.in the latter case,usac actually makes its payment to the service provider,who in turn must pass the funds through to the school.
the issue here is whether reimbursement monies,presently held by usac,are part of the estate of lan tamers,the bankrupt service provider.when lan tamers filed for bankruptcy,springfield had already paid it in full for installation and maintenance of internet networks at various schools.usac had already approved funding for the projects.the bankruptcy court and district court both held that these funds belong to springfield and are not the property of the estate.we affirm.
the facts about the structure of the program and the events are undisputed.
one of the goals of the telecommunications act was to encourage universal telecommunications service.universal service includes advanced telecommunications and information services,particularly internet access,for schools as well as for libraries and rural health care providers.see b,h.the internet highway for these schools is paved with mandated contributions from the telecommunications industries the usf coffers are filled by interstate telecommunications providers who pay mandatory charges,which they typically pass on to consumers in their bills.see id.d.federal regulations give usac the responsibility to administer the usf,collect the charges,and disburse its funds,all under the direction of the federal communications commission fcc.see.the usf monies are not appropriated federal funds nonetheless,they exist by reason of a federal mandate.the funds are not distributed by a federal agency but by usac,a private nonprofit corporation,subject to regulation.see generally.office of pub.util.counsel fcc,cir describing usf provisions of telecom act and subsequent regulations frieden,universal service,harv.tech,same.
the program implements the telecom act mandate of usf support for schools.see b.in the past few years,usac has disbursed between billion and billion annually in funding for schools and libraries.to receive funds,a school enters directly into a contract with a service provider to supply eligible telecommunications services.see c.the service provider must be registered with usac.see usac service provider manual,ch,available at last visited may.a school must complete an application process with multiple steps to have support approved.the amount of funding a school receives from the usf depends on the area poverty level,and ranges from to of the total cost of eligible projects.see b.springfield,one of the state most economically disadvantaged school districts,generally receives near the maximum percentage.
most often,after approval,usac and a school simply disburse their respective shares of the cost directly to the service provider.sometimes,however,schools elect an alternative payment method,referred to as billed entity applicant reimbursement bear,especially if they want a project completed quickly.springfield chose the bear option for the two contracts at issue here.under the bear method,a school the billed entity applicant pays the full cost to a service provider up front,receives from usac a funding commitment letter for the program share of the cost,and then submits a form to usac to receive reimbursement.
usac makes its payments from the usf in the form of either a check or,if the service provider so chooses and owes charges to the usf,a credit against those charges.see h b i ii.usac says that it lacks the authority to pay a school directly,because the telecom act and its regulations allow payments from the usf only to service providers.see e o nly an eligible telecommunications carrier shall be eligible to receive specific federal universal service support id.h b authorizing payments for telecommunications carriers.thus the service provider,who has already been paid,must receive the funds under the bear method and pass them through to the school.as part of the bear application,an authorized representative of the service provider is required to sign an acknowledgment that 
t he service provider must remit the discount amount authorized by usac to the billed entity applicant who prepared and submitted this form as soon as possible after usac notification to the service provider of the amount of the approved discounts but in no event later than calendar days after the receipt of the reimbursement payment 
the service provider must remit payment of the approved discount amount to the billed entity applicant prior to tendering or making use of the payment issued by usac to the service provider 
usac handbook for service providers is even more explicit the service provider functions merely as a vehicle to deliver the reimbursement back to the applicant.failure to provide the reimbursement in a timely fashion may result in the service provider facing enforcement action.usac service provider manual,supra,ch.springfield says it normally received reimbursements within a few days after usac paid them to the service provider.
lan tamers completed a number of projects for springfield,two of which are pertinent.in,lan tamers and springfield entered into a contract for lan tamers to install a data network at central high school.in,they entered into a separate contract for lan tamers to provide network maintenance services at four springfield schools for.lan tamers completed both jobs satisfactorily.springfield paid in full for the central high school project by january,and for the maintenance contract by january.
usac initially found the central high school project ineligible for funding,but springfield appealed this decision to the fcc and prevailed in march.by early,the contracts were fully performed by both parties and springfield had received funding commitment letters from usac stating that the program would reimburse of each contract cost.these two reimbursements total.springfield submitted the required bear paperwork to usac on april.on each form,lan tamers signed the acknowledgment quoted above.
a month later,on may,lan tamers filed a voluntary chapter bankruptcy petition.upon learning of this filing,usac withheld payment of the reimbursements,which were to have been made to lan tamers by check.at proceedings brought by creditors,lan tamers mentioned the reimbursements and said the monies were not its property and that it acted merely as a.the creditors claimed the proceeds.the city of springfield appeared and asserted the reimbursements were its property.the bankruptcy court opined that springfield claim was really a claim to title and to recover an asset and so it should be asserted in an adversary proceeding.see fed.
on june,springfield filed an adversary proceeding laying claim to the reimbursements.the suit named as defendants lan tamers,its principal creditors,and usac.one creditor,the bank of western massachusetts,counterclaimed,arguing that its secured interest in all receivables of lan tamers extended to the reimbursements.the official unsecured creditors committee also argued against springfield position and was deemed a party to the proceeding.lan tamers supported springfield claim.usac also argued that the reimbursements belonged to springfield rather than lan tamers,but differed as to exactly what power the bankruptcy court had over usac to order it to take action.presumably,with the blessing of the bankruptcy court determination that the funds belong to springfield,usac intends to make a check payable to lan tamers for the funds to be paid out to springfield the bankruptcy court took testimony in the adversary proceeding on june,and heard oral argument on june.it also received and briefing from the parties.
the bankruptcy court issued a comprehensive written decision in the adversary proceeding on august.city of springfield lan tamers,in re lan tamers.it determined that the reimbursements were not the property of the estate,but were held by lan tamers in either a resulting trust or a constructive trust for the benefit of springfield.id.at.the district court affirmed this decision in a order on september.
in october,the bankruptcy court converted lan tamers petition from chapter to chapter and appointed david ostrander as trustee of the bankruptcy estate.the trustee replaced the creditors committee as the appellant before this court.he appeals the exclusion of the reimbursements from the property of the estate.
the only issue here,whether the reimbursements are the property of the estate,is purely one of law.normally,such issues are reviewed de novo.see lentz spadoni in re spadoni,cir adams coveney,cir.springfield argues for a more deferential standard,citing a case concerning a bankruptcy court award of fees,prebor collins in re i do trust,cir per curiam.that case is inapposite,because it invoked discretionary and judgments made by the bankruptcy judge.see casco bank,dn assocs.in re dn assocs,cir.here,there is plenary review of an unalloyed legal question.we have jurisdiction over the appeal because the ruling is a final disposition of springfield adversary action.
section of the bankruptcy code defines the property of the estate.see.the statutory language evinces congressional intent to include a broad range of property.see united states whiting pools,d.it begins,in a,by including all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property.a.the remainder of,however,enumerates statutory exclusions from this broad definition.property covered by these provisions is excluded from the estate,rather than being exempted under other portions of the code.this is an important distinction.see traina sewell in re sewell,cir differentiating exclusions from exemptions ostrander lalchandani in re lalchandani,cir p roperty must first be property of the estate before it can be exempted.
two exclusions are arguably relevant here.one such exclusion,c,removes inalienable interests in trusts,typically spendthrift trusts or pension plans,from the estate.the bankruptcy court rested its holding on another basis for exclusion,which states 
property in which the debtor holds,as of the commencement of the case,only legal title and not an equitable interest becomes property of the estate only to the extent of the debtor legal title to such property,but not to the extent of any equitable interest in such property that the debtor does not hold.
the trustee argues that the reimbursements are accounts receivable of lan tamers,covered by the broad definition of the property of the estate,and that springfield is an ordinary unsecured creditor of lan tamers,entitled only to a pro rata distribution for its claim on an unpaid contractual debt.springfield,pointing to the bankruptcy court decision and the language of the d exclusion,responds that lan tamers never had any equitable interest in the reimbursements and was simply a conduit for them.there is no claim that springfield did not meet all the requirements to get the funding usac,in whose coffers the funds now reside,argues that the money should go to springfield.buchanan alexander,how.navy purser argues that seamen wages can not be attached by their creditors.
the plain text of d excludes property from the estate where the bankrupt entity is only a delivery vehicle and lacks any equitable interest in the property it delivers.identical language found in both the house and senate reports that accompanied passage of the bankruptcy code strongly reinforces this plain reading.see united states yellin in re weinstein,cir further supporting interpretation of bankruptcy code through legislative history.while noting that the overall scope of is broad,the reports continue 
situations occasionally arise where property ostensibly belonging to the debtor will actually not be property of the debtor,but will be held in trust for another.for example,if the debtor has incurred medical bills that were covered by insurance,and the insurance company had sent payment of the bills to the debtor before the debtor had paid the bill for which the payment was reimbursement,the payment would actually be held in a constructive trust for the person to whom the bill was owed.
at,reprinted in,at,reprinted in.in this congressional hypothetical,property is excluded from the estate where the debtor merely receives property in order to deliver it to its intended recipient without any control or ownership over it.
the task,then,is to characterize the reimbursements properly.to determine the nature of lan tamers interest,we look to the nature of the federal program from which that interest arises.at least two circuits have faced analogous problems under d.in one of these cases,the seventh circuit aptly framed the issue 
the answer depends on the terms under which the grants were made.did they constitute the debtor a trustee,custodian,or other intermediary,who lacks beneficial title and is merely an agent for the disbursal of funds belonging to another if so,the funds were not assets of the bankruptcy estate.or were the grants more like payment under a contract 
in re county cmty.action agency,cir posner,citations omitted.involved efforts by a federal agency to claim the unexpended balance of federal grant funds and property bought with grant funds from the estate of a bankrupt private nonprofit community service agency,and thus to prevent distribution of this property to creditors.the court looked at the nature of the federal government interest in the property,expressed through the regulations and the nature of the relationship.id.at.expressly noted that this federal interest does not preempt the recipient of federal money can declare it may affect the issue of who owns the property.id.at.
the third circuit,in deciding in re columbia gas systems,cir,held that refunds created and mandated pursuant to federal law by a federal agency,the federal energy regulatory commission ferc,and held by a bankrupt natural gas pipeline company,were not the property of the estate under d.id.at debtor acts as a receiving and transmitting agent,or a conduit,for money upstream suppliers owe to overcharged consumers quotation omitted.as such,the funds could not be reached by creditors of the bankrupt entity.analyzing the problem as one of federal law,columbia gas held that the bankruptcy court should give permission to the debtor to pay refunds that it had collected from upstream suppliers to the appropriate customers.id.at.using trust and beneficiary concepts as a matter of federal common law,the court considered the facts that the refunds were created by order of a federal agency,private parties could not alter the refund orders,the refunds implemented a central objective of the federal legislation,and the refunds should not be subject to the inconsistent results that the vagaries of state law would impose.id.at.columbia gas likewise excluded surcharges the debtor had collected from customers to fund industry research under ferc direction.id.at see also westmoreland human opportunities,walsh,cir rights to debtor grantee continuing contract relationship with government are not property of the estate in re united milk prods.funds collected by debtor under federal milk marketing orders,and owed to milk producers,are not property of the estate in case yonkers bd.of educ.richmond children,funds from state education department paid to debtor but designated as payment for school district are not property of the estate.
these cases share several common modes of analysis which we apply here.first,we look to the role that the debtor was
