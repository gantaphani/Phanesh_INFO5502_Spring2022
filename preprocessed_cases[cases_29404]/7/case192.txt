this case raises questions about the proper application of,which prohibits discharge in bankruptcy cases involving a fraudulent transfer of assets.aaron watman filed a chapter bankruptcy petition on march.lawrence groman initiated an adversary proceeding objecting to watman discharge under a and a.after a trial,the bankruptcy court entered judgment in favor of watman,and the bankruptcy appellate panel bap affirmed that judgment.groman now appeals.we vacate and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
except where otherwise specified,the following facts do not appear to be in dispute.watman,a dentist,joined childrens dental associates of lowell childrens dental in april.at that time,groman,also a dentist,was the sole shareholder,officer,and director of childrens dental.the parties agreed that watman would be given the opportunity to purchase fifty percent of the practice at the end of one year if the two men worked well together.consistent with that plan,at the end of his first year with childrens dental,watman entered into an agreement to pay groman on a monthly basis for ten years in exchange for a fifty percent ownership stake in the practice.in,watman agreed to purchase the other fifty percent of the practice from groman,and the payment period was extended an additional ten years to cover the other half of the purchase price.watman made the monthly payments to groman until september of,at which time watman claimed to be having difficulties in making the payments.in response,groman agreed to reduce the monthly payments from to.
groman testified at trial that watman made only two of the reduced monthly payments.in april,groman filed suit against watman and childrens dental as joint obligors for the remaining balance owed him.on december,groman obtained a judgment against watman and childrens dental in the amount of in middlesex superior court.neither watman nor childrens dental appealed that judgment.
in or about march of,groman filed a complaint to appoint a receiver for childrens dental.a hearing on the appointment of a receiver was scheduled for march,but was continued by agreement of counsel to march.
on march,watman wrote checks from the childrens dental checking account,totaling.he recorded these transactions in childrens dental books.of that total,went to prepayments of childrens dental anticipated expenses for the month of april,including office rent,equipment rent,health insurance,and maintenance.although payroll was typically paid out every two weeks,watman caused payroll withdrawals to be made from childrens dental bank account on march,and march,the day after the original date of the receivership hearing.on march,on the advice of counsel,watman sent a letter of resignation to michael dana rosen,counsel for childrens dental,terminating his employment immediately.on march,watman filed his chapter bankruptcy petition.on march,childrens dental filed its chapter petition at the time that these petitions were filed,watman was the sole officer and director of childrens dental.at the time of filing,childrens dental had cash in bank accounts in the amount of approximately and accounts receivable of about.these assets were disclosed in the bankruptcy schedules and turned over to the bankruptcy trustee.on or about march,watman informed lowell doctors park from whom childrens dental was renting its office space,that childrens dental would be terminating its occupancy of the premises.
from march,through march,watman operated a dental practice under his own name at the office space that had been occupied by childrens dental at arcand drive,in lowell,massachusetts arcand drive location,using the same furniture and equipment that childrens dental had used.watman offered the employees of childrens dental positions in his practice on the same terms as childrens dental was employing them.then,on march,lowell dentistry for children,lowell dentistry was incorporated and began operations out of the same arcand drive location.the corporate documentation to form lowell dentistry had been prepared in january by the law firm of devine,millemet branch.childrens dental paid the cost of these services from a retainer that it had paid to that firm.watman became,and continues to be,the president,sole shareholder and director of lowell dentistry.most of childrens dental patients became patients of lowell dentistry when childrens dental ceased operating.
on august,groman filed a complaint,alleging,inter alia,that watman actions warranted a denial of his discharge pursuant to a and a.watman subsequently moved to dismiss groman complaint for failure to state a claim under rule of the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure and rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.that motion was granted by the bankruptcy court.on appeal,the bap reversed the bankruptcy court dismissal of the objections to discharge and remanded for a trial on the merits.after trial,the bankruptcy court entered judgment in favor of watman.on appeal,the bap affirmed the judgment of the bankruptcy court.this appeal ensued.
unlike most other federal cases,bankruptcy cases are not reviewed on appeal in the first instance by the court of appeals.rather,under,district courts and federal bankruptcy appellate panels possess authority to hear appeals from bankruptcy court decisions.section does preserve to the parties,however,an additional layer of review in the courts of appeals.id.whether the intermediate appellate body is the district court or the bap,our focus remains on the decision of the bankruptcy court.we examine that court findings of fact for clear error and afford de novo review to its conclusions of law.see martin bajgar in re bajgar,cir.since this is exactly the same regimen that the intermediate appellate tribunal must use,we exhibit no particular deference to the conclusions of that tribunal be it the district court or the bap.brandt repco printers lithographics,in re healthco,cir grella salem five cent sav.bank,cir.we accordingly direct our attention to the bankruptcy court decision.
a enumerates the circumstances which can preclude a chapter debtor receipt of a discharge in bankruptcy.in this case,groman invokes a a and a as a bar to watman discharge.section a provides that 
the court shall grant the debtor a discharge,unless the debtor,with intent to hinder,delay,or defraud a creditor or an officer of the estate charged with custody of property under this title,has transferred,removed,destroyed,mutilated,or concealed,or has permitted to be transferred,removed,destroyed,mutilated,or concealed a property of the debtor,within one year before the date of the filing of the petition or b property of the estate,after the date of the filing of the petition.
a.thus,in order for a debtor to be denied a discharge under a,an objector must show by a preponderance of the evidence that the debtor transferred,removed,destroyed,mutilated,or concealed his or her property or the property of the estate if the transfer occurs within one year of the petition filing date for prepetition transfers with intent to hinder,delay or defraud a creditor.depositors economic protection hayes in re hayes,cir.grounds for discharge are construed liberally in favor of the debtor.see commerce bank trust burgess in re burgess,cir.
section a applies to this case because of the terms of a,which prohibits a debtor from committing an act proscribed under a in connection with the bankruptcy case concerning an insider.a.where the debtor is an individual,the term insider is defined to include a corporation of which the debtor is a director,officer,or person in control.a iv.
under this theory,groman alleges that childrens dental is an insider of watman,and watman transferred,removed,destroyed,mutilated,or concealed assets of childrens dental in its bankruptcy case,warranting the denial of a discharge in watman individual bankruptcy case.in light of watman status as sole officer,shareholder,and director of childrens dental,childrens dental clearly qualifies as an insider of watman for purposes of a,and watman does not argue otherwise.rather,this case turns upon what,exactly,watman transferred out of childrens dental,and whether he acted with the intent that disqualifies him from the discharge of his substantial debt to groman.
in order to prevail under,groman had to convince the bankruptcy court that watman acted with the intent to hinder,delay,or defraud his creditors including groman from collecting on their debts.section requires a showing of actual intent,not constructive intent.see collier on bankruptcy a king ed citing cases.the determination of actual intent is a finding of fact.see in re burgess,at.often,the intent issue will turn on the credibility and demeanor of the debtor,and in such circumstances,we typically defer to the bankruptcy court conclusions.palmacci umpierrez,cir.in all events,we will affirm the bankruptcy court findings of fact unless they appear to be clearly is,unless we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.anderson city of bessemer city,d internal quotation marks omitted.of course,if we determine that a bankruptcy court findings are too indistinct,we may decline to proceed further and remand for more explicit findings.in re healthco,at.
we are guided in this inquiry by case law from this and other circuits addressing the question of intent.given the practical difficulty of mounting direct evidence of the debtor intent,few cases turn on such proof.instead,looking to the circumstances surrounding the transfer,courts have identified several objective indicia that,taken together,strongly indicate fraudulent intent.those indicia include insider relationships between the parties the retention of possession,benefit or use of the property in question the lack or inadequacy of consideration for the transfer the financial condition of the party sought to be charged both before and after the transaction at issue the existence or cumulative effect of the pattern or series of transactions or course of conduct after the incurring of debt,onset of financial difficulties,or pendency or threat of suits by creditors the general chronology of the events and transactions under inquiry see salomon kaiser in re kaiser,cir and an attempt by debtor to keep the transfer a secret annino,draper moore,lang in re lang,cir.max sugarman funeral home,investors,cir enumerating similar indicia in the context of fraudulent intent showing under a.the shifting of assets by the debtor to a corporation wholly controlled by him is another badge of fraud.kaiser,at.
watman claims that he formed lowell dentistry to preserve the assets of childrens dental,relying for that claim on testimony by counsel for childrens dental that lowell dentistry would turn over profits to childrens dental for payment of the debt to groman.however,that arrangement was never memorialized in writing,is not in any way referenced in any written memoranda,and was not reported in childrens dental bankruptcy schedules.the bankruptcy court does not mention any such arrangement in its decision.we discount this argument and turn to the evidence cited by the bankruptcy court 
in finding no intent to hinder,delay or defraud a creditor,the bankruptcy court focused primarily on the fact that watman did not conceal his actions,including the checks he wrote from childrens dental checkbook for prepayment of april expenses t here was no secretion of assets.there was no hiding of assets.everything was fully disclosed from the beginning the court also emphasized that watman had relied on the advice of counsel w ith respect to reliance on the advice of counsel,in a close case as this,and particularly where there no concealment,although reliance on counsel is not a safe harbor,it may,in some circumstances,negate some of the other inferences of intent.the court explained that since every chapter filing hinders or delays in many respects the collection efforts of creditors,the fact of hindering or delay is not a per se basis of denial of discharge.
groman attacks the bankruptcy court intent determination on the ground that it focused too narrowly on watman reliance on counsel and his lack of concealment and failed to address the other indicia of fraud established by the precedents.groman argues that fair consideration of these other indicia reveal watman fraudulent intent.for example,watman was the sole officer and director of childrens dental and caused childrens dental to transfer its assets first to himself and then to lowell dentistry,a corporation of which watman is the president,sole shareholder,and director.see kaiser,at citing t he shifting of assets by the debtor to a corporation wholly controlled by him as badge of fraud.groman further argues that the timing of the alleged transfers,on the eve of a receivership proceeding,reflect watman fraudulent intent.
moreover,groman emphasizes that neither watman nor lowell dentistry gave any consideration for childrens dental entire dental practice,including its office space,furniture,equipment,supplies patients and employees.in his view,the transfer of patient records,together with the office space,furniture and equipment,and the hiring of all the employees of childrens dental,shifted all the goodwill of childrens dental to lowell dentistry,stripped childrens dental of its aggregate value as a going concern,and eliminated its ability to generate income for the estate,leaving groman with an empty shell at childrens dental save approximately in cash and accounts receivables against which to pursue collection of his judgment 
there is considerable force to groman claim that there is no logical explanation for watman conduct here except an intent to delay,hinder,or defraud his creditors,particularly groman.we find no evidence of any consideration that passed between childrens dental and lowell dentistry.watman was present on all sides of the transaction.the timing of events,in light of the pendency of the receivership proceedings,is suspect.however,there can not be a meaningful analysis of the fraudulent transfer issue without a determination by the bankruptcy court of exactly what property was transferred between childrens dental and lowell dentistry.
therein lies the problem.the bankruptcy court never addressed that transfer question adequately.instead,its transfer analysis was essentially limited to the following statement 
there is no transfer here in the customary sense.possibly there was some transfer under the broad definition of transfer under section of the bankruptcy code,but i am not willing to and can not find constructive actual intent on top of a constructive transfer under section.and even though possession can be a transfer,it seems to me that the type of transfer,if,in fact,there was one,is relevant to determination or an inference of intent the transfers,if they did take place at all,were not of the formal legal title nature,and to the extent that patients files,records,et cetera,are property of the estate,which at least the defendant claims they not,and i heard no evidence to the contrary,the defendant claiming that they were property of the individual the extent that those are property of the estate,i find that they have been transferred,and they remain available to the trustee for liquidation.
without minimizing the difficulty of the transfer issue,we regretfully find the bankruptcy court analysis unsatisfactory in a number of ways first,we can not tell whether the bankruptcy court applied the correct definition of transfer in its analysis.as we have previously held,the definition of transfer under applies in the context of.see in re bajgar,at.under,transfer is defined as 
every mode,direct or indirect,absolute or conditional,voluntary or involuntary,of disposing of or parting with property or with an interest in property,including retention of title as a security interest and foreclosure of the debtor equity of redemption.
according to the legislative history of,
t he definition of transfer is as broad as possible.many of the potentially limiting words in current law are deleted,and the language is simplified.under this definition,any transfer of an interest in property is a transfer,including a transfer of possession,custody,or control even if there is no transfer of title,because p
