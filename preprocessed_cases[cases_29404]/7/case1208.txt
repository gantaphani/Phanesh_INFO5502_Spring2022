michael frierdich is a chapter debtor,which means,in simplest terms,that he does not have enough assets to pay off a staggering amount of debt.this case,between the bankruptcy trustee mottaz and frierdich wife oswald,turns on when frierdich transferred shares of stock or their proceeds,worth to oswald.the answer to that question affects whether mottaz can upset the transfer and obtain its proceeds for distribution to frierdich creditors.oswald,who would just as soon keep the,has already had two swings at this issue.she lost before the bankruptcy judge and the district judge.we will ring her up on strikes.
because this case arose on summary judgment,we state the facts in the light most favorable to oswald.we turn first to the events of early.at that time,frierdich was a director and the treasurer of columbia centre,a closely held company,and owned of its outstanding shares.paul frierdich his brother and joe koppeis held the remaining shares.paul and michael frierdich both submitted affidavits saying that columbia centre never issued stock certificates to its shareholders.a certificate certificate evidencing frierdich shares turned up but had never been signed.the stock record book was also lost.
meanwhile frierdich and oswald were pondering the business of marriage.in anticipation of their engagement,they decided to take stock of their respective financial situations.based on information that frierdich provided to oswald,they determined that the value of frierdich estate exceeded that of oswald.so they assented to an arrangement under which frierdich would transfer his columbia centre stock to oswald and she would waive any interest in frierdich estate.on january,frierdich and oswald were engaged.
the next day frierdich executed a stock power.it assigned to oswald his interest in the stock and gave the officers of columbia centre power of attorney to transfer the stock on the company books.on january frierdich sent the transfer document,along with transfer instructions,to paul frierdich.the transmittal letter read please transfer stock as of,to bev.this is part of the prenuptial agreement we have.call if any questions.on february paul frierdich sent a speed message reading 
mike and bev 
i received your stock transfer of all mike stock in columbia centre.shopping center corporation,and accordingly the transfer to bev oswald of his.we do not need anything else for the transfer.
oswald never received a stock certificate and no notation on the missing stock record book was ever made.
frierdich and oswald each signed a prenuptial waiver to any interest in the other estate on march.paragraph six of oswald waiver read 
it is the intent of the undersigned that her present and future interest in any assets of michael frierdich is specifically limited to those assets which michael frierdich shall have voluntarily transferred an interest to the undersigned and only then in circumstances wherein he has affirmatively taken action transferring an ownership interest to the undersigned.reference herein includes interest michael frierdich has previously and voluntarily,by execution of a stock transfer,assigned all his rights,title,and interest in and to his stock ownership in a columbia,illinois shopping center to beverly oswald.
frierdich and oswald were married days later.
in august or september of,koppeis and paul frierdich approached frierdich about having the corporation repurchase his shares in columbia centre.they offered him,a price that increased,based on financial appraisals,to.koppeis,who was columbia centre president and managing officer,was not aware of any transfer to oswald.
in september a sale agreement was forwarded to frierdich.it listed him as the seller.on a draft of the agreement frierdich crossed out his name,substituted bev oswald as the seller,and sent the documents back to paul frierdich with a transmittal letter reading i believe bev needs to sign this because of the transfer document i gave her several months ago.the money should go to her.the final agreement of sale,however,again listed frierdich as the seller.frierdich signed that agreement,warranting that he held title to the stock and that it was not subject to any agreement that would restrict its sale.koppeis and paul frierdich also signed the agreement.at closing,which apparently took place on september,columbia centre issued frierdich a check.he signed the receipt and deposited the check in oswald account after endorsing it for deposit.at that same time,frierdich resigned his positions with the company.
in a letter dated september,to union planters bank,with which oswald and frierdich son were trying to arrange a loan for a real estate purchase,frierdich stated 
i transferred some to beverly oswald as a gift to a spouse,there are no gift tax consequences.there is an unlimited marital deduction for gifts to a spouse,and as such,this is the net amount for her to utilize.i sold my stock in a shopping center for a sum in excess of that amount and was only required to pay capital gains tax on some.my interest in the shopping center was sold in.
involuntary bankruptcy proceedings commenced on february.frierdich schedules indicate that,as of the filing,he had debts of and assets of.twelve lawsuits were pending against frierdich,five of which had been pending prior to september.the claims on file in the bankruptcy proceeding reflect debts in excess of incurred prior to january,including federal taxes of approximately owing.frierdich was also the major shareholder and guarantor of many of the debts of south of the border,which had filed for bankruptcy apparently in july.
mottaz,the trustee,filed this adversary proceeding against oswald seeking to avoid frierdich transfer to her of the stock proceeds from the september,sale.the bankruptcy judge fines,finding no dispute that the relevant transfer occurred in september,and not january,entered summary judgment for mottaz in the amount of.he held,in the alternative,that even if the transfer occurred in january,it was voidable.oswald appealed and the district judge affirmed.
in a second appeal from a bankruptcy court decision,we apply the same standard of review as did the district court.in re,cir.because this case was decided on summary judgment,see,our review is de novo.
this case implicates two avoidance provisions of the federal bankruptcy code.title a a provides that a trustee may avoid a transfer by a debtor made within one year before the date of the filing of the bankruptcy petition if the debtor made such transfer with actual intent to hinder,delay,or defraud any entity to which the debtor was or became indebted.title b allows the trustee to commandeer the rights of an unsecured creditor who could have avoided the transfer under applicable law,in this case the illinois fraudulent transfer act.see.for our purposes the key difference between these two avoidance routes is that the illinois fraudulent transfer act does not contain a look back provision.thus if the transfer in the present case occurred in january of,it occurred more than one year before the february,bankruptcy filing and would fall outside of look back provision.mottaz would then be relegated to avoiding the transfer under.if,on the other hand,the transfer did not occur in january,but rather occurred when the proceeds of the stock sale were deposited in september,the transfer would fall within one year of the february bankruptcy filing and could be avoided,if there was actual intent to defraud,under a a.the burden of proving a fraudulent transfer under is on the trustee.collier on bankruptcy,ed.
so to the key issue we turn whether frierdich transferred his columbia centre stock to oswald in january of.under the bankruptcy code,
a transfer is made when such transfer is so perfected that a bona fide purchaser from the debtor against whom applicable law permits such transfer to be perfected can not acquire an interest in the property transferred that is superior to the interest in such property of the transferee.
d.this provision presumes a transfer,which the bankruptcy code defines as every mode,direct or indirect,absolute or conditional,voluntary or involuntary,of
