this case requires that we determine the relationship between c of the bankruptcy code and the illinois mortgage foreclosure law,see ilcs b.this issue has divided the bankruptcy and district courts sitting in illinois.in this case,the bankruptcy court and the district court determined that the right of an illinois debtor to cure a default expires upon completion of the foreclosure sale of the property and does not continue during the period between that sale and the judicial confirmation of that sale by the state court.we agree with that determination,and therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.
backgrounda.
the underlying facts are not disputed.on january,colon executed a note secured by a mortgage on her principal residence located in lincolnwood,illinois.on november,option one mortgage corporation option one,the holder of the note,filed a complaint in the circuit court of cook county to foreclose the mortgage.on may,a judgment for foreclosure and sale was entered in that foreclosure proceeding on january,the sheriff conducted a foreclosure sale of the residence.on january,prior to the judicial confirmation hearing mandated by the illinois mortgage foreclosure law,colon filed a voluntary petition under chapter of the bankruptcy code.she also filed a chapter plan,which provided for the cure of her default on the note and mortgage.on february,on the motion of option one,the bankruptcy court lifted the automatic stay to permit option one to proceed in the illinois foreclosure action.colon appealed this decision of the bankruptcy court to the district court that court upheld the decision of the bankruptcy court.colon then took this further appeal to this court.
in determining that the bankruptcy court had committed no error in lifting the automatic stay and in permitting the foreclosure hearing to proceed in the illinois court,the district court recognized that it had to determine whether illinois law allows a debtor to cure a default after the property is sold at a foreclosure sale.the court further recognized that,in deciding this matter,it had to determine the relationship between c of the bankruptcy code and the illinois mortgage foreclosure act,ilcs.section c of the bankruptcy code provides that a default with respect to,or that gave rise to,a lien on the debtor principal residence may be cured until such residence is sold at a foreclosure sale that is conducted in accordance with applicable nonbankruptcy law c.the illinois mortgage foreclosure act sets forth a process,culminating in a hearing after the property is purchased in the sheriff sale.more precisely,the illinois statute requires that,after the sheriff sale,there must be a hearing before the state court.that court must approve the sale unless it determines that the sale was flawed in one of four ways the notice given was not proper the sale terms were unconscionable the sale involved fraud or justice was not otherwise done.see ilcs b.if the court approves the sale,the purchaser is permitted to exchange the certificate of sale issued at the foreclosure sale for a deed that conveys title.
the district court concluded that,for purposes of bankruptcy,a debtor right to cure a default is extinguished after the property has been sold at a judicial sale,not when a sale is confirmed by the state court.the court concluded that 
although confirmation is not a mere formality in the state arena,its significance to federal concerns is too minimal to justify extending the period for cure to that point.for the purposes of c,the sale is conducted in accordance with applicable nonbankruptcy law once the highest bid is entered and accepted.any other result would allow a federal procedural mechanism to afford greater rights than would otherwise be available under state substantive law.

the district court further reasoned that congress clearly intended to extend the debtor right to cure to the outer limits allowed under state law but the intent could not have included a desire to permit the debtor,through creative invocation of bankruptcy protection,to do an around state law once all substantive events have come and gone.id.the district court accordingly determined that the bankruptcy court decision was not based on an erroneous legal conclusion and,therefore,the bankruptcy court had not abused its discretion in permitting the state confirmation hearing to proceed.id.
discussiona.
the parties agree that the district court correctly stated the standard of review.the bankruptcy court grant of relief from the automatic stay is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.see in re williams,cir however,a court necessarily abuses its discretion when its decision is based solely on an erroneous conclusion of law.see united air lines,int l ass of machinist aerospace workers,cir.when reviewing the bankruptcy judge conclusions of law,this court applies a de novo standard.see meyer rigdon,cir.
colon home was sold at a foreclosure sale before she filed her chapter reorganization plan and,in that plan,proposed to redeem the home that already had been sold at the foreclosure sale.however,at the time of the bankruptcy filing,the illinois state courts had not yet confirmed the sale of the property as required by the illinois mortgage foreclosure law.she therefore submits that the bankruptcy court should not have permitted the confirmation hearing on the judicial sale of her property once she filed her chapter plan.as the district court noted,this case turns on the relationship between c of the bankruptcy code and the illinois mortgage foreclosure law,see ilcs b.we must determine whether,under c of the united states bankruptcy code,a chapter plan may cure a default on a debtor principal residence when the petition and plan were filed after the residence was sold at a foreclosure sale,but prior to confirmation of the sale in accordance with the illinois mortgage foreclosure law.illinois bankruptcy and district courts have expressed disagreement on this issue 
in resolving this issue,we must begin,as we do with any issue of statutory construction,with the wording of the statute.see united states balint,cir.if the wording of the statute is clear,that is the end of the matter.see united states hayward,cir.section c of the bankruptcy code provides,a default with respect to a lien on the debtor principal residence may be cured until such residence is sold at a foreclosure sale that is conducted in accordance with applicable nonbankruptcy law.c emphasis supplied.the illinois code states in pertinent part 
t he court shall conduct a hearing to confirm the sale.unless the court finds that i a notice required in accordance with subsection c of section was not given,ii the terms of sale were unconscionable,iii the sale was conducted fraudulently or iv that justice was otherwise not done,the court shall then enter an order confirming the sale.
the parties dispute whether c reference to a foreclosure sale that is conducted in accordance with applicable nonbankruptcy law terminates the debtor right to cure the default at the close of the auction or whether that right continues until the state court confirms the sale.c emphasis supplied.
plain wording 
not surprisingly,each side submits that its view is supported by the plain language of c.option one notes that employs the word sale rather than completion of the sale,confirmation of the sale,or transfer of the deed.see appellee br.at.it further emphasizes that the same provision speaks in terms of the sale being conducted rather than completed.see also in re danaskos,distinguishing between conduct of sale itself and confirmation hearing.
other language of the provision must also be taken into account and arguably supports colon.the statutory provision refers to a sale conducted in accordance with applicable nonbankruptcy law.c.although this provision may be read as simply addressing the manner in which the sheriff sale is to be conducted,it also may be read as permitting state law to define the point at which the forfeiture sale ought to be considered complete.although the latter reading of the statute seems most plausible,we think t
