the trustee for the bankruptcy estate of senior cottages of america,llc,and senior cottages management,llc appeals from the district court order denying him leave to amend his complaint.the amended complaint alleges that the lawyers for senior cottages,namely richard morris,michael cohen,and the firm of morris,carlson,hoelscher,committed malpractice and aided and abetted the breach of fiduciary duty by murray klane,who was governor,manager,and majority interest owner of senior cottages.the complaint,as amended,alleges that the lawyers assisted klane in looting senior cottages assets.the district court held that the trustee lacked standing to bring the claim.moratzka senior cottages of america,wl,at.we reverse and remand.
the trustee first complaint was dismissed as to morris and the morris,carlson firm by the bankruptcy court on the ground that the trustee had alleged only injury to the creditors of senior cottages,not to senior cottages itself because there was no allegation that senior cottages had a value in excess of creditors claims against it.moratzka morris in re senior cottages of america,llc.the bankruptcy court added in a footnote that even if the trustee had alleged injury to senior cottages,the complaint might not have been adequate because the claims might be barred by the defense of in pari delicto id.at.
the trustee sought to amend the complaint.the proposed amended complaint alleged as follows.senior cottages,a limited liability company,was in the business of developing,building,and managing senior citizen housing projects,which qualified for low income housing tax credits.murray klane was one of the two sole governors of senior cottages and was also chief manager,in complete control of the daily operations of the company.as of april,klane owned a interest in senior cottages in,senior cottages was insolvent,in that it was not paying debts as they became due.the amended complaint alleges that because of its insolvency,senior cottages needed to sell its valuable assets the housing projects presumably,to an entity that could benefit from the tax credits 
rather than finding an arm length buyer,klane formed a new entity,millennium properties,llc,in august,and caused senior cottages to transfer all or substantially all of the assets of senior cottages to millennium,including eleven housing projects.in return for the assets,millennium assumed debt secured by the assets,but did not pay anything.in separate litigation brought by the minority of senior cottages,a minnesota state court found that the value of the consideration received by senior cottages was not reasonably equivalent to the value of the assets transferred to millennium and that the transfer was fraudulent.the amended complaint alleges that the value of the projects was at least million.additionally,klane directed cash payments to millennium which should have been made to senior cottages.
morris and his law firm were outside counsel to senior cottages and also represented klane.they advised senior cottages to transfer the assets to millennium and substantially assisted the transaction.the amended complaint alleges that morris knew that the transfer was for inadequate consideration,that klane was breaching his fiduciary duties to senior cottages in making the transfer,and that the transfer damaged senior cottages in the amount of at least million.
the amended complaint alleged counts against morris and his law firm for negligence and aiding and abetting klane breach of fiduciary duty.
the bankruptcy court denied the motion to amend the complaint on the ground of futility,reasoning that the in pari delicto defense would bar the complaint.the trustee appealed to the district court,which affirmed on a different theory 
t he court finds that trustee lacks standing to bring the legal malpractice and aiding and abetting claims against morris and his firm.as previously discussed,the eighth circuit has held that a trustee can only bring those claims that are the property of the estate.in re ozark rest.equip,cir.conversely,a trustee can not bring a claim on behalf of the creditors of a debtor corporation.
nowhere in the proposed amended complaint is there an allegation that debtor would have remained solvent absent the transfer.ultimately,trustee is unable to show that debtor would act as anything other than a conduit of recovery for creditors under the proposed amended complaint.

it is the duty of the trustee in bankruptcy to collect and reduce to money the property of the estate for which such trustee serves.the property of the estate includes all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.a.causes of action are interests in property and are therefore included in the estate it follows that the trustee has standing under to assert causes of action that belonged to the debtor at the time of filing bankruptcy.mixon anderson in re ozark rest.equip,cir.

whether a particular cause of action arising under state law belonged to the debtor in bankruptcy or to someone else is determined by state law.see ozark rest,at.it is generally recognized that a bankruptcy trustee has authority to bring an action for damages on behalf of a debtor corporation against corporate principals for alleged misconduct,mismanagement,or breach of fiduciary duty,because these claims could have been asserted by the debtor corporation,or by its stockholders in a derivative action.id.
a director is a fiduciary.so is a dominant or controlling stockholder or group of stockholders while normally that fiduciary obligation is enforceable directly by the corporation,or through a stockholder derivative action,it is,in the event of bankruptcy of the corporation,enforceable by the trustee.

if the corporation owned a cause of action against the principal who breached a duty,it follows that it also owns the cause of action for aiding and abetting the principal breach.thus,in seitz michel,a shareholder sued third persons for conspiring with a corporate officer to waste the corporation assets.the complaint was dismissed on the ground that the shareholder could not bring the action because it belonged to the corporation and had to be brought derivatively.
similarly,the estate owns a claim for malpractice against the debtor lawyers that accrued before the filing of the petition.appletree square i.hannan.in national city bank coopers lybrand,the minnesota court of appeals held that creditors lacked standing to bring a malpractice suit against a corporation accountants for negligence causing loss to the corporation instead,the malpractice claim belonged to the injured corporation itself 
the noteholders alleged injury exists only because gcc was injured,and the amount of their injury is wholly dependent on the diminution in the value of gcc assets.this is the essence of a derivative claim.
in contradiction to this reasoning and authority,in the second circuit,there is a special rule that a corporation does not have standing to bring a claim against outsiders for defrauding a corporation with the cooperation of an insider of the corporation.the rule arose in shearson lehman hutton,wagoner,cir.there,the sole shareholder,sole director and president of the corporation engaged in stock trades that allegedly dissipated the assets of the corporation.id.at.the corporation filed for bankruptcy,and the bankruptcy trustee initiated arbitration against the corporation stockbroker for fraud.id.the district court enjoined the trustee from proceeding with the arbitration,and the second circuit affirmed.rather than relying on the defense of in pari delicto or simply the absence of the element of reliance for the fraud claim,the second circuit analyzed the case as presenting a constitutional standing problem 
in our analysis of the question presented,the case or controversy requirement coincides with the scope of the powers the bankruptcy code gives a trustee,that is,if a trustee has no power to assert a claim because it is not one belonging to the bankrupt estate,then he also fails to meet the prudential limitation that the legal rights asserted must be his own.
id.at.the second circuit framed a broad standing rule holding,a claim against a third party for defrauding a corporation with the cooperation of management accrues to creditors,not to the guilty corporation.id.at.however,in addition to the rule just stated,wagoner also relied on the fact that the defendant broker owed no fiduciary duty to the corporation because the corporation trading accounts were.id.although wagoner has been followed in the second circuit,it has also been criticized for characterizing an in pari delicto defense as a standing issue.see jeffrey davis,ending the nonsense the in pari delicto doctrine has nothing to do with what is property of the bankruptcy estate,emory,john gregg,the doctrine of in pari delicto recent developments,norton annual survey of bankruptcy law part i dan schechter,trustee lacks standing to sue because corporate insiders prepetition behavior is imputed to corporation,comm.fin.newsl.in my opinion,the rule in wagoner is nonsensical t he injury forming the basis of the trustee complaint is to the corporation itself.gradually,the second circuit and the lower courts within that circuit have shifted from treating the question as one of standing to treating it as an affirmative defense.compare hirsch arthur andersen,cir,with official comm.of the unsecured creditors of color tile,coopers lybrand,llp,cir applying texas law,representatives of bankruptcy estate had standing to sue debtor accountants despite existence of in pari delicto defense,in re grumman olson,explaining differences between wagoner rule and in pari delicto defense,and bondi bank of america in re parmalat,d.
several other circuits have declined to conflate the constitutional standing doctrine with the in pari delicto defense.the third circuit explained an analysis of standing does not include an analysis of equitable defenses,such as in pari delicto.whether a party has standing to bring claims and whether a party claims are barred by an equitable defense are two separate questions,to be addressed on their own terms.official comm.of unsecured creditors lafferty,cir.accord official comm.of unsecured creditors edwards,cir holding that trustee had standing,but federal claim was barred by in pari delicto and state claim for aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty was not cognizable under georgia law,cert.denied,d baena kpmg,llp,cir trustee case barred by in pari delicto,but that doctrine has nothing to do with article iii requirements first union bank,cir corporation trustee had standing to sue bank for aiding and abetting embezzlement by corporate fiduciary city indep.sch.dist.wright in re educators group health trust,cir that the defendant may have a valid defense on the merits of a claim brought by the debtor goes to the resolution of the claim,and not to the ability of the debtor to assert the claim.see terlecky hurd in re dublin securities,cir considering in pari delicto defense and declining to consider standing argument see also charles alan wright et,federal practice and procedure supp.stating with regard to the standing argument rejected in lafferty the urge to cloak routine questions in article iii garb seems to be irresistible.
we agree with the first,third,fifth,and eleventh circuits that the collusion of corporate insiders with third parties to injure the corporation does not deprive the corporation of standing to sue the third parties,though it may well give rise to a defense that will be fatal to the action.standing is one aspect of the constitutional requirement that courts may only decide cases or controversies.novartis seeds,monsanto,cir.to have standing,a plaintiff must allege an injury that is fairly traceable to the defendant conduct,and the requested relief must be likely to redress the alleged injury.id.the existence of a defense to a cause of action does not deprive the plaintiff of standing,as the late judge richard arnold explained in novartis seeds 
monsanto contention,if upheld,establishes no more than a defense on the merits,and the distinction between such a defense and jurisdiction is a vital one.

because the bankruptcy trustee is empowered by law to assert causes of action belonging to the debtor at the time of filing,the question of standing here depends on whether senior cottages alleged that it suffered an injury traceable to actions of its lawyers which could be redressed by the requested award of damages.the amended complaint alleges that morris and the law firm participated in stripping senior cottages of its assets without adequate compensation.the state court decision incorporated by reference in the amended complaint stated that klane directed payments belonging to senior cottages to millennium,listing some in cash payments that were diverted.in addition to the diverted cash payments,klane transferred projects which carried with them the right to tax credits.even though senior cottages could not use the tax credits itself because of its impending bankruptcy,the trustee has alleged that the transferable tax credits,as well as development and management fees associated with the projects,made the
