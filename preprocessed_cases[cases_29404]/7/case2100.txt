introduction 
george and peggy heubel appeal from an order permitting a judgment creditor to execute against property held in their revocable trust.after filing this appeal,the heubels filed a petition in federal court seeking protection from creditors pursuant to chapter of the bankruptcy code.the heubels did not notify this court about their bankruptcy filing.respondent mary keitel,who is george heubel sister,did notify us about it,however.thereafter,we advised the heubels and their counsel of our intention to impose sanctions against them for filing a frivolous appeal and for failing to notify us about the filing and status of the bankruptcy case.the heubels responded that their bankruptcy case barred us from taking any action against them.thereafter,the heubels bankruptcy case was dismissed with prejudice.
we hold that the bankruptcy case did not preclude us from imposing sanctions on the heubels and their appellate counsel.we affirm the order permitting mary keitel to execute against property in the heubels revocable trust.we also find that the heubels appeal is frivolous and we impose sanctions on them and their counsel for filing a frivolous appeal and for their unreasonable infractions of the rules governing appeals.
ii.facts and procedural history 
mary keitel obtained a judgment for fraud and undue influence against her brother george heubel and george wife,peggy.a jury found that the heubels deprived keitel of her fair share of her mother estate.the issues presented on appeal require only a brief summary of the evidence supporting the jury verdict in the underlying action against the heubels.the heubels unduly influenced caroline heubel caroline,mary keitel and george heubel mother,by extracting from her various documents,including a power of attorney,which allowed them to accomplish transfers of realty,bank accounts,and other assets to their sole control.although caroline had made clear her desire that her estate be divided equally between her children upon her death,when caroline died,the heubels gave keitel a small sum and kept the bulk of caroline estate for themselves without ever filing a probate action.after keitel learned the heubels had removed virtually everything from caroline estate with inter vivos transfers,she brought the underlying action claiming she had been deprived of her rightful share of her mother estate by the heubels fraud and undue influence.
on june,keitel obtained a jury verdict against the heubels in the amount of.the verdict was based upon special findings of undue influence,fraud by intentional misrepresentation,fraud by concealment,and fraud by false promises.judgment was entered and filed on june.the heubels appealed that judgment and specifically challenged the sufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict.on february,we affirmed the judgment,which is now final.keitel heubel,nonpub.opn.
meanwhile,on june,the day before judgment was entered,the heubels executed and recorded four grant deeds.in each case,the heubels granted real property to mike lunardi,angela lunardi and sarah heubel as of the george william heubel and peggy anne heubel blind trust dated june.a declaration of trust executed by the heubels that same day described the george william heubel and peggy anne heubel blind trust as a revocable living trust.in the trust instrument,the heubels expressly reserved the right to revoke this trust at any time.the instrument also provided that,if the trust was revoked,ownership of the trust property reverted to the heubels.
when keitel attempted to levy and execute upon the heubels realty to satisfy her judgment,the heubels sent the sheriff of alameda county the sheriff copies of the grant deeds they executed on june.in a letter to the sheriff dated august,the heubels stated with this letter,we are providing you with copies of grant deeds showing how the subject properties are owned the properties described are in the possession and control of the trust as stated on each of the attached deeds.the heubels concluded their letter as follows again we are not the owners of record and were not at the time of levy.in consideration of the above,a legal sale of this property can not take place simply because we are not the owners of the properties referenced in the notice of levy.
thereafter,the sheriff refused to execute on the realty that the heubels transferred into their trust without a court order authorizing him to do so.keitel sought a court order clarifying that,under california law,the sheriff was authorized to pursue judgment execution on realty transferred into a revocable,inter vivos trust by a judgment debtor.the trial court issued the requested order on july,the july order.
in the july order,the court found that the george william heubel and peggy anne heubel blind trust dated june,is a trust for which the settlors retained the power to revoke the trust in whole within the meaning of probate code section and,accordingly,the trust property is subject to the claims of creditors of george william heubel and peggy anne heubel.thus,the court ordered a writ of execution may issue against the trustees of the george william heubel and peggy anne heubel blind trust dated june.
the heubels filed a notice of appeal from the july order on july.the appellants opening brief was filed on november.on december,the heubels filed a voluntary joint petition under chapter of the bankruptcy code.neither the heubels,their appellate counsel daniel ray bacon,nor their bankruptcy counsel,william marini,gave this court notice of the bankruptcy petition.we learned about the petition on february,when we received a letter from keitel counsel,brian dinday.according to his letter,it occurred to dinday at some point after all the briefing in this appeal was complete that nobody had informed this court about the heubels bankruptcy case.
on february,we ordered the parties to appear at a hearing before this court to address two issues whether the heubels bankruptcy petition stayed proceedings in this case and whether the heubels and their counsel should be sanctioned for failing to notify the court about the bankruptcy case.the parties addressed these issues both in writing and at a hearing before us on march.
on may,we notified the heubels and their appellate counsel,pursuant to rule e of the california rules of court,that we were considering imposing sanctions on them for filing a frivolous appeal and we gave them days to file a written response to our proposed course of action.we did not schedule an additional hearing on the issue of frivolous appeal sanctions for several reasons.first,the heubels originally waived oral argument notwithstanding the fact that keitel had filed a motion to impose sanctions against them for filing a frivolous appeal.second,at the march,hearing,this court expressly advised the heubels counsel,daniel bacon hereafter bacon,that we considered this appeal to be frivolous and invited him to address this issue.third,the heubels provided a written response to our may notice that we were considering imposing sanctions for filing a frivolous appeal but did not seek an additional hearing on this issue.in light of these facts,we concluded that scheduling an additional hearing would serve no useful purpose and would be inappropriate in light of the substantial time and expense already generated by these proceedings.
on may,this court filed an opinion in which we imposed sanctions against the heubels and bacon,for filing a frivolous appeal and for failing to notify the court about the filing and status of the heubels bankruptcy case.thereafter,bacon filed a motion to withdraw as counsel for the heubels.in it he asserted that the heubels refused to consent to his withdrawal notwithstanding the fact that irreconcilable differences and conflicts of interest precluded him from continuing to represent them.this court had not yet ruled on bacon motion to withdraw when our may,opinion became final.we notified the supreme court of this fact and requested that this case be transferred back to us.on july,the supreme court transferred this case back to us with directions to vacate our may,opinion and to reconsider this matter as we saw fit.
on july,the bankruptcy court granted a motion by keitel to dismiss the heubels bankruptcy case with prejudice and imposed sanctions against both the heubels and their bankruptcy attorney.the bankruptcy court also prohibited the heubels from filing a bankruptcy petition under any and all chapters of the bankruptcy code for the next days.
on july,we filed an order granting bacon motion to be relieved as counsel for the heubels.via the same order,we notified the heubels and bacon that we were considering imposing sanctions on them for filing a frivolous appeal,and gave them an opportunity to file written opposition.we held a hearing on that subject on september.
iii.discussion 
issues presented 
we are no longer required to consider the impact of the automatic stay resulting from the heubels bankruptcy case since that case has now been dismissed with prejudice.however,appellate courts have discretion to determine unnecessary issues of great importance to the parties which may serve to avoid future litigation when the issue presented is one of continuing public interest and is likely to recur.community redevelopment agency force electronics th,d see also filipino accountants state bd.of accountancy d.eisenberg,et,cal.practice guide civil appeals and writs the rutter group.
in the present case,before the heubels bankruptcy petition was dismissed we had already determined that the automatic bankruptcy stay does not extend to our regulatory power to impose sanctions for abuse of the appellate process.we exercise our discretion to address this matter and set forth our conclusions herein because this issue is an important one both to the general public and to these parties.by clarifying the scope and nature of our power to impose sanctions,we hope to deter both the heubels and other litigants from abusing the appellate process.
with the heubels bankruptcy case dismissed,we also reach the merits of this appeal.we affirm the july order and impose sanctions against the heubels and bacon for filing a frivolous appeal.we also find that sanctions should be imposed against the same individuals because of unreasonable infractions of the rules governing appeal.
b.the government regulatory exception to the automatic bankruptcy stay 
the first issue we address is whether the heubels insulated themselves from the sanctioning power of this court by filing their bankruptcy case.we conclude they did not.
section of the bankruptcy code states,in relevant part a except as provided in subsection b of this section,a petition filed under section,or of this title operates as a stay,applicable to all entities,of the commencement or continuation,including the issuance or employment of process,of a judicial,administrative,or other action or proceeding against the debtor that was or could have been commenced before the commencement of the case under this title,or to recover a claim against the debtor that arose before the commencement of the case under this title.
when a bankruptcy debtor is a party in an appeal,the court must decide whether the appeal is a commencement or continuation of an action or proceeding against the debtor.the majority of courts that have addressed the issue have concluded that the relevant inquiry is whether the original proceeding,the underlying action,was brought against the debtor.see parker bain cir,fn,and cases cited therein shah glendale federal bank th,fn,d.in other words,an appeal is not a commencement of an action and the fact that a debtor is the appellant is not determinative.if the original proceeding was brought against the debtor,an appeal in that proceeding is stayed even if the appeal is brought by the debtor unless some exception applies.parker,at,fn.shah,at,fn,d.this majority view was endorsed in shah,supra,th at pages,d.the shah court found that the automatic stay did not apply to an appeal commenced by a because that appeal was a continuation,within the meaning of section a,of an action brought by the debtor rather than against the debtor.id.at,d.
in the present case,the heubels appeal is a continuation of a judicial proceeding that was brought against the heubels to recover on a claim that arose prior to the commencement of the heubels bankruptcy case.thus,while the heubels bankruptcy case was pending,the automatic stay applied to this judicial proceeding e xcept as provided in subdivision b of section.a.subdivision b identifies proceedings that are excepted from the automatic stay.the exception relevant to this case provides that the filing of a petition does not operate as a stay under paragraph,or of subsection a of this section,of the commencement or continuation of an action or proceeding by a governmental unit to enforce such governmental unit police and regulatory power.b.this government regulatory exception to the automatic stay prevent s the bankruptcy court from becoming a haven for wrongdoers.in re berg cir,berg,quoting fischel i.
courts employ two tests to determine whether governmental action is exempted from the automatic stay by virtue of the government regulatory exception,the pecuniary purpose test and the public policy test.in re berg,supra,at.under the pecuniary purpose test,the court determines whether the government action relates primarily to the protection of the government pecuniary interest in the debtor property or to matters of public safety and welfare.if the government action is pursued solely to advance a pecuniary interest of the governmental unit,the stay will be imposed.the public policy test distinguishes between government actions that effectuate public policy and those that adjudicate private rights.citation.ibid.
applying these tests in the present case illustrates that the automatic stay does not preclude this court from imposing sanctions on a party his attorney for abusing the appellate process or otherwise violating the rules of this court.by exercising our authority to impose sanctions we are not pursuing the government pecuniary interests.rather we are performing an important regulatory function.furthermore,exercising our sanction powers effectuates public policy by protecting the public from abusive and obstructive litigation conduct.
our conclusion is supported by the only california case we have found which addresses this issue,papadakis zelis d.papadakis.in that case,an attorney named zelis was sued by former clients whom he had persuaded to invest in a limited partnership in which he was the general counsel.the litigation was settled pursuant to an agreement which required that zelis stipulate to a judgment against himself.after various failed attempts by zelis to undo his agreement,the trial court entered judgment pursuant to the parties stipulation.zelis appealed the judgment.this court issued an order to show cause stating that we were considering imposing sanctions against zelis for filing a frivolous appeal.id.at.zelis responded by notifying the court that he had filed a bankruptcy petition,which he claimed prevented us from imposing sanctions against him.ibid.in rejecting this argument,we reasoned that courts have inherent regulatory power to prevent abuses of the court system and that the automatic stay is not an escape mechanism from the enforcement of this important regulatory power.id.at.thus,we noted,the bankruptcy statute expressly excepts from the reach of the automatic stay an action or proceeding by a governmental unit to enforce such governmental unit police or regulatory power citation.ibid.we concluded that the imposition of sanctions by the courts of this state for attorneys frivolous or abusive litigation tactics fell within that statutory exception.ibid.
the abusive litigant in papadakis was an attorney.indeed,our holding was reinforced by the fact that courts have a legitimate regulatory interest in punishing the misconduct of professionals who are licensed by the state.papadakis,supra,d at.however,that fact was not essential to our analysis because our power to impose sanctions does not depend on a licensing relationship.a judicial proceeding to impose sanctions is a manifestation of our regulatory power to control proceedings before us which extends to any participant who engages in improper litigation conduct during those proceedings.a party,no less than his attorney,should not be permitted to escape the consequences of his or her abusive litigation tactics and thus can not negate our regulatory powers simply by filing a bankruptcy petition.thus,papadakis supports our conclusion in the present case that a court power to impose sanctions on participants in proceedings before it is not affected by the filing of a bankruptcy proceeding by one of those participants.
our conclusion is also supported by federal authority establishing that the automatic stay is not a safe harbor from sanctions imposed by federal courts,supra,berg,supra,alpern lieb cir.in,an attorney filed an individual petition for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code while a motion for rule sanctions,rule,was pending against him in a case in which he allegedly failed to conduct a reasonable inquiry before filing a federal court complaint on behalf of his client,supra,at.the court found that,while pecuniary interests were affected by the imposition of rule sanctions,such interests were those of the parties to the litigation rather than any governmental unit.the governmental interest was the nonpecuniary interest of the federal judiciary to keep the stream of federal litigation free from unnecessary and abusive legal obstructions.id.at.further,the court found that the imposition of sanctions under rule is a direct application of the district court regulatory powers,which serve to protect the general public from needless,harassing,and abusive litigation.id.at.therefore,the court held that proceedings to impose sanctions on authority of rule of the federal rules of civil procedure are not automatically stayed by the filing of a petition in bankruptcy,supra,at.
was expressly approved by the ninth circuit in berg,supra,at page.in that case,an attorney named berg represented a smith in a lawsuit against smith former employer and in a subsequent appeal.berg,supra,at.while smith appeal was pending,berg filed his own bankruptcy petition.thereafter,and without notice of the berg bankruptcy,the court of appeals affirmed the judgment against smith and imposed sanctions against berg for filing a frivolous appeal.the defendant then sought relief from the automatic stay in berg bankruptcy case in order to collect its sanctions award.the bankruptcy court ruled that the award of sanctions was not subject to the automatic stay at all.id.at.agreeing,the ninth circuit found it clear that the purpose of such sanctions is to effectuate public policy,not to protect private rights or the government interest in the sanctioned person property.id.at.thus,the berg court held that the government regulatory exemption exempts from the automatic stay an award of attorneys fees imposed under rule of the federal rules of appellate procedure as a sanction for unprofessional conduct in litigation.ibid.
this federal authority supports our conclusion even though we are a state court because the unavailability of the a stay as a safe harbor from sanctions is not limited to the federal forum.janis janis misc d,see also in re betts.in janis the supreme court of new york held that as a general proposition,sanctions imposed by a state court are excepted from the automatic stay created under a.janis,supra,at.the janis court used papadakis to support its conclusion.janis,at.it also relied on federal authority because federal and state court sanctions serve the same function and neither courts sanctioning authority should be delayed indefinitely by a debtor expedient of declaring bankruptcy.id.at,quoting in re betts,supra,at.
the foregoing authority supports our conclusion that the automatic stay that arose when the heubels filed their bankruptcy petition during the pendency of this appeal did not protect the heubels or their appellate attorney from the consequences of their improper actions in this court.our government regulatory power,which is expressly excepted from the reach of the automatic stay,includes the authority to impose sanctions in order to punish and deter abuses of the appellate process.
we impose monetary sanctions against the heubels and attorney bacon for two related reasons.first,this appeal is frivolous and there is overwhelming evidence it was filed for the purpose of delaying satisfaction of a valid judgment.second,appellants violation of a local rule of this court is additional strong evidence of an intent to abuse the legal process.
the appeal is frivolous 
keitel has filed a motion asking this court to impose sanctions on the heubels for filing a frivolous appeal.see cal.rules of court,rule a if the appeal is frivolous or taken solely for the purpose of delay the reviewing court may impose upon offending attorneys or parties such penalties,including the withholding or imposing of costs,as the circumstances of the case and the discouragement of like conduct in the future may require code civ,when it appears to the reviewing court that the appeal was frivolous or taken solely for delay,it may add to the costs on appeal such damages as may be just.
an appeal is frivolous and warrants the imposition of sanctions when it is prosecuted for an improper harass the respondent or delay the effect of an adverse when it indisputably has no any reasonable attorney would agree that the appeal is totally and completely without merit.citation.in re marriage of flaherty cal d,flaherty see also pierotti torian th,d.
in the present case,the lower court based its july order on probate code section,which provides if the settlor retains the power to revoke the trust in whole or in part,the trust property is subject to the claims of creditors of the settlor to the extent of the power of revocation during the lifetime of the settlor.this provision clearly and explicitly permitted keitel,as a judgment creditor,to reach real property held in the trust over which the heubels retained the power of revocation.
the heubels argue that probate code section does not apply in this case because they never created a valid trust against which keitel could enforce her judgment.this argument has no merit.the five elements required to create an express trust are a competent trustor,trust intent,trust property,trust purpose,and a beneficiary.estate of heggstad th,d.the revocable living trust document that appears in this appellate record meets all these required elements.the document states an intent to create a trust and it identifies the trustmakers,the property to be placed into the trust,the trust purpose,and the beneficiaries of the trust.
the heubels claim they did not create a valid trust because there was never any trust property.see,a trust is created only if there is trust property.the heubels maintain they transferred their property to the three individuals named in the grant deeds rather than to the trust.but the probate code expressly provides that a trust may be created by a transfer of property by the owner during the owner lifetime to another person as trustee,subd.b.here the evidence clearly shows that the heubels transferred their property into the revocable trust by executing and recording the grant deeds which conveyed the property to three individuals as of the george william heubel and peggy anne heubel blind trust.that transfer was reflected in the declaration of trust itself,which expressly identified the subject properties as assets of the trust and the individuals named in the deeds as trustees of the trust.
next,the heubels argue that,even if a trust was established,it became invalid after the three trustees resigned subsequent to the transfers of the heubels properties to them pursuant to the grant deeds we are not surprised that the heubels cite no authority to support this argument as none exists.the role of the trustee,while an important one,is not an essential element for the creation or operation of a trust because the court can always appoint another one.accordingly,the alleged resignations of the trustees did not render the trust invalid.
finally,the heubels contend the july order should be reversed because the
