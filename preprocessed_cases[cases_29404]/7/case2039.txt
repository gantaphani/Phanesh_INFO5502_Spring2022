background 
the pertinent facts are alleged in leider complaint.for purposes of this appeal,we assume the allegations in the complaint to be true and draw all reasonable inferences in leider favor.see roedler dep t of energy,cert.denied,d highland montgomery cent.sch.dist.united states.
in july of,milton righetti filed a petition under chapter of the bankruptcy code,see,in the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of california.complaint.in september of that year,his wife,hope righetti,also filed a chapter petition in the northern district.id.on september,their cases were consolidated.id.leider,who was an unsecured creditor of the righettis,filed a claim for in the proceedings.id.
in march of,the bankruptcy court entered a final decree and order closing the case.complaint.at that time,the funds on hand were distributed to the righettis creditors pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court.however,due to a change of address,leider did not receive his distributive share of from the proceeds of the righetti bankruptcy estate.leider alleges that he was unaware of the termination of the righetti bankruptcy proceedings or the distribution of the funds.complaint.
in a bankruptcy proceeding,after days have elapsed from the time funds are distributed to creditors,any checks to creditors that have not been cashed are canceled and the funds represented by the checks are paid into the bankruptcy court.a.all such funds received by the bankruptcy court are deposited with the treasurer of the united states or a designated depositary,in the name and to the credit of the court.after five years,any funds that are still unclaimed are deposited by the bankruptcy court in the united states treasury in the name and to the credit of the united states.thereafter,a creditor entitled to any of the funds may file a claim with the bankruptcy court,and if the claim is approved,the treasury department issues a check to the creditor in the principal amount of his or her distributive share.id.
in this case,after the period had passed,john kendall,the trustee in the righetti bankruptcy proceedings,transferred the funds that remained unclaimed,including those owed to leider,to the clerk of the bankruptcy court for deposit with the united states treasury pending creditors filing petitions claiming their distributive shares.complaint at.approximately two years later,after learning of the resolution of the righettis bankruptcy action,leider petitioned the bankruptcy court for the payment of his distributive share of the estate.in due course,he received from the court the sum of,without interest.id.
on september,leider filed a class action suit in the united states district court for the northern district of california against the united states,the treasury department,and former treasury secretary robert rubin,alleging,inter alia,that the government failure to pay interest on his distributive share of the unclaimed bankruptcy funds constituted a taking of property under the fifth amendment.
in due course,the defendants moved to dismiss leider complaint for lack of jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted,pursuant to rules b and b,respectively,of the federal rules of civil procedure.in an april,order,the district court denied the defendants motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.the court held that it had jurisdiction under the little tucker act,a,because leider,the only plaintiff in the as yet uncertified class,had filed a claim for interest on his distributive share of the bankruptcy proceeds that did not exceed.leider,slip.op.at 
at the same time,however,the district court ruled that leider had failed to state a viable takings claim under the fifth amendment.it therefore granted the motion to dismiss under rule b.the court determined that the statutes mandating the deposit of unclaimed bankruptcy funds into a treasury account expressly permitted creditors to request and receive their distributive shares at any time.accordingly,the court reasoned,the government merely possessed leider share,which,as a matter of law,did not constitute a taking without compensation in violation of the fifth amendment.leider,slip.op.at.the district court viewed the government possession of leider funds as resulting not from a compensable taking,but from leider own inaction.as for interest on the funds that the government had in its possession,the court declined to find that the united states committed an unconstitutional taking by failing to pay interest on unclaimed funds that it was obligated by statute to hold for plaintiff due to his own negligence.id.finally,while the district court noted that leider did not separately plead a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty in support of his claim that interest was taken from him,it ruled that such an alternative basis for recovery was without merit,slip.op.at.
leider appealed the dismissal to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit.that court sua sponte requested briefing on the question of whether it properly could assert jurisdiction over leider appeal in light of the supreme court decision in united states hohri,d and the congressional grant of jurisdiction to this court in a.thereafter,on november,the ninth circuit held that it lacked jurisdiction and ordered a transfer of leider appeal to this court.

dismissal for failure to state a claim under rule b is proper only when a plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.conley gibson,d.as indicated above,in reviewing the grant of a rule b motion,we assume all factual allegations in the complaint to be true and draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff favor.whether the district court properly dismissed leider complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted is a question of law,which we review de novo.boyle united states.
the fifth amendment provides,in pertinent part,as follows nor shall private property be taken for public use,without just compensation.const.amend.v,cl.in evaluating a takings claim,we first consider whether the plaintiff has identified a property interest cognizable under the fifth amendment.see m j coal united states.if the plaintiff satisfies the prerequisite of identifying a cognizable property interest,which we have labeled a bedrock requirement,wyatt united states,cert.denied,minerals int l,united states,d,we proceed to consider whether the governmental action at issue constituted a taking of that property interest.m j coal,at karuk tribe of cal.ammon.
