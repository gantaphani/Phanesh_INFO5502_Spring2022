the question presented in this bankruptcy appeal is whether an annuity purchased by a debtor couple the day before they sought bankruptcy relief is,under the facts here presented,exempt under texas law.ins.code ann,or because it was a premium payment made in fraud of a creditor.ins.code ann.according to the debtors repeated representations to the bankruptcy and district courts,this annuity was purchased not simply to maximize the debtors exemption claims but to manipulate an inheritance that the debtor andres alejandro soza soza may ultimately share with his siblings.because the debtors purpose in purchasing this annuity had nothing to do with the rehabilitative goal of texas exemption laws,they could not legitimately claim the exemption.accordingly,the judgment of the district court,reversing the bankruptcy court denial of exemption,must itself be reversed,and the case is remanded for further proceedings.
on october,soza and his wife,mary rachel buzo,transferred into a mutual of omaha annuity.the next day they filed a voluntary chapter bankruptcy petition joseph hill was appointed trustee of their bankruptcy estate.the debtors bankruptcy schedules listed just under in unsecured debt and in property.the debtors identified the annuity as an asset valued at,and they claimed an exemption pursuant to of the texas insurance code.
the trustee objected to the exemption because the statute does not apply to a premium payment made in fraud of a creditor.ins.code ann.relying on the debtors petition and schedules,the trustee argued that their conversion of property into an exempt annuity on the eve of bankruptcy amounted to constructive fraud detrimental to the creditors.in response,the debtors contended that the law permits them to maximize their exemptions,and there was no proof that they intended to defraud the creditors.
at the hearing on the trustee objection,the debtors asserted for the first time that the money with which they purchased the annuity had recently been inherited from soza father.their attorney represented to the court that the debtors used the inheritance to purchase the annuity for safekeeping until they could decide how the inheritance was to be distributed among soza and his siblings.the attorney said his clients feared that unless the inheritance was placed out of reach of the creditors by means of an annuity,the trustee would attempt to litigate the debtors share of ownership or would pursue soza siblings for the transfer of their shares.alternatively,counsel feared he would have to delay the bankruptcy filing by one year to avoid the fraudulent transfer provision of the bankruptcy code.a,amended by,stat,effective.
the bankruptcy court and counsel for the trustee were taken aback by these representations,which were contrary to the debtors sworn schedules identifying the annuity as their property.the court rejected the debtors untimely attempt to offer the will and soza testimony about it.nevertheless,all parties recognized a looming issue over the true ownership of the inheritance.the court proceeded,however,to adjudicate the objection without reference to the inheritance claim.the court held that of the texas insurance code,although somewhat ambiguous,proscribes constructive as well as actual fraud on creditors.it found,based on the pleadings and undisputed facts,that the debtors conversion of property into an exempt annuity on the eve of bankruptcy amounted to constructive fraud.the court denied the exemption.
the debtors appealed to the district court,reiterating their claim about the inheritance in their brief 
the check was received in august and would have been shared with soza eight siblings and the children of the deceased brother,but with the uncertainty of the october changes to the bankruptcy law,soza did not want to delay the bankruptcy a year to avoid the possibility of the trustee trying to undo payments to family members.
the district court upheld the bankruptcy court refusal to consider this as an untimely contention,but it reversed the bankruptcy court and approved the exemption under texas law.like the bankruptcy court,the district court found no explicit textual guide to whether the statute depends on actual or intended fraud of a creditor or whether something less than intent is sufficient to violate the provision.soza hill in re soza.the court reasoning proceeded in three steps.first,the court noted that the timing of the annuity purchase,standing alone,was not sufficient to prove actual intent to defraud creditors.second,the court analogized the constructive fraud interpretation of the statute with the texas uniform fraudulent transfer act tufta provisions that invalidate a debtor transfers made for less than reasonably equivalent value.see.bus.com.code ann.a.because the annuity here was purchased for full value,constructive fraud as defined in tufta could not exist.third,the court held that in the absence of a fiduciary duty relationship arising from other circumstances,the common law doctrine of constructive fraud does not apply to relations in texas.relying,finally,on the principle that texas interprets debtors exemptions broadly,the court concluded that even if constructive fraud is covered by,the trustee had not borne his burden of proof.
now finding themselves the appellees,the debtors no longer assert that the payment for the annuity sprang from an inheritance in which soza owns a potentially small share.instead,they vigorously defend the district court opinion and criticize the trustee for having failed to present evidence to support his attack on the exemption.the debtors do not,however,disavow their counsel representation to both lower courts that the annuity was purchased not to provide them a future stream of income,but to remove its corpus from the bankruptcy court in order to avoid the uncertainty of bankruptcy litigation involving them or soza family members.this clever strategy,taken together with other facts,provides a more complex backdrop for application of the texas annuity exemption laws than the simple eve of bankruptcy transfer on which the bankruptcy and district court opinions were predicated.although these circumstances might not sustain a finding of actual intent to defraud the debtors creditors,and the trustee did not so argue in the lower courts,they highlight the importance of determining whether the exception to annuity exemptions for a premium payment made in fraud of a creditor includes intentional fraud as well as something less than intentional fraud.
at first glance,what the legislature intended to describe as fraud of a creditor seems unclear in the context of life insurance policies and annuities obtained by debtors.there is no controlling texas case law to provide guidance read in context with other texas fraudulent transfer statutes,there is little doubt that must include intentional fraud as well as conduct less than intentional fraud.the texas legislature added the in fraud of a creditor exception to the texas insurance code exemption statute for life insurance and annuity benefits in.see act of june,ch.sess.law serv.recodified at.ins.code.ann.this was two years before the exemption was broadened to include annuity contracts purchased by an individual.see act of,ch.sess.law serv.recodified at.ins.code.ann.as of,at least three fraudulent conveyance provisions in state law required a showing of actual intent to defraud.one of these appears in the texas property code,which prohibits a debtor from converting personal property into exempt property with the intent to defraud,delay,or hinder a creditor.prop.code ann.a emphasis added since at least,the texas family code has provided that an agreement between spouses to partition marital property is void with respect to the rights of a creditor whose rights are intended to be defrauded by it.family code ann.a emphasis added.significantly,texas adopted the tufta in,and it states that a debtor transfer is fraudulent as to a creditor if made with actual intent to hinder,delay,or defraud any creditor of the debtor or if made for a lack of reasonably equivalent value under certain additional conditions.bus.comm.code ann.a emphasis added.under tufta,transfers made with either actual intent to defraud a creditor or something less than actual intent,transfers made without receiving a reasonably equivalent value are included as fraudulent transfers.
the language of these sister statutes indicates that the texas legislature clearly knew how to distinguish between provisions defining as fraudulent a transfer made with intent to defraud a creditor and provisions defining a lesser standard than intent to defraud.because.ins.code uses the general phrase in fraud of a creditor rather than specific language requiring intent to defraud we conclude that it encompasses both intentional fraud and conduct less than intentional fraud.the texas supreme court has endorsed this approach to interpretation in holding that i t is a rule of statutory construction that every word of a statute must be presumed to have been used for a purpose.likewise,we believe every word excluded from a statute must also be presumed to have been excluded for a purpose.laidlaw waste systems dallas,city of wilmer,internal quotations and citations omitted.
still,exactly what conduct less than intentional fraud amounts to fraud on creditors under is unclear.the parties and the courts below repeatedly describe this something less than intention standard as constructive fraud.this term is a practical shorthand,but,since it appears nowhere in the statutes,it lacks substantive content and is not susceptible to precise definition the tufta describes one species of constructive fraud in stating that transfers made without receiving a reasonably equivalent value are deemed in fraud of creditors.see also.bus.comm.code ann.a.section of the texas insurance code contains no such limitation,nor does reference tufta definition of constructive fraud.there is,therefore,no reason to conclude that the more general language of is limited by tufta definition of constructive fraud.in fact,it would be improper to construe by attributing a limitation that appears only in another statutory provision.the texas supreme court so held in laidlaw when the legislature employs a term in one section of a statute and excludes it in another section,the term should not be implied where excluded.at.
ultimately,texas courts will have to determine how much less than actual intent to defraud suffices to deny exemptions for insurance policies and annuities under.for present purposes,we glean some assistance from the list of eleven factors,commonly known as badges of fraud,that courts may consider in determining whether a debtor actually intended to defraud creditors under tufta it may appear contradictory to consider facts used to infer actual intent to defraud in order to determine constructive fraud.any contradiction,however,is illusory.factors relevant to determining actual intent to defraud,a higher culpability standard,should be equally probative where something less than actual intent will suffice.when analyzing facts under tufta,this court has noted that s ince direct proof of fraud often is not available,courts may rely on circumstantial evidence to establish the fraudulent intent.roland united states,cir.not all,or even a majority,of the badges of fraud must exist to find actual fraud.indeed,w hen several of these indicia of fraud are found,they can be a proper basis for an inference of fraud.roland,at.
like tufta,the bankruptcy code also unwinds transfers made with actual intent to hinder,delay or defraud creditors,a,and may deny discharge on similar grounds.a.in this connection,courts have identified various badges of fraud that tend to evidence a transfer made with intent to defraud under and 
the lack or inadequacy of consideration the family,friendship or close associate relationship between the parties the retention of possession,benefit or use of the property in question the financial condition of the party sought to be charged both before and after the transaction in question the existence or cumulative effect of the pattern or series of transactions or course of conduct after the incurring of debt,onset of financial difficulties,or pendency or threat of suits by creditors and the general chronology of events and transactions under inquiry.

taking all the surrounding circumstances in this case into consideration,several of the badges of fraud are evident here.we conclude that,even if actual intent to defraud was lacking,the debtors annuity purchase constituted a premium payment made in fraud of a creditor.ins.code.they purchased the annuity on the eve of bankruptcy.assuming the payment came from their property,the annuity was in an amount that would have covered all of the debtors listed debts,and the purchase deprived the creditors of all but in assets.
significantly,the debtors retained full control of the annuity can always be cashed out.and while this feature is true of all annuities,and thus would not ordinarily be proof of any fraud,here,the temporary and contingent nature of the purchase was conceded.the debtors claimed the annuity as their property on the bankruptcy schedules,yet their counsel assured both lower courts,to the contrary,that the payment was funded by an inheritance to which soza entitlement was uncertain.their counsel also represented to both lower courts that the annuity was purchased in order to place litigation over soza and his siblings property interests in the inheritance beyond the reach of the bankruptcy court 
in,texas law was modified for the first time to permit personal annuities to be shielded from the claims of creditors.texas cases have to date upheld annuities sharing the characteristics that they were not and they were intended to provide payments for the debtors and their families in the future.see in re foster,exempting annuity created to disburse state lottery winnings in re alexander,exempting annuity created to pay out structured tort settlement.not so here.the purpose of these debtors purchase was to remove a disputed inheritance from an inquiry,necessary to bankruptcy administration,that would have determined the debtors property rights in that inheritance.the annuity was a sham to stave off litigation,not a shield authorized by texas law to enable the debtor to gain a fresh start 
no doubt texas law encourages the broad construction of its exemption laws,especially those provisions that lack limitations based on fraud of creditors.see,ncnb.bank in re volpe,cir texas courts apply a liberal rule of construction to state exemption statutes.citing cases hickman hickman,o ur exemption statutes should be liberally construed in favor of express exemptions,and should never be restricted in their meaning and effect so as to minimize their operation upon the beneficent objects of the statutes.without doubt the exemption would generally be resolved in favor of the claimant.no doubt courts must recognize that some planning is permissible,and that the mere conversion of assets from exempt to property on the eve of bankruptcy does not by itself suffice to prove an intent to defraud creditors.first.sav,reed in re reed,cir the exemption provided by the instant texas statute,however,contains its own limitation designed to prevent fraud on creditors,and its standard is set at something less than intent to defraud.here,there is considerably more than mere timing to condemn the expedient use of an annuity to thwart the bankruptcy court from determining the extent of the debtors interest in property.
conclusion 
under texas insurance code,the annuity purchased by these debtors represented a payment made in fraud of a creditor,and the debtors could not claim an exemption for the annuity.on remand,however,the bankruptcy court will have to explore the extent to which soza has an ownership interest in the alleged inheritance.
reversed and remanded.
i concur in the result reached by the panel majority,but i write separately because,with respect,i disagree with part of its methodology for getting there.both the panel majority and i agree that applicability of section of the texas insurance code is not limited to instances of actual fraud,intentional fraud,principally because the words used in the texas and codes to limit their coverages to intentional fraud are absent from the insurance code it is at this point,however,that the method of statutory construction i would employ and the substantive content i would give to the insurance code in fraud of a creditor provision diverge from the panel majority method and content.
the panel majority relies on three state texas uniform fraudulent transfers act tufta the texas family code,and the texas property determine how the fraud of a creditor which we agree is embraced by the insurance code should be defined.but it is obvious to me that neither the texas property code nor the texas family code offers any guidance here because they address only actual,intentional,fraud and can therefore tell us nothing about the definitional elements of fraud for purposes of the insurance core issue in this case.
the only texas statute among the three relied on by the panel majority that addresses anything other than actual intentional fraud is tufta.therefore,of the statutes cited by the panel majority,only tufta is even potentially informative of the meaning of constructive or fraud of a creditor.yet tufta definition of fraudulent as to a creditor expressly recognizes only intentional fraud not applicable here and a transfer lacking reasonably equivalent value plus other factors the panel majority nevertheless purports to use tufta indicia of intent to cobble together a version of fraud while ignoring the definition of fraud expressly provided in transfer without reasonably equivalent value.either tufta should be used to inform the analysis,in which case we should accept its definition of fraud for purposes of the insurance code,or it should not be so used,in which case we would have no alternative but to resort to the common law.we can not do both because,logically,tufta can not simultaneously be both the panel majority starting point and the point at which the panel majority departs from tufta.yet the panel majority opinion schizophrenically uses tufta both ways at once.
the panel majority opinion tries to finesse this inconsistency by stating section of the texas insurance code contains no such limitation,nor does reference tufta definition of constructive fraud.but this defeats the purpose of turning to tufta for guidance in the first place.the panel majority uses tufta fraudulent as to a creditor to define in fraud of a creditor in the insurance code but the exclusive definition of a fraudulent transaction in tufta,is a transfer made without receiving reasonably equivalent value.so,unless the panel majority is willing simply to tufta genre into the insurance code,there is no nexus to be found between the two statutes.
in response to this objection,the panel majority pronounces the insurance code provision to be more general than tufta.to me,it borders on circularity to say simply that the insurance code provision is more general than tufta,so tufta does not restrict the insurance code.for the panel majority to use tufta to inform its analysis of the insurance code,there must be a substantial degree of not the two provisions.to baldly declare that such exists,and then inexplicably dismiss any differences that actually exist,begs the question totally.
as i understand the panel majority method of statutory interpretation,it proceeds thusly we do know what x means,so to assist our understanding we turn to y,which we assume is close to x y requires that either a or b be present we conclude,though,that x requires neither a nor b because x is not sufficiently close to can it really be maintained that y has been used to meaningfully define x in this way with x being the insurance code in fraud of a creditor,y being tufta,a being intentional fraud,and b being a transfer made without receipt of reasonably equivalent value,the panel majority is exposed as saying that we do know what in fraud of a creditor is,so we turn to tufta tufta requires either actual intent to defraud or engaging in a transfer without receipt of equivalent value ergo,absent actual intent,whatever else in fraud of a creditor might mean,it does not require a transfer without equivalent value.go figure 
again,i agree with the conclusion that soza premium was a payment made in fraud of a creditor.but i can only justify providing content to the insurance code fraud provision by giving fraud its common law meaning,not by torturing other incompatible statutes.sutherland says 
all legislation must be interpreted in the light of the common law and the scheme of jurisprudence existing at the time of its enactment.where there is a limitation by statute which is capable of more than one construction the statute must be given that construction which is consistent with common law.and where an operative word is not defined in a statute the common law meaning controls 
as there is reasonable doubt about what the texas legislature meant to include when it provided an exception for fraud of a creditor in the insurance the panel majority opinion already see the texas common law as the only defensible starting place for interpreting the statute at issue.
further,i do not believe that the phrase of a creditor creates a new term of art,but simply cabins the universe of frauds to which this exception to the insurance code exemption applies.i conclude,therefore,that the interpretation of the words and phrases in the common law should comport with the presumption that c meanings are assumed to apply even in statutes dealing with new and different subject matter in the absence of evidence to indicate a contrary meaning.
for openers,texas common law recognizes that there are two types of fraud actual and constructive.actual fraud,which is not at issue in this case,requires intentional breaches of duty that are designed to injure another or to obtain an undue and unconcientious sic advantage.constructive fraud being all varieties of actionable fraud and therefore clearly at issue here involves breaches that the law condemns as fraudulent merely because they tend to deceive others,violate confidences,or cause injury to public interest.
texas courts have recognized in a general sense that c onstructive fraud,as a concept,has fuzzier edges and is less susceptible of easy definition than actual fraud even though the contours of actual fraud have been neatly staked out,
no such case has done the same for constructive fraud.nor is such a case possible,because the whole need for a doctrine of constructive fraud rests on the lack of a common law tort to cover the conduct at hand.the best the texas s upreme c ourt has been able to do is remark that constructive fraud is the breach of some legal or equitable duty.
consistent with this definitional ambiguity,some texas case law appears to have read this formulation of constructive fraud to require a confidential or fiduciary relationship a review of the cases reveals that,consistent with the flexible nature of equity,texas has not construed constructive fraud so narrowly for example,although an intermediate texas appellate court in hubbard shankle noted in its constructive fraud inquiry that no fiduciary relationship existed,it also explicitly referenced the absence of an additional legal or equitable duty.the state appellate court in jean noted that a reasonable trier of fact could have concluded that there was no breach of fiduciary duty or conduct that was unfair to the community estate.
among the texas cases that i have examined shwiff priest comes closest to requiring a confidential or fiduciary relationship to support a finding of constructive fraud the shwiff opinion,however,contains no reasoning beyond a mere citation to a case dealing with the duties owed by the spouses to community property as support for its contention that a fiduciary duty is required and even this holding was not essential to the state court conclusion that there was no constructive fraud as the court also found that there had been no harm 
although a decision by an intermediate appellate state court is a datum for ascertaining state law which is not to be disregarded by a federal court,we are empowered to reach the conclusion that we believe the state highest court would reach if we are convinced by other persuasive data that the highest court of the state would decide otherwise.and,the clearest pronouncement on constructive fraud by the texas supreme court is not limited by the necessity of a fiduciary or confidential relationship as noted above,its other cases hint at the expansive nature of the concept.a survey of texas case law reveals that a fiduciary or confidential relationship is not a prerequisite for a finding of constructive fraud there need only be a violation of a legal or equitable duty,determined according to a flexible and approach.
klein sporting goods,is an excellent example of this flexible approach there,the owner of a gun store,the gun exchange,had pledged his inventory as security for a bank loan.he was also indebted to unsecured trade creditors.after the bank gave notice of its intention to foreclose on the inventory,the store owner incorporated a second company,the gun store,secured a line of credit from a different bank,and had the new corporation purchase the inventory of his former business,the gun exchange.he had the new corporation pay more than market value for the inventory to avoid personal liability to the first bank,which held his personal guarantee in addition to a security interest in the inventory.the unsecured trade creditors were paid nothing after the owner transferred all assets of the gun exchange to his new corporate alter ego,the gun store.the trade creditors commenced suit against the now gun exchange.
relying on a theory of constructive fraud,the trade creditors,with whom no fiduciary relationship is evident from the opinion or from the typical trade relationship,sought to have the corporate fiction of the gun exchange disregarded and to make the owner personally liable for its debts.on appeal,the court had little difficulty affirming the jury finding of constructive fraud.it noted that although the corporate fiction will typically insulate shareholders,officers,and directors from liability,when the corporate form has been used as part of a basically unfair device to achieve an inequitable result,such insulation disappears the court further noted that the texas business and commerce code imposes a duty of good faith on all covered dealings and that the complex machinations of the gun store owner failed that test.as the duty of good faith was violated,and c onstructive fraud is the breach of some legal or equitable duty which,irrespective of moral guilt,the law declares fraudulent,the court affirmed the finding of constructive fraud using corporate forms as a method to avoid creditors was legally and factually sufficient to support the jury finding of constructive fraud.
as no special relationship between the debtors and their creditors in the instant case appears from the record,such legal duties as,for example,good faith and fair dealing,do not provide a basis for a finding of constructive fraud taking all the surrounding circumstances in this case into consideration,however,i am convinced that,under texas common law,the debtors annuity purchase violated an equitable duty.the factors recounted in the panel majority opinion are worth repeating here.the debtors purchased the annuity on the eve of bankruptcy,an equitable proceeding although the nature of the federal proceeding does not alter our erie inquiry,it does inform the circumstances in which a texas court would determine whether an equitable duty exists.assuming the annuity was acquired with the debtors property,it was in an amount that would have covered all of the debtors listed debts,leaving the creditors with only in assets.the debtors also retained control of the property because it appears this annuity,like almost all,could be cashed out.and even though this feature is common to annuities,and thus can not be proof of fraud in the ordinary case,here,the debtors conceded the temporary and contingent nature of the purchase 
klein provides support for the proposition that the debtors violated an equitable duty,yet because of the duty of good faith in that case,it is not on all fours with the present situation.at least one texas court of appeals has,however,decided a case similar to klein without reference to a legal or equitable duty of good faith.in speed eluma international,the owner of a corporation claimed that the corporation was in arrears on rent owed to him,giving him a lessor lien on which he immediately foreclosed,permitting him to transfer the entirety of the corporation assets to a third party for a prearranged sum this deal structure was used to circumvent a temporary restraining order that the creditors of the company had obtained to enjoin the very sale that the owner carried out through a different mechanism.the court concluded that this violated an equitable duty and refused to reverse the jury finding of constructive fraud 
as in klein and speed,the annuity in the instant case has been used to achieve an inequitable result through machinations that have deprived the creditors of satisfaction for their claims and the bankruptcy court of the ability to adjudicate ownership of assets that might belong to the estate.under the foregoing common law interpretation of the insurance code constructive fraud provision,the bankruptcy court was justified in looking through the sham of the annuity to the real source of the money,just as the courts in klein and speed used constructive fraud to prevent inequity.but this justification,i emphasize,is found in texas common law,not in some tortured construction of dissimilar texas statutes.it is for these reasons that,with respect,i specially concur in the panel majority judgment.
the debtors filed for bankruptcy just before the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act bapcpa came into effect,stat.codified as amended in scattered sections of.bapcpa governs cases filed on or after october.since the debtors filed their bankruptcy petition before october,law governs this case.
the district court discussed three cases involving the predecessor to marineau am.life ins,sun life assurance of canada dunn,d,and leibman grand.they are all clearly distinguishable from this case and none of them assists us with interpreting the phrase in fraud of a creditor.marineau addressed whether the proceeds of an insurance policy that was purchased with embezzled funds could be placed in a constructive trust for the owner of the embezzled funds.the texas exemption statute then applicable did not even contain an in fraud of a creditor exception.see marineau,at citing act of,ch.sess.law serv.similarly,sun life addressed whether the proceeds of an insurance policy could be placed in a constructive trust for a beneficiary of the policy whose share of proceeds was wrongfully reduced in violation of a divorce decree.sun life never mentions,let alone interprets,the in fraud of a creditor exception at issue,leibman addressed whether sufficient evidence was presented at trial to establish that a debtor had made annuity premium payments in fraud of a creditor.the court determined that there was sufficient evidence to uphold the trial court finding that the debtor had made payments with intent to defraud his.the court provided no analysis of the phrase in fraud of creditor.
the intent to defraud language has been in a since at least.see act of,ch.sess.law serv.
because constructive fraud appears neither in nor in texas other statutes regarding fraud on creditors,it seems highly unlikely that the texas legislature intended to refer to common law constructive fraud cases as an interpretive standard for in fraud of a creditor.
section b of the texas business commerce code states in determining actual intent under a,consideration may be given,among other factors,to whether the transfer or obligation was to an insider the debtor retained possession or control of the property transferred after the transfer the transfer or obligati
