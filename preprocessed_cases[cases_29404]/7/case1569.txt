this appeal involves continental insurance company continental pursuit of a breach of contract claim against thorpe insulation company thorpe in thorpe chapter bankruptcy proceeding.the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court orders denying continental motion to compel arbitration and disallowing its claim.we now affirm.
thorpe distributed and installed products from to.about claims for injuries or deaths have been brought against thorpe.thorpe insurers,including continental,have paid more than million defending and indemnifying thorpe for these claims.in,continental and thorpe entered into the wellington agreement,an omnibus insurance coverage and claims handling agreement between asbestos producers and their insurers.the wellington agreement provides for binding arbitration of coverage disputes.
in,continental told thorpe that thorpe had exhausted its coverage under continental insurance policies and ceased indemnifying thorpe.thorpe then sought,for the first time,coverage under continental policies,asserting that such coverage was not subject to the policies liability limits.continental disputed thorpe coverage claim and initiated arbitration under the wellington agreement.the arbitrator rejected thorpe claim and found that thorpe had no remaining coverage rights under continental policies.thorpe appealed,and the parties agreed to settle.
the parties executed an integrated settlement agreement and release settlement agreement in april of.whether there has been a breach of this agreement and whether that should be determined by an arbitrator or by the bankruptcy court are the issues presented by this litigation.
the settlement agreement provides for mutual releases,and states in relevant part 
thorpe fully releases and forever discharges continental of and from any and all claims,actions,causes of action,rights,liabilities,obligations and demands of every kind and nature,known and unknown,suspected or unsuspected,past,present,and future,arising out of,related to,or in any way connected with,in whole or in part,any claim of any kind under the policies or relating to the arbitration 
the settlement agreement also contains two warranties that are central to this case.first,the assignment warranty provides 
the parties to this agreement each represent and warrant that they have not and will not in any manner assign,transfer,convey or sell,or purport to assign,transfer,convey or sell to any entity or person any cause of action,chose in action,or part thereof,arising out of or connected with the matters released herein,and that they are the only persons or entities entitled to recover for damages under such claims,causes of action,actions,and rights.
second,the establishment warranty provides 
the parties to this agreement each further represent and warrant that they will not in any way voluntarily assist any other person or entity in the establishment of any claim,cause of action,action,or right against the other party to this agreement arising out of,resulting from or in any way relating to the matters released.
thorpe and continental agreed to arbitrate disputes regarding the settlement agreement and its terms.
the settlement agreement released only thorpe claims against continental.it does not refer to the direct action rights of individual asbestos or to the contribution,indemnity,or subrogation rights of other insurers.as such,direct action claims and other insurers claims against continental were not released under the terms of the settlement agreement.
after the settlement agreement,as thorpe coverage under other insurers policies neared its limits,coverage actions commenced in california state court.thorpe and the insurers began settlement discussions that contemplated thorpe filing for bankruptcy.thorpe goal was to confirm a plan of reorganization pursuant to section g of the bankruptcy code.
section g is unique to the asbestos context.it provides a mechanism for consolidating assets and liabilities of a debtor into a single trust for the benefit of present and future asbestos claimants.see,at.section g authorizes the bankruptcy court to enter a channeling injunction channeling claims to the trust to prevent claimants from suing the debtor.collier on bankruptcy alan resnick henry sommer,ed.the injunction may also bar actions against third parties,such as insurers,that are based on claims against the debtor,if the third parties contribute to the trust in amounts that are commensurate with their likely liability.id.one requirement for a g injunction is that,as part of the process of seeking approval of the plan of reorganization,a class of claimants be established and vote,by at least percent of those voting,to approve the plan.g b ii iv bb.
in preparation for the bankruptcy and to achieve settlement in the state court actions,thorpe negotiated with insurers other than continental.certain insurers agreed to fund the g trust in consideration of thorpe filing for bankruptcy and seeking a g injunction that would protect the insurers against claims arising out of policies issued to thorpe.these insurers the settling insurers agreed to assign their contribution,indemnity,and subrogation rights against thorpe other insurers,including continental,to thorpe and the trust to be established under g.before filing for bankruptcy,thorpe also collaborated with asbestos claimants to begin structuring a g plan,as g requires percent of such claimants to consent to the plan as one requirement for it to be confirmed.
continental contends that the above actions violated the assignment warranty and the establishment warranty of the settlement agreement.continental also alleges that thorpe encouraged and assisted the filing of three direct action lawsuits against continental in september of,in violation of the establishment warranty.continental tried to arbitrate its claim that thorpe actions breached the settlement agreement.in a letter requesting arbitration,continental made clear its concern over a bankruptcy filing any actions related thereto.the arbitrator scheduled a hearing for october.
on october,thorpe filed for chapter bankruptcy.this stayed arbitration pursuant to.continental filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy court on february.thorpe objected to the claim.continental filed an amended proof of claim and moved to compel arbitration.the amended claim alleged the following to be violations of the settlement agreement thorpe prepetition acquisition of the settling insurers contribution,indemnity,and subrogation rights against continental thorpe assignment of such rights to the trust created pursuant to the g plan thorpe prepetition encouragement of direct action claims against continental and thorpe cooperation and participation as a plan proponent in drafting,proposing,and seeking confirmation of a plan designed to assist asbestos claimants in bringing direct action claims against continental.
the bankruptcy court set a hearing on the motion to compel arbitration and the claim objection for october,it told the parties that it would decide the motion to compel arbitration first and that it would then resolve legal but not factual issues relating to the claim objection.continental did not conduct any discovery before the october hearing 
at the october hearing,the bankruptcy court denied continental motion to compel arbitration and disallowed its claim.the bankruptcy court held that the allowance or disallowance of continental claim was a core matter under b but the core nature of the proceeding did answer the arbitration question.the bankruptcy court recognized the strong federal policy in favor of arbitration,but stated that in core matters,it had discretion in an appropriate case not to send it to arbitration.quoting from a prior tentative ruling,the bankruptcy court explained why in its view this case was such an appropriate case,and exercised its discretion to deny continental motion to compel arbitration 
although the conduct of which continental complain s may have commenced prepetition,the acts of which continental complain s,if true,are inextricably intertwined with the manner in which thorpe is attempting to structure,orchestrate,and obtain approvals for what is likely to be a complex plan of reorganization.resolution of these claims would require the trier of fact to adjudicate whether in conducting and administering these chapter cases and negotiating with the various constituencies involved in the case concerning the prospect of a consensual plan of reorganization,thorpe has somehow run afoul of contractual provisions contained in a prepetition settlement agreement with continental.such matters are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court.as a matter of fundamental bankruptcy policy,only a bankruptcy court should decide whether the manner in which someone has administered a bankruptcy estate gives rise to a claim for damages.courts 
can not be the arbiters of such issues moreover,the arguments that continental wish es to advance are inextricably intertwined with the issues that the court will have to address in connection with confirmation of the proposed plan 
the very terms of the plan themselves are among the alleged breaches of the settlement agreement 
after denying continental motion to compel arbitration,the bankruptcy court turned to continental claim and thorpe claim objection.it sustained thorpe claim objection and disallowed continental claim as a matter of law.
first,as to thorpe alleged breaches of the assignment warranty,the bankruptcy court held that the plain language of the settlement agreement precludes thorpe from assigning claims to third parties,but does not preclude acquiring claims from third parties,so thorpe mere acquisition of the settling insurers contribution,indemnity,and subrogation rights against continental did not breach the assignment warranty 
the bankruptcy court also rejected as a matter of law continental argument that thorpe assignment of the settling insurers rights to the g trust breached the assignment warranty.the bankruptcy court reasoned that because thorpe could not have released third parties claims in the settlement agreement,the settling insurers contribution,indemnity,and subrogation claims did not vaporiz e once assigned to thorpe.and because those claims,as assets,ought to go in the trust,the bankruptcy court held that even if the assignment warranty by its terms precluded thorpe from then assigning them to the trust,the provision would not be enforceable under bankruptcy code sections g,c,and a b.
the bankruptcy court next addressed thorpe alleged breaches of the establishment warranty.it concluded that,even assuming continental broad reading of the warranty,a breach of contract claim based on thorpe actions to assist asbestos claimants in bringing claims against part of its efforts to confirm a reorganization plan and create a g not succeed as a matter of bankruptcy law.the bankruptcy court reasoned along these lines given that agreements in which a debtor contracts away prepetition rights that it would otherwise have had in the context of a bankruptcy case are not generally enforceable,the conduct alleged to be a breach in this case,the formulation and structuring,negotiation,and attempt to arrive at the very kind of plan structure that g is about,could not be a breach of an enforceable contract.continental appealed to the district court.
the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court order denying continental motion to compel arbitration and affirmed the order disallowing continental claim in large part.but the district court reversed the bankruptcy court disallowance order as to continental allegations concerning thorpe prepetition encouragement of direct actions against continental.
the district court agreed that resolution of continental claim was a core proceeding.it also agreed that the bankruptcy court had discretion to deny continental motion to compel arbitration,at least to the extent that arbitration of the claim would conflict with the purposes of the bankruptcy code,and held that the bankruptcy court findings support the conclusion that arbitration of the claims would conflict with the underlying purposes of the bankruptcy code.the district court upheld the bankruptcy court findings and conclusions regarding the assignment warranty,as well as its finding that thorpe actions alleged to breach the establishment warranty were of its attempt to establish a trust and to avail itself of the protections of g.however,the district court held that the bankruptcy court findings did not support disallowance of continental claim to the extent that it alleged thorpe prepetition encouragement of direct action claims against continental,and remanded this issue to the bankruptcy court.the district court stated that its opinion regarding the core nature of continental claims against the bankruptcy estate applie d with equal force to the remanded claims and expresse d no opinion on whether the bankruptcy court should refer these claims to arbitration.
on remand,thorpe moved for summary judgment on the remanded portions of its objection to continental claim,and continental moved to compel arbitration of the remanded encouragement claims.continental requested discovery,but the bankruptcy court neither gave continental an opportunity to conduct discovery nor held an evidentiary hearing before ruling on the motions.
at a may,hearing,continental refused to argue the remanded issue thorpe alleged prepetition encouragement of three direct a standalone claim unrelated to thorpe larger goal of filing for bankruptcy and confirming a g plan.in light of continental unwillingness to separate the direct actions from thorpe efforts to negotiate a plan and prepare for bankruptcy,the bankruptcy court concluded that its previous analysis of thorpe conduct,that contracts for prepetition waivers of rights are unenforceable,applied with equal force to thorpe prepetition conduct.the bankruptcy court granted thorpe motion for summary judgment,sustained thorpe claim objection,and disallowed continental claim in its entirety.
the bankruptcy court also denied continental renewed motion to compel arbitration.it concluded that it had discretion not to enforce the arbitration clause in the settlement agreement for two reasons.first,the case required centralization,because resolution of continental claim had to be coordinated with the plan confirmation process and because continental claim and its objection to the plan confirmation overlapped factually second,the remaining claims,as asserted by continental on remand,still involved thorpe exercise of its rights in bankruptcy and should be decided by a bankruptcy judge.
the bankruptcy court indicated that if continental claim really could be separated out and be a standalone claim,then arbitration might be appropriate.but,from continental comments at the hearing and its moving papers,the bankruptcy court found that t his one little piece can not be extracted and treated as something different from thorpe actions in the bankruptcy.the bankruptcy court stated that continental claim was inextricably intertwined with something i really need to adjudicate,and so,it reasoned,i ca let this go to arbitration because it too fraught with peril that a nonbankruptcy forum would end up adjudicating things that it really ha s no business adjudicating,lest it run into a violation of bankruptcy policy.continental again appealed to the district court.
the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court orders denying continental motion to compel arbitration and disallowing its claim,concluding that continental repeatedly refused to limit the scope of its claim to matters that were within the scope of the remand and would not require the arbitrator to decide important matters of bankruptcy policy involving g.continental then appealed to this court.

continental contends that its claim should be arbitrated pursuant to the arbitration clause in the settlement agreement.it argues first,that its claim is,and second,that even if its claim is core,it should be arbitrated because arbitration would not inherently conflict with the bankruptcy code.we disagree.
the federal arbitration act,et,establishes a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements.moses cone mem l hosp.mercury constr,d.the act provides that agreements to arbitrate shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract,and that a court must stay a proceeding if it is satisfied that an issue in the proceeding is arbitrable under such an agreement.a court duty to rigorously enforce arbitration agreements does not diminish when a party bound by an agreement raises a claim founded on statutory rights.express,mcmahon,d internal quotation marks omitted.
like any statutory directive,however,the arbitration act mandate may be overridden by a contrary congressional command.id.at.if congress did intend to limit or prohibit waiver of a judicial forum for a particular claim,such an intent will be deducible from the statute text or legislative history,or from an inherent conflict between arbitration and the statute underlying purposes.id.alteration,citation,and internal quotation marks omitted.
we must decide whether congress intended to make an exception to the arbitration act for claims arising in bankruptcy proceedings,an intention discernible from the text,history,or purposes of the bankruptcy code.see id.neither the text nor the legislative history of the bankruptcy code reflects a congressional intent to preclude arbitration in the bankruptcy setting.see whiting turner contracting mach.enters,in re mach,cir in re mintze,at mor ben ins.mkts.trident ins.in re mor ben ins.mkts,cir.we ask,then,whether there is an inherent conflict between arbitration and the underlying purposes of the bankruptcy code.see mcmahon,at.
this issue is one of first impression in our circuit.several of our sister circuits that have addressed the issue have considered,as a threshold matter,a distinction between core and proceedings.see in re mach,at lines,am.owners mut.prot.indem.ass in re lines,cir ins.of am.ngc settlement trust asbestos claims mgmt.in re gypsum,cir.in proceedings,the bankruptcy court generally does not have discretion to deny enforcement of a valid prepetition arbitration agreement.in re mach,at energy shell oil in re energy,cir martin domke,domke on commercial arbitration ed see also mci telecomms.gurga in re gurga,cir.in core proceedings,by contrast,the bankruptcy court,at least when it sees a conflict with bankruptcy law,has discretion to deny enforcement of an arbitration agreement.phillips congelton,in re white mountain mining,cir in re lines,at in re gypsum,at domke,supra.the rationale for the distinction,as explained by the second circuit,is that proceedings are unlikely to present a conflict sufficient to override by implication the presumption in favor of arbitration,whereas core proceedings implicate more pressing bankruptcy concerns.in re lines,at.
however,not all core bankruptcy proceedings are premised on provisions of the code that inherently conflict with the federal arbitration act nor would arbitration of such proceedings necessarily jeopardize the objectives of the bankruptcy code.in re gypsum,at.we agree that the distinction,though relevant,is not alone dispositive.we join our sister circuits in holding that,even in a core proceeding,the mcmahon standard must be met that is,a bankruptcy court has discretion to decline to enforce an otherwise applicable arbitration provision only if arbitration would conflict with the underlying purposes of the bankruptcy code.see mcmahon,at in re mach,at eleventh circuit in re mintze,at third circuit in re white mountain mining,at fourth circuit in re lines,at second circuit in re gypsum,at fifth circuit.
here,we agree with the bankruptcy court and the district court that the resolution of continental claim was a core proceeding.continental argues that its state law breach of contract claim is because it is based on state law and arose outside of and independent of thorpe bankruptcy.yet regardless of how continental characterizes its claim,continental filed a proof of claim,and thorpe objected to the claim,so under b b,the allowance or disallowance of that claim was a core proceeding.see durkin benedor in re indus,cir the filing of a proof of claim is the prototypical situation involving the allowance or disallowance of claims against the estate,a core proceeding under b.collier,supra,a an objection to a claim is classified as a core proceeding even though,in another context,the litigation in question might be related.one can readily see that allowing a claim for continental would affect what was available for all creditors to receive.continental claim disputed or affected assets in the g trust the settling insurers contribution,indemnity,and subrogation rights and the rights of other creditors the asbestos claimants.accordingly,resolution of that claim directly impacted the administration of the bankruptcy estate.see b a.on all these grounds we hold that the resolution of continental claim was a core matter in the bankruptcy.
we next address whether,in this core proceeding,the bankruptcy court had discretion to deny continental motion to compel arbitration.
as an initial matter,we note that continental claim is not,as continental contends on appeal,independent of thorpe bankruptcy.from continental initial letter requesting arbitration and its arguments throughout this litigation,it is clear that thorpe bankruptcy filing any actions related thereto are related to continental claim.the amended proof of claim challenges thorpe acquisition of the settling insurers contribution,indemnity,and subrogation rights against continental,its assignment of those rights to the g trust,and its efforts to negotiate,structure,and confirm a plan designed to assist asbestos claimants in bringing direct actions all actions that thorpe took to exercise its rights in bankruptcy.
because thorpe alleged breaches of the settlement agreement were inextricably intertwined with its bankruptcy,the bankruptcy court determined that resolving continental claim required adjudication of whether in conducting and administering these chapter cases and negotiating with the various constituencies involved in the case concerning the prospect of a consensual plan of reorganization,thorpe has somehow run afoul of contractual provisions contained in a prepetition settlement agreement,and that a s a matter of fundamental bankruptcy policy,only a bankruptcy court should decide whether the manner in which someone has administered a bankruptcy estate gives rise to a claim for damages.in other words,the nature of the allegations were such that adjudication of continental claim in any forum other than a bankruptcy court would conflict with fundamental bankruptcy policy.as such,the bankruptcy court concluded that it had discretion not to send the claim to arbitration.the district court agreed,stating that continental claim raised questions go ing to the heart of g and the management of an bankruptcy estate,that should be resolved by a bankruptcy judge and not an arbitrator.
we agree.the purpose of g is to consolidate a debtor assets and liabilities into a single trust for the benefit of asbestos claimants.see,at.congress intended that the mechanism be available for use by any asbestos company facing overwhelming liability.see id.at.congress tasked bankruptcy courts with ensuring that g high standards are met and gave them authority to implement and supervise this unique procedure.see id.at.a claim based on a debtor efforts to seek for itself and third partie
