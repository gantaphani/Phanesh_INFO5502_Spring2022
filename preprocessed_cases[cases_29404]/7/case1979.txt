appellants jorge and gayle guerra the guerras appeal the district court order affirming the bankruptcy court dismissal of their adversary complaint against luis the debtor based on his failure to comply with florida financial responsibility act,florida statutes.on appeal,the guerras challenge the bankruptcy court and district court determination that the debt in issue is dischargeable in bankruptcy.after review,we affirm.
background 
death of veronica guerra 
this appeal arises out of the tragic death of the guerras newborn daughter,veronica guerra.during guerra pregnancy,the guerras had agreed with the debtor that he would deliver their baby.they further agreed that,in the event the debtor was unable to deliver the guerras baby,one of his partners would attend to the birth and lourdes ramon,a junior associate of the debtor,would not be involved.nevertheless,when guerra was admitted to the hospital,ramon attended to the birth.according to the guerras,as a result of ramon negligence,veronica guerra sustained injuries during the delivery and died eleven days later.
state court action 
in florida state court,the guerras filed a malpractice action against both the debtor and ramon.on february,the jury in the state court action returned a verdict in favor of the guerras and against the debtor and ramon.specifically,the jury found that ramon negligence caused veronica guerra death that there was no negligence by the debtor with regard to veronica guerra death but that the debtor breach of contract was a legal cause of veronica guerra death.the jury awarded the guerras million,and the florida state court entered final judgment against the debtor.
bankruptcy case and adversary proceeding 
meanwhile,on december,the debtor had filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of title of the united states code the bankruptcy code.on february,the guerras filed in the bankruptcy case an adversary proceeding against the debtor.the guerras adversary complaint asserted that,pursuant to florida statutes,the debtor was obligated to establish a fund to pay claims arising out of his rendering of,or failure to render,medical care and services,and that the debtor had a fiduciary duty to his patients to maintain a claims fund of per claim or in the aggregate.the guerras alleged that the debtor had not established the required fund and thus would not be able to pay the malpractice judgment against him.the guerras essentially alleged that they had a claim against the debtor for the amount of the required claims fund to apply to the malpractice award.
more specifically,the guerras asserted that their claim was pursuant to a of the bankruptcy code.see a.section a provides that debts for fraud or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity are 
on march,the bankruptcy court entered an order abating the adversary proceeding pending the resolution of the state court litigation.on september,the debtor filed a motion to dismiss the guerras adversary complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted or,in the alternative,for summary judgment.the debtor argued,inter alia,that florida statutes is a regulatory statute and does not create a fiduciary duty or any technical trust between the debtor and the guerras,and thus the a exception to discharge does not apply to any debt between the debtor and the guerras after a hearing,the bankruptcy court granted the debtor motion to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.
the guerras appealed the bankruptcy court dismissal to the district court,and the district court affirmed.the guerras now appeal to this court.
ii.discussion 
the florida financial responsibility act,florida statutes,requires that to obtain a license a physician must maintain either malpractice insurance,or a letter of credit payable to the physician,or an escrow account of his own funds to demonstrate his financial responsibility in the event of a malpractice award against him.see.stat.as did the bankruptcy court and the district court,we accept the allegations of the guerras adversary complaint as true and will assume that the debtor failed to comply with his obligations under and that there is no claims fund,malpractice insurance,or letter of credit to satisfy a portion of the guerras million judgment against the debtor 
further,the guerras adversary complaint is not based on the debtor failure to obtain malpractice insurance or provide a letter of credit,but is based solely on the debtor not having established a claims fund under that could then be used to pay the guerras malpractice judgment.thus,the only issue in this appeal is whether the debtor failure to maintain the claims fund under created a debt that falls within the a exception to discharge for debts for defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity.we first review prior judicial interpretation of the a exception and then apply it to this case.
debts under a 
an individual debtor debts,including malpractice debts,are generally dischargeable in a chapter bankruptcy case,and exceptions to discharge are construed narrowly.a,b equitable bank miller in re miller,cir c ourts generally construe the statutory exceptions to discharge in bankruptcy liberally in favor of the debtor and recognize that the reasons for denying a discharge must be real and substantial,not merely technical and conjectural.quotation marks,citations,and punctuation omitted see also,garver in re garver,cir noting that all types of professional malpractice claims generally are dischargeable under the bankruptcy code.
although a establishes an exception to dischargeability for debts for defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity,this exception is a narrow one.the supreme court has consistently held that the term fiduciary is not to be construed expansively,but instead is intended to refer to technical trusts.quaif johnson,cir citing davis aetna acceptance,and other supreme court cases interpreting previous versions of the a exception,but noting that all versions have referred to defalcation and to fiduciary capacity or fiduciary character see commonwealth land title blaszak in re blaszak,cir noting that the term fiduciary capacity is construed more narrowly in the context of a than in other circumstances see also gergely in re gergely,cir noting that the relationship does not create a fiduciary relationship for purposes of a.
in quaif,this court further noted that the davis decision is the last supreme court case to speak to the issue and that the supreme court has left the lower courts to struggle with the concept of technical trusts.quaif,at.quaif also discussed the trends in judicial interpretation of the a exception and noted that courts seemed to include the voluntary,express trust created by contract within the scope of fiduciary capacity as used in a.id.in contrast,courts have excluded the involuntary resulting or constructive trust,created by operation of law,from the scope of the exception.id.additionally,quaif noted that cases have also articulated a requirement that the trust relationship have existed prior to the act which created the debt in order to fall within the statutory fiduciary capacity exception.id.citing matter of angelle,cir.accordingly,constructive or resulting trusts,which generally serve as a remedy for some dereliction of duty in a confidential relationship,do not fall within the a exception because the act which created the debt simultaneously created the trust relationship.id.emphasis added 
even if a fiduciary relationship exists prior to the act that created the debt,the next question under a is whether there was a defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity.in quaif,this court further explained that d efalcation refers to a failure to produce funds entrusted to a fiduciary,but that the precise meaning of defalcation for purposes of a has never been entirely clear.id.at.quaif observed that the best analysis of defalcation is that of judge learned hand in central hanover bank trust herbst,cir,in which judge hand concluded that while a purely innocent mistake by the fiduciary may be dischar
