the trial court found the california department of corrections and rehabilitation cdcr lacked authority to supervise defendant charles andre toussain on parole because his current commitment offense,failing to register as a sex offender,was not a crime that subjected him to classification as a sex offender.see,subd.a all statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise designated.the court dismissed cdcr petition alleging toussain violated parole by tampering with his electronic monitoring global positioning system or gps device,and directed that county officials supervise toussain under the postrelease community supervision prcs program.the attorney general appeals from the order dismissing the petition,contending the legislature authorized cdcr to classify the risk of reoffense posed by all registerable sex offenders released from prison,and therefore the offender current commitment offense is not determinative if cdcr has assessed the person as a sex offender.we agree the legislative scheme requires parole supervision for anyone cdcr has classified as a sex offender,regardless of the current commitment offense.accordingly,we reverse.
factual and procedural background 
in april,toussain cdcr parole agent filed a parole revocation petition alleging toussain had been convicted for failing to register as a sex offender,subd.b in april.the previous month,cdcr had released toussain on parole with various terms and conditions,including that he participate in continuous electronic monitoring,global positioning system gps technology,that he not tamper with the gps device,and that he contact the parole agent immediately if and when the device vibrates makes an audible tone beep.
the petition alleged toussain violated parole by tampering with his gps device just days after he was released.according to the petition,after midnight on march,toussain parole agent received information from the gps tracking company that the fiber optic band connected to toussain gps device had been tampered with or was malfunctioning.the agent transmitted an audible and vibrating alert to toussain device,but toussain did not respond.toussain,a transient,did not have a telephone number.about an hour later,agents located toussain lying on the ground in front of the public defender office in santa ana.the gps device was on the ground next to toussain.the agent believed someone had tampered with the device by pulling the fiber optic band from one side and breaking the clips that hold the gps device and fiber optic band together.toussain claimed the device came off his leg when he fell down,but he admitted he did not attempt to contact the agent to report the device came off.
toussain underlying sex offense conviction,assault with intent to rape,occurred in may and resulted in a prison sentence.beginning in,toussain criminal history included eight separate prison commitments for various offenses,including narcotics sales and possession,manufacturing a weapon in prison,theft,and forgery.the parole revocation petition alleged toussain static sex offender risk category was high,and recommended the court return toussain to custody for days.
toussain moved to dismiss the parole revocation petition,asserting the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the petition.he argued cdcr could not supervise him because his most recent prison stint was not for a crime triggering parole supervision under section.the district attorney responded section required parole supervision because cdcr classified toussain as a sex offender with a static score of.following a hearing in may,the court dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction,stating supervision should be transferred to the probation department where defendant is to be placed on postrelease community supervision prcs.the court ordered toussain immediate release and directed him to present himself to county probation officials the next day.the attorney general appeals the trial court decision to dismiss the parole revocation petition.
discussion 
the attorney general contends cdcr properly exercised parole supervision over toussain and was entitled to seek his parole revocation because cdcr classified him as a sex offender,and all sex offenders released from prison must be placed on parole rather than prcs regardless of the offender most recent commitment offense.for the reasons expressed below,we agree.
section provides in relevant part,a a person released from state prison prior to or on or after july,after serving a prison term,or whose sentence has been deemed served pursuant to section,for any of the following crimes is subject to parole supervision by cdcr and the jurisdiction of the court in the county in which the parolee is released,resides,or in which an alleged violation of supervision has occurred,for the purpose of hearing petitions to revoke parole and impose a term of custody a serious felony as described in subdivision c of section.a violent felony as described in subdivision c of section.a crime for which the person was sentenced pursuant to paragraph of subdivision e of section or paragraph of subdivision c of section.any crime for which the person is classified as a sex offender.any crime for which the person is required,as a condition of parole,to undergo treatment by the state department of state hospitals pursuant to section.b notwithstanding any other law,all other offenders released from prison shall be placed on postrelease supervision prcs pursuant to title commencing with section.italics and boldface added.
the fundamental purpose of statutory construction is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.citations.in order to determine this intent,we begin by examining the language of the statute.citations.l anguage of a statute should not be given a literal meaning if doing so would result in absurd consequences which the legislature did not intend.citations.thus,t he intent prevails over the letter,and the letter will,if possible,be so read as to conform to the spirit of the act.citation.finally,we do not construe statutes in isolation,but rather read every statute with reference to the entire scheme of law of which it is part so that the whole may be harmonized and retain effectiveness.citation.people pieters cal d.we independently determine under the de novo standard of review questions of statutory interpretation.people ex rel.lockyer shamrock foods cal th,d.
by its terms,section requires parole supervision,not prcs,whenever a person who has committed a ny crime for which the person is classified as a sex offender,subd.a,italics added.toussain contends parole supervision is required only when the offender most recent prison commitment is for a crime for which the person was classified as a sex offender,but the plain terms of the statutory language include no such limitation.to the contrary,the legislature specified that even for offenders already released from prison prior to section effective date on july,the person is subject to cdcr parole supervision if he or she served a prison term for a ny crime for which the person is classified as a sex offender,subd.a,italics added.
the legislature use of the present tense is classified as and is subject to discloses a plain intent that individuals who are classified as sex offenders shall be subject to parole supervision based on a qualifying commitment offense any crime for which the person is classified as a sex offender,even in circumstances where they reoffend and are released from prison after a new offense.in other words,the sex offender designation remains controlling and requires parole supervision whether the person committed a qualifying offense and first gained release from prison prior to,on or after july,subd.a,italics added.otherwise,a sex offender on parole could deliberately commit a felony to prompt parole revocation,serve time on the new offense,and gain release on prcs rather than continue under parole supervision.
the distinction between parole and prcs is important because prcs offenders are not subject to the legislature containment model to deter sex offender recidivism.section describes th
