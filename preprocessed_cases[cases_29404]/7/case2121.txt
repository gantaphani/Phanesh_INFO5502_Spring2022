in this case,we must determine whether chapter of the texas civil practice and remedies code applies to a conversion action brought under texas business and commerce code section.the trial court granted information support concept summary judgment motion,which asserted that southwest bank was liable for conversion and could not join a responsible third party to the action,and the court of appeals affirmed.because we agree that chapter does not govern a conversion claim,we affirm the court of appeals judgment.
background 
an information support concepts isc employee,kelly rasco,stole multiple checks,payable to isc,over an period.she then deposited the of them,totaling more than her personal account at southwest bank.although isc did not have an account with southwest bank,and the checks did not bear an isc endorsement or signature southwest bank nevertheless accepted the deposits for rasco personal account and secured payment on those checks.
pursuant to texas business and commerce code section,isc brought a conversion action against southwest bank.southwest bank answered and sought leave to join rasco,her husband,and isc chief financial officer as responsible third parties pursuant to texas civil practice and remedies code chapter.the trial court denied southwest bank motion on the ground that the bank was not entitled to apportion responsibility.isc then moved for summary judgment on liability for conversion and actual damages.the trial court granted isc motion and entered a final judgment against southwest bank for actual damages plus prejudgment interest 
southwest bank appealed,complaining that the trial court erred by refusing to allow joinder of rasco as a responsible third party.while southwest bank did not deny that it converted the checks stolen by rasco,it contended that rasco shared responsibility for the conversion and should be held proportionately liable.id.at.the court of appeals rejected southwest bank arguments and affirmed the trial court judgment.id.at.the court of appeals noted that under the uniform commercial code ucc,it was the depositary bank obligation to verify an endorsement.id.at.the court held that when two statutes conflict,courts must give effect to the specific here,the ucc over the general chapter.id.at citing.gov t code.additionally,the court noted that recent ucc amendments demonstrated a discrete legislative fault scheme uniquely applicable to banks.id.thus,the court of appeals concluded that the proportionate responsibility statute set forth in chapter of the civil practice and remedies code does not apply to a ucc section claim for conversion.id.at.
southwest bank presents a single issue for our review whether a bank,facing a conversion claim resulting from the theft of an employer checks by an employee who deposited those checks in the bank,is entitled to join the thief as a responsible third party in the conversion action.
aucc revised article 
in an effort to accommodate modern technologies and practices in payment systems and with respect to negotiable instruments,the american law institute ali and the national conference of commissioners on uniform state laws the commissioners drafted a revised version of ucc article revised article,with corresponding amendments to articles and.see uniform commercial code,official text and comments,prefatory note to revised article.in,the ali and the commissioners approved the new text of revised article with miscellaneous and conforming amendments to articles and.william hawkland lary lawrence,uniform commercial code series.the american bar association approved the official text in.daryl robertson,report of the commercial code committee of the section of business law of the state bar of texas on revised ucc articles and,baylor.
the business law section of the state bar of texas formed a commercial code committee in for the purpose of studying and making recommendations with respect to new and revised articles to the ucc.id.at.over the course of several years and numerous meetings,that committee analyzed revised articles and,with the goal of making a recommendation to the legislature in conjunction with the texas legislative session.id.at.the committee recommendation included a complete deletion of existing chapter and adoption of a new revised chapter revisions of selected sections in chapter and conforming amendments to chapters and of the business and commerce code.id.at.representative grusendorf introduced as house bill the committee recommended revisions to chapters and.laws.the bill,with some amendments,was passed by the house and senate,signed by the governor,and became effective january.act of may,ch.laws.
revised article included ucc section,adopted verbatim by the texas legislature.see.bus.that section,entitled conversion of instrument,provides that a n instrument is converted if it is taken by transfer,other than a negotiation,from a person not entitled to enforce the instrument or a bank makes or obtains payment with respect to the instrument for a person not entitled to enforce the instrument or receive payment.id.a.section limits a plaintiff recovery to the amount of the plaintiff interest in the instrument.id.b.section,like its predecessor section,reflects the rationale that the first bank in the collection chain is usually in the best position to ensure that endorsements are authentic.see ames great bank.
responsible third parties 
in the same legislative session that it adopted revised article,the legislature amended the civil practice and remedies code,permitting joinder of responsible third parties in certain cases and providing for the inclusion of a responsible third party in the jury determination of percentages of responsibility.see.civ.prac,by its terms,chapter applies to any cause of action based on tort in which a defendant,settling person,or responsible third party is found responsible for a percentage of the harm for which relief is sought,but does not apply to actions to collect workers compensation benefits or certain claims for exemplary damages id.a,c.chapter does not explicitly address its applicability in ucc cases.
statutory analysis 
we must decide then whether,in a conversion action,a defendant may join a responsible third party as set forth in the civil practice and remedies code.the ucc contains a comprehensive and carefully considered allocation of responsibility among parties to banking relationships.for example,a bank that mistakenly pays a thief who presents a stolen check may sue that thief for breach of the transfer warranty.see.bus.see also william hawkland lary lawrence,uniform commercial code series noting that a thief gives the transferor warranties when he transfers the instrument even though he has no right to possess the instrument.moreover,revised article now includes its own comparative negligence provisions that apply to some,but not all,conversion claims.see.bus,see also id.cmt.subsection b differs from former section in that it adopts a concept of comparative negligence.if a thief steals a check made payable to his or her employer and forges an indorsement,the employer negligence,if any,may bar its claim against the payor bank.see,hawkland and lawrence,uniform commercial code series when a payee or indorsee whose indorsement has been forged sues the payor for conversion,the payor may defend the action by proving that the payee negligence substantially contributed to the making of the forged indorsement.upon such proof,the payee is precluded under section from asserting the forgery.when the payee brings an action for conversion against a depositary bank,the payee negligence is also available as a defense.in both of these cases,the failure of the payor or depositary bank to exercise ordinary care in paying or taking the instrument will result in allocating of the loss between the bank and the payee to the extent to which each party failure contributed to the loss.
thus,for example,under section,an employer who entrusts an employee with responsibility with respect to an instrument may be barred from recovery against the bank.bus.this section is based on the belief that the employer is in a far better positio
