the question presented is whether an affidavit of fault signed by an attorney who represents a party in a bankruptcy proceeding but not in the civil action is competent to support a party motion in the civil action for mandatory relief under code of civil procedure section,subdivision b.we hold that such an affidavit is competent and reverse the judgment of dismissal as to that party.we otherwise affirm.
factual and procedural background 
appellants sjp limited partnership sjp and its general partner,george justice justice,sued the city of los angeles and others alleging that they had wrongfully refused to extend building permits previously issued to appellants for the construction of a residence on sjp property.appellants sought a writ of mandate,as well as monetary damages and declaratory relief based on inverse condemnation.in june,the trial court issued a peremptory writ of mandate,directing respondents to grant extensions of the building permits.however,the property was ultimately lost in a foreclosure proceeding.
in october,appellants attorney of record filed a motion to be relieved as counsel.on november,while the motion was pending,appellants attorney notified the court that sjp had filed for bankruptcy protection.the trial court granted the motion to be relieved as counsel on november.in its written order,the court ordered the action stayed and set for january,a status conference and order to show cause osc re sjp need to be represented by a licensed attorney.the court also ordered appellants relieved counsel to give notice,including notice to sjp bankruptcy counsel.
after justice appeared twice in pro.per.and obtained continuances,the osc was calendared for may.neither appellant appeared on that day.the court dismissed the complaint as to sjp for its failure to appear by counsel.thereafter,the city filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings,arguing that justice lacked standing to pursue the matter because the property at issue was owned by sjp.
the day before the hearing on the motion for judgment on the pleadings,both appellants filed a substitution of attorney.the new attorney appeared the next day at the hearing and orally requested that the case be reinstated as to sjp.the court denied the request with prejudice and granted the motion for judgment on the pleadings,dismissing the complaint as to justice.
appellants filed a motion for relief,asking the court to vacate the dismissals under the mandatory relief provisions of section,subdivision b,or alternatively,under the court inherent discretionary authority.the declaration of sjp bankruptcy counsel,stuart koenig,was offered in support of the motion.koenig declared that he was aware sjp counsel in the state court action had withdrawn from representation and that justice was having difficulty obtaining new counsel for sjp.justice had informed him that the state court required sjp to appear at a hearing with new counsel.koenig advised justice that the state court could not dismiss sjp case because to do so would violate the automatic stay koenig believed was in place under section of the united states bankruptcy code.the declaration stated prior to the hearing that resulted in the dismissal of sjp as a party to this action,i did advise justice that this court could not and therefore would not act to dismiss sjp as a party.it is my understanding that justice acted on this advice.i further recognize that,although i was not representing sjp in this state court action,i should have appeared at the hearing and made certain that this court was aware that sjp was in bankruptcy and that the automatic stay precluded this court from taking any action against an asset of the bankruptcy estate,such as this claim.in light of the ruling by this court that the automatic stay does not protect sjp from a dismissal as a party,my interpretation of the bankruptcy code and the application of the automatic stay to the facts of this case was incorrect,and therefore the dismissal of sjp was the result of my advice to justice and mistaken interpretation of the bankruptcy code.
justice submitted his own declaration in support of the motion,stating the following i acted in reliance upon koenig and his firm.i truly did use all my best efforts to get another attorney for sjp and to comply with the court order,despite the fact that i was told by koenig that the court could take no action against sjp claims.justice explained that no attorneys he spoke to were willing to undertake representation until a lien filed by prior counsel was resolved.justice also stated that he attempted to appear at the osc hearing on may,but arrived late due to unforeseen traffic.
respondents filed an opposition to the motion for relief,which was later stricken by the trial court for improper service.in reply,appellants submitted an additional declaration of koenig,stating that he was not related to justice and had no other relationship with justice or sjp other than as counsel for sjp.justice also submitted an additional declaration stating that prior to sjp dismissal,he had confirmed koenig advice with another bankruptcy attorney,who was neither a friend nor relative.
the court denied the motion for relief,finding that the declaration of sjp bankruptcy counsel did not qualify under section,subdivision b because he was not the attorney of record in the civil case.the court also declined to exercise its inherent discretionary authority to vacate the dismissals.appellants have appealed from both judgments of dismissal and the order denying the motion for relief
