robert and darlene blendheim are colloquially known as chapter debtors.like many others who sought bankruptcy relief during the housing crisis,they took advantage of the bankruptcy tools available under chapter and then filed for chapter relief.one of the tools available in a chapter reorganization is lien voidance,or lien stripping.ordinarily,the bankruptcy code permits chapter debtors to void or modify certain creditor liens on the debtor property,permanently barring the creditor from foreclosing on that property.however,a amendment to the bankruptcy code bars chapter debtors from receiving a discharge at the conclusion of their chapter reorganization if they received a chapter discharge within four years of filing for chapter relief.f.
in this case,we are tasked with deciding whether by making chapter debtors like the blendheims ineligible for a discharge,congress also rendered them ineligible for chapter mechanism.this question has divided bankruptcy courts in our circuit and divided bankruptcy courts,bankruptcy appellate panels,district courts,and courts of appeals throughout the country.the bankruptcy court below concluded that hsbc lien on the blendheims home would be void upon the successful completion of their chapter plan,and the district court affirmed.we agree with the district court conclusion that discharge ineligibility does not prohibit the blendheims from taking advantage of the tools available in a typical chapter proceeding,and therefore affirm.
bankruptcy proceedings 
claim disallowance and lien voidance 
in,robert and darlene blendheim filed for bankruptcy under chapter of the bankruptcy code.the blendheims eventually received a discharge of their unsecured debts in.the day after receiving the discharge in their chapter case,the blendheims filed a second bankruptcy petition under chapter to restructure debts relating to their primary residence,a condominium in west seattle.in their schedule,the blendheims listed their condo at a value of,subject to two liens a lien securing a debt of owed to hsbc bank usa,and a lien securing a debt of owed to hsbc mortgage services.the lien is the only interest at issue in this appeal.
the lien holder hsbc,represented in bankruptcy proceedings by its servicing agent,filed a proof of claim in the chapter proceeding seeking allowance of its claim,which authorizes a creditor to participate in the bankruptcy process and receive distribution payments from the estate.the blendheims filed an objection to the claim on the basis that,although hsbc properly attached a copy of the relevant deed of trust to its proof of claim,hsbc failed to attach a copy of the promissory note the blendheims also alleged that a copy of the promissory note they had previously received appeared to bear a forged signature.for reasons unknown,hsbc never responded to the blendheims objection to its proof of claim.the deadline for responding passed,and in november,hearing no objection from hsbc,the bankruptcy judge entered an order disallowing hsbc claim.even after the blendheims served hsbc and its counsel with a copy of the disallowance order,hsbc took no action in response.instead,it withdrew its pending motion and requested no future electronic notifications from the court.
in april,the blendheims filed an adversary proceeding complaint seeking,among other things,to void hsbc lien pursuant to d,which states that t o the extent that a lien secures a claim against the debtor that is not an allowed secured claim,such lien is void.the blendheims contended that because hsbc claim had been disallowed,its lien secured a claim that is not an allowed secured claim and thus the lien could be voided.the bankruptcy court held a hearing the following month,specifically advising hsbc to take action to address the disallowance order.voidance of the lien posed a more drastic consequence than simple disallowance of hsbc claim in the bankruptcy proceeding voiding the lien would eliminate hsbc right of foreclosure.
even though the threat of voidance loomed,a year passed,and still hsbc took no action to set aside the order.once more,the court advised hsbc to file a motion to set aside the disallowance order.this time,almost a year and a half after the disallowance order was entered,hsbc responded.in april,hsbc filed a motion for reconsideration of the disallowance order,alleging grounds of mistake,inadvertence,surprise,excusable neglect,due process violations,and inadequate service.following a hearing,the bankruptcy court denied the motion.the court explained that hsbc presented no argument or evidence as to why its failure to respond was due to mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or excusable neglect,and hsbc has not provided any rationale for waiting nearly months after entry of the disallowance order to request reconsideration.it therefore declined to set aside the disallowance order.
the blendheims subsequently moved for summary judgment,once again seeking lien voidance.hsbc filed a response,arguing that it would be improper and inequitable to void the lien after the claim was disallowed for mere failure to respond.in support of its argument,hsbc pointed to a seventh circuit case called in re tarnow,cir,which had similarly dealt with the voidance of liens under d.as hsbc explained,there,the seventh circuit declined to permit a court to void a lien under d where the creditor claim had been disallowed for untimely filing.the court concluded that because a secured creditor is not required to file a proof of claim at all,and may instead look to its lien for satisfaction of the debt,destruction of a lien under d is a disproportionately severe sanction for an untimely filed claim.hsbc argued that destruction is equally inappropriate in the case of simple default.
the bankruptcy court held a hearing and offered an oral ruling at the conclusion of argument.the bankruptcy court acknowledged that voiding hsbc lien under d based on a default gives the court pause.however,the court explained,the text of d seemed clearly to contradict hsbc contentions t he trouble with the lender arguments here is they would just blue pencil d right out of the equation.d very clearly says if the secured debt is purporting to secure a disallowed claim,then the lien can be avoided.the court acknowledged that there plenty of case law that says,even in a chapter the secured creditor can just take a pass on the whole proceeding without imperiling his lien.but it distinguished tarnow,explaining that while that case involved a claim,here hsbc had filed a timely claim in the bankruptcy proceeding 
the claim in tarnow was only disallowed because it was late in a situation where they did need to file a claim at all so it as if the secured creditor in tarnow did file the claim at all.
that substantially different than what we have here where the claim was filed.there was a n objection to it that went to the substance,did not have anything to do with the form of the claim or the lateness of the claim.
and regardless of arguments now as to whether that would have been a meritorious objection if it had been responded to,hsbc just slept on its rights 
because hsbc claim had been disallowed and the court had found no legitimate basis for setting aside the disallowance,the disallowance was clearly a predicate under d for disallowance of the lien and therefore the lien should be set aside.the court ordered that upon debtors completion of a bankruptcy,this order shall be and the subject deed of trust is void pursuant to d,and hereby cancelled.
plan confirmation and permanent lien voidance 
the parties then proceeded to the plan confirmation process.the bankruptcy court rejected several proposed plans,ultimately confirming the blendheims eleventh amended plan.the bankruptcy court discussion of its reasons for rejecting the blendheims ninth amended plan,however,is relevant here.
after the blendheims filed their proposed ninth amended plan,hsbc objected on two grounds.first,hsbc argued that the blendheims improperly seek to cancel and void hsbc lien upon completion of the plan.according to hsbc,even if a lien is properly voided under d,that lien must be reinstated upon the completion of a chapter plan.this is because the blendheims could only obtain permanent voidance of the lien through a discharge,and the blendheims were statutorily ineligible for such a discharge because they had already received a chapter discharge within the previous four years.see f t he court shall not grant a discharge of all debts provided for in the plan or disallowed under section,if the debtor has received a discharge in a case filed under chapter during the year period preceding the date of the order for relief.second,hsbc objected that the plan was not filed in good faith.
the bankruptcy court rejected hsbc argument that a lien may not be voided upon plan completion.recognizing a split of authority among lower courts,the court observed that a chapter debtor ability to void a lien does not depend on the debtor eligibility for a discharge.it concluded that it is not per se prohibited for debtors to propose a chapter plan stripping the first or second position lien on their residence,notwithstanding their lack of eligibility for a chapter discharge.the court went on to address good faith.it concluded that the chapter petition had been filed in good faith,as the blendheims had valid reorganization goals and did not appear to be serial repeat filers who were systematically and regularly abusing the bankruptcy system.however,the court ultimately concluded that the plan had not been proposed in good faith the plan would authorize the blendheims to void both the first and liens,even though the lien would become fully secured and thus legally enforceable at the moment hsbc lien was deemed void.accordingly,the court rejected the ninth amended plan,but permitted the blendheims to amend.
in april,the bankruptcy court confirmed the blendheims eleventh amended chapter plan.this plan reinstated the lien,the voidance of which had caused the previous plan to fail.the court concluded that the reinstatement of the lien cure s what the court found was in bad faith before,and thus confirmed the plan.importantly,the confirmed plan replicated the ninth amended plan in permitting the blendheims to permanently void hsbc lien upon the completion of the plan.the court subsequently issued an order implementing the plan.
ii.appellate proceedings 
district court proceedings 
hsbc appealed to the district court for the western district of washington.the district court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over the disallowance order and order denying reconsideration because hsbc failed to timely file notice of appeal with respect to those orders.the district court affirmed the remaining bankruptcy court orders in their entirety.
first,the court considered whether the bankruptcy court had properly voided hsbc lien.the court assumed that the initial voidance of the lien under d was proper,turning directly to the question whether the blendheims could make the voidance permanent in the absence of a discharge.the court rejected hsbc argument that a debtor must be eligible for a discharge in order to accomplish lien stripping,or permanent voidance of the lien.observing an emerging consensus in this circuit that lien stripping can be accomplished through plan completion,the court concluded that the bankruptcy code permitted the blendheims permanently to void hsbc lien whether or not they were entitled to a discharge.the court reasoned that it should not impose a discharge requirement on the debtor ability to strip a lien when none is required by statute.concluding otherwise,the court stated,creates an extremely harsh result a debtor who successfully completed a chapter plan,obeying all the requirements approved by the court,would see many of his debts spring back to life.
the district court next rejected hsbc argument that it was denied due process.the court explained that the lien was voided in an adversary proceeding,which granted hsbc a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue.the district court then went on to reject hsbc argument that the blendheims chapter case was not filed in good faith,explaining that the bankruptcy court findings that the blendheims had valid reorganization goals other than lien stripping,did not file in order to defeat state court litigation,and did not exhibit any egregious behavior,were not clearly erroneous.finally,the district court rejected the blendheims request for attorneys fees.
ninth circuit proceedings 
hsbc timely appealed the district court affirmance of the bankruptcy court orders permanently voiding hsbc lien.the blendheims,seeking a determination that the district court erred in its denial of attorneys fees.several months after the appeal was docketed,the blendheims successfully completed their plan payments,meaning that they were poised to permanently void hsbc lien upon the closure of their case in the bankruptcy court.we granted hsbc motion for an emergency stay of the bankruptcy court order closing the case,pending the outcome of its appeal to this court.
iii.statutory framework 
there are several bankruptcy code provisions at issue in this case.to assist the reader,we begin by walking through the relevant chapters and sections.
a.the life of a bankruptcy case 
a bankruptcy case begins with the filing of a petition and the creation of an estate,which comprises the debtors legal and equitable interests in property.fed.a.the filing of the petition triggers an automatic stay,prohibiting all entities from making collection efforts against the debtor or the property of the debtor estate.to collect on a debt,a creditor must hold a claim,or a right to payment,id,which has been allowed by the bankruptcy court,id.every claim must go through the allowance process set forth in before the claim holder is entitled to participate in the distribution of estate assets.the bankruptcy court may decline to allow or disallow a claim for a variety of reasons.see,id.b disallowing claims unenforceable against the debtor id.b disallowing tardily filed proof of claim.but importantly,for creditors holding liens secured by property,filing a proof of claim and participating in the allowance process indeed,participating in the bankruptcy process as a whole is completely voluntary.a creditor with a lien on a debtor property may generally ignore the bankruptcy proceedings and decline to file a claim without imperiling his lien,secure in the in rem right that the lien guarantees him under law the right of foreclosure.see bank in johnstown chase bank of.a secured creditor may disregard the bankruptcy proceeding,decline to file a claim and rely solely upon his security if that security is properly and solely in his possession.
the bankruptcy code contains two chapters designed to give relief exclusively to individual debtors chapters and.to decide which chapter to file under,a debtor must compare his means and goals against the purposes of each chapter.in a chapter bankruptcy proceeding,also called a liquidation,a bankruptcy trustee immediately gathers up and sells all of a debtor nonexempt assets in the estate,using the proceeds to repay creditors in the order of the priority of their claims.a.the bankruptcy estate does not,however,include any wages or assets that a debtor acquires after the bankruptcy filing.id.a.provided the debtor meets all the requirements,the court may then grant the debtor a discharge,which releases a debtor from personal liability on certain debts.id.thus,chapter offers debtors the chance to make a fresh start,and a clean break from his financial past,but at a steep price prompt liquidation of the debtor assets.harris viegelahn,d.
by contrast,a chapter proceeding,often called a reorganization,is designed to encourage financially overextended debtors to use current and future income to repay creditors in part,or in whole,over the course of a period.see harris.at.only debtors with a regular income,which is sufficiently stable and regular to enable them to make payments under a plan,are eligible for chapter reorganization,e.unlike chapter proceedings,where a debtor nonexempt assets are sold to pay creditors,chapter permits debtors to keep assets such as their home and car so long as they make the required payments and otherwise comply with their obligations under their confirmed plan of reorganization.
a chapter debtor formulating a proposed plan of reorganization must include certain mandatory provisions,but also has at his disposal various discretionary provisions the tools in the reorganization toolbox.see in re cain,cir.mandatory provisions,which all chapter plans must contain in order to qualify for confirmation,are set forth in a and of the bankruptcy code.among other things,these sections require a plan to be proposed in good faith,u.a satisfy the best interests of creditors test,which requires that the value distributed to holders of allowed,unsecured claims be no less than the amount that would have been paid if the estate were liquidated under chapter,id.a and provide for the submission of all or a portion of the debtor future earnings as is necessary for the execution of the plan,id.a.discretionary provisions that a debtor may incorporate in his plan are set forth in b.these tools include the curing or waiving of a default,id.b the assumption,rejection,or assignment of any executory contract or unexpired lease,id.b and the modif ication of the rights of holders of secured claims,other than a claim secured only by a security interest in real property that is the debtor principal residence,or of holders of unsecured claims,id.b.the last provision,providing for the modification of creditors rights,is one of the most advantageous tools available to chapter debtors.for example,we have interpreted b to permit debtors to void liens on their homes to the extent that the lien is wholly unsecured by the value of the home.in re zimmer,cir evaluating modification of unsecured claim s,as defined under a modification is a powerful tool voidance or avoidance of a lien permits debtors to nullify a creditor in rem rights by effectively removing from a creditor his right to foreclose on a property.
another useful tool in a chapter reorganization,which is also available in chapter,is the discharge.a chapter debtor seeking a discharge typically proposes a plan in which the discharge is granted at the end of the proceeding,after the debtor completes all required payments under the plan.id.a id.b permitting the court to grant a discharge to a debtor who has not completed all payments under the plan under certain limited circumstances.a discharge releases debtors from personal liability on claims and enjoins creditors from taking any action against the debtor in the debtor personal capacity.id.a.the bankruptcy code authorizes debtors to receive a discharge of unsecured debt such as credit card debt or secured debt such as a mortgage on a home.ordinarily,in case of debtor default on a mortgage,a creditor is not limited to a right of foreclosure on the property a creditor may also sue the debtor personally for any deficiency on the debt that remains after foreclosure.see johnson home state bank,d.the discharge eliminates the creditor ability to proceed in personam against the debtor whether the debt is secured or unsecured in the case of a secured debt,the creditor retains the ability to foreclose on the property but can no longer proceed against the debtor personally.see also collier on bankruptcy a.
if a debtor proposed plan conforms with the mandatory requirements described above and all voluntary provisions similarly satisfy the good faith and best interests of creditors tests,then the bankruptcy court will confirm the chapter plan.the bankruptcy code provides that the provisions of a confirmed plan bind the debtor and each creditor,such that any issue decided under a plan is entitled to res judicata effect.bullard blue hills bank,d confirmation has preclusive effect,foreclosing relitigation of any issue actually litigated by the parties and any issue necessarily determined by the confirmation order.internal quotation marks omitted.if the debtor complies with his obligations under the confirmed plan and makes all the required payments,the court will grant the debtor a discharge if appropriate and close the case.a.
many debtors,however,fail to complete a chapter plan successfully,often because they can not make payments on time.recognizing this,the bankruptcy code permits debtors who fail to complete their plans to convert their chapter case to a case under a different chapter,or dismiss their case entirely.id.a b.but importantly,upon dismissal or conversion of a case,a debtor loses any benefits promised in exchange for the successful completion of the plan whether in personam,such as discharge,or in rem,such as lien voidance.the code treats any lien voided under a chapter plan as reinstated upon dismissal or conversion,restoring to creditors their state law rights of foreclosure on the debtor property.see id.f c i b c.section of the bankruptcy code governs conversion of a chapter case to a case under a different chapter.it provides that a creditor holding a security interest as of the date of the filing of the chapter petition shall continue to be secured,meaning that a creditor lien will be restored to him upon conversion.id.f c i.dismissal of a chapter case has a similar effect provides that any lien stripped under d will be reinstated upon dismissal of the case,unless a court orders otherwise.id.b c.in effect,conversion or dismissal returns to the creditor all the property rights he held at the commencement of the chapter proceeding and renders him free to exercise any nonbankruptcy collection remedies available to him.see collier on bankruptcy.
in,congress enacted the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act bapcpa,stat,to make several significant changes to the bankruptcy code.one of congress purposes in enacting bapcpa was to correct perceived abuses of the bankruptcy system.milavetz,gallop milavetz,united states,d see also i,at explaining that the enactment also sought to ensure that the system is fair for both debtors and creditors.included among the provisions intended to provide greater protections for creditors,according to the house report,are reforms prohibiting abusive serial filings and extending the period between successive discharges.i,at.one of bapcpa new provisions extending the period between successive discharges appears in chapter,f the court shall not grant a discharge of all debts provided for in the plan if the debtor has received a discharge in a case filed under chapter,or of this title during the year period preceding the date of the order for relief under this chapter.f.as relevant here,this provision bars a chapter debtor from obtaining a discharge if he has received a chapter discharge within the past four years.debtors who have sought sequential relief under chapters and,and are thus subject to f prohibition on successive discharges,are termed chapter debtors.
significantly,f does not prohibit a debtor from filing a chapter petition after receiving a chapter discharge,and so nothing prevents a debtor from taking advantage of the other chapter tools available to him,apart from discharge.see collier on bankruptcy.for example,a debtor may use chapter to cure a default or seek protection of the bankruptcy court and the automatic stay while paying debts in an orderly fashion through a plan.id.thus,chapter debtors are permitted to take advantage of many of chapter restructuring tools,notwithstanding bapcpa amendments.the question presented in this case is whether the chapter debtor ineligibility for a discharge also renders him ineligible to void a lien permanently upon the completion of his chapter plan.we turn to this difficult question.
iv.discussion 
as the bankruptcy court below aptly summarized,this case presents unique issues stemming from the almost bizarre lack of diligence by hsbc early on in the case.hsbc inexplicable failure to respond to the bankruptcy court order disallowing its claim in the bankruptcy proceeding has generated a litany of issues,including several questions of first impression.in part a,we first address whether the bankruptcy court properly voided hsbc lien under d of the bankruptcy code.next,we consider in part b whether the voiding of that lien is permanent such that the lien will not be resurrected upon the completion of the blendheims chapter plan.this is the novel chapter question.in part c,we determine whether the voiding of the lien comports with due process.finally,in part d,we address whether the bankruptcy court clearly erred in concluding that the blendheims chapter petition was filed in good faith.
before proceeding with our discussion of these questions,we briefly examine the justiciability of hsbc claims.because hsbc failed timely to appeal the order disallowing its claim and order denying reconsideration to the district court,we,like the district court,lack jurisdiction over these orders.see in re mouradick,cir t he untimely filing of a notice of appeal deprives the appellate court of jurisdiction to review the bankruptcy court order.but hsbc failure to timely appeal these orders does not,as the blendheims have suggested,render hsbc appeal of the bankruptcy court other orders moot.the blendheims are correct that the unappealed orders preclude this court from offering hsbc any remedy in bankruptcy,but their argument misses the mark hsbc is not seeking a remedy in bankruptcy.rather,as we address in greater detail below,hsbc asks us to determine whether,now that the blendheims have successfully completed their chapter plan,hsbc maintains a lien on the property such that it may pursue its,remedy foreclosure against the blendheims.deciding this question requires us to examine the validity of the bankruptcy court order,plan confirmation order,and implementation order,which together permanently extinguish hsbc lien and right to foreclose.hsbc timely appealed these orders,and reversal on appeal would grant effective relief to hsbc by restoring its lien on the blendheims home.see pub.utils.comm,cir the court must be able to grant effective relief,or it lacks jurisdiction and must dismiss the appeal.accordingly,this appeal is not moot.
d permits voidance of hsbc lien 
first,we consider whether the bankruptcy court properly voided hsbc lien pursuant to d.we requested supplemental briefing from the parties on this question of first impression.we review de novo the district court decisions on an appeal from a bankruptcy court.in re afi holding,cir.a bankruptcy court conclusions of law,including its interpretation of the bankruptcy code,are reviewed de novo.blausey trustee,cir per curiam.
the provision at issue here,d,states in full 
to the extent that a lien secures a claim against the debtor that is not an allowed secured claim,such lien is void,unless 
such claim was disallowed only under section b or e of this title or 
such claim is not an allowed secured claim due only to the failure of any entity to file a proof of such claim under section of this title.
d.both parties agree that neither of the exceptions under d applies.looking at the main text of the provision,d authorizes the voiding of liens securing claims that have been deemed not an allowed secured claim.the most straightforward reading of the text suggests that if a creditor claim has not been allowed in the bankruptcy proceeding,then such lien is void.void means o f no legal effect or null.black law dictionary ed.accordingly,congress language appears unequivocal d clear and manifest purpose is to nullify a creditor legal rights in a debtor property if the creditor claim is not allowed,or disallowed.
the supreme court decision in dewsnup timm,d,confirms this interpretation.there,a chapter debtor sought to use d to void a creditor lien on his property,arguing that the creditors claim was not an allowed secured claim because it was undersecured in other words,the value of the property supporting the creditor lien was less than the value of the claim.id.at.dewsnup rejected the debtor argument,holding that d did not void the lien on his property because the creditor claim had been fully allowed.id.at.the court reasoned that its reading gives the provision the simple and sensible function of voiding a lien whenever a claim secured by the lien itself has not been allowed and ensures that the code determination not to allow the underlying claim against the debtor personally is given full effect by preventing its assertion against the debtor property.id.at.dewsnup holding clarifies that d voidance mechanism turns on claim allowance.see bank of america,caulkett,d affirming dewsnup interpretation of d in the context of wholly underwater liens because the bank claims here are both secured by liens and allowed under,they can not be voided under the definition given to the term allowed secured claim by dewsnup see also collier on bankruptcy a dewsnup determined that section d does not void liens on the basis of whether they are secured under section a,but on the basis of whether the underlying claim is allowed or disallowed.
here,it is undisputed that hsbc claim was not allowed.although hsbc filed a proof of claim,the bankruptcy court expressly disallowed the claim after the blendheims objected and hsbc failed to respond.see a a claim or interest is deemed allowed,unless a party in interest objects.id.b i f such objection to a claim is made,the court,after notice and a hearing,shall determine the amount of such claim.the blendheims argue,and the bankruptcy court concluded in its hearing on the blendheims motion for summary judgment,that if a claim is disallowed,then under d and consistent with dewsnup,the claim associated lien is void.we agree.although voiding hsbc lien upon disallowance may seem a harsh consequence,we find that congress directed such an outcome under d.because hsbc claim was disallowed,d leaves hsbc with a claim against the debtor that is not an allowed secured claim,and therefore its lien is void.
hsbc has pointed to decisions from three of our sister circuits,but these decisions are not contrary to our holding.the fourth,seventh,and eighth circuits have concluded that bankruptcy courts may not use d to void liens whose claims have been disallowed on the sole basis that their proofs of claim were untimely filed.in re shelton,cir,cert.denied,d in re hamlett,cir in re tarnow,cir.these courts reason that voiding liens merely because the creditor did not timely file a claim violates the,principle that valid liens pass through bankruptcy unaffected.shelton,at discussing dewsnup,at hamlett,at tarnow,at see bank,at a creditor may disregard the bankruptcy proceeding,decline to file a claim and rely solely upon his security if that security is properly and solely in his possession.
congress codified the principle that liens may pass through bankruptcy in d a lien securing a claim that is not an allowed secured claim is void unless such claim is not an allowed secured claim due only to the failure of any entity to file a proof of claim.this provision,an exception to d voiding mechanism,means that the failure of the secured creditor to file a proof of claim is not a basis for voiding the lien of a secured creditor.tarnow,at quoting,at.our sister circuits concluded that a claim filed late is tantamount to not filing a claim at all,and that therefore,under principles and the rationale of d,an untimely claim could not justify voiding the lien securing it.hamlett,at w e conclude,following the reasoning set forth in tarnow,that the failure to file a timely claim,like the failure to file a claim at all,does not constitute sufficient grounds for extinguishing a perfectly valid lien.shelton,at same tarnow,at.
these decisions are distinguishable from this case,where hsbc timely filed its proof of claim.because this case does not concern a or claim,d exception does not apply.moreover,the equitable concerns animating the decisions of our sister circuits do not apply with the same degree of force to the case before us.a creditor who files an untimely claim has little choice but to accept the disallowance of his claim because under the bankruptcy code,untimeliness is itself a basis for disallowance.see b.interpreting d to void such a claim would automatically transform a timing mistake into a death knell for the lien securing the claim.thus,our sister circuits concluded,such a lienholder should forfeit the right to participate in the bankruptcy proceeding and lose the opportunity to stand in line as an unsecured creditor for that portion of debt that is not adequately secured,shelton,at see tarnow,at but should not lose its lien.rather,those courts concluded that the lienholder ought to retain whatever rights it has under state law to enforce the lien.
where a claim is timely filed and objected to,on the other hand,disallowance is not automatic.this case is a good example hsbc timely filed its proof of claim,received service of the blendheims objection,and then had a full and fair opportunity to contest the disallowance of its claim it simply chose not to.thus,while voiding a lien securing an untimely filed claim might be considered a disproportionately severe sanction for untimeliness,in re tarnow,at,voidance is not so severe a sanction in a case like this one,where the bankruptcy court disallowed the claim because,as the bankruptcy court put it,hsbc just slept on its rights and refused to defend its claim.hsbc refused to defend its lien after it was challenged by the blendheims for failure of proof and because their copy allegedly bore a forged signature.in these circumstances,hsbc failure to respond is more akin to a concession of error than a failure to file a timely claim.hsbc simply forfeited its claim.
we therefore affirm the bankruptcy court conclusion that d authorized the voidance of hsbc lien.these facts present a straightforward application of d textual command.though we may one day confront the question whether an untimely filed claim justifies voiding its associated lien,that is not the issue presented in this case,and accordingly,we decline to decide it here.
chapter debtors may permanently void liens 
voiding a lien under d might simply end the story in a different case,but not so here.as we discussed at part iii above,the bankruptcy code contains several provisions that reinstate a previously voided lien at the conclusion of a chapter proceeding,effectively bringing that lien back to life.hsbc argues that the only way for a debtor to avert these provisions is to obtain a discharge.if correct,this would create an insurmountable obstacle for chapter debtors,like the blendheims,who are statutorily ineligible to obtain a discharge,having filed for chapter reorganization within four years of obtaining a discharge under chapter.see f.accordingly,hsbc argues,liens will come back to life,and lien voidance can not be made permanent after the completion of a chapter plan,in circumstances where,as here,the debtors are ineligible for a discharge.
the question whether chapter debtors may obtain the permanent release of lien obligations has divided lower courts within our circuit.compare frazier real time resolutions,holding that liens may be permanently voided in a chapter case,in re okosisi,same,in re hill,same,and in re tran,same,aff,d,with in re victorio,holding that liens can not be permanently voided in a chapter case,aff sub nom.victorio billingslea,in re casey,same,and in re winitzky,at.may,same two other courts of appeals and bankruptcy appellate panels from three circuits,including our own,have also addressed the question,all concluding that chapter debtors may void liens irrespective of their eligibility for a discharge.see in re scantling,cir in re davis,cir in re boukatch,cir in re cain,cir in re fisette.cir we will omit the citations here,but we note that bankruptcy and district courts in other circuits have also divided over this question.and so we turn to the next question before us whether the bankruptcy code permits chapter debtors,like the blendheims,to permanently void a lien upon the completion of a chapter plan.
a discharge is not necessary to close a chapter case or permanently void a lien 
hsbc argues that a discharge is necessary to obtain the benefits of lien voidance because,apart from conversion or dismissal,discharge is the only mechanism available to bring a chapter case to close in a manner that makes lien voidance permanent.as authority for that proposition,hsbc points to our decision in in re leavitt,cir.there,we considered the appropriate standard of bad faith as cause to dismiss a chapter bankruptcy petition with prejudice.id.at footnote omitted.in the course of affirming the bankruptcy appellate panel dismissal of an action with prejudice upon findings of bad faith concealment of assets and inflation of expenses,we stated,a chapter case concludes in one of three ways discharge pursuant to,conversion to a chapter case pursuant to c or dismissal of a chapter case for cause under c.id.at footnote omitted.as we explained above,dismissal and conversion reinstate a previously voided lien.see.lower courts have therefore interpreted this language in leavitt as making clear the legal fact that the only way to make a lien strip permanent is by discharge because conversion or dismissal reinstates the avoided lien.victorio,at see also casey,at in the case of a chapter,there can be no discharge,and conversion is not an option.dismissal is the necessary result,without discharge,when a debtor performs a plan that leaves one or more debts wholly or partially unpaid.hsbc characterizes this as the leavitt rule and argues that the only way for a chapter debtor to permanently void a creditor lien is through a discharge.under hsbc theory,the blendheims ineligibility for a discharge means that their chapter case must end in conversion or dismissal,either of which would restore the lien previously voided under d.
hsbc theory rests upon a fatal flaw our decision in leavitt imposed no rule that a chapter case must end in conversion,dismissal,or discharge,and the bankruptcy code is devoid of any such requirement.in leavitt,we were not tasked with deciding all the ways in which a chapter case can end.rather,we were called upon to determine whether the bankruptcy court below had properly dismissed a bad faith chapter petition with prejudice.our statement that a chapter case concludes in one of three ways was not necessary to our holding,and is therefore dictum.that much should be clear from the context in which the statement was made in fact,we made clear in the sentence immediately following that h ere,we are only concerned with dismissal.leavitt,at.our statement in leavitt should not be read to describe an exhaustive list of ways in which a chapter case may conclude.
nor has hsbc cited any provision in the bankruptcy code stating that a chapter plan may end only in conversion,dismissal,or discharge.indeed,contrary to the leavitt rule,the code contemplates closure of a case pursuant to a,which provides that a fter an estate is fully administered and the court has discharged the trustee,the court shall close the case.with closure,no conversion,dismissal,or discharge is necessary.see davis,at adopting the debtor argument that i n a successful chapter case the plan is completed,and the case is closed administratively without dismissal or conversion see also scantling,at concluding that because the creditor claim is not secured,thus making a inapplicable,the debtor ineligibility for a discharge is irrelevant to a strip off in a chapter case see also okosisi,at the court finds that in this situation the proper result is for the court to close the case without discharge.a.
fundamentally,a discharge is neither effective nor necessary to void a lien or otherwise impair a creditor right of foreclosure.as defined under the bankruptcy code,a discharge operates as an injunction against a creditor ability to proceed against a debtor personally.see a a discharge operates as an injunction against an action to collect,recover or offset any such debt as a personal liability of the debtor emphasis added.discharges leave unimpaired a creditor right to proceed in rem against the debtor property.see johnson,at a bankruptcy discharge extinguishes only one mode of enforcing a claim namely,an action against the debtor in personam while leaving intact another namely,an action against the debtor in rem.collier on bankruptcy t he provisions of apply only to the personal liability of the debtor,so they do not affect an otherwise valid prepetition lien on property.it follows logically that there is no reason to make the bankruptcy code in rem modification or voidance provisions contingent upon a debtor eligibility for a discharge,when discharges do not affect in rem rights.see fisette,at explaining that the strip off of a lien is not the equivalent of receiving a discharge because a discharge releases a debtor in personam liability,but it does not affect the lien hill,at since the debt was already discharged,or changed to status in the chapter case,a second discharge for the debtors in this chapter case would be redundant.
we acknowledge that there has been considerable confusion on this point.in victorio,the bankruptcy court rejected the notion that closure pursuant to a constituted a fourth option for ending a chapter case,reasoning in part that prior to bapcpa,the only way a lien strip became permanent in any chapter case was through discharge.at.the court observed that the bankruptcy code should not be read to abandon past bankruptcy practice absent a clear indication that congress intended to do so,id.at quoting in re bonner mall,cir,and therefore found that discharge was a necessary predicate for lien voidance.however,because bankruptcy discharge,by definition,affects only in personam liability,it has never served as the historical means for ensuring that the bankruptcy code various mechanisms for modifying or voiding a creditor in rem rights remained in place at the conclusion of a plan.see,d discussed above id.b permitting modification of the rights of holders of certain secured claims and holders of unsecured claims id.f permitting debtors to void liens impairing exemptions on certain assets.no discharge is,or ever has been,necessary to accomplish the outcome that the blendheims seek 
victorio cited various cases for the proposition that modifications to creditors rights are effective only to the extent that they can be discharged,victorio,at,but this conclusion does not follow from the cases.each of the cited cases concerns certain debts for which the debtor remains personally liable after the completion of his chapter plan.see,bruning united states,d nondischargeable interest on unpaid tax debt remains a personal liability of the debtor in re foster,cir interest on child support obligation may be collected personally against the debtor in re ransom,cir student loan interest is recoverable by creditor,rev on other grounds sub nom.espinosa united student aid funds,cir in re pardee,cir interest on student loan debt remains personal liability of the debtor.these cases stand for nothing more than the uncontroversial proposition that the bankruptcy code renders certain debts if the debt is,then a debtor remains personally liable for that debt.to conclude based on these cases that the only way to make a lien strip permanent is by discharge,is to ignore the bankruptcy code unequivocal distinction between in personam and in rem liability.see defining a discharge as an injunction against actions to recover debt as a personal liability of the debtor emphasis added.these cases can not be read for the proposition that a discharge is necessary to permanently eliminate in rem liability.
lien voidance does not subvert congress intent in enacting bapcpa 
hsbc contends that even if discharge is not the sole route to permanent,permitting chapter debtors to achieve permanent circumvents congress purpose in enacting f limitation on successive discharges.the bankruptcy court in victorio reasoned that permitting debtors to achieve de facto discharge of liability through the closure mechanism effects an end run around bapcpa clear mandate.at see also cain,at collecting cases subscribing to the de facto discharge argument.the victorio court also suggested that congress did not intend to allow debtors to void liens upon case closure,while similarly situated,debtors must complete all the requirements of a chapter plan in order to permanently void a lien.at.thus,hsbc argues,allowing the blendheims to permanently avoid liability on the lien subverts congress purpose in enacting bapcpa and should not be permitted irrespective of whether there are alternative routes besides a discharge for closing a chapter case.
we disagree that permitting the blendheims to void hsbc lien subverts congress intent in prohibiting successive discharges.we take congress at its word when it said in f that chapter debtors are ineligible for a discharge,and only a discharge.had congress wished to prevent chapter debtors from having a second bite at the bankruptcy apple,then it could have prohibited chapter debtors from filing for chapter bankruptcy entirely.see,g n o individual or family farmer may be a debtor under this title who has been a debtor in a case pending under this title at any time in the preceding days see also johnson,at citing express prohibitions on serial filings and explaining that t he absence of a like prohibition on serial filings of chapter and chapter petitions convinces us that congress did not intend categorically to foreclose the benefit of chapter reorganization to a debtor who previously has filed for chapter relief.nothing in the code conditions chapter other benefits or remedies on discharge eligibility.see cain,at is an important tool in the chapter toolbox,and it is not conditioned on being eligible for a discharge.fisette,at we see no merit in the argument that allowing a strip off in a no discharge chapter case amounts to allowing the debtor a de facto discharge.and,for the reasons we have discussed,we think that if congress had meant to prohibit chapter debtors from voiding or modifying creditors in rem rights,it would not have done so by restricting the availability of a mechanism that by definition only affects in personam liability.
our interpretation gives full effect to congress intent to prevent abusive serial filings and successive discharges through bapcpa.prohibiting successive discharges helps curb abuse of the bankruptcy system by ensuring that a debtor once granted a discharge of debt is not granted yet a second discharge just a few years later.a debtor who has racked up significant credit card debt and received a chapter discharge,for example,will not obtain a second clean slate upon the filing of a chapter petition.further,we agree with the district court that reaching the contrary conclusion would create an extremely harsh result that is inconsistent with the bankruptcy code text and purpose.congress created the chapter mechanism to permit eligible debtors,who are capable of diligently meeting their obligations under plans,to reorganize their financial affairs and pay a greater amount on debts than they would have otherwise done under a chapter liquidation.section f does not purport to interfere with the important tool in the chapter toolbox.cain,at see davis,at positing that congress intended to leave intact the normal chapter regime where a debtor could otherwise satisfy the requirements for filing a chapter case.
interpreting the bankruptcy code to permit lien modification through case closure does not,as victorio warned,place debtors like the blendheims in a better position than debtors.victorio posited that debtors who fail to complete their plans will see their previously voided liens reinstated under dismissal provision,whereas chapter debtors can just have the case closed and thereby make the lien voidance permanent.at.we respectfully disagree.nothing in the code compels a bankruptcy court to close,rather than dismiss,a chapter case when a debtor fails to complete his plan.in addition,the availability of case closure does not eliminate a bankruptcy court duty to ensure that a debtor complies with the bankruptcy code best interests of creditors test,a,and the good faith requirement for confirming a chapter plan,id.a.rather,the bankruptcy court here properly conditioned permanent upon the successful completion of the chapter plan payments.if the debtor fails to complete the plan as promised,the bankruptcy court should either dismiss the case or,to the extent permitted under the code,allow the debtor to convert to another chapter.
in sum,we do not interpret bapcpa to limit a debtor access to chapter provisions by virtue of f limitation on successive discharges,and we conclude that a debtor ineligibility for a discharge has no bearing on his ability to permanently void a lien.we join the fourth and eleventh circuits in concluding that chapter debtors may permanently void liens upon the successful completion of their confirmed chapter plan irrespective of their eligibility to obtain a discharge.scantling,at davis,at.therefore,we hold that the blendheims ineligibility for a discharge does not prohibit them from permanently voiding hsbc lien.
voidance of the lien satisfied due process 
next,we turn to hsbc claim that the bankruptcy court failed to afford hsbc due process before voiding its lien.whether adequate notice has been given for the purposes of due process is a mixed question of law and fact that we review de novo.in re brawders,cir.
hsbc raises two related arguments in support of its due process claim,both of which essentially claim a lack of adequate notice.first,hsbc argues that the validity of its lien was not effectively determined under the procedural requirements set forth under the bankruptcy rules.federal rule of bankruptcy procedure requires actions determining the validity,priority,or extent of a lien to be brought in an adversary proceeding,which imposes certain notice requirements on plaintiffs.see fed.requiring service of adversary summons and complaint in compliance with federal rule of civil procedure.although hsbc acknowledges that the blendheims initiated an adversary proceeding to bring their motion for summary judgment seeking lien voidance,and thus the lien was technically voided in the adversary proceeding,hsbc contends that the lien was substantively voided by the disallowance order because the disallowance of its claim rendered voidance a fait accompli.accordingly,hsbc argues,the validity of its lien was actually decided outside of an adversary proceeding.second,hsbc argues that the bankruptcy court allowed hsbc lien to be avoided by ambush,because the blendheims never mentioned their intent to void hsbc lien in their objection to the proof of claim.according to hsbc,not only did the blendheims fail to give notice of their intent to seek voidance of the lien,but they affirmatively represented in several court filings that the lien was valid suggesting that they would not seek to void the lien.
both of hsbc arguments fail under the supreme court decision in united student aid funds,espinosa,d.in that case,the debtor filed a chapter petition and proposed a plan providing for repayment of the principal and discharge of the accrued interest on student loans he owed to united student aid funds,united.id.at.after being served with notice of the plan,united filed a proof of claim reflecting both the principal and the accrued interest on the loan.id.at.united did not,however,object to the plan proposed discharge of interest or espinosa failure to initiate an adversary proceeding to determine the dischargeability of that debt.the bankruptcy court eventually confirmed the plan,and the chapter trustee mailed united a notice of the plan confirmation,which advised united of its right to object within days.id.united did not object,and after espinosa successfully completed the plan,the court granted him a discharge of the student loan interest.id.at.
it was not until three years later,when united attempted to collect on the unpaid interest and espinosa moved for an order holding united in contempt for violating the discharge injunction,that united raised an objection to the discharge order.id.at.united complained that the bankruptcy code requires student loans to be discharged in an adversary proceeding,and because espinosa did not initiate any such proceeding or serve united with an adversary complaint,united was deprived of its due process rights.id.the court rejected united argument,explaining that the standard for constitutionally adequate notice is notice reasonably calculated,under all the circumstances,to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.id.at quoting mullane cent.hanover bank trust.because united received actual notice of the filing and contents of espinosa plan,which united acknowledged by filing a proof of claim,the court concluded,t his more than satisfied united due process rights.id.emphasis added.accordingly,the court held that there was no due process violation.id.
espinosa indicates that regardless of whether hsbc lien was technically voided in the adversary proceeding or upon entry of the default order,due process was satisfied when hsbc received notice that the blendheims filed their objection to its proof of claim.once hsbc received notice of that filing,it was deemed to have notice that its claim might be affected and it ignored the ensuing proceedings to its peril.see in re gregory,cir holding that for due process purposes,when the holder of a claim receives notice that the debtor has initiated bankruptcy proceedings,it is under constructive or inquiry notice that its claim may be affected,and it ignores the proceedings to which the notice refers at its peril.it bears emphasis that all that is constitutionally required for adequate notice is information sufficient to alert a creditor that its rights may be affected.see id.due process does not demand the degree of specificity of notice to which hsbc claims entitlement.it is neither the court nor the debtor responsibility to ensure that a creditor fully understands and appreciates the consequences of the bankruptcy proceeding.rather,it is hsbc responsibility,once apprised of the bankruptcy proceeding,to investigate the potential consequences in store for its lien.hsbc did not have to file a claim to preserve its lien but once it chose to do so,it subjected itself to the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court and its rules.and once the blendheims objected to hsbc claim pursuant to a,there can be no doubt that hsbc was on notice that there might be consequences.
indeed,the record shows that hsbc inexplicable failure to assert its rights,and not any defect in process,led to its predicament here.after hsbc filed a proof of claim in the blendheims chapter bankruptcy,the blendheims objected to the proof of claim and served hsbc servicing agent with a copy of the objection.hsbc failed to respond.then,the bankruptcy court entered the default order disallowing hsbc claim,and again,hsbc was served with a copy of the order.once again,hsbc failed to respond,taking no action to undo the disallowance order.the blendheims then initiated adversary proceedings declaring their intent to void the lien and the bankruptcy court advised hsbc to move to set the disallowance order aside.still,hsbc did nothing.hsbc waited over a year and a half after the default order was entered before it finally moved to set aside the disallowance order.predictably,the court found no excusable neglect present on these facts and declined to grant hsbc request.surely,the process given was sufficient to put hsbc on notice that its lien might be affected.
far from revealing a due process violation,the record shows that hsbc rights were honored at every turn.hsbc own failure to assert its rights,which resulted in the entry of the order,does not make the order constitutionally defective.accordingly,we affirm the district court determination that the bankruptcy court afforded hsbc due process.
d.the chapter petition was filed in good faith 
a chapter petition may be dismissed for cause,pursuant to c of the bankruptcy code,if it was filed in bad faith.in re eisen,cir per curiam.we review for clear error a bankruptcy court determination whether or not a plan was filed in bad faith.id.in determining whether a debtor acted in bad faith,a bankruptcy judge must review the totality of the circumstances,and consider the following factors 
whether the debtor misrepresented facts in his petition or plan,unfairly manipulated the bankruptcy code,or otherwise filed his chapter petition or plan in an inequitable manner 
the debtor history of filings and dismissals 
whether the debtor only intended to defeat state court litigation and 
whether egregious behavior is present.
