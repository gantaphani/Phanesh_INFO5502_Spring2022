we must decide whether a standing chapter bankruptcy trustee enjoys absolute immunity for scheduling and noticing a bankruptcy confirmation hearing.we agree with the bankruptcy appellate panel bap that the trustee and her assistant enjoy absolute immunity from liability for the decision to schedule the bankruptcy confirmation hearing.because we further conclude that the giving of notice is a part of the discretionary scheduling function,however,we reject the bap holding that immunity does not extend to the failure to give notice of the hearing.
factual and procedural background 
cherry barbara castillo filed this chapter bankruptcy case on september.nancy curry was appointed as trustee in castillo case.a staff attorney employed by her,julie feder,assisted curry with certain matters in the case.after castillo petition was filed,curry conducted an a meeting of creditors on october.at the meeting,curry decided on the basis of various irregularities in the petition that the a meeting should be continued to january.she believed that she could not determine the feasibility of castillo proposed plan until the court adjudicated objections to the plan on december.as curry conceded in her briefs to the bankruptcy court,due to a clerical error in her office,the confirmation hearing was actually set for december.neither castillo nor her counsel was notified of the rescheduled confirmation hearing date.nevertheless,on december,a confirmation hearing was held.castillo did not appear,and therefore did not provide proof that she had made the plan payments as required for confirmation.the trustee informed the court that a plan payment had not been made because one had not been recorded on the trustee books,even though castillo had in fact mailed a late payment to the trustee sometime after november.as a result,the debtor chapter case was dismissed on december.
castillo counsel,thomas leonard,received notice of the dismissal sometime after it was served on december,but did not take any action during the seven days before the mortgagee took advantage of the dismissal to foreclose on castillo residence on december.leonard then successfully moved to vacate the dismissal,as curry did not oppose the debtor motion to vacate.because castillo residence had been sold to a third party,however,the bankruptcy court refused to set aside the foreclosure sale.on january,castillo sought leave of the bankruptcy court to prosecute suit against the trustee and her staff attorney in los angeles county superior court.castillo also named her attorney,leonard,as a defendant,based on the fact that despite receiving timely notice of the dismissal,leonard office failed to file a motion to vacate the dismissal before the foreclosure sale date of december.
before the bankruptcy court,castillo contended that the trustee was negligent in scheduling the december,confirmation hearing without due notice to castillo or her counsel the trustee was not immune from suit and the requirement that castillo bring her state law claim against her bankruptcy attorney for any malpractice on his part in state court created a danger of conflicting rulings.the bankruptcy court granted castillo motion after hearing on february,by order entered march.the court reasoned that the trustee had a duty to provide due process to the debtor and that in this case debtor and debtor counsel were not given the proper due process,which resulted in serious consequences.the court also noted that the debtor had complied with her chapter requirements.
the trustee sought reconsideration of the bankruptcy court orders.in addition,attorney leonard moved the bankruptcy court for leave to against curry and feder in state court.the bankruptcy court denied curry motion for reconsideration after hearing on may,by order entered may.it also granted leonard motion for leave to sue curry and feder on july.
the bap granted leave to appeal what it viewed as the interlocutory bankruptcy court decision,citing in re kashani,cir.it then extended immunity for damages relating to the miscalendaring of the confirmation hearing,but not for damages resulting from the failure to give notice of the hearing.further ruling that the failure to give notice violated a duty imposed by law upon the trustee,the bap held that the suit could proceed under our decision in in re cochise college park,cir.
ii.jurisdiction 
curry challenges the bankruptcy court jurisdiction to grant castillo and leonard leave to sue and,in turn,appellate jurisdiction of the bap and our court to review those orders.
jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court 
curry asserts that the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction to hear castillo and leonard motion for leave to file suit against the trustee because the case had previously been dismissed and a bankruptcy court may not sua sponte reopen a dismissed bankruptcy case.curry has couched her argument as a challenge to the bankruptcy court power to reopen a previously dismissed case.however,as the bankruptcy judge noted,although the chapter case had been dismissed,it had not been closed.thus there was no need to reopen the case to hear the motion.in any event,a bankruptcy court has broad discretion to reopen a case sua sponte 
the court may issue any order,process,or judgment that is necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this title.no provision of this title providing for the raising of an issue by a party in interest shall be construed to preclude the court from,sua sponte,taking any action or making any determination necessary or appropriate to enforce or implement court orders or rules,or to prevent an abuse of process.
a see also b a case may be reopened in the court in which such case was closed to administer assets,to accord relief to the debtor,or for other cause.
a bankruptcy court decision to reopen is entirely within its sound discretion,based upon the circumstances of each case.in re elias,cir,citing in re rosinski,cir citizens bank trust case,cir in re rediker.as the seventh circuit has stated 
n umerous courts have ruled that jurisdiction is not automatically terminated with the dismissal of the underlying bankruptcy case,and that bankruptcy courts have discretion to retain jurisdiction over adversary proceedings.the rationale for retention of jurisdiction over an adversary proceeding is that some cases have progressed so far that judicial interference is needed to unravel or reserve the rights of parties.
in re statistical tabulating,cir quoting in re morris,cir.
even if the bankruptcy court had reopened a dismissed case,its decision could only be set aside for an abuse of discretion.in re slyman,cir.the trial court exercise of its discretion will not be disturbed unless there is a definite and firm conviction that the court below committed a clear error of judgment in the conclusion it reached upon a weighing of the relevant factors.in re eisen,cir internal quotations omitted.
regardless of whether the dismissal constituted some sort of constructive closure,we do not believe that the bankruptcy court abused its discretion by sua sponte setting aside the dismissal for the limited purpose of allowing the hearing on the motion to proceed,and allowing the entry of an order granting the motion.it was appropriate for the bankruptcy court to reopen the case to determine whether to grant leave because 
it is generally held that without leave of the bankruptcy court,no suit may be maintained against a trustee for actions taken in the administration of the estate.a court other than the appointing court has no jurisdiction to entertain an action against the trustee for acts within the trustee authority as an officer of the court without leave of the appointing court.

appellate jurisdiction 
contrary to the bap conclusion,the bankruptcy court orders denying curry claim of immunity were not interlocutory.under the collateral order doctrine of cohen beneficial industrial loan,courts have recognized that the denial of immunity is a final order.see,behrens pelletier,d the denial of qualified immunity is an appealable final order under the cohen doctrine.paine city of lompoc,cir denial of the absolute immunity accorded witnesses and participants in alleged conspiracies to testify falsely,like denials of other forms of absolute immunity,is a collateral order appealable in the absence of a final order under.jones city of jackson,cir typically,denials of qualified immunity,although not final orders,are immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine set forth in cohen.mendenhall riser,cir a lthough denials of qualified immunity on summary judgment are not final orders,they are immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine if based on an issue of law.fry melaragno,cir same.
here,the bankruptcy court orders granting castillo and leonard motions for leave to sue are orders denying immunity.they were final and appealable orders under the collateral order doctrine,so the bap had jurisdiction under a and b.similarly,the bap partial affirmance was final,and we have jurisdiction under d.

iv.immunity 
curry asserts immunity from suit under the theory that bankruptcy trustees are entitled to immunity for actions that are integrally related to the adjudication of the bankruptcy case.lonneker farms,klobucher,cir a trustee in bankruptcy is entitled to derived judicial immunity because he is performing an integral part of the judicial process.castillo and leonard argue that the supreme court decision in antoine byers anderson,d,redirects our inquiry away from whether actions performed by nonjudicial officers are integrally related to the judicial process to an examination of the nature of those functions.the trustee is immune for actions that are functionally comparable to those of judges,those functions that involve discretionary judgment.antoine,at.appellees concede that a bankruptcy trustee would enjoy absolute immunity for judicial functions involving the exercise of discretionary judgment,such as the decision to schedule a bankruptcy confirmation hearing,but contend there can be no immunity for purely ministerial acts,such as the failure to give notice of a hearing.trustee curry,as the proponent of the claim of absolute immunity,bears the burden of establishing that such immunity is justified.id.at.
judicial immunity 
common law has long recognized judicial immunity,a sweeping form of immunity for acts performed by judges that relate to the judicial process.forrester white,d imbler pachtman,d.this absolute immunity insulates judges from charges of erroneous acts or irregular action,even when it is alleged that such action was driven by malicious or corrupt motives,forrester,at,or when the exercise of judicial authority is flawed by the commission of grave procedural errors.stump sparkman,d.judicial immunity discourages collateral attacks on final judgments through civil suits,and thus promotes the use of appellate procedures as the standard system for correcting judicial error.forrester,at.most judicial mistakes or wrongs are open to correction through ordinary mechanisms of review.id.at.
immunity for nonjudicial officers 
absolute judicial immunity is not reserved solely for judges,but extends to nonjudicial officers for all claims relating to the exercise of judicial functions.burns reed,d scalia,concurring in part and dissenting in part.the supreme court has been quite sparing in its recognition of absolute immunity,and has refused to extend it any further than its justification would warrant.burns,at.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.yet the court has also guarded the traditional protections extended to the judicial process.forrester,at.specifically,judicial immunity has been readily extended to such nonjudicial officers as 
military and naval officers in exercising their authority to order to grand and petit jurors in the discharge of their duties as such to assessors upon whom is imposed the duty of valuing property for the purpose of a levy of taxes to commissioners appointed to appraise damages when property is taken under the right of eminent domain to officers empowered to lay out,alter,and discontinue highways to highway officers in deciding that a person claiming exemption from a road tax is not in fact exempt,or that one arrested is in default for not having worked out the assessment to members of a township board in deciding upon the allowance of claims to arbitrators,and to the collector of customs in exercising his authority to sell perishable property,and in fixing upon the time for notice of sale.
burns,at.quoting cooley,law of torts.
judicial or immunity is not available only to those who adjudicate disputes in an adversarial setting.rather,the immunity is extended in appropriate circumstances to non jurists who perform functions closely associated with the judicial process.cleavinger saxner,d.the supreme court has recognized that individuals,when performing functions that are judicial in nature,or who have a sufficiently close nexus to the adjudicative process,are entitled to a grant of absolute immunity.among those the court has found immune are prosecutors,when initiating a prosecution and presenting the state case,imbler,at.prosecutors,when taking acts and making decisions in preparation for the initiation of a prosecution or trial,buckley fitzsimmons,d burns,at.administrative law judges and agency hearing officers,when performing adjudicative functions within a federal agency,cleavinger,at.butz economou,at.agency officials,when performing functions analogous to those of a prosecutor,butz,at.agency attorneys,in arranging for the presentation of evidence in the course of an administrative adjudication,id.at.and individuals,when acting within the scope of their duties,who participate in the judicial process,such as grand jurors,petit jurors,advocates,and witnesses.id.at.burns,at.
in antoine,the supreme court worked a sea change in the way in which we are to examine absolute immunity for nonjudicial officers.antoine,d.the court announced that absolute immunity will be extended to nonjudicial officers only if they perform official duties that are functionally comparable to those of judges,duties that involve the exercise of discretion in resolving disputes.antoine,at.under this approach,to determine whether a nonjudicial officer is entitled to absolute immunity,courts must look to the nature of the function performed and not to the identity of the actor performing it.buckley,at.quoting forrester,at.stump,at.romano bible,cir.
antoine involved a section action against a seriously delinquent court reporter,who despite payment therefor and several court orders,failed to deliver a complete transcript of a criminal trial on appeal.reasoning that the making of the official record of a court proceeding by a court reporter is part of the judicial function,we concluded that the reporter was entitled to absolute immunity for actions within the scope of her authority.antoine byers anderson,cir,rev,d.
the supreme court disagreed that the issue could be
