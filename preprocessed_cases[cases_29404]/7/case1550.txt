this case presents the question whether a debtor transfer of funds to its sole shareholder,in repayment of a purported loan,may be a constructively fraudulent transfer under a b.in order to answer this question,we must determine whether a bankruptcy court has the power to recharacterize the purported loan as an equity investment.we hold that a court has the authority to determine whether a transaction creates a debt or an equity interest for purposes of,and that a transaction creates a debt if it creates a right to payment under state law.see,butner united states,d noting that congress has generally left the determination of property rights in the assets of a bankrupt estate to state law.because the district court concluded that it lacked authority to make this determination,we vacate the decision below and remand for further proceedings 
fitness holdings international,the debtor in this bankruptcy case,was a home fitness corporation.before declaring bankruptcy,the company received significant funding from two entities hancock park,its sole shareholder,and pacific western bank.defendants kenton van harten and michael fourticq both served on fitness holdings board of directors.fourticq was also a manager of hancock park.
between and,fitness holdings executed eleven separate subordinated promissory notes to hancock park for a total of.each note required fitness holdings to pay a specified principal amount to hancock park,plus interest of ten percent per year,on or before the note maturity date 
in july,pacific western bank made a million revolving loan and a million installment loan to fitness holdings,both of which were secured by all of fitness holdings assets.hancock park guaranteed these loans.fitness holdings and pacific western bank amended the loan agreement multiple times.the amendments eased fitness holdings obligations in various ways,for example,by extending the maturity dates on the revolving loan and waiving past breaches.
finally,in june,fitness holdings and pacific western bank agreed to refinance fitness holdings debt.under the terms of the agreement,pacific western bank made two loans to fitness holdings a million term loan,and an million revolving line of credit.these loans were also secured by all of fitness holdings assets.the loan agreement provided that upon closing,would be disbursed to pay off pacific western bank original secured loan,and would be disbursed to hancock park to pay off its unsecured promissory notes.the payoff of pacific western bank prior secured loan had the effect of releasing hancock park from its guarantee.
these attempts to save fitness holdings proved unsuccessful,and the company filed for chapter bankruptcy on october.a committee of unsecured creditors,acting on behalf of fitness holdings and its estate,filed a complaint against hancock park,pacific western bank,van harten,and fourticq to recover the payments made to hancock park as a result of the refinancing transaction with pacific western bank.the complaint also requested declaratory relief,asking the court to characterize the financing hancock park provided to fitness holdings in connection with the promissory notes as equity investments in fitness holdings,rather than extensions of credit.as a result,the complaint alleged,the transfer of to hancock park was constructively fraudulent.
on january,the bankruptcy court dismissed all claims against hancock park with prejudice.the case was subsequently converted to a chapter filing on april,in re fitness holdings int,bk br,dkt.cal.april.the following month,the bankruptcy court appointed a trustee for fitness holdings,who replaced the committee of unsecured creditors in the litigation.
the trustee appealed the bankruptcy court dismissal of the complaint to the district court,which affirmed the bankruptcy court and dismissed the case for failure to state a claim.in re fitness holdings int,fitness i,no.cv ag,wl.the district court held that,under longstanding precedent of the ninth circuit bankruptcy appellate panel,hancock park advances to fitness holdings were loans and,as a matter of law,it was barred from recharacterizing such loans as equity investments.id.at citing in re pacific express,cir 
the trustee timely appealed,claiming that the district court should have recharacterized hancock park payment of to fitness holdings as a payment in satisfaction of an equity interest rather than a debt,and then avoided fitness holdings transfer to hancock park as a constructively fraudulent transfer under a b of the bankruptcy code.

we begin by setting forth the legal framework for fraudulent transfers under a b of the bankruptcy code 
filing a petition in bankruptcy creates an estate made up of the debtor assets.schwab reilly,d.in a chapter bankruptcy,a trustee is appointed or elected to administer the estate.in order to protect the interests of the estate,a bankruptcy trustee may bring an action to avoid a transfer made before the bankruptcy that is allegedly either intentionally fraudulent,a a,or constructively fraudulent,a b bfp resolution trust,d.a transfer is constructively fraudulent,and thus can be avoided by the trustee,if the debtor made the transfer on or within two years before the date of filing the bankruptcy petition,the debtor received less than a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for such transfer or obligation,a b i,and one of four circumstances obtains 
in construing the statutory requirement that the debtor received less than a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for such transfer or obligation,a b i,we must turn to a series of interlocking statutory definitions.the key phrase in a b i,reasonably equivalent value,is not defined in the code.bfp,at.value is defined,however,and includes the satisfaction or securing of a present or antecedent debt of the debtor.d a.under this definition,p ayment of a preexisting debt is value,and if the payment is,full value is given.collier on bankruptcy ed.therefore,to the extent a transfer constitutes repayment of the debtor antecedent or present debt,the transfer is not constructively fraudulent.see freeland enodis,cir holding that there is reasonably equivalent value where payment of the accrued interest constituted forgiveness of a contractual debt.quoting in re carrozzella richardson.
we next address the definition of the term debt.the bankruptcy code defines debt to mean liability on a claim.see also johnson home state bank,d noting that debt has a meaning coextensive with that of claim.citing.of public welfare davenport,d.claim is defined,in relevant part,to mean a right to payment,whether or not such right is reduced to judgment,liquidated,unliquidated,fixed,contingent,matured,unmatured,disputed,undisputed,legal,equitable,secured,or unsecured.a.the code thus broadly defines debt as liability on virtually any type of right to payment.
under these interlocking definitions,to the extent a transfer is made in satisfaction of a claim,a right to payment,that transfer is made for reasonably equivalent value for purposes of a b i.and a determination that a transfer was made for reasonably equivalent value precludes a determination that it was constructively fraudulent under a b.see in re united energy,cir.
this analysis raises the further question of how courts are to determine whether there is a right to payment that constitutes a claim under the code.supreme court precedent establishes that,unles
