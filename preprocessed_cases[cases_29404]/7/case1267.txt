this case involves a dispute between a secured lender who held a security interest in its debtor inventory and subsequent purchasers of that inventory who left their purchased goods on the debtor premises over whose interest took priority when the debtor filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code.the bankruptcy court determined that the subsequent purchasers were buyers in the ordinary course of business,as defined in iowa code by virtue of their constructive possession of the goods,giving the buyers priority under iowa code.the eighth circuit bankruptcy appellate panel bap reversed,concluding that the buyers did not have constructive possession of the goods under iowa law.united bank of ia.indep.inputs in re ia.limestone.we now reverse the bap judgment and reinstate the decision of the bankruptcy court.
western iowa limestone,wil owned several quarries throughout iowa,and it began marketing agricultural lime as a of its operations in.it marketed the ag lime through six fertilizer and chemical dealers,who resold the ag lime at retail.in january,one of wil dealers,independent inputs,llc,purchased tons of ag lime from wil,and in february,two other dealers,paul leinen and leinen,collectively leinen and hereinafter,together with independent inputs,referred to as dealers,purchased a total of tons of ag lime.the dealers paid for the ag lime at the time of the purchases,and each of the bills of sale noted that the ag lime would remain at the quarry until the dealers sold the ag lime to their ultimate customers.this arrangement was beneficial to wil,which also provided trucking services.wil maintained its ag lime in a single fungible pile on its premises.the ag lime that the dealers purchased likewise remained in the fungible pile until resold to their customers and removed from the premises.
wil filed a petition under chapter of the bankruptcy code on december.at that time,independent inputs had resold and removed tons of ag lime from wil premises,and leinen had removed tons.united bank of iowa is wil largest secured creditor,and it had a security interest in all of wil assets,including its inventory,accounts receivable,and proceeds,to secure a million loan.the ag lime remaining on wil premises was sold in the bankruptcy proceedings as part of its inventory,and the dealers filed a joint objection to the proposed distributions from the sale of the inventory,claiming priority over united bank as buyers in the ordinary course of business bioc to the extent of the value of the ag lime they had purchased but had not yet removed from wil premises.independent inputs claim was for,and leinen claims were for.
the bankruptcy court initially determined that the dealers failed to establish bioc status under iowa law because they did not take physical possession of the ag lime or have a right to recover the goods under article of the iowa uniform commercial code iowa ucc as required by iowa code.on a motion to alter or amend,the bankruptcy court reversed itself,concluding that the dealers had taken constructive possession of the ag lime and had satisfied the requirements for bioc status under.united bank appealed,and the bap reversed,concluding that the dealers did not constructively possess the ag lime under iowa law for purposes of a priority contest between a secured creditor and a purchaser.because the bap concluded that the dealers did not have constructive possession of the ag lime,it avoided the separate issue of whether constructive possession satisfies the requirement of tak ing possession contained in.the dealers appeal from the bap decision.

under iowa ucc law,a buyer in ordinary course of business takes free of a security interest created by the buyer seller,even if the security interest is perfected and the buyer knows of its existence.iowa code.thus,the dealers take free of united bank prior security interest if they meet the definition of a bioc.buyer in ordinary course of business is defined by the iowa ucc as 
a person that buys goods in good faith,without knowledge that the sale violates the rights of another person in the goods,and in the ordinary course from a person in the business of selling goods of that kind.a person buys goods in the ordinary course if the sale to the person comports with the usual or customary practices in the kind of business in which the seller is engaged or with the seller own usual or customary practices only a buyer that takes possession of the goods or has a right to recover the goods from the seller under article may be a buyer in ordinary course of business.buyer in ordinary course of business does not include a person that acquires goods in a transfer in bulk or as security for or in total or partial satisfaction of a money debt.
relevant to this appeal,bioc status requires that the sale comport with the usual or customary practices for the kind of business involved and that the buyer take possession of the goods.the dealers do not claim that they had a right to recover under article.we begin with the central issue of this is,whether a buyer who purchases fungible goods from a seller but leaves the goods at the seller premises satisfies the requirement that the buyer take possession of the goods.id.we must determine whether constructive possession is within the meaning of the statute,and if so,whether the circumstances of this case amount to constructive possession sufficient to confer bioc status.
the penultimate sentence of the definition of a bioc requires that the buyer either take possession or ha ve a right to recover the goods from the seller under article.id.the requirement was added to the uniform commercial code ucc in,and the iowa legislature adopted the revised ucc provision verbatim in.the term possession is not defined in the iowa ucc,and does not elaborate on what is meant by tak ing possession.iowa courts determine legislative intent from the words chosen by the legislature absent a statutory definition or an established meaning in the law,words in the statute are given their ordinary and common meaning by considering the context within which they are used.city of waterloo bainbridge,iowa internal marks omitted.iowa courts look beyond the statute express terms only when the language is ambiguous.a statute is ambiguous if reasonable minds could differ or be uncertain as to the meaning of the statute.id.language that is plain,clear,and susceptible to only one meaning is unambiguous.id.
section refers only to possession,not to physical possession or constructive possession.in the context of,both physical possession and constructive possession are plausible meanings of the bare term possession,and we conclude that the term is ambiguous as used in.see first bank in lenox lamoni livestock sales,iowa ambiguity in the word possession dates from the introduction into the law of the concept of constructive possession.quoting jacobson aetna cas.sur.we therefore apply the rules of statutory interpretation to ascertain the iowa legislature intent in requiring a buyer to take possession before being considered a bioc.
in interpreting a statute,the supreme court of iowa looks to the common law to construe undefined terms.see lamoni livestock sales,at s s,meyer,iowa unless displaced by the ucc,the common law supplement s its provisions.in lamoni livestock sales,the court interpreted the term possession in the context of comment to iowa ucc,which distinguished between the characterization of goods as farm products or inventory depending on whether the goods were in the possession of a debtor engaged in farming operations or had come into the possession of a marketing agency.iowa code,cmt.the court relied on the concept of constructive possession to hold that livestock in the physical possession of a sale barn or marketing agency was nonetheless constructively possessed by the farmer who placed the livestock with the sale barn because the farmer retained ownership of the livestock.lamoni livestock sales,at.the supreme court of iowa noted that possession is not defined in the ucc and looked to property law concepts for an analogy.id.at see also iowa code,cmt.recognizing that possession is not defined and adopt ing the general concept as it developed under former article,which applied the principles of agency.
there is no reason to believe without some explicit indication that iowa courts would construe the undefined term possession to include constructive possession in some sections of the iowa ucc and not in others.see iowa code unless displaced by the particular provisions of this chapter referring to the iowa ucc,the principles of law and equity,including the law of principal and agent supplement its provisions.where the iowa legislature intended to supplant the common law in the ucc,it specifically provided so.for example,in defining control for purposes of a certificated security in,the comments specify that control has a particularized meaning and is not to be interpreted by reference to other bodies of law.see iowa code cmt.the comment provides that i n particular,the requirements for possession derived from the common law of pledge are not to be used as a basis for interpreting subsection c or d of.id.rather,t hose provisions are designed to supplant the common law concepts of constructive possession and the like.id.this comment recognizes that the iowa legislature intended courts to look to the common law to interpret undefined terms contained in the iowa ucc,and that under the common law of iowa,possession includes constructive possession.
the transfer of possessory rights as between the buyer and the seller is a logical point at which to sever the security interest held by the seller lender when the seller sells its goods in the ordinary course of its business.see,cmt.the penultimate sentence prevents a buyer that does not have the right to possession as against the seller from being a buyer in ordinary course of business.william hawkland,richard lord,charles lewis,frederick miller,hawkland ucc series app endix part ii suggesting that under the amendment,a buyer will become a bioc when the buyer becomes entitled to a possession remedy.construing possession to include constructive possession is consistent with this demarcation and with the purpose of the bioc status.if required physical possession to the exclusion of constructive possession,then a buyer who completed a sales transaction and placed goods with a bailee would not be considered a bioc,but would continue to be subject to the lender security interest.in this scenario,as between the buyer and the seller,the seller has no authority for regaining possession of the goods from the bailee,and the buyer clearly has the superior possessory interest as compared to the seller.further,at this point,the lender is secured by the proceeds of the sale and no longer needs the security provided by the goods themselves.see gmac bus.credit,ford motor in re ii,t he reason that a security interest does not continue in collateral that is sold to a buyer in ordinary course is that the security interest continues in the proceeds,thus protecting the secured creditor.see also white commercial code b normally a lender with a security interest in inventory intends the debtor to be able to sell the inventory free and clear.
in this situation,we see no reason for the buyer not to receive the inventory free of the lender security interest even though the buyer took constructive rather than physical possession of the goods.the outcome should not differ based on whether the bailee is a third party or is the seller,where,as here,the buyer completes the sales transaction,the buyer takes delivery of the goods at the seller premises,and the buyer and the seller explicitly agree that the seller will hold the goods for the buyer,such that the buyer constructively possesses the goods.see kunkel sprague bank,cir applying kansas law and holding that under the ucc,a seller loses its article right to stop delivery when the goods are constructively delivered to the buyer via a bailee,even when the bailee is the seller see also havens steel commerce bank,in re havens steel,holding that constructive possession satisfies the take possession requirement under missouri ucc.we hold that possession as used in iowa ucc includes constructive possession.
having determined that the requirement in iowa ucc may be met through constructive possession,we turn to the separate issue of whether the dealers satisfied the requirements of constructive possession under iowa law.the bankruptcy court concluded that the dealers had constructive possession of the ag lime,but the bap disagreed.according to the bap,under iowa law a buyer has constructive possession of goods held by the seller only if the buyer takes some visible and apparent step to inform the world of the change in possession from the seller to the buyer.in re ia.limestone,at discussing boothby brown,iowa,wl mcafee busby,iowa,iowa.the dealers assert that adoption of the ucc in the by the iowa legislature rendered these cases inapplicable,and that more recent cases support their position that they could take constructive possession of the ag lime without notice to the secured creditor.
we agree with the dealers that mcafee and boothby do not control on the issue of whether constructive possession under iowa law requires notice to the world of the change in ownership.both cases involved application of an iowa statute that specifically required notice when a seller retained actual possession no sale or mortgage of personal property,where the vendor or mortgagor retains actual possession thereof,is valid against existing creditors or subsequent purchasers without notice,unless a written instrument conveying the same is executed and acknowledged like conveyances of real estate,and filed for record.mcafee,at quoting iowa code emphasis added.iowa code explicitly required notice when the vendor retained actual possession.in mcafee,a husband claimed to have gifted a carriage to his wife to avoid a prior security interest.id.at.the court determined that the husband retained actual possession based on the facts that the carriage was used for and by the entire family and that,at that time in iowa history,personal property used in the house occupied by the husband and wife was deemed to be in the possession and control of the husband.id.at distinguishing pierson heisey,iowa iowa,where a father who gifted a piano to his daughter did not retain actual possession though the piano remained in his home because t here was no pretense the father used the property as his own.boothby relied on the same statute.see boothby,iowa,wl.section was subsequently transferred to iowa code and repealed by the iowa legislature in.see iowa code,historical notes noting the repeal by acts ch.notably,this was the same time that the iowa legislature initially adopted iowa ucc.see iowa code,historical notes noting that the section was added by acts ch.
section notice requirement that applied to vendors who retained actual possession is no longer on iowa books.without that statutorily mandated notice,we are left to determine what constitutes constructive possession under iowa law,and particularly whether the bap correctly concluded that notice to the world is required before a buyer can constructively possess goods left with the seller.the supreme court of iowa has described constructive possession as follows c onstructive possession of personal property by its owner exists where the owner has intentionally given the actual,the direct physical the property to another for the purpose of having him do some act for the owner to or with the property.lamoni livestock sales,at.ultimately,the court discussion of constructive possession focused on the knowledge and agreement of the part
