rehearing en banc was granted to determine,for credit card debt,the standards for bankruptcy nondischargeability under a a credit obtained by false or actual fraud.primarily at issue are whether credit card use constitutes a representation of intent to pay the loan thereby obtained intent to pay and,if so,whether the issuer may justifiably rely on it.universal card services ucs appeals the district court judgment affirming the bankruptcy court decision that the debt from constance mercer ucs card is dischargeable.we reverse and remand.
in september,when mercer received ucs,she was employed as a paralegal,having worked approximately years had a junior college degree and gross annual income of approximately and was familiar with card accounts and how obligations arise with them.she had begun gambling in casinos in as of ucs solicitation,she had developed a gambling obsession,financed by winnings and cash advances through.that year,she began having problems paying her bills and acquired at least six more cards four before ucs that november.
ucs solicitation followed a screening process begun months earlier.the credit bureau listed prospects based on ucs criteria,such as total revolving debt,bankruptcies,and existing credit utilization a risk score was established for each prospect.that score predicted the probability of an account,within a period,being delinquent for days or more.the maximum score was ucs required a minimum of.mercer was,evaluated at trial by ucs as very good.
from the resulting prospects,an outside vendor eliminated duplicates and those who either had requested not to be solicited or were located in high fraud areas.those remaining were matched against ucs internal risk and scoring models.for those still remaining,the credit bureau screened again to ensure no change in credit history or standing.as the fair credit reporting act requires according to ucs,ucs offered a card to each prospect including mercer.
in september,mercer completed,signed,and returned her acceptance to ucs,providing,among other things,her income and identifying data,such as her social security number.ucs checked this information against its database.a third credit bureau screening determined mercer ability to service a credit line limit.had there been any deterioration in credit history,ucs would have either withdrawn the offer or offered a lower limit.
on november,ucs opened mercer account,with a limit,and provided a card and cardmember agreement.the agreement stated,inter alia it was effective upon mercer was responsible for all amounts owed and she agree d to pay such amounts according to the terms by making at least a minimum payment in each billing cycle against the balance due.
mercer reached her limit within a month of,obtaining cash advances.each was used for gambling.four were on or before november,from an automatic teller machine atm at a casino nine,between november and december,from an atm at a bank and one,from another entity.on november,days after but before mercer reached her limit,her account was flagged by ucs for excessive transactions.ucs determined they were not egregiously excessive and cleared the account for further use.
mercer last was on december,only a month after.her first ucs monthly statement through,reflected a balance approximately.the minimum payment was not made.
the second statement requested the required payment and no.when contacted twice in february by ucs,mercer stated she was trying to become current,and did not know when she could make a payment later days post last,that she had consulted an attorney about bankruptcy.the final statement ending advised the account had been closed.quarterly,ucs reviewed its customers creditworthiness.but,because mercer limit had been reached during the first billing cycle,her review was irrelevant.notwithstanding her claimed inability to make the minimum payments,mercer checking account statements for that period reflect numerous atm cash withdrawals,including in casinos.for example,that for january reflected,totaling approximately.
on filing for chapter bankruptcy relief in april,mercer was indebted to nine for more than.most of those accounts including with ucs had been opened between march and december.she had lost approximately in gambling within two years prior to filing bankruptcy,including at least in,when her income from two jobs was approximately.
following trial in,mercer ucs debt was held dischargeable,the bankruptcy court ruling for,ucs relied on its own investigation,rather than on any representation by mercer therefore,ucs could not rely on her representation,if any,at and,even assuming ucs actually relied on any mercer representation,it would not have been justifiable,because ucs investigation was inadequate.universal card servs.mercer in re mercer.

although the amount of the debt at stake in this nondischargeability proceeding is relatively small,is involved in many consumer bankruptcies.accordingly,it is imperative that we clarify the standards governing nondischargeability of.
cards play a major role in,and promote,modern commerce.a few examples of their uses and importance follow.cards are a not for cash and checks,especially where they are not a viable medium,such as in telephone and internet purchases.see todd zywicki,the economics of credit cards,chap,spring.they help small retailers compete with larger ones,many of which have their own credit operations,by allowing the former to shift the risk of to the issuer.id.at.finally,cash advances,the focus of the case at hand,are a prompt,simple,and extremely convenient alternative to bank loans.
the downside for increased consumer credit is bankruptcy.see david snow,the dischargeability of credit card debt new developments and the need for a new direction,am,winter readily available cards tempt consumers,by loss of work,illness,or family difficulties,to attempt to tide themselves over and to postpone financial collapse or bankruptcy with little or no realistic prospect of success.filings increased from approximately in to million in decreasing somewhat in and.see american,annual total bankruptcy filings for,available at last checked.b ank,retail and industry advocates estimate consumer bankruptcies cost their businesses about billion a year.dawn kopecki jeffrey taylor,house,senate diverge on bills for bankruptcy,wall,at.as expected,that cost is passed along to customers.bankruptcies are said to cost each united states household annually,in part because,to recoup losses,issuers and other businesses increase customers interest rates.julie hyman,senate set to pass legislation to curb bankruptcy abuse.timess,at.
our court has not addressed the standards for a a nondischargeability.numerous others have,with conflicting theories emerging.because of the issue importance,the need for a uniform standard,and the many subissues in this case,arising out of a card being used to obtain funds for gambling,we address each element in detail.
in this regard,there is no statutory basis for distinguishing between cards obtained at the debtor initiative and those obtained in response to a solicitation.accordingly,although this case involves a card,the standard we not so confined.moreover,irrespective of how the debtor obtained the card,his intent to pay representation,and the creditor issuer actual reliance thereon,are the same.on the other hand,a card may be relevant as to whether that reliance was justifiable 
section a a excepts from discharge,inter alia,any debt for an extension of credit,to the extent obtained by false pretenses,a false representation,or actual fraud,other than a statement respecting the debtor financial condition.a a emphasis added.ucs contends that,with each mercer knowingly falsely represented her intent to pay and the bankruptcy court applied an incorrect standard in determining ucs failed to prove actual and justifiable reliance.
we apply the same standard of review as did the district court the bankruptcy court factual findings are reviewed for clear error its legal conclusions and mixed questions of fact and law,de novo,randall blake,evans matter of canion,cir.but,of particular importance to this case,the clear error standard does not apply to findings of fact resulting from application of an incorrect legal standard.see fabricators,technical fabricators,matter of fabricators,cir.
the operative terms in a a,false pretenses,a false representation,or actual fraud,carry the acquired meaning of terms of art and are terms.field mans,d.w here congress uses terms that have accumulated settled meaning under the common law,a court must infer,unless the statute otherwise dictates,that congress means to incorporate the established meaning of these terms.id.internal quotation marks,ellipses,and citations omitted.

the sole issue before the court was the level of reliance that a a requires a creditor to demonstrate.id.at.field concerned actual fraud,one of a a three nondischargeability bases.id.at.although not mean ing to suggest that the requisite level of reliance would differ if there should be a case of false pretense or false representation but not of fraud,the court did not settle the question.id.at.emphasis added.
for the understanding of actual fraud in when that term was added to a a by the bankruptcy reform act of,stat,the court looked to the most widely accepted distillation of the common law of torts the restatement second of torts.field,at.the restatement,however,does not define fraud,much less actual fraud instead,it discusses fraudulent misrepresentation.
prior to field,some courts defined differently a a three bases.see,montgomery ward,blackburn in re blackburn.likewise,our court has applied different,but somewhat overlapping,elements of proof for a a actual fraud,as opposed to false.see recoveredge pentecost,cir for false,knowing and fraudulent falsehood describing past or current facts that creditor relied upon for actual fraud,knowingly false representation with intent to deceive creditor,who relied on it and therefore sustained loss.we are not required to address whether such distinctions survived field 
ucs did not specify on which of the three bases it relied.it has contended throughout,however,that,similar to the earlier listed elements for actual fraud described in pentecost,mercer made a knowingly false representation,with intent to deceive,upon which it relied in extending her credit.both parties have briefed those elements.likewise,most courts considering have applied elements similar to those described in pentecost for actual fraud 
those elements are appropriate for determining because,as discussed infra,lends itself to that analysis.accordingly,for each,and by a preponderance of the evidence,grogan garner,d,ucs was required to prove mercer made a representation it was knowingly false it was made with the intent to deceive ucs ucs actually and justifiably relied on it and ucs sustained a loss as a proximate result of its reliance.
resolution of the issue at hand requires examining caldwell,cir,cert.denied,which held excepted from discharge were only debts obtained by actual overt false pretense or representation,not those created by obtaining credit through concealment of insolvency and present inability to pay.id.at emphasis added.the rationale underlying has been severely eroded in the modern world of credit transactions and the decision has been the subject of much criticism.sears,roebuck boydston matter of boydston,cir.
was governed by a a predecessor,a of the bankruptcy act of.it excepted,inter alia,liabilities for obtaining money or property by false pretenses or false representations.a repealed see field,at.actual fraud was added as a nondischargeability basis,some suggest,in order to eliminate distinction between overt and implied misrepresentation since the amendment,has caused confusion among our circuit bankruptcy courts 
when one has a duty to speak,both concealment and silence can constitute fraudulent misrepresentation an overt act is not required.see restatement second of torts,citibank,eashai in re eashai,cir.moreover,a misrepresentation need not be spoken it can be made through conduct.see id.cmt.accordingly,retains no validity it is overruled.
the difficulty in credit card cases is for the creditor,who does not deal with the debtor,to prove the elements of misrepresentation and reliance.eashai,at emphasis added see also universal card servs.feld in re feld.the bankruptcy court finding no actual and justifiable reliance on any representations by mercer was premised on an erroneous interpretation of the law.it did not address the other elements for.
based on our review,ucs has proved three of the five elements and part of another for the balance,we must remand for.through each,mercer represented her intent to pay.a question of fact for remand is whether the representation was knowingly false.if so,intent to deceive is present.in authorizing the loan,ucs actually relied on the representation whether that was justifiable is a question of fact for remand.finally,ucs loss unpaid loan was proximately caused by its reliance.
a representation of intent to pay was made at,not at.mercer card being did not preclude the representation.
many earlier cases held that,by,the debtor represented both intent and ability to pay the ability factor has been criticized for improperly shifting the burden of proof,making the debtor a guarantor of her financial condition and because it gives preferential treatment to issuers,making too easily nondischargeable moreover,even if could be understood as a representation not only of intent,but also ability,to pay,the latter is not actionable under a a as noted,it excludes from its scope a statement respecting the debtor financial condition.a a emphasis added 
many,more recent,cases hold that is a representation of intent to pay with payments pursuant to the schedule when the representation is confined to intent,not ability,to pay,there is no risk it will have the undesirable consequence of making the debtor a guarantor of her financial condition mercer apparently agrees.in her appellate briefs,she implicitly concedes that,with each,she represented her intent to pay.on the other hand,several bankruptcy courts have held is not a representation.for example,universal card servs.alvi in re alvi,emphasis added,held it involves no representation,express or implied 
alvi,at,relied on williams united states,d.williams had been charged with a crime under knowingly false statement to influence action of certain financial institutions.id.at.applying the rule of lenity,the court rejected the government contention that a drawer of a check is generally understood to represent he currently has funds on deposit sufficient to cover it,id.at,holding a check is not a factual assertion at all,and therefore can not be characterized as true or false,and thus did not make any representation as to the state of williams bank balance.id.at.emphasis added.alvi reasoned t he similarities between the issuance of a check and compel concluding that ordinary is not a representation accordingly,in and of itself is not capable of being true or false.alvi,at emphasis added.
williams does not compel that conclusion.even assuming a check is a representation of sufficient funds,this would be a statement respecting financial condition,not actionable under a a.in any event,the drawer does not request an extension of credit from his bank instead,he draws on his funds on deposit.if they are not sufficient to cover the check,the bank will not honor it.because the drawer is not seeking an extension of credit from his bank,he is not making a representation,by,of intent to pay a loan from his bank.on the other hand,is both a request to the issuer for a loan against a line of credit and a promise to pay.inherent in the loan being made and the consideration therefor is that promise without it,there is no loan,merely a gift.see la capitol fed.credit union melancon in re melancon.moreover,field,decided after,and unlike,williams,concerns a civil statute.field directed that a a be interpreted in accordance with the common law 
we agree with the ninth circuit that each forms a unilateral contract the holder promises to repay the debt and the issuer performs by reimbursing the merchant who accepted the card in payment.anastas american sav.bank in re anastas,cir emphasis added see restatement second of contracts cmt.b where each loan is the sole consideration for the corresponding part of the continuing guaranty for future loans,the guaranty is often characterized as an offer for a series of separate contracts,cited in anastas,at mercer understood that,on,ucs established a line of credit for her,providing the opportunity to obtain goods,services,and cash from entities with which ucs had contracted,with ucs reimbursing the merchants and looking to her for payment.her provided,inter alia signified acceptance of the agreement,including the obligation to pay the charges by making at least the minimum monthly payments.
of course,by,mercer was not obligated to use that credit.but,by,she requested a loan against that line and,by approving each,and therefore reimbursing the merchant,including an atm owner,ucs made a loan to her.see melancon,at.her promise to pay occurred not when the line was established,but at,when the loan was made.see id.with each,mercer did not say anything to ucs.again,her conduct was a loan request and promise to pay.see feld,at absence of express statement with completely consistent with fraud doctrine,which recognizes representation can be made through conduct.
the common law of fraud supports a representation through.the restatement does not define representation it does define misrepresentation,which denote s not only words spoken or written but also any other conduct that amounts to an assertion not in accordance with the truth.restatement second of torts,cmt.b emphasis added.a misrepresentation can be one of fact,opinion,intention or law.id.emphasis added.
if,as here,the misrepresentation concerns intention to perform an agreement,that intention may be expressed but it is normally merely to be implied from the making of the agreement.id.cmt.c emphasis added.a promise necessarily carries with it the implied assertion of an intention to perform.id.emphasis added.accordingly,mercer representation included her implied assertion of an intention to perform.id.emphasis added.
likewise,it is of no moment that,with,mercer did not deal directly with ucs,but instead with the merchant including through an atm machine which accepted her card.based on her testimony,mercer intend ed,or ha d reason to expect her representation would be communicated to ucs,and that it would influence ucs conduct.id.emphasis added 
scienter distinguishes actual or positive fraud from constructive fraud,or that implied by law fraud actionable under a a is the positive type.see,ames moir.fraud in the act defining nondischargeability means positive fraud,or fraud in fact,involving moral turpitude or intentional wrong,and not implied fraud,or fraud in law,which may exist without the imputation of bad faith or immorality emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted anastas,at same under a a pentecost,at same.inferring,from,a representation of intent to pay does not violate this principle under a a,the creditor still must prove all of the other elements of fraud,including scienter knowingly false representation 
the appropriate focus with respect to a debtor intent is whether she acted in bad faith by knowingly making a false representation.the bankruptcy court did not address whether mercer representations were knowingly false.a misrepresentation is fraudulent if the maker knows or believes the matter is not as represented,or does not have the confidence in the accuracy of his representation as stated or implied,or knows he does not have the basis for his representation as stated or implied.restatement second of torts emphasis added.a representation of the maker own intention to do a particular thing is fraudulent if he does not have that intention.id.emphasis added.if he does not have it,he must of course be taken to know that he does not have it.id.cmt.b emphasis added see also melancon,at one always knows his present intentions.
the representation of intent to pay is false if there is use without that intent.see,anastas,at american express travel related servs,hashemi in re hashemi,cir,cert.denied,d.many courts have listed various factors to consider in determining whether the representation was made with the requisite scienter.in eashai,at,the ninth circuit referenced the factors listed in citibank,dougherty in re dougherty,the time between and the bankruptcy filing whether,prior to,an attorney was consulted about bankruptcy the number of charges their amount the debtor financial condition at whether the limit was exceeded whether multiple charges were made on the same day whether the debtor was employed her employment prospects her financial sophistication whether her buying habits changed suddenly and whether luxuries or necessities were purchased.see also,rembert,at feld,at.others have rejected their use 
we agree with the ninth circuit that such factors are nonexclusive none is dispositive,nor must a debtor conduct satisfy a minimum number to constitute fraudulent intent.hashemi,at.in most instances,a bankruptcy court consideration of these factors will be helpful.it should consider them,together with any other facts and circumstances it may find proper,in determining whether,at,the debtor knew her representation was false.
in this regard,and as the ninth circuit has stressed,the debtor financial condition at is only one of many factors to consider,and should not be the sole basis for finding fraudulent intent.anastas,at our precedent in boydston,is not at odds with this.
boydston concerned credit purchases the creditors claimed the debts were nondischargeable under the predecessor to a a,asserting acquisition with no intent to pay.id.at.the bankruptcy court found they failed to establish subjective intent not to pay our court found no clear error.but,it stated where hopeless insolvency at the time of the purchases makes payment impossible,fraudulent intent may be inferred.id.at emphasis added.although this appears to conflict with the ninth circuit much later statement in anastas,the point being made in boydston was that hopeless insolvency,when the charges were made,was merely one method of establishing the debtor subjective intent not to pay.boydston,at emphasis added.
to the extent boydston could be interpreted as requiring a bankruptcy court to infer fraudulent intent solely on the basis of hopeless insolvency at,it would be inconsistent with the restatement.it requires,instead,that the inquiry focus on the debtor subjective intent,with such hopeless insolvency simply being evidence from which his lack of honest belief may be inferred.restatement second of torts cmt.d emphasis added see also feld,at field and restatement make clear that,under common law,subjective standard must be applied in determining fraudulent intent.
accordingly,hopeless insolvency,or inability to pay,at may support finding the debtor did not intend to pay,but only if she was aware of her financial condition and knew she could not and therefore did not intend to make even the minimum monthly payment to the issuer.see restatement second of torts cmt.d intention not to perform may be shown by any evidence that sufficiently indicates its existence,as,for example,the certainty that he would not be in funds to carry out his promise emphasis added melancon,at if the debtor has no idea how the money will get paid back,or if it will get paid back,then he may hope to may even want to he certainly does not intend to repay.emphasis added.
a debtor rarely will admit is incurred with the intention of not paying it therefore,the creditor may rely on circumstantial evidence to prove the debtor state of mind at in order to prove a debtor fraudulent intent under a a,the creditor must present sufficient evidence to convince the trier of fact that,as discussed,the debtor made the statement of intent in bad is,knowing it was false.pentecost,at.in this regard,the aim of the objective factors enumerated supra is to discern the debtor subjective intent.citibank,michel,o bviously the court must consider evidence that is probative of the debtor intent to repay in addition to considering the debtor demeanor,but the ultimate inquiry still seeks to determine the debtor subjective intent.ultimately,in cases such as this one,where a debtor testifies as to her subjective intent,the bankruptcy court must make a credibility determination,considering the debtor testimony,along with other objective circumstantial evidence of the debtor subjective intent.see matter of sheridan,cir while certain objective circumstantial evidence may support an inference of fraud,it does not compel such a conclusion when the trial judge finds the debtor contrary testimony to be credible.accordingly,on remand,in addition to mercer testimony that she intended to pay,all of the facts and circumstances surrounding her may be considered in determining mercer subjective intent.
cases such as this one,involving to finance gambling,with the claim of intent to pay with gambling winnings,present a particularly difficult challenge for determining whether the debtor,at,subjectively intended to pay obviously,gamblers gamble with the hope of winning,not losing.mercer so testified.but,hoping to win is not synonymous with intending to pay.a statement of intent i will repay is distinguishable from a hope or a desire to do so.it suggests a plan to repay,and an anticipated source of funds from which it might be made.melancon,at.accordingly,if a debtor presents evidence of alternative sources of sufficient to make her minimum payment,her intent with regard to her gambling winnings would be less relevant.
therefore,in determining whether mercer subjectively intended to pay obtained to finance gambling,one relevant inquiry is what mercer intended to do with any winnings.did she intend to use them to pay her,or to finance more gambling see id.at suggesting court should inquire whether debtor has ever gambled and won,and what she did with winnings.
the bankruptcy court did not consider intent to deceive.of course,if the debtor does not know the representation is false,there is no misrepresentation therefore,she does not intend to deceive.see fcc card friend in re friend.nevertheless,the restatement treats the elements separately.see restatement second of torts cmt.b state rules that determine whether a representation is fraudulently made,rules regarding maker purpose to induce the recipient to act in reliance upon the misrepresentation see also chevy chase bank fsb kukuk in re kukuk,fraudulent nature of representation separate from intent to deceive to influence conduct.
intent to deceive is present if the debtor intends or has reason to expect the creditor to act or to refrain from action in reliance upon the misrepresentation.restatement second of torts.a result is intended if the actor either acts with the desire to cause it or acts believing that there is a substantial certainty that the result will follow from his conduct.id.cmt.
with,and the concomitant representation of intent to pay,the cardholder intent is for the creditor,in reliance on that representation,to approve the requested loan,melancon,at accordingly,if the bankruptcy court finds that,by,mercer made a knowingly false representation of intent to pay,then the separate requisite intent to deceive is also present.
ucs had the burden of proving not only that it actually relied on mercer representation,but also that its reliance was justifiable.see restatement second of torts.the effect vel non of the card being comes into play here.
in bankruptcy court,the parties did not devote much attention to actual reliance.it is treated extensively here,for the most part,in order to respond to judge dennis dissent.the parties stipulated mercer was familiar with card accounts and how obligations arise in connection with them and she admitted that,through,she incurred a debt to ucs.the trial focus was primarily on the scienter element and on justifiable reliance.perhaps for that reason,most of the testimony of ucs bankruptcy specialist ucs witness dealt with ucs screening process and the information it had available to it before offering mercer a card.concerning actual reliance,ucs witness testified as follows 
based on ucs records with regard to this information,would ucs have extended credit to mercer if it knew that she would not pay or did not have ability to pay for these charges on this account 
i would say no.
emphasis added.
this lack of emphasis on actual reliance is shown by mercer closing argument instead being directed primarily at the representation and scienter elements.contrary to her later appellate briefs position,she argued was not a representation of intent to pay.as a result,she did not expressly argue that ucs failed to prove actual reliance on representations.instead,she argued that,at,ucs did not rely on any representations by her.
in its bankruptcy court brief,ucs contended actual reliance was demonstrated by its extension of credit loan to mercer at each.mercer responsive brief took a different approach ucs could not show actual and justifiable reliance when,at or before,it had an opportunity to make an adequate investigation passively extending credit at did not constitute reliance on subsequent.
regarding actual reliance,the bankruptcy court held 
ucs solely relied on its own agents and investigative processes to make its decision.the evidence reflects nothing written,said or done by mercer upon which ucs relied at any time at.
the court concludes that without the establishment of reliance on mercer representations at the time the card was issued,reliance will not attach to the representations,if any,made by mercer with the subsequent use of the card.under the circumstances of this case,where the credit card was,based solely on ucs screening process,performed through various credit bureaus and the risk score,there was no actual reliance by ucs on representations made by mercer.
mercer,at emphasis added.
the finding of nothing written,said or done by mercer upon which ucs relied at,was influenced by an erroneous interpretation of the law as requiring reliance on representations by the debtor,regarding her financial condition,at,in order for the issuer to rely on subsequent representations at.prior to the passage,the bankruptcy court,at,quoted at length from universal card services ellingsworth in re ellingsworth,which held a creditor can not justifiably rely on any representation,or the absence thereof,made by a card holder if the card was,and no direct financial information was obtained by the issuer.id.at emphasis added.
the actual reliance inquiry must focus on the representations,through,of intent to pay,even if,for,the issuer relied on its investigation of the debtor creditworthiness,rather than on any representations by her.again,any such representations,regarding her financial condition,are not actionable under a a,and can not support actual reliance on subsequent intent to pay representations.because the bankruptcy court factual finding of no actual reliance on representations is based on an incorrect interpretation of the law,it is not insulated by the clearly erroneous standard of review.see fabricators,at 
the record does not contain briefs filed in district court.the district court held the bankruptcy court correctly applied the law in determining whether ucs actually and justifiably relied on mercer representations,if any and the bankruptcy court did not clearly err in finding the evidence reflects nothing written,said or done by mercer upon which ucs relied at.
in its briefs before the panel,in addressing actual reliance,ucs contended the bankruptcy court applied the wrong standard and erroneously concluded that ucs did not actually rely on mercer representations despite the uncontested fact it advanced the funds she requested with each actual reliance was demonstrated by this credit extension and her representation of intent to pay was a substantial factor in its making the requested loans.emphasis added.in its supplemental en banc brief,ucs reiterated these contentions in support of its credit extension proving actual reliance on mercer representations.
mercer panel brief did not respond directly it asserted,conclusorily,that the finding should be affirmed.in her supplemental brief,mercer,for the first time,attempted to respond,maintaining,consistent with the bankruptcy court,that,because ucs did not actually rely on any representations at,it was precluded from relying on any at subsequent.
the recipient of a fraudulent misrepresentation can recover only if he in fact relies upon the misrepresentation and his reliance is a substantial factor in bringing about his loss.restatement second of torts cmt.a emphasis added.that comment refers to the restatement rule on causation in fact,which provides,similarly,that the reliance must be a substantial factor in determining the course of conduct that results in his loss.id.emphasis added.accordingly,actual reliance is the equivalent of 
the standard of actual reliance requires little of the creditor,city bank trust vann in re vann,cir emphasis added it must prove it in fact relied upon the representations of the debtor.id.at.moreover,as mentioned,such reliance need not be the cause of the issuer actions it is enough that the representation has played a substantial part,and so has been a substantial factor,in influencing his decision.restatement second of torts cmt.b emphasis added citation omitted.
courts that recognize as an intent to pay representation generally have concluded that the issuer extension of credit constitutes actual reliance on such representation obviously,the debtor promise to pay is an essential factor in the issuer decision to make the requested loan it would not do so without it.likewise,the debtor conduct causes the issuer loss when it reimburses the merchant and the debtor does not pay 
some bankruptcy courts have held an issuer passive extension of credit does not constitute reliance on,that it can not sit back and do nothing and still meet the standard for actual and justifiable reliance when it had an opportunity to make an adequate examination or investigation.alvi,at emphasis added another line of cases holds that the issuer relies only on the cardholder promise to pay,and not on any representations emanating from subsequent.see gm card cox in re cox,because includes promise to pay,it would be irrational for a fact finder to conclude the issuer relied upon a later implied representation of intent to pay we disagree with both lines of cases.
first,alvi and its progeny also hold is not a representation.we have rejected that proposition.
second,for actual reliance,the representation at issue is the intent to pay the loan obtained through.the fact that an issuer based its decision on its investigation of the debtor creditworthiness does not preclude the issuer from relying also on the debtor subsequent intent to pay representation.similarly,consistent with the restatement second of torts comment b,reliance on the debtor promise does not preclude relying also on the representation.moreover,reliance on the alone would be insufficient again,there is no loan to pay until see melancon,at see also manufacturer hanover trust ward in re ward,cir merritt,dissenting without issuer reliance on promise to pay through,consideration is lacking,and contract is voidable the opposite result would undermine credit cards as a medium of exchange emphasis added 
in sum,an issuer usually will be able to establish actual reliance by showing it would not have approved the loan in the absence of debtor promise to pay through.it is undisputed that,for each mercer,ucs authorized the requested loan.obviously,her intent to pay representation,through,was a substantial factor in ucs decision to make each loan.equally obvious,if she had not used the card,ucs would not have made a loan nothing would have occurred as a matter of law,ucs actually relied on mercer representations.
concerning justifiable reliance,the restatement has a special rule for representations of intention,as at issue here.reliance is justifiable if the existence of the intention is material and the recipient has reason to believe that it will be carried out.id.emphasis added.
for the existence of the intention,the recipient is justified in relying on a representation only if it gives him reason to believe that the intention is firmly entertained and,therefore,to expect that it will be carried out.whether the recipient has reason for this belief depends upon the circumstances under which the statement was made,including the fact that it was made for the purpose of inducing the recipient to act in reliance upon it and the form and manner in which it was expressed.id.cmt.
for the existence of the intention being material,id.cmt.b see also id,commentary contains a to,which defines materiality.it is present when,in deciding on a course of action,a reasonable man would attach importance to its existence or the maker of the representation knows or has reason to know its recipient regards or is likely to regard the matter as important,although a reasonable man would not so regard it.id.emphasis added 
as a matter of law,the materiality element is present here in determining whether to approve the loan requested by,a reasonable issuer would attach importance to the existence of a cardholder representation of intent promise to pay that loan.see melancon,at i f the representation is a necessary part of the transaction,it is material.
the second prong for justifiable reliance on a statement of intention is reason to believe the intention will be carried out.if the recipient knows facts that will make it impossible for the maker to carry out his intention,the recipient can not be justified in his reliance.restatement second of torts cmt.c emphasis added.
the comment use of knows,and its omission of should have known,suggest strongly that,for justifiable reliance on a representation of intention,the recipient is not required to conduct an investigation.section confirms this the recipient of a fraudulent misrepresentation of fact is justified in relying upon its truth,although he might have ascertained its falsity had he made an investigation.id.emphasis added.
this rule applies even when the investigation could be made without any considerable trouble or expense on the other hand,if a mere cursory glance would have disclosed the representation falsity,its falsity is regarded as obvious id.cmt.a emphasis added.in this regard,t he recipient of a fraudulent misrepresentation is not justified in relying upon its truth if he knows that it is false or its falsity is obvious to him.id.emphasis added.
field,which involved a misrepresentation of fact,relied on no duty to investigate in concluding that,for a a actual fraud,the standard is justifiable,not reasonable,reliance.field,at.but,speaks only about fraudulent misrepresentations of fact.the case at hand involves a representation of intention,prompting whether applies.
the answer is found in the commentary to.as mentioned,provides the general rule of liability for fraudulent misrepresentations of fact,opinion,intention,or law.
strictly speaking,fact includes not only the existence of a tangible thing or the happening of a particular event or the relationship between particular persons or things,but also the state of mind,such as the entertaining of an intention or the holding of an opinion there is sometimes,however,a marked difference between what constitutes justifiable reliance upon statements of the maker opinion and what constitutes justifiable reliance upon other representations.therefore,it is convenient to distinguish between misrepresentations of opinion and misrepresentations of all other facts,including intention.
restatement second of torts cmt.d emphasis added see also manufacturers hanover trust pannell in re pannell,a person intent,his state of mind,is capable of ascertainment and a statement of present intention is deemed a statement of a material existing fact,sufficient to support a fraud action.emphasis added internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
therefore,for justifiable reliance,one form of a representation of fact is one of intention.see kukuk,at comments to provide representations of fact include those of intention.accordingly,rule applies.concomitantly,field,even though it dealt with a representation of fact rather than of intention,is controlling with respect to whether an issuer has a duty to investigate.
in addition to its citing and,dealing with no duty to investigate and obviousness of the representation falsity,field also cited the restatement for contributory negligence not being a bar to recovery because fraudulent misrepresentation is an intentional tort.field,at.emphasis added see also restatement second of torts.field contrasted justifiable and reasonable reliance 
although the plaintiff reliance on the misrepresentation must be justifiable this does not mean that his conduct must conform to the standard of the reasonable man.justification is a matter of the qualities and characteristics of the particular plaintiff,and the circumstances of the particular case,rather than of the application of a community standard of conduct to all cases.
at.quoting restatement second of torts cmt.b emphasis added.
in addition to the restatement,field cited other treatises to support the applicable standard being justifiable,not reasonable,reliance.id.at.they state similarly that the recipient of a fraudulent misrepresentation may justifiably rely on it unless its falsity is obvious or there are red flags indicating such reliance is unwarranted.see id.i t is only where,under the circumstances,the facts should be apparent to one of his knowledge and intelligence from a cursory glance,or he has discovered something which should serve as a warning that he is being deceived,that he is required to make an investigation of his own quoting prosser,law of torts,ed id.at recipient is entitled to rely upon representations of fact of such a character as to require some kind of investigation or examination on his part to discover their falsity,and a defendant who has been guilty of conscious misrepresentation can not offer as a defense the plaintiff failure to make the investigation or examination to verify the same quoting harper james,law of torts,emphasis added see also mayer spanel int l matter of mayer,cir.the common law of fraud does not have any requirement.emphasis added,cert.denied,d.
despite field guidance,reliance has been found unjustifiable by some courts if they conclude that,prior to,the issuer creditworthiness investigation was inadequate for example,the holding in ellingsworth,relied on by the bankruptcy court in the case at hand,was that the issuer can not justifiably rely on a representation if the card was,and no direct financial information was obtained by the issuer.at emphasis added.the court was critical of based on the debtor risk score,income,and employment,without the issuer also considering her assets,secured debt,and other living expenses.id.at.ellingsworth reasoning resembles the assumption of risk doctrine applied in ward,at,a case,which held unless the issuer conducts a credit check,it assumes the risk that the debtor will not pay loans 
a different kind of assumption of risk doctrine was adopted by the eleventh circuit in first national bank of mobile roddenberry,cir,decided under a a predecessor.a few years after applying for,and receiving,cards from a bank,the cardholder engaged in a credit card spending spree.id.at.although the bank advised merchants calling for authorization of charges to retrieve the card,she was able to use it without detection,by making small purchases,and continued doing so,even after filing bankruptcy.id.at.
roddenberry pre a a held the issuer assumes the risk of nonpayment until it unconditionally revokes the right to card possession and use,and the cardholder is aware of the revocation.id.at this theory has received considerable criticism moreover,many bankruptcy courts in the very circuit that rendered the opinion have interpreted it as not precluding nondischargeability for actual fraud added by the amendment,which most of those courts define as occurring through without intent to pay 
for several reasons,we reject both the roddenberry and ward variations of assumption of risk.interestingly,mercer did not rely on it.in fact,at closing argument,her counsel stated he was not urging its adoption in all fairness it goes a little bit too far.
first,roddenberry would make it virtually impossible for any issuer to prevail under a a.the bankruptcy code should not be interpreted to require issuers to assume the risk that cardholders will commit fraud rather,the credit card transaction like any other lending relationship is premised upon the notion that both parties will act in good faith.thus,the debtor is expected to make bona fide use of the card and not engage in fraud.chevy chase bank,fsb briese in re briese,emphasis added 
second,because the assumption of risk theory does not consider the debtor intent in incurring,it is likely to result in the discharge of debt,contrary to the language and purpose of a a see grogan,at.bankruptcy code fresh start policy for benefit of honest but unfortunate debtors,not perpetrators of fraud sovran bank,allen in re allen,judicial attempts to engraft a fresh start policy onto a b,regarding false financial statements are properly viewed with skepticism.because the policies underlying questions of dischargeability are sharply conflicting,decisions about the scope of the nondischargeability provisions are best left to congress where legislative techniques and the safeguard of political accountability can ensure that the conflicting policies are resolved in a legitimate manner.
moreover,such assumption of risk could have the unintended consequence of encouraging dishonest debtors,especially those with cards,to undertake spending sprees,until they have reached their credit limits,knowing their debts will be discharged,as long as they wait at least days before filing.see a c supp consumer debt for luxury goods or services,or cash advances aggregating more than,within days before filing presumptively nondischargeable obviously,a dishonest but patient debtor who intends to incur in contemplation of discharge easily could avoid this period.see universal card servs.pakdaman.likewise,adoption of this theory undoubtedly would result in increased credit costs for honest.see citibank,senty in re senty.
finally,this assumption of risk theory is inconsistent with the common law,as expressed in the restatement.simply put,it confuses assumption of risk with contributory negligence,as those doctrines are commonly understood.compare restatement second of torts contributory negligence with id.cmt.c assumption of risk.fraud being an intentional tort,a victim contributory negligence is not a defense see restatement second of torts cmt.on the other hand,as discussed,the recipient of a fraudulent misrepresentation can be said,in a sense,to have assumed the risk of relying on the representation only when he knows it is false or it is obvious that reliance is unjustified.accordingly,if an issuer does not know the falsity of the user representation of intent to pay,or if it is not obvious that reliance on the representation is unjustified,the issuer does not assume the risk the cardholder will commit fraud.
the ninth circuit justifiable reliance standard for is consistent with field and the restatement the issuer justifiably relies on a representation of intent to pay as long as the account is not in default and any initial investigations into a credit report do not raise red flags that would make reliance unjustifiable.anastas,at emphasis added see eashai,at although a person ordinarily has no duty to investigate the truth of a representation,a person can not purport to rely on preposterous representations or close his eyes to avoid discovery of the truth emphasis added hashemi,at this standard appropriately recognizes the unique nature of credit card transactions,the ability of a cardholder to mask an actual financial condition by making minimum payments from whatever sources,and the issuer lack of access to the cardholder present financial condition at each.universal card servs.searle,for,adopting ninth circuit justifiable reliance standard.
of course,if the issuer discovers red flags during a investigation or during the lending relationship,such as unemployment or insufficient income to service existing debt,it probably would not be justified in relying on a representation of intent to pay.see briese,at reliance unjustified where issuer investigation revealed high debt load and an inability to make more than minimum payments issuer thus ignored an obvious risk in extending credit 
although the bankruptcy court cited field and stated the applicable justifiable reliance standard,mercer,at,it did not apply it.instead,it held even assuming ucs actually relied on any representations by mercer,it was not justifiable in light of the incomplete nature of the credit information obtained by ucs.id.at.it suggested if ucs does not want its cardholders to use cash advances for gambling purposes and wants such uses to be,why not put a specific restriction on this use in the cardholder agreement.id.at emphasis added.
at trial,the bankruptcy judge had suggested a number of questions ucs should have asked mercer before,such as whether she was married had other credit cards or loans and had a gambling addiction.it had also asked why ucs did not prohibit at atm machines in casinos.at the trial conclusion,the court had suggested that,in addition to relying on credit bureau information and risk scores,issuers could ask,among other things,whether the debtor has any problem with gambling owes any gambling debts and has had any gambling losses or winnings over the past several years.it had also suggested issuers should be required to exercise due diligence.needless to say,the applicable justifiable reliance standard does not require such due diligence.in fact,the suggested standard was much more stringent than the reasonable reliance standard applied in many cases prior to being rejected by field 
even assuming ucs,a sophisticated lender with considerable resources,could have conducted the type investigation envisioned by the bankruptcy court,its failure to do so does not per se preclude finding it was justified in relying on mercer representations of intent to pay,because the information it obtained prior to appears,based on the evidence,not to have raised red flags requiring further investigation.of course,justifiable reliance is a question of fact.see coston bank of malvern matter of coston,cir en banc reasonable reliance question of fact.because the bankruptcy court applied an incorrect legal standard in finding no justifiable reliance,on remand it must make that determination,under the correct legal standard.
for justifiable reliance,the focus should be on whether ucs,based on its credit screening and its relationship with mercer during her brief,had reason to believe she would not carry out her representation,through,of intent to pay.relevant to that determination are the circumstances under which the representation was made,including the fact that it was made for the purpose of inducing ucs to act in reliance upon it,and the form and manner in which it was expressed.see restatement second of torts cmt.and,facts pertinent to that inquiry include,but are not limited to ucs decision to offer the card,based on an examination of mercer credit before acceptance,and again between acceptance and issuance the terms of the,which provided that mercer signified her acceptance of those terms,including the requirement that she pay the loans incurred,by making at least the minimum monthly payments and mercer reaching her limit within the first billing cycle,within the scope of the,and before ucs had any reason to suspect she would not pay.
some courts have criticized issuers for allowing at casinos,and have held issuers can not justifiably rely on representations of intent to pay through at a casino to obtain cash advances along that line,mercer contends that,because she so used her card,ucs failed to prove justifiable reliance.
although there may be circumstances in which a debtor obtaining cash advances in a casino may have relevance in determining justifiable reliance,see,universal card servs.crutcher in re crutcher,the record at hand does not contain evidence of such circumstances.it does not support mercer assertion ucs was aware,when she inserted her card into the atm,she was in a casino.instead,the billing statement reflects that,although mercer obtained four advances at a casino on and november,they were not posted until november.as ucs representative testified,that is when ucs receives an electronic transfer notification from the clearing bank,which may be several days after the transaction.
moreover,as a matter of law,there is no basis for treating cash advances obtained at casinos differently from those obtained elsewhere.section a a does not do so.in any event,although mercer testified she used her ucs cash advances for gambling,she obtained more than twice as many of them at a bank as in a casino.and,the evidence established ucs has no control over atm locations and is not affiliated with the entity which operated the casino atm from which mercer obtained the advances.
the record contains no evidence to support precluding issuers from justifiably relying on a cardholder promise to pay a cash advance merely because it was obtained at a casino.common sense suggests that not everyone does so to obtain gambling funds,much less that she does so because she is losing and has no other source for those funds.for example,if given a choice,some might consider it safer,or more convenient,to enter a casino to obtain cash,rather than do so at an atm outside a bank,where there is no security and far greater potential for being robbed.or,some might be in a casino hotel for a convention or musical entertainment and obtain a cash advance at an atm there for uses.
the fact that mercer reached her limit within the first billing cycle,before receiving her first statement,also does not detract from finding justifiable reliance.obviously,if a cardholder has a history of payments with the issuer,justifiable reliance will be easier to prove but,the absence of that history does not preclude such reliance because mercer reached her limit so quickly,ucs had no opportunity to evaluate her creditworthiness based on a history with it.until december only a month after issuance,the last day of,when she exceeded her credit limit by approximately,mercer was within the terms of the.
requiring that a cardholder have a history of timely payments before the issuer can justifiably rely on the intent to pay representation would result in the discharge of all incurred within at least the first month of use.this would encourage dishonest debtors to reach their limits within the first billing cycle in order to preclude nondischargeability.it could also have the unintended consequence of spurring issuers to establish such low initial limits that cards would serve no useful purpose to many cardholders.
likewise,the fact that,days after,ucs flagged mercer account for excessive transactions does not preclude justifiable reliance.ucs representative testified ucs reviewed the account,decided the transactions were not egregiously excessive,and cleared the account for further use and,because the charges were within the terms of the,ucs was obligated to honor it.reliance on this factor could encourage issuers to cancel cards if used frequently within the first billing cycle,regardless of whether the limit had been exceeded.
finally,ucs was required to prove loss proximately caused by reliance on mercer representations.see restatement second of torts fraudulent misrepresentation is a legal cause of a pecuniary loss resulting from reliance upon it if the loss might reasonably be expected to result from the reliance.on remand,if the bankruptcy court finds mercer fraudulently misrepresented her intent to pay and ucs justifiably relied on that misrepresentation,then,as a matter of law,ucs loss unpaid loan resulted from the reliance.id 
for mercer a a nondischargeability vel non,we hold,as a matter of law,for each she represented her intent to pay the loan if her representation was knowingly false,she intended to deceive ucs it actually relied on the representation by authorizing the requested loan and its loss was proximately caused by such reliance.on remand,to be determined for each representation is whether it was knowingly false and ucs justifiably relied on it.
accordingly,the judgment of the district court is reversed,and the case is remanded to the district court,with instructions to remand to the bankruptcy court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
reversed and remanded.
i am firmly convinced that the majority errs when it adopts the fiction that,as a matter of law,each separate use of a credit card constitutes a representation by the user of an intent to pay,and that,if it does,the credit card issuer may rely on those representations.i,therefore,respectfully dissent for the reasons set forth in the panel opinion,mercer in re mercer,cir,and the following reasons.mindful that dissents do little more than make the dissenter feel better,i shall state my reasons briefly.
the majority admits that a creditor must prove every element of its claim of nondischargeability by a preponderance of the evidence.but the majority has completely ignored the universally accepted and fundamental principle of bankruptcy law that exceptions to discharge must be narrowly construed in favor of the debtor.see,for example,miller abrams in re miller,cir.the majority omission effectively shifts the burden of proof and alters the balance of bankruptcy policy struck by section.chevy chase bank,fsb briese in re briese,quoting chase manhattan bank,ford in re ford,to permit credit card plaintiffs to benefit from implications is to engage in impermissible.briese,at.if one can infer a representation from use of the card,then the creditor is relieved of the obligation of proving that a false representation was made.
the majority also ignores a second universally accepted canon of construction contracts should be construed so as to avoid neutralizing or ignoring any provisions or treating provisions as surplusage.see,for example,texas transmission amerada hess,cir.the majority construes mercer credit agreement so as to neutralize completely its provisions obligating mercer to repay for debts accumulated on the card mercer represented in writing in the credit agreement,which she was required to accept before she used the card,that she intended to repay for credit extended through the card.the credit agreement embodied the entire agreement between mercer and.why,then,would mercer undertake to represent each time she used her card that she intended to repay for its use though otherwise impressively thorough,the majority opinion does not answer this question.indeed,the question can not be answered because mercer made no such representations.the majority fiction that she did has an unfortunate consequence it allows effectively to rewrite the credit agreement after the fact.this is hardly the narrow construction the law requires.as rewritten through the majority legerdemain,moreover,the agreement between mercer and clearly favors,since all agree that mercer violation of the credit agreement requirement that she repay does not preclude discharge of her debt.
in my view,use of a credit card resembles the issuance of a check.the supreme court has held,as the majority admits,that issuing a check in payment of a debt knowing that the account on which the check is drawn does not contain sufficient funds to cover the check is not a representation that there are funds sufficient to cover the check.it is in fact not a representation of anything.williams united states,d t echnically speaking,a check is not a factual assertion at all,and therefore can not be characterized as true or false.in williams,the defendant engaged in a check kiting scheme during which he presented to several federally insured banks checks on his accounts that greatly exceeded the funds in those accounts.the court held that by so doing,the defendant did not make a false statement because issuing the check was no statement at all.id.the majority also discounts this holding because williams was a criminal case and because a check simply orders funds to be transferred,but i fail to see how these facts impact williams holding that issuing the check is not a representation.the majority also discounts williams on the basis that in it the court was applying the rule of lenity.a simple reading of the opinion shows,however,that the rule of lenity did not affect the rationale for the holding,which the court announced early in the opinion after thorough analysis.the court in williams only mentioned the rule of lenity in passing at the very end of the opinion after fully establishing the holding.if giving a check in payment of a debt is not a representation,then there is no justification in my view for holding,as the majority does,that using a credit card to obtain cash or make purchases is.this is particularly true in this case,where there was prior written representation of intent to repay.when a check is presented in payment of goods or services,or in exchange for cash,it simply authorizes the transfer of funds from the drawer account to the merchant.likewise,when a credit card is presented for the same purposes,it simply authorizes a transfer of funds from the approved line of credit to the merchant,or to the in the case of the use of an atm machine.williams,therefore,applies here.
interestingly,most of the courts that have adopted the implied representation theory have not considered williams.universal card servs.alvi in re alvi.the similarities between the issuance of a check and the use of a credit card make it illogical,i submit,to conclude that the use of a credit card in an ordinary credit transaction necessarily invokes a representation,when the issuance of a check does not.
the majority incorrectly characterizes the relationship between and mercer as a series of,a loan made each time the card was used.the majority,accordingly,concludes that h er promise to pay occurred not when the line was established,but at,when the loan was made.opinion.this conclusion is simply incorrect.her promise to pay occurred when mercer accepted the written credit agreement with,which states that the card holder is responsible for all amounts owed on the card holder a ccount and the card holder agree s to pay such amounts according to the terms of the a greement.conditioned its offer of credit to mercer on her promise to accept the credit agreement and furnish certain information annual income,social security number,birth date,home and business telephone numbers and her maiden name,which promise she kept.as i noted above,agreed with mercer at that time upon all terms and conditions that would inform her use of the card.so what occurred when she used the card,therefore,was simply the transfer of funds against the credit line previously established and on the terms and conditions previously established.no new loan agreement was made and no new terms were agreed to.hence,no new representations were made.
although the panel opinion noted as much,this case implicates policy issues that,i think,merit another brief reference.offered mercer a credit card and a credit limit after conducting the cursory credit check described in the majority opinion on the condition that she return certain information,which she did,and that she accept the credit agreement,which she did.she was then free to use the card,subject to the terms and conditions of the agreement.never did inquire about her prior credit card use,or the amount of her debt.had it done so,mercer lack of creditworthiness would have been obvious.now asks this court to fashion a fiction to save it from the consequences of its own inadequate credit check,and,to my surprise,this court has done so.this action,in my view,subverts the requirement that the creditor prove each element of the exception to discharge upon which it relies and the bedrock principle that exceptions to discharge must be narrowly construed in favor of the debtor.
since i would hold that no implied representation was made,i would not reach the reliance issue.
although i find judge duh√© dissenting opinion quite persuasive and am tempted to rest upon it,i dissent separately because i believe that this court should affirm the bankruptcy and district court judgments on the ground that there is no evidence in the record that took action in actual reliance upon each of mercer individual credit or cash draws on her line of credit.while i am uncertain about the analogy judge duh√© draws between bank checks and credit card transactions,i agree with the reasoning of his dissent insofar as it demonstrates that there was no evidence of actual reliance on individual card transactions as representations in this case.
the bankruptcy code excepts from discharge certain debts resulting from false pretenses,a false representation,or actual fraud.a a.in interpreting this provision the supreme court has looked to the concept of actual fraud as it was understood in when that language was added to a a.field mans,d.for aid to that understanding the court has relied on the restatement second of torts published shortly before the bankruptcy reform act of.id.the section on point dealing with fraudulent misrepresentation states that both actual and justifiable reliance are required.id.internal quotation omitted citing restatement second of torts.
section of the restatement second of torts provides the recipient of a fraudulent misrepresentation can recover against its maker for pecuniary loss resulting from it if,but only if,a he relies on the misrepresentation in acting or refraining from action,and b his reliance is justifiable.see also id.cmt.a if the recipient does not in fact rely on the misrepresentation,the fact that he takes some action that would be consistent with his reliance on it and as a result suffers pecuniary loss,does not impose any liability upon the maker.consequently,to deny mercer a discharge of her credit card debt,was required to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that,inter alia,sustained a pecuniary loss from fraudulent misrepresentations by mercer upon which in fact relied in taking action or refraining from action.proof by that it took some action that would be consistent with its reliance on an alleged misrepresentation,without proof of its actual reliance on the alleged misrepresentation,is not sufficient.
because did not introduce any evidence to show that it actually relied on any of mercer alleged misrepresentations in taking or refraining from action,the bankruptcy court correctly refused to deny mercer discharge the arguments by,adopted by the majority,that took action in actual reliance on alleged misrepresentations implied by each of mercer individual draws on her line of credit are empty assertions.the record simply does not support a factual finding of any such reliance or action.the majority opinion wrongly reverses the decision of the bankruptcy court,which held that failed to prove that it actually relied on mercer individual credit purchases and atm withdrawals in extending credit to her,because there is absolutely no evidence in the record that contemporaneously relied on the individual transactions in its decision to extend or to continue a line of credit to her.the record evidence shows that relied solely on its own screening process and automated system in allowing mercer to make cash and credit draws on her line of credit.
the majority opinion is badly mistaken in asserting that the testimony of expert,lewis,shows that relied on a supposed representation made during each use of mercer card in authorizing her to draw on the credit line.op.at.when read in context,his the effect that if had known mercer would not pay the credit card charges,it would not have extended credit to her in the first not made in reference to reliance upon mercer card use.it clearly concerned the quality of the information had at the time it decided to issue a card and extend a line of credit to mercer,which of course occurred before she ever used her card.lewis made the statement after counsel reviewed with him the six credit cards that mercer obtained prior to receiving her card and the fact that mercer had been screened three times by a credit bureau before her card was activated 
based on records with regard to this information,would have extended credit to this defendant if it knew that she would not pay or did not have ability to pay for these charges on this account 
i would say no.
had any of those reports come back with negative information concerning delinquent payments,over limits,bankruptcy,that type of information,would she have been sent a solicitation offer 
roa,vol,emphasis added.the question put to lewis clearly refers to the point in time when determined the credit limit it would offer to mercer and accordingly extended credit to her by issuing a credit card in her name with that limit this line of the effort expended by procuring credit reports before the credit card was meant,in the words of counsel,to dispel any notion that may exist that credit card companies in general go through the phone book and pull out a mailing list and send out applications or offers to people without regard to their creditworthiness.closing arguments of counsel,roa.in sum,lewis never testified that relied in acting or refraining from action on the individual credit purchases and atm withdrawals made by mercer.
decision and action in extending a line of credit to mercer was made in reliance upon own research before she accepted offer of credit.mercer.as lewis testified before the bankruptcy judge 
w hen we issue a solicitation or subsequently issue a card,it based again,some people may agree that it not long enough,but it based on at least a six or seven month study of that person credit history and their ability to maintain their accounts 
credit card holders have been eligible for a line of credit determined on their prior usage and history as stated by the credit bureau.
roa,vol.later mercer counsel again stressed and lewis agreed that the decision to act by extending a line of credit to mercer was made in reliance upon own research before it activated her credit card 
q.so based on all these different reviews,analyses that done and everything else,all determined that mercer has the financial ability to handle a unsecured credit line with your company,right 
based on the information we had at the time,yes,sir.
after mercer accepted the credit card and began using it,did not take any action to extend her line of credit in contemporaneous reliance on each draw.instead of looking at each transaction made by an individual like mercer,set up its automated system to make quarterly credit evaluations of its customers,the results of which,along with information the company maintained about the promptness of payments,whether each customer stayed within credit limit,and whether excessive use of a particular card was made within a period of time,formed the basis of decisions regarding whether to terminate or continue cardholders credit lines each cash advance mercer obtained was made instantaneously from an atm machine no one at evaluated the transaction or relied on any implicit representation made by mercer while using her card.
the testimony of expert,lewis,explaining how mercer was allowed to make charges surpassing her credit limit without being cut off first by,proves that does not monitor each individual transaction while it is being made,therefore negating a finding that actually relies on any representation made during a specific transaction.
can you explain why mercer final account balance exceeds the maximum balance allowed on this account of 
a the reason that there is an over limit charge on the account is that if you refer to page and of our statement you will see that the transaction dates reflect the date that the charge was made.if you will refer to the posting date when we receive the charges from the merchants,in some cases there will be delays of three days,five days,two days so although the charge has been made,if it is a floor limit charge it does not have to be called in or authorized by us to post to the account.there is going to be a gap where all the charges,because we have not received them from that merchant,are posted to the customer account,which would enable the account to have new charge activity which could put it over the limit.
roa vol.lewis went on to explain that,even if a merchant requires authorization for a charge,such authorization does not involve reliance upon any representation that may be made by the cardholder at the time the card is used instead a n authorization is basically an approval saying that at the time this charge was made there is sufficient credit available on the customer credit line to let the charge be made.id.at.furthermore,as the majority opinion points out,was not aware that on several occasions 
when mercer inserted her card into the atm,she was in a casino.instead,the billing statement reflects that,although mercer obtained four advances at a casino on and november,they were not posted until november.as representative testified,that is when receives an electronic transfer notification from the clearing bank,which may be several days after the transaction.
op.at emphasis omitted.because was not aware of each transaction until several days after it occurred,could not have relied upon each individual draw on mercer credit line contemporaneously with its occurrence.nor does the record contain any evidence to support findings that in fact engaged in action in reliance on each charge as it occurred.
another telling line of questioning from own counsel in the hearing before the bankruptcy court focuses on lewis assertions that mercer uses of the card indicated her intent not to repay the charges she was incurring 
q.at the time that the debtor was using the card,having reviewed her duplicate account statements,what facts do you see in her use of the card that would lead you to believe that she lacked the requisite intent to repay this debt 
a.at the time of her usage of the card 
t he fact of the location where the cash advances were taken,namely casinos 
q.so to further elaborate on some other items that might have been concerns to was the number of charges made a concern 
a.the number of charges in that one period of time,yes.
q.the amount of the charges 
a.the amount of the charges,particularly since it took the account over the limit,yes.
would the fact that the debtor had made numerous transactions on the same day become a concern 
a.that would have been addressed in internal report,where that came in as a possible alert.
roa,vol.it is highly improbable that actually relied on these same card its expert testified were indicative of a fraudulent intent not to repay the charges deciding to take the action of extending credit to mercer.
that utterly failed to prove actual reliance upon anything while the charges were being made was unmistakably the factual finding of the bankruptcy judge after hearing the evidence 
the evidence showed that prior to and subsequent to the issuance of the credit card to mercer,several investigations and evaluations of mercer were conducted by solely relied on its own agents and investigative processes to make its decision.the evidence reflects nothing written,said or done by mercer upon which relied at any time while the charges were being made.
emphasis added.because this finding of fact was not clearly erroneous,the majority is manifestly wrong in setting it aside.findings of fact,whether based on oral or documentary evidence,shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous,and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.federal rule of civil procedure a.because did not prove that it actually relied on a misrepresentation by mercer in acting to extend or continue her line of credit,its suit to deny her discharge was correctly rejected and dismissed by the bankruptcy court.the fact that the bankruptcy court may have miss spoken or incorrectly stated a rule of law that did not affect substantial justice or the substantial rights of the parties must be disregarded.n o error or defect in any ruling by the court is ground for disturbing a judgment unless refusal to take such action appears to the court inconsistent with substantial justice.the court at every stage of the proceeding must disregard any error or defect in the proceeding which does not affect the substantial rights of the parties.federal rule of civil procedure.
the district court,therefore,was clearly correct in affirming the bankruptcy court decision because there was no clear error in the bankruptcy judge finding that failed to prove that it actually relied on any representations made by mercer 
t his court finds that the lower court did not commit clear error in finding that the evidence reflects nothing written,said or done by mercer upon which relied at any time while the charges were being made and that solely relied on its own agents and investigative processes to make its decision to issue the credit card.without the requisite proof showing actual reliance,the appellant claim for nondischargeability does not meet the requirements for the false pretense or actual fraud prongs of a a.
consequently,the majority is doubly wrong in reversing the judgments of the bankruptcy and district courts.furthermore,even if we were not legally bound to uphold,in the absence of clear error,the trial court crucial finding of fact that did not actually rely on a misrepresentation by mercer in taking action to extend or continue her line of credit,a thorough,objective review of the record shows that did not prove this element of its case.therefore,because failed to prove the essential element of actual reliance this court should affirm the bankruptcy and district courts without reaching the issues of representation and justifiable reliance.
in addition,if the debtor applied for a card,at issue may be a b excepting debts for,inter alia,credit extension obtained by materially false written statement respecting debtor financial condition on which creditor reasonably relied.

judge dennis states that,when read in context,this quoted testimony did not refer to reliance on mercer,but instead concerned the quality of information available to ucs at.but,the specific question at issue specifically refers to extend ing credit and to for these charges emphasis added,obviously referring to,not.the fact that much of the testimony preceding and subsequent to the quoted testimony dealt with simply reflects the focus of the the bankruptcy justifiable,not actual,judge dennis points out,prior to the quoted testimony,ucs witness testified regarding mercer other credit cards and the credit bureau screening process.immediately after the quoted question and answer,counsel asked another question regarding ucs decision.and,the very next question concerned whether mercer had the intent and ability to repay these charges when they were incurred.emphasis added.viewing ucs witness testimony as a whole,it seems clear that ucs counsel was trying to present evidence to establish each of the elements of fraud,but focused primarily on the most elements of scienter and justifiable reliance.the presentation of ucs witness testimony was somewhat disjointed,in part due to the bankruptcy court intermittent questions regarding ucs short,ucs witness testified that ucs would no t have extended credit to mercer if it knew that she would not pay for the charges on her account.this is actual reliance.
judge dennis focuses,as did the bankruptcy and district courts,on ucs reliance on its own screening and investigation in making the decision to issue the card to mercer.because the representations at issue are those of intent to pay each loan obtained through,the fact that ucs did not rely on any representation by mercer at does not preclude it,as discussed infra,from relying on representations.see restatement second of torts representation need not be sole,but only substantial,factor in influencing recipient action.as discussed,because the bankruptcy and district courts applied an incorrect legal standard in finding no actual reliance,focusing on rather than,to find no actual reliance,the clearly erroneous standard is not applicable.judge dennis suggestion that the error is harmless because ucs did not prove actual reliance on mercer representations is based on his view of ucs witness testimony as relating to the information ucs obtained through its investigation as discussed supra,the question asked of the witness referred to these charges,not to.moreover,the error was not harmless.by focusing solely on ucs decision,and what the bankruptcy court found to be an inadequate investigation of mercer creditworthiness under a standard even more stringent than the reasonable reliance standard,the bankruptcy court did not consider whether,with each,mercer made a representation of intent to pay or whether ucs relied on that representation when approving charges or advancing cash to mercer.

judge dennis quotation of testimony dealing with scienter is not relevant to the analysis for actual reliance.nevertheless,judge dennis relies on that testimony to assert i t is highly improbable that ucs actually relied on these same card its expert testified were indicative of a fraudulent intent not to repay the charges deciding to take the action of extending credit to mercer.emphasis added.obviously,a finding of no actual reliance can not be based on evidence that the creditor,in hindsight,determines is indicative of the debtor fraudulent intent.

judge dennis states that,because each cash advance mercer obtained was made instantaneously from an atm machine,no one at ucs evaluated the transaction or relied on any representation mercer made through.relying on the evidence of the time lag between transactions when the advance was and posting the charges,judge dennis concludes that,because ucs was not aware of the transactions until several days after they occurred,ucs could not have relied contemporaneously upon each individual draw on mercer credit line.as discussed,this analysis completely overlooks the fundamental fact that a cash advance is a loan,not a gift.inherent in any loan is a promise to pay.see melancon,at promise to repay is not merely a substantial factor in determining whether a loan will be made i t is an essential element of any loan.
along this line,in some circumstances the claimed reliance on a representation of intent to pay may be so unreasonable that it could support finding no actual reliance.t he greater the distance between the reliance claimed and the limits of the reasonable,the greater the doubt about reliance in fact.field,at.see also vann,at reasonableness of the reliance may be used as proof that the creditor did rely.first deposit bank mack in re mack,without conducting any credit check,issuer sent debtor solicitation,requesting only her social security number,home telephone number,and annual household income card provided debtor along with cash advance check for universal card servs.crutcher in re crutcher,after debtor advised issuer she was considering bankruptcy and was an addicted gambler,and requested her account be closed and not reopened under any circumstances,issuer approved emergency cash advance so debtor could pay casino debt and permitted cash advances,increasing account balance to over during gambling spree first usa bank hunter in re hunter,after debtor defaulted on card and filed bankruptcy,same creditor offered debtor another card one week before trial on creditor nondischargeability complaint feld,at if issuer distributes cards freely without conducting any credit analysis,appropriate to find no reliance.concerning field statement that reasonableness goes to the probability of actual reliance,at,it would seem that any situation in which claimed actual reliance is so unreasonable as to support finding no would also support finding reliance was not justifiable,as discussed infra.we need not reach that issue here.
judge dennis states after mercer accepted the credit card and began using it,ucs did not take any action to extend her line of credit in contemporaneous reliance on each draw.but,obviously,by making the loan cash advance requested with each,ucs took action in reliance on mercer promise to repay that transactions took place within the context of the cardmember agreement and line of a purely physical level,the course of action that causes the issuer loss is the pushing of buttons,combined with the internal actions of the atm.but these physical actions must be understood within the context of the contractual arrangement that makes them meaningful.pushing random buttons or putting the wrong card in the machine wo generate any money.it is only through prior arrangements the assignment of a card to the holder,the choice of a pin,the operation of the network,the provision of atms in convenient locations that the transaction works at all,and part of this prior arrangement is the understanding that the physical act of pushing the buttons will carry with it some unverbalized statements that have legal,at emphasis added.when mercer received the requested cash advances,she immediately received cash in hand.the fact that the transactions cash advances were not posted simultaneously does not change the fact that they were loans which would not have been made in the absence of a promise to repay them.judge dennis position would require card issuers to monitor individual transactions as they occur,and would result in great delay in receiving credit especially troublesome for cash advances,increased credit costs for card users,and would,in short,greatly not use of cards as a medium of exchange.
