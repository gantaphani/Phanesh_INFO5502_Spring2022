on remand following an earlier appeal in this case,a bankruptcy court ruled that the release provision in national heritage foundation chapter reorganization plan was unenforceable.the district court affirmed.on appeal to this court,nhf argues that the courts below erred,claiming that the facts and circumstances surrounding its bankruptcy are sufficiently unique to justify the release.finding insufficient evidence to support nhf contentions,we affirm.
a detailed recitation of the facts underlying this case is contained in our previous opinion,behrmann national heritage foundation,cir nhf i.we recite only those facts relevant to this appeal.
nhf is a public that administers and maintains donor advised funds.these are funds in which donors relinquish all right and interest in the assets they donate.the sponsoring charitable this case,and controls all of the donated assets,although donors retain the right to make recommendations regarding the use of the assets.
in,nhf filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy code after a state court entered a multimillion dollar judgment against it.after multiple revisions,the bankruptcy court approved nhf fourth amended and restated plan of reorganization the plan.the plan contained a non debtor release provision covering nhf the official committee of unsecured creditors the committee and its members any designated representatives of the committee and any officers,directors,or employees of nhf,the committee,or their successors and assigns collectively,the released parties.the release provision provided that the released parties 
shall not have or incur,and are hereby released from,any claim,obligation,cause of action,or liability to any party in interest who has filed a claim or who was given notice of the debtor bankruptcy case the releasing parties for any act or omission before or after the petition date through and including the effective date in connection with,relating to,or arising out of the operation of the debtor business,except to the extent relating to the debtor failure to comply with its obligations under the plan.
certain nhf appellees in this case challenged the plan confirmation on the ground that the release provision was invalid.the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court confirmation of the plan.
on the first appeal,we vacated that portion of the district court judgment affirming the release provision,holding that the bankruptcy court failed to make sufficient factual findings to support its conclusion that the release provision was essential.see nhf i,at.although we reiterated this circuit longstanding rule that releases may be enforced in appropriate circumstances,we cautioned that they should only be approved cautiously and infrequently.id.at.to determine whether such circumstances exist,we directed the bankruptcy court to consider the six substantive factors enumerated in class five nevada claimants dow corning in re dow corning,cir.these include whether 
there is an identity of interests between the debtor and the third party the has contributed substantial assets to the reorganization the injunction is essential to reorganization the impacted class,or classes,has overwhelmingly voted to accept the plan the plan provides a mechanism to pay for all,or substantially all,of the class or classes affected by the injunction and the plan provides an opportunity for those claimants who choose not to settle to recover in full.
id.at.on remand,we instructed the bankruptcy court if the record permits it to set forth specific factual findings supporting its conclusions that the release provision in nhf plan was valid.nhf i,at.
a different bankruptcy court judge considered the case on remand.that court gave the parties the option of reopening the record to present more evidence,but they declined to do so.reviewing the record,the bankruptcy court made factual findings with respect to each of the dow corning factors.it concluded that only one factor an identity of interests between nhf and the released parties clearly weighed in favor of nhf,and it declared the release provision unenforceable.see in re heritage.the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court ruling.see heritage,behrmann,cv,wl,at.nhf timely appealed.
we review the legal conclusions of the bankruptcy court and district court de novo.gold first.bank ass in re taneja,cir.like the district court below,we review the bankruptcy court factual findings for clear error.id 
based on the record before us,we conclude that nhf has failed to carry its burden of proving that the facts and circumstances of this case justify the release provision.like the courts below,we consider the evidence with respect to each dow corning factor in turn.
under the first dow corning factor,a court must consider whether there is an identity of interests usually an indemnity obligation between the debtor and the released parties.a nondebtor release may be appropriate in such circumstances because a suit against the may,in essence,be a suit against the debtor that risks deplet ing the assets of the estate.nhf i,at quoting in re dow corning,at.
we conclude that nhf has demonstrated an identity of interests between itself and the released parties.under the terms of its bylaws,nhf must advance legal expenses and indemnify its officers and directors for any action in which such person may be involved by reason of his being or having been a director or officer of nhf.no security is required to ensure the covered parties repay nhf for any advanced expenses.see also in re heritage,at describing the scope of nhf indemnification provisions.such an expansive indemnity obligation is sufficient to satisfy the first dow corning factor.
the second dow corning factor required nhf to demonstrate that the released parties made a substantial contribution of assets to its reorganization.nhf i,at.in effect,this factor ensures that in order for a released party to achieve that status,it must have provided a cognizable and valid contribution to the debtor as part of the debtor reorganization.
none of the released parties in this case made any financial contribution to the reorganization.nhf nonetheless argues that its officers and directors satisfied this requirement by promising to continue serving nhf.
as an initial matter,there is no evidence in the record to support nhf assertion that its officers and directors actually promised to continue serving nhf even if such a promise had been made,we find no error in the district court conclusion that it would not constitute a substantial contribution of assets in this case.as the bankruptcy court found,nhf officers and directors,all of whom are insiders,performed their duties either because they were paid to do so in the case of the officers,or because they had a fiduciary obligation to do so in the case of the directors.in re heritage,at.under these circumstances,the released parties did not provide meaningful consideration for their release from liability.in re sl liquidating,concluding that directors and officers did not make a substantial contribution when their described efforts were consistent with their preexisting fiduciary duties and job responsibilities.the absence of such consideration weighs against nhf release provision.
the third dow corning factor also counsels against the release provision.to satisfy this factor,a debtor must demonstrate that the release is essential to its reorganization,such that the reorganization hinges on the debtor being free from indirect suits against parties who would have indemnity or contribution claims against the debtor.nhf i,at quoting in re dow corning,at.
nhf primarily contends that the risk of litigation from its donors,whose numbers run in the thousands,renders the release provision essential,as nhf would likely have to indemnify its officers and directors for their legal expenses should such suits arise.
although we are sympathetic to nhf concern about the possibility of donor suits,the evidence does not suggest that its reorganization is doomed without the release provision.nhf has provided little to no evidence regarding the number of likely do
