hyundai is a manufacturer of trailers.in,hyundai sold a large quantity of trailers to southern trailer equipment sales,southern trailer,a trailer dealership in which appellants james harrell harrell and raleigh williams williams owned a majority interest.harrell and williams also owned a majority interest in two other dealerships appellant jackson truck trailer repair,jackson truck trailer,and the debtor in this case,trailer source,trailer source 
in,hyundai filed a civil action in california state court against the jt t parties,southern trailer,and trailer source.hyundai alleged that it had delivered more than million in trailers to southern trailer but had received only million in payment.hyundai alleged that there were fraudulent conveyances of trailers from southern trailer to the two other dealerships that otherwise could have satisfied southern trailer debt to hyundai.in august,hyundai entered into a settlement and security agreement california settlement with all of the defendants in the california action.under the terms of that agreement,trailer source and southern trailer agreed to a schedule for payment of the remaining million debt to hyundai,and hyundai obtained a security interest in the assets of both trailer source and southern trailer.
in october,trailer source defaulted on its obligations under the california settlement.on june,hyundai filed suit in the united states district court for the middle district of tennessee alleging that the jt t parties had established a scheme to transfer fraudulently trailers and cash from trailer source and southern trailer to jackson truck trailer,preventing the first two dealerships from making their scheduled payments to hyundai pursuant to the california settlement.
on january,hyundai filed an involuntary chapter bankruptcy petition against trailer source,and on february,the united states bankruptcy court for the middle district of tennessee entered an order of relief,which automatically stayed the proceedings in hyundai separate action in the united states district court for the middle district of tennessee against the jt t parties.a number of parties,including hyundai and the jt t parties,subsequently filed as creditors of trailer source.
soon after appointment of a trustee,hyundai contacted the trustee to request an investigation of the claims and consideration of an action by the trustee against the jt t parties.at first,the trustee proposed that he employ hyundai own counsel at hyundai expense to conduct an investigation,but the trustee withdrew this suggestion after the jt t parties argued that hyundai had a conflict of interest.on november,the trustee also offered to sell the cause of action to hyundai,but hyundai declined because of concerns about the legality of such a transaction.hyundai then made a demand upon the trustee to pursue an avoidance action against the jt t parties.under b and a,a bankruptcy trustee may seek to avoid certain transfers of a debtor assets and to recover assets that were wrongfully transferred.after the trustee declined to pursue an avoidance action,hyundai filed a motion asking the bankruptcy court to grant hyundai derivative standing to pursue the avoidance action on behalf of the bankruptcy estate.
that motion was opposed by the jt t parties,and the bankruptcy court held a hearing on february.at that hearing,the trustee explained that he did not pursue the claims primarily because the estate lacked funds to pay the investigation and litigation costs and he could not retain competent counsel in a case like this to go forward on a contingency fee basis.it not going to happen.joint appendix at hr g tr.at.the trustee also explained that the merits of the case was part of it and t he economics was part of it,and further cited the weird situation with the district court.at dist.op.at.on february,the bankruptcy court denied hyundai motion for derivative standing.at order on mot.for derivative standing.the bankruptcy court concluded that hyundai had not made the requisite showing that the claims were colorable so as to establish derivative standing under canadian pacific forest products,irving,in re the gibson group,cir.the bankruptcy court also concluded that the trustee refusal to pursue the claims was based on the trustee business judgment that an outside law firm would not likely take the case on a contingency basis due to its merits.at order on mot.for derivative standing at.finally,the court expressed reservations about the viability of the doctrine in light of the supreme court decision in hartford underwriters insurance union planters bank,d.after it was denied derivative standing,hyundai filed a timely proof of claim in the amount of.at proof of claim.
on february,four days before the bankruptcy court ruling on derivative standing,hyundai filed a motion for relief from the automatic stay so that it could pursue its separate action against the jt t parties.later that day,the trustee filed a motion for approval of a settlement of the estate claims against the jt t parties.under that agreement bankruptcy settlement,the jt t parties agreed to pay to settle all of the claims.on march,hyundai filed a motion for reconsideration of the order denying it derivative standing.after a hearing on march,the bankruptcy court approved the bankruptcy settlement and denied hyundai motion for reconsideration.
following a hearing on may,the bankruptcy court also denied hyundai motion for relief from the stay.hyundai had argued that it had security interests in certain collateral that could not be settled by the trustee in the bankruptcy settlement.however,the bankruptcy court ruled that hyundai motion was moot because all of hyundai claims were encompassed within the bankruptcy settlement.further,the court ruled that hyundai had failed to show that relief was appropriate pursuant to d or.
on june,hyundai appealed the following orders of the bankruptcy court to the district court the order approving the bankruptcy settlement,the order denying hyundai derivative standing,the order denying hyundai motion to reconsider that denial,and the order denying hyundai motion for relief from the automatic stay.the district court reversed all of the orders except the order denying reconsideration.first,the district court found that the bankruptcy court abused its discretion in approving the bankruptcy settlement because it did not set forth adequate findings in support of its order and because the record contained facts weighing against the settlement,including the fact that the estate received only in exchange for the release of nearly million in claims.second,the district court ruled that the supreme court decision in hartford underwriters did not affect the continuing validity of derivative standing,and that hyundai satisfied the test for derivative standing under gibson group.third,because it reversed the bankruptcy court denial of derivative standing,the district court affirmed,without reaching the merits,the bankruptcy court order denying hyundai motion for reconsideration.finally,the district court reversed the bankruptcy court order denying hyundai motion to lift the automatic stay.the district court explained that the trustee did not have authority to settle hyundai security interests in the debtor,which exist irrespective of the avoidance action hyundai sought to assert on behalf of the estate.the district court thus concluded that the bankruptcy court erred in finding that hyundai interests were settled by the bankruptcy settlement.further,the district court concluded that hyundai was entitled to a lift of the automatic stay under d because the estate contained little if any value,and therefore hyundai interests were not adequately protected.
after the district court decision,the jt t parties filed a motion asking the district court to certify the following questions for interlocutory appeal whether derivative standing remains available in chapter proceedings after hartford underwriters,whether the res judicata effect of the california settlement barred hyundai from exercising derivative standing,and whether the district court should have affirmed the bankruptcy settlement given the res judicata effect of the california settlement.the district court certified the first question pursuant to b,noting that this court has not yet addressed the continuing viability of derivative standing since hartford underwriters.on july,we granted permission for an interlocutory appeal on that question.in this consolidated appeal,the jt t parties also appeal the district court order reversing the bankruptcy court denial of hyundai motion to lift the automatic stay.
ii.analysis 
appellate standing 
hyundai contends that the jt t parties lack appellate standing to appeal either the district court order granting hyundai request for derivative standing or its order granting hyundai motion to lift the automatic stay.specifically,hyundai argues that the jt t parties lack standing under the prudential doctrine of appellate standing that applies only in the bankruptcy context.under that doctrine,which is more limited than article iii standing or the prudential requirements associated therewith,standing to appeal a bankruptcy order is limited to person s aggrieved by that order,that is,parties directly and adversely affected pecuniarily.harker troutman in re troutman,cir internal quotation marks omitted.however,as we explain below,the doctrine of appellate standing is not applicable under the circumstances of this case.
we are aware of no case that applies the doctrine when it is undisputed that the party who initially challenged the bankruptcy court appellate standing to do so.the doctrine has been applied almost exclusively in cases in which the question is whether the party who appealed the bankruptcy court order was sufficiently aggrieved by that order.see,in re troutman,at holding that shareholders of debtor corporation lacked appellate standing to appeal bankruptcy court order awarding insurance proceeds to trustee marlow rollins cotton in re the julien,cir holding that creditor lacked appellate standing to appeal order of bankruptcy court absent permission of bankruptcy court see also squire scher in re squire.cir unpublished opinion lyndon prop.ins.katz.cir unpublished opinion monus lambros in re monus.cir unpublished order fishell soltow in re fishell,wl cir,unpublished opinion,cert.denied,d.
we are aware of only one case in this circuit in which the doctrine was applied in a different context.in fidelity bank,national association group,cir,we applied the doctrine to the question of whether the appellants had standing to appeal a district court order in a federal receivership action.the appellants in fidelity bank were an affiliate of a debtor company and a principal and shareholder of that affiliate along with the debtor,they had been sued by a creditor for fraudulent conveyances in an action consolidated with a receivership action in district court.id.at.over the objections of the affiliate and its principal,the receiver entered into an agreement with the creditor in which the creditor abandoned its claim against the debtor,and in exchange the debtor assigned its rights to pursue its own claim against the affiliate.id.after the district court ruled that the receiver had the authority to abandon the receivership claim,the affiliate and its principal appealed.id.at.on appeal,we applied the doctrine and held that the affiliate and its principal lacked appellate standing because they did not assert claims against the receivership estate assets and therefore were not adversaries in the context of the receiver motion to abandon the fraudulent conveyance claim.id.at.concluding that the bankruptcy doctrine applied in the receivership context,we noted that a primary purpose of both receivership and bankruptcy proceedings is to promote the efficient and orderly administration of estates for the benefit of creditors.id.at.
in the bankruptcy context,however,we have never applied this doctrine when the party that initiated the appeal from the bankruptcy court had undisputed appellate standing.the doctrine has been exclusively invoked to limit which parties may initiate appeals from the bankruptcy court to the district court or the bankruptcy appellate panel only in the narrow context of a receivership which the district court takes on a role that resembles a bankruptcy this court ever invoked the doctrine to ask whether the party appealing from the district court to the court of appeals was sufficiently aggrieved.
we find support for limiting the doctrine to initial appeals from the bankruptcy court in the rationales that courts have articulated for the doctrine.for instance,the first circuit has explained that 
this rule of appellate standing is necessary to insure that bankruptcy proceedings are not unreasonably delayed by protracted litigation that does not serve the interests of either the bankrupt estate or its creditors.the nature of bankruptcy litigation,with its myriad of parties,directly and indirectly involved or affected by each order and decision of the bankruptcy court,mandates that the right of appellate review be limited to those persons whose interests are directly affected.
in re el san juan hotel,cir.thus,a principal rationale of the doctrine is to prevent parties indirectly affected by rulings from bringing appeals on tangential issues.
however,once a party with undisputed standing has appealed a bankruptcy court order in district court,and that issue has been litigated in the district court,these concerns are no longer implicated to the same degree.first,the district court may hear an initial appeal only from a sufficiently aggrieved party whose interests are directly implicated in the bankruptcy proceedings.aligned on the other side in the district court are adverse parties who,though they may not independently meet the requirements of appellate standing,have a concrete stake in the outcome at least sufficient to establish an article iii case or controversy.when the same parties and issues remain in the case on a second layer of appeal from the district court to the court of appeals,the case logically still involves parties sufficiently aggrieved so as to satisfy the prudential doctrine demand that the appeal must involve directly affected parties.moreover,applying this prudential doctrine to bar appeals by only certain parties from the district court to the court of appeals would create a perverse imbalance.here,for instance,if hyundai had lost in the district court,it is clear that it would have appellate standing to pursue a second appeal to the court of appeals.however,if the doctrine were applied in this context,the jt t adverse to hyundai in the district lack standing to appeal the district court adverse rulings on the very same issues.
in sum,we hold that the bankruptcy doctrine is not applicable to the second layer of appeal,from the district court to the court of appeals,when it is uncontested that the party who appealed the bankruptcy court order to the district court had appellate standing instead we apply the general rule that a party must be aggrieved by the judicial action from which it appeals.city of cleveland ohio,cir internal quotation marks omitted.because it is uncontested that the jt t parties are aggrieved by the decision of the district court,the jt t parties have standing to pursue this appeal.
availability of derivative standing 
the district court concluded that the bankruptcy code permits grants of derivative standing to creditors to pursue avoidance claims on behalf of the bankruptcy estate.hyundai seeks derivative standing to assert avoidance claims against the jt t parties pursuant to two statutory provisions that authorize an estate to recover assets wrongfully transferred from the debtor.section b provides that 
except as provided in paragraph,the trustee may avoid any transfer of an interest of the debtor in property or any obligation incurred by the debtor that is voidable under applicable law by a creditor holding an unsecured claim that is allowable under section of this title or that is not allowable only under e of this title.
b emphasis added.section a then provides that 
except as otherwise provided in this section,to the extent that a transfer is avoided under section,b,or a of this title,the trustee may recover,for the benefit of the estate,the property transferred,or,if the court so orders,the value of such property,from 
the initital transferee of such transfer or the entity for whose benefit such transfer was made or 
any immediate or mediate transferee of such initial transferee.
a emphasis added the jt t parties contend that the plain language of b and a authorizes only the trustee to act and thus precludes derivative standing by the creditor to proceed on behalf of the estate.they argue that derivative standing under these provisions is foreclosed by the decision in hartford underwriters where the supreme court determined that identical the trustee may language in c of the bankruptcy code foreclosed any party other than the trustee from using that provision to recover certain administrative costs.the jt t parties further submit that the rationale for allowing derivative standing in chapter proceedings,which this court has permitted but underwriters in gibson group,does not extend to chapter proceedings where there is always an independent bankruptcy trustee.
we review the decision of the bankruptcy court directly,giving no deference to the decision of the district court.heavrin schilling in re triple s restaurants,cir.we review the bankruptcy court legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error.id.
in hartford underwriters,the supreme court held that c of the bankruptcy code was exclusively enforceable by the bankruptcy trustee.that section provides as follows 
the trustee may recover from property securing an allowed secured claim the reasonable,necessary costs and expenses of preserving,or disposing of,such property to the extent of any benefit to the holder of such claim 
c emphasis added.hartford underwriters,an insurance company that had provided workers compensation insurance to the chapter debtor,sought to recover unpaid premiums.because the estate lacked sufficient unencumbered funds to pay the premiums,hartford sought to charge the premiums to a secured creditor pursuant to c,which allows for the charge of certain administrative expenses against lienholders.hartford argued that c gave it authority to bring an independent action to recover the premiums.see hartford underwriters,at.the supreme court disagreed,holding that the plain language of c indicated that the trustee was the only party authorized to invoke the provision.id.at.the court noted that w here a statute names the parties granted the right to invoke its provisions such parties only may act.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted second alteration in original.next,the court cited the unique role played by the trustee in bankruptcy proceedings,mak ing it entirely plausible that congress would provide a power to him and not to others.id.at.because it concluded that the text of the code was clear,the court rejected hartford reliance upon practice in which were sometimes permitted to directly pursue administrative expenses.id.at.finally,the court observed that if were permitted independently to pursue recovery they might impair the ability of the bankruptcy court to coordinate proceedings,and might proceed even where the trustee himself planned to do so.id.at.
the court carefully noted,however,that it did not address whether a bankruptcy court can allow other interested parties to act in the trustee stead in pursuing recovery under c.id.at.noting the practice of some courts of allowing creditors a derivative right to bring avoidance actions when the trustee refuses to do so,even though the applicable code provisions mention only the trustee,the court explained that this practice ha d no analogous application here,since hartford did not ask the trustee to pursue payment and did not seek permission from the bankruptcy court to take such action in the trustee stead.id.internal citations omitted.thus,the court made clear that it was rejecting only an independent right to use c.id.accordingly,although hartford underwriters provides guidance for our analysis,it does not control the question of whether the bankruptcy code allows courts to grant derivative standing to creditors to bring avoidance actions when the trustee refuses to do so.
we first note that since hartford underwriters every court of appeals to address derivative standing to pursue avoidance claims has affirmed the practice validity.two courts have expressly considered the impact of hartford underwriters and have upheld the practice.see pw,racing comm in re racing,cir holding that derivative standing is available to a creditor to pursue avoidance actions when it shows that a chapter trustee or in the case of chapter is unable or unwilling to do so notwithstanding hartford underwriters official comm.of unsecured creditors of cybergenics ex rel.cybergenics chinery,cir en banc holding that bankruptcy courts can authorize creditors committees in chapter proceedings to sue derivatively to avoid fraudulent transfers for the benefit of the estate notwithstanding hartford underwriters.two other circuits have continued to approve of the practice underwriters,though without mention of the hartford underwriters decision.glinka murad in re housecraft indus.usa,cir commodore int l gould in re commodore int l,cir fogel zell,cir approving of derivative standing in dicta.
we begin,as did the supreme court in hartford underwriters,with the observation that congress says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.at.quoting connecticut bank germain,d.sections b and a and other avoidance no reference to derivative standing and state only that the trustee may bring certain avoidance and recovery actions.if these were the only relevant sections of the code,hartford underwriter interpretation of the trustee may in c would weigh strongly against derivative standing given the natural presumption that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning.atl.cleaners dyers,united states.however,our analysis is not so cribbed,because other provisions of the bankruptcy code,as well as practice,clearly contemplate the equitable power of bankruptcy courts to authorize creditors,in appropriate instances,to bring claims on behalf of the bankruptcy estate.
first,in b b congress has expressly provided that creditors may be compensated on a priority basis for their efforts in recovering property for the benefit of the estate.specifically,b b provides for the priority payment of the expenses of a creditor that recovers,after the court approval,for the benefit of the estate any property transferred or concealed by the debtor.b b.an avoidance action pursuant to b as hyundai proposes within the scope of b b as an action to recover property transferred by the debtor.based upon the text and statutory history of b b,we believe that the only explanation for this provision is that it approves the practice of permitting creditors,with court authorization,to pursue claims on behalf of bankrupt debtors.see cybergenics,at.
we find support for this reading in the statutory history of b b.section b b is derived from of the bankruptcy act.as early as,derivative standing for creditors had been judicially recognized.see chatfield,cir in,congress amended the bankruptcy act of to add,which provided for the priority payment of a creditor expenses when transferred assets were recovered for the benefit of the estate by the efforts of the creditor.act of,ch,stat,codified as amended at a repealed.the ostensible purpose of the amendment was presumably to make explicit what had already been determined to be implicit that creditors acting for the benefit of the estate were allowed to sue derivatively.alan lepene sean gordon,the case for derivative standing in chapter it the plain meaning,stupid,am.when congress enacted the bankruptcy code in,it continued the practice of in what is now b b of the bankruptcy code.see,at,as reprinted in,explaining that the proposed b of the new bankruptcy code is derived mainly from section a of the bankruptcy act,with some changes see also info,wolkowitz in re maximus computers,cir.bap section b b carries forward the authority under former bankruptcy act for creditors to sue in the name of the trustee to recover property for the benefit of the estate and to be compensated as administrative expenses.we believe that the practice of derivative standing,unlike the practice at issue in hartford underwriters,is the type of rule that congress was aware of when enacting the code.hartford underwriters,at.quoting united states ron pair,d.
we further believe that b b would be meaningless if the code did not also contemplate the practice of derivative standing.although the jt t parties make little attempt to address the significance of b b,we note that parties in other cases have offered alternative interpretations of b b in an attempt to show that this provision would not be meaningless absent the practice of derivative standing.one alternative interpretation posits a creditor who,after obtaining a lift of the automatic stay from the bankruptcy court,independently pursues a claim and surrenders any surplus recovery to the estate.however,as the third circuit observed in cybergenics,this interpretation fails because state law provides that a transfer or obligation may be avoided only to the extent necessary to satisfy the creditor claim.at quoting uniform laws annotated,uniform fraudulent transfer act uniform laws annotated,uniform fraudulent conveyance act.because an oversecured creditor can not directly recover any property beyond that necessary to satisfy its own claim,it can not recover property for the benefit of the estate unless it sues derivatively.id.
a second alternative interprets b b as authorizing expenses for creditors who object to discharge and then successfully locate and bring into the estate assets that had been transferred or concealed by the debtor.cybergenics,at fuentes,dissenting.some courts have accepted this interpretation and allowed creditors to recoup expenses when the creditors efforts in discovering hidden assets and opposing discharge ultimately benefit the estate.see id.listing cases.the theory behind this interpretation is that,although the creditor does not technically recover property,the trustee would not have recovered the property but for the creditors assistance in locating the assets.see,in re harvey,wl,at,while technically the creditors did not recover property for the benefit of the debtor,they were the cause without which no recovery would have taken place.in re spencer,finding that creditor actions in locating assets and opposing discharge qualified for recoupment of expenses under b b.this reading,however,is inconsistent with the plain language of b b,which provides that it is the creditor who must recover.when the creditor merely provides investigative assistance or otherwise helps the trustee locate assets,it is the trustee who ultimately recovers rather than the creditor.see cybergenics,at i nvestigative assistance would not implicate b b because the creditors committee would not itself recover the property.in re beale,holding that creditor that conducted investigations and assisted trustee in recovering assets for estate could not recoup expenses under b b because it was the trustee who recovered in re blount,section b b is limited to situations wherein the creditor is a creditor that recovers.t he connection must be direct.the creditor must be the recovering party extension to situations where the creditor action indirectly or ultimately leads to the recovery of property is contrary to the statute.consequently,we reject this alternative interpretation as inconsistent with b b clear requirement that the creditor must be the recovering party.
because we reject these alternative interpretations,we agree with the third circuit that b b would be meaningless unless authority to sue derivatively existed.cybergenics,at.we do not believe,however,that b b authorizes derivative standing in the first instance.instead,like the third circuit,we believe this authority derives from bankruptcy courts equitable power to craft flexible remedies in situations where the code causes of action fail to achieve their intended purpose.id.
the supreme court has long recognized that bankruptcy courts are courts of equity with the power to apply flexible equitable remedies in bankruptcy proceedings.see young united states,d b ankruptcy courts are courts of equity and appl y the principles and rules of equity jurisprudence.quoting pepper litton.second alteration in original united states energy resources,d b ankruptcy courts,as courts of equity,have broad authority to modify relationships.local loan hunt.c ourts of bankruptcy are essentially courts of equity,and their proceedings inherently proceedings in equity.see also,at,as reprinted in,stating that under the new bankruptcy code t he bankruptcy court will remain a court of equity.
we agree with the third circuit that the ability to confer derivative standing is a straightforward application of bankruptcy courts equitable powers.cybergenics,at.in b,congress clearly intended for bankruptcy estates to recover assets fraudulently transferred by the debtor.to effectuate this intent,congress authorized the trustee or to bring avoidance actions to maximize the value of the estate.typically,the system designed by congress ensures that the value of the estate is maximized and that creditors rights are protected because the trustee will pursue valuable avoidance claims.however,when the trustee unjustifiably refuses to bring an avoidance action under b,the system breaks down.it is in precisely this situation that bankruptcy courts equitable powers are most valuable,for the courts are able to craft flexible remedies that,while not expressly authorized by the code,effect the result the code was designed to obtain.cybergenics,at.when the trustee is delinquent,the bankruptcy the district court of which it is a unit should be able to exercise its equitable powers to authorize a creditor to pursue recovery of fraudulently transferred property for the benefit of the estate.in so doing,this equitable remedy effectuates congress intent that fraudulently transferred property be recovered for the bankruptcy estate.
the jt t parties argue in the alternative that even if derivative standing is available in chapter proceedings,it should not be available in chapter proceedings such as the instant case.the jt t parties acknowledge that derivative standing may be necessary in chapter proceedings where typically there is not an independent trustee and thus it is the debtor who generally decides whether to bring an avoidance action.we noted in gibson group that a often acts under the influence of conflicts of interest and may be tempted to use its discretion as a sword to favor certain creditors over others,rather than as a tool to further its reorganization for the benefit of all creditors as congress intended.canadian pacific forest products,irving,in re the gibson group,cir.the jt t parties submit that derivative standing is not necessary in the chapter context because chapter proceedings always have an independent trustee who is not subject to such conflicts of interest.
we reject this attempt to limit derivative standing to chapter proceedings.first,there is circuit precedent allowing derivative standing in chapter proceedings,albeit in a code case.william tanner united states in re automated bus,cir.in automated business systems,a reform act of case,we held that a creditor had derivative standing to pursue an avoidance action when the trustee in chapter liquidation proceedings refused to bring an action because of a lack of funds in the estate.id.at.we noted there that the need for derivative standing could be particularly great in the context of chapter proceedings where there may be no funds remain ing to divide among creditors or to finance a suit to set aside a fraudulent conveyance.id.at.
second,there is no textual support in the code for drawing such a distinction between the chapter and chapter contexts.section b b,which provides textual support for the availability of derivative standing,applies in both chapter and chapter proceedings.we do not believe that this was a mere oversight,given that congress expressly limited another subsection of b to chapters and.see b d providing that creditors and other enumerated parties may recoup costs incurred in making a substantial contribution in a case under chapter or of this title.
there are also substantial policy reasons for allowing derivative standing in chapter proceedings.as we noted in automated business systems,in contrast to chapter reorganization proceedings,in chapter liquidation proceedings there are often no funds remain ing to divide among creditors or to finance a suit to set aside a fraudulent conveyance.at.consequently,a trustee in chapter proceedings may decline to pursue meritorious and potentially sizeable claims simply because there are inadequate funds in the estate to pay litigation expenses.indeed,that appears to be the case here.the trustee explained that he did have any money in the case and that economics was part of reason that he did not pursue the avoidance claims urged by hyundai.at hr g tr.at at dist.op.at.although the trustee stated that he could not retain competent counsel in a case like this to go forward on a contingency fee basis,the record does not indicate whether the trustee actually attempted to find contingency counsel or simply concluded on his own that it would be futile.at hr g tr.at.in any case,we do not believe that the trustee failure to obtain contingency counsel suggests that the avoidance claims were weak or insubstantial.we note,for instance,that the jt t parties offered to settle the claims for,and that hyundai has made a substantial investment in pursuing these claims in the present case and in the district court action.instead,the record indicates that the trustee declined to pursue apparently potentially in large part because of a lack of available funds to finance an investigation and possible litigation.just as conflicts of interest may lead to underenforcement of avoidance claims by in chapter proceedings,a lack of available funds may lead to underenforcement by trustees in chapter proceedings.in this situation,we believe that bankruptcy courts should be able to authorize derivative standing for creditors willing and able to prosecute colorable claims that may enhance the value of the bankruptcy estate in chapter proceedings.
finally,we pause to emphasize additional ways that the practice of derivative standing that we approved in gibson group and now reaffirm is distinguishable from the practice addressed by the supreme court in hartford underwriters.there,the court expressly limited its holding to a creditor assertion of an independent right to proceed under the code specifically under c.at.unlike the petitioner in hartford underwriters,hyundai does not assert an independent right,but instead must seek and obtain permission from the bankruptcy court or the district court of which it is a unit before it may proceed on behalf of the estate.because derivative standing is not asserted as an independent right and must be authorized by the bankruptcy court,it does not present the same risk of interference with the trustee and the bankruptcy court feared by the supreme court in hartford underwriters.the hartford underwriters court expressed concern that allowing parties to proceed independently under c without court permission could impair the ability of the bankruptcy court to coordinate proceedings,as well as the ability of the trustee to manage the estate and that parties could proceed even where the trustee himself planned to do so.id.at.further,the court feared that parties might attempt to use c even though their claim was quite weak.id.however,these concerns are greatly alleviated by the procedural prerequisites to derivative standing.in gibson group,we held that a party moving for derivative standing must show that a demand was made on the trustee or to act,the trustee or declined,a colorable claim exists that would benefit the estate,and the trustee or inaction was an abuse of discretion.at.in sharp contrast to the practice disapproved of in hartford underwriters,a creditor may not proceed when the trustee plans to do so,a creditor may not bring a weak or claim,and,because derivative standing must be judicially approved,the bankruptcy court ability to coordinate proceedings is not impaired.
in conclusion,we reaffirm the continued vitality after hartford underwriters of granting derivative standing to creditors to pursue avoidance actions on behalf of the estate and hold that this practice is available in both chapter and chapter proceedings.
application of gibson group factors 
after concluding that derivative standing survived hartford underwriters,the district court found that hyundai satisfied the test for derivative standing under gibson group.this issue was not certified to this court,and the parties have not addressed it in their briefs on appeal.w e recognize that even those issues not properly certified are subject to our discretionary power of review if otherwise necessary to the disposition of the case.easley pettibone,cir internal quotation marks omitted.here,however,the record on appeal is inadequate.under gibson group,a party seeking derivative standing must establish,inter alia,a colorable claim that would benefit the estate.at.in determining whether a claim is colorable in this context,courts initially look to the face of the complaint.id.at.looking to the complaint that hyundai filed in its separate district court action,the district court in this case found that the complaint provided sufficient evidence of a colorable claim.that complaint,however,was not included in the joint appendix in this appeal.accordingly,we will not guess at the complaint contents based on descriptions by the parties and the courts below.because this issue was not certified to this court,the parties did not argue this issue on appeal,and the record before us is inadequate,we decline to review the district court ruling that hyundai satisfied gibson group test for derivative standing.
lift of automatic stay 
because we affirm the district court grant of derivative standing to hyundai,we conclude that relief from the automatic stay is not necessary for the adequate protection of hyundai interests.hyundai requested that the bankruptcy court lift the automatic stay so that it could return to the district court to pursue its action against the jt t parties to recover the assets allegedly fraudulently transferred from trailer source.a bankruptcy court must grant such a request for cause,including the lack of adequate protection of an interest in property of such party in interest.d.
although hyundai argues on appeal that we should affirm the district court order granting relief from the stay,hyundai also appears to acknowledge that this would be unnecessary if it is granted derivative standing.indeed,the bankruptcy court denial of derivative standing was the only reason that hyundai later requested relief from the automatic stay.hyundai states that 
for purposes of the derivative standing motion,hyundai agreed to subordinate its secured claim and receive a pro rata distribution from any recovery along with the allowed claims of other creditors in the case.the denial of derivative standing by the bankruptcy court formed the basis for hyundai later request for relief from the automatic stay on february,to enforce its rights granted in the settlement and security agreement.
hyundai br.at.hyundai sought to have the stay lifted so that it could bring claims against the jt t parties to recover assets allegedly transferred from trailer source.that is precisely what it will do now that it has been granted derivative standing,only it will do so indirectly,on behalf of the estate,rather than directly.because hyundai will now be able to pursue its claims against the jt t parties derivatively on behalf of the estate,relief from the stay is not necessary to provide adequate protection of hyundai interests.accordingly,we reverse the district court grant of stay relief.
iii.conclusion 
for the reasons stated above,we affirm the district court grant of derivative standing to hyundai and reverse the district court grant of relief from the stay to hyundai.the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
because appellants do not have appellate standing,i would dismiss their appeal.the jt t parties have not established that they have a protected pecuniary interest supporting reversal of either the order denying hyundai request for derivative standing or the order denying hyundai motion to lift stay.accordingly,they do not have appellate standing to challenge those determinations.

in most cases where appellate standing is at issue before a court of appeals,the question is whether the party who appealed the bankruptcy court order to the district court was sufficiently aggrieved by that ruling.here,as the majority opinion notes,there is no dispute that the party who initially challenged the bankruptcy court orders,hyundai,had appellate standing to do so.instead,the issue in this case is whether the jt t parties may now appeal the district court reversal of the bankruptcy court orders.
even if the jt t parties did not need to be persons aggrieved to defend an order of the bankruptcy court before the district court,see baron budd,unsecured asbestos claimants,they must be such parties to appeal the district court ruling to this court.the appellate standing doctrine exists to prevent indirectly affected parties from stalling bankruptcy proceedings,and this interest is implicated in the context of an appeal from a district court to a court of appeals as much as in an appeal from a bankruptcy court to a district court.moreover,there is no more of a perverse imbalance in permitting only one side to appeal a district court judgment than in permitting only one side to appeal a bankruptcy court decision,the context in which the majority accepts application of the appellate standing limitation.
the jt t parties argue that they were aggrieved by the district court order granting hyundai derivative standing and lifting the automatic bankruptcy stay,and that they thus should be permitted to appeal that decision.they primarily argue for appellate standing in their capacity as defendants to future litigation,pointing out that they would not be subject to suit by either the estate or hyundai but for the district court decision.in the alternative,the jt t parties contend that they have standing as creditors to challenge any orders affecting the assets and administration of the bankruptcy estate.neither of those contentions is correct.
the jt t parties do not have appellate standing,either as defendants to an adversary proceeding or as creditors of the estate,to attack the order granting hyundai derivative standing.first,it is well established that parties are not aggrieved by an order granting a creditor derivative standing when their interest in the order is as party defendants in the resulting adversary proceeding.see travelers ins.porter,cir in re el san juan hotel,at in re fondiller,at moran official comm.of admin.claimants,wl,at,t here are no cases which support the argument that litigation,whether real or potential,makes someone a person aggrieved for standing purposes.in re ashford hotels.this is because the interest that entities such as the jt t parties assert as defendants to an adversary proceeding is not protected by the bankruptcy code.to be considered a person aggrieved,an appellant must establish both an injury in fact as well as that the interest which he seeks to protect is an interest which the bankruptcy act seeks to protect or regulate.in re the harwald,cir.even if we assume that b and a do preclude all parties other than the trustee from bringing avoidance and recovery actions,as the jt t parties contend,the purpose of such preclusion is presumably to allow the trustee to retain control over the administration of the estate.see hartford underwriters ins.union planters bank,d discussing the unique role that the trustee plays in managing the estate.it is not to protect parties against whom relief may be sought for the estate.the interest of the jt t parties as adversary defendants,which is avoiding liability to the estate,is diametrically opposed to the primary goal of b and a,which is to allow the estate to recover fraudulently transferred assets,as well as that of the bankruptcy code in general,which is to minimize the injury to creditors,in re the harwald,at.because the interest of the jt t parties as defendants to an adversary proceeding is not one that the code provisions relied upon protect,they do not have appellate standing in this capacity to challenge the reversal of the order denying hyundai derivative standing.
moreover,as several courts have observed,an order that simply allows an adversary proceeding to go forward does not directly diminish a defendant property,increase his burdens,or impair his rights,in re el san juan hotel,at in re fondiller,at.as those courts have explained,a bankruptcy order permitting a creditor to bring an action on the estate behalf affects such an adversary defendant rights incidentally,rather than directly.see,in re el san juan hotel,at.although a named defendant in an adversary proceeding might have an interest in defending himself against liability,an order that merely allows the action to go forward does not impair his ability to so.see also fidelity bank,at.the order does not,for example,prevent the defendant from asserting a claim or defense in the adversary proceeding that might otherwise be available to him.fidelity bank,at in re el san juan hotel,at.here,indeed,the jt t parties state that they will argue in the adversary action that the california settlement prevents hyundai from recovering transferred assets in excess of the amount needed to satisfy allowed and administrative creditor claims.
because the interest that the jt t parties assert as defendants to an adversary proceeding is not protected by the bankruptcy code provisions relied upon in this appeal,it is irrelevant that it is no longer uncertain whether the jt t parties will be sued by the estate.the jt t parties point out that hyundai has already substituted the estate as plaintiff in the district court action against them.they contend,based on this,that the order effect on their interest is now sufficiently definite to permit them to appeal that decision.this argument misses the point.absent a direct,protected interest,it does not matter how certain the effect of the order is.indeed,the jt t parties potential liability is no less speculative than that faced by named defendants in other cases who were held not to be persons aggrieved.in in re el san juan hotel,for example,the first circuit held that a former bankruptcy trustee did not have appellate standing to challenge the appointment of counsel for the estate to bring a fraudulent concealment action against him.at.because the former trustee only interest wa s as party defendant,the first circuit held that the appointment ha d no direct and immediate impact on his pecuniary interests.id.this was the case even though the moving party explicitly request ed permission to prosecute a suit and the bankruptcy court granted the requisite leave to file the complaint.id.at emphasis added.see also moran,wl,at holding that an adversary defendant was not a person aggrieved even though creditor committee acting on behalf of the estate ha d already filed claims against him.
in re fondiller,upon which the jt t parties rely,is not to the contrary.in that case,the ninth circuit held that an appellant could not appeal from a bankruptcy order authorizing the employment of special counsel for the estate to investigate and recover assets allegedly concealed by appellant.at.although it does not appear that an action had yet been brought against the appellant at the time of her appeal,unlike in this case,it was hardly unlikely there that one would soon be brought.at the time of the order,the appointed party had already performed an extensive investigation into the fraudulent transfers.id.at.moreover,the trustee was specifically appointed to recover the transferred assets.id.nothing in the ninth circuit analysis suggests that it hinged upon the fact that an adversary action had not yet been brought such that the appellant would have had appellate standing had she already been named as a defendant.in fact,in the subsequently decided duckor spradling metzger baum trust in re,cir,the ninth circuit strongly suggested that a party is not aggrieved by an order that permits an adversary proceeding to go forward,even where the party has already been named as a defendant.there,the ninth circuit held that the interest of an appellant who had already been sued was similar to the interest asserted in in re fondiller.id.at.nonetheless,the court held that the duckor appellant had appellate standing because it also ha d alleged that it would be harmed by the order as a creditor of the estate,and thus had the type of direct pecuniary interest that was lacking in fondiller.see also in re el san juan hotel,at explicitly relying upon in re fondiller in holding that the appellant was not aggrieved despite virtual certainty that he would be named as a defendant.
the jt t parties were also not aggrieved in their capacity as purported creditors of the estate.this is a distinct theory,as the duckor court explained.as an initial matter,it is not entirely clear from the record whether the jt t parties have a legitimate claim against the estate.although they are listed as creditors in the bankruptcy proceedings,the jt t parties have yet to file a proof of claim with the bankruptcy court as to any debt that trailer source owes them moreover,on appeal to this court,the jt t parties have not attempted to explain their precise claim against the estate.nonetheless,because the deadline for filing proofs of claim has not passed and because hyundai arguably conceded before the district court that the jt t parties have some form of claim against the estate i assume for purposes of this appeal that the jt t parties are in fact creditors.
however,even if the jt t parties are creditors,that does not necessarily mean that they are persons aggrieved by the order permitting hyundai to bring claims on the estate behalf.a party does not automatically have appellate standing by virtue of being a creditor.see,williams cheves in re williams,cir richardson treacy,shaffel,moore mueller in re richardson indus.contractors,cir lopez behles in re am.ready mix,cir tilley vucurevich in re pecan groves of,cir.w hether or not a party is a creditor misses the point to have standing to appeal,the party must demonstrate he has a direct and adverse pecuniary interest in each order he challenges.in re am.ready mix,at.
here,the jt t parties have not pointed to evidence establishing that they will suffer a direct pecuniary loss if hyundai can not recover on the fraudulent conveyance claims for the estate,and thus do not have appellate standing despite their being creditors.a creditor generally has appellate standing to challenge an order affecting the specific assets from which he seeks to be paid.salomon logan in re int l envtl.dynamics,cir see also licensing by paolo,sinatra in re gucci,cir.however,even a party asserting a claim against the estate must show a realistic likelihood of suffering pecuniary harm as a result of the action.schum zwirn special opportunities fund lp in re the watch,cir gibbs bruns llp coho energy,in re coho energy,cir even a claimant to a fund must show a realistic likelihood of injury in order to have standing.as the record here currently stands,it is unclear whether allowing hyundai to bring the avoidance and recovery action would even affect the payment of the jt t parties claim.the jt t parties have not provided this court with any description of their claim or the assets out of which that claim could potentially be paid,much less pointed to evidence in the record to substantiate any such allegations.
without this kind of evidence,it is impossible to ascertain whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jt t parties would actually be harmed in their capacity as creditors by the grant of derivative standing.if,for example,the estate contains little of value aside from the fraudulent conveyance claims and the jt t parties claim is unsecured and subordinate to those of all other creditors,it is very possible that the jt t parties would not have recovered anything even in the absence of a grant of derivative standing to hyundai or,if the estate has additional assets and the jt t parties have a small,secured claim that is superior to all other claims,then they will likely recover on their claim regardless of whether the adversary action brought by hyundai is successful.in either of these scenarios,permitting hyundai to pursue the avoidance and recovery action could hardly be said to have a negative impact on the jt t parties interests as creditors.see in re the watch.at stating,in dictum,that the creditor injury was too speculative where he could not show a likelihood of recovering on his unsecured claim in re richardson indus.contractors.at holding that unsecured creditor could not appeal decision determining priority among secured creditors because it would not affect the payment of his claims see also fishell soltow in re fishell,wl,at cir,holding that debtors lacked appellate standing because they had not provided information regarding the estate other assets and liabilities,the cost of litigation,or other factors regarding the litigation impact on the estate chemlen bank of ir.first holdings,wl,at cir,recognizing district court application of the same rule.thus,even if it is assumed that the jt t parties have some sort of claim against the estate,they have not established that they were aggrieved by the reversal of the order denying derivative standing to hyundai.
furthermore,it is obvious from the adverse interests of the jt t parties and the estate that the jt t parties are not actually bringing this appeal as creditors.because of their dual status as creditors and adversary defendants,the jt t parties will not actually suffer a pecuniary injury if the estate does not re
