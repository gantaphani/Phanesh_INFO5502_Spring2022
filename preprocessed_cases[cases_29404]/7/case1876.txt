m m auto,appeals the merits portion of a bankruptcy appellate panel decision affirming the wyoming bankruptcy court determination that m m willfully violated the automatic stay of by repossessing a pickup truck after a chapter bankruptcy petition had been filed.m m appeal presents a host of issues,including the finality of the bap decision,the burden of proof required by,the meaning of willful under,and the application of that definition to m m actions.
background 
this tortured tale about a truck and those that would possess it began when debtors tommy dean and candice ann johnson purchased a pickup truck from m johnson smith in re johnson,table,wl,at bap cir.pursuant to a retail installment contract and security agreement the sales contract signed by the parties on march,debtors agreed to purchase the vehicle for.the sales contract specified that debtors would make a down payment,consisting of previously paid to m m for the failed purchase of a different vehicle,in cash,and a deferred payment due april,on march,debtors paid the additional,took possession of the vehicle,and received a bill of sale.the bill of sale listed wells fargo fin as the lienholder it contained no contingencies other than a statement that the sale would not become binding until accepted by the dealer or his authorized representative.app.at decision on debtors am.compl.for turnover,sanctions and injunctive relief at.july,hereinafter.order.m m authorized representative executed the bill of sale on march.
debtors financed the rest of the purchase price.the terms of the financing required repayment over thirty months at a sixteen percent interest rate,with the first installment due on april.the parties understood that financing would be arranged through wells fargo financial,and the sales contract contained an assignment provision apparently for that purpose.wells fargo was not,however,a party to the sales contract.rather,the sales contract listed m m as the seller,required debtors to make payments to the seller,and granted m m a security interest in the vehicle.
m m informed debtors that wells fargo would contact them within ten days of the vehicle purchase,although the parties dispute the purpose of this call.according to m m,the call was intended to allow wells fargo to conduct a loan interview,a fact which m m alleges debtors were aware of given their past attempts to finance a vehicle purchase with m debtors believed the call was meant merely to inform them how to make loan payments.debtors assumed,based on a previous vehicle purchase through m m and a document entitled m m auto outlet casper gillette rocksprings your sic approved that appeared to indicate loan approval,that wells fargo had already approved the financing arrangement.app.at.order at.
regardless,wells fargo either did not call debtors or was unable to reach them.testimony illustrated that on or around april,debtors called wells fargo in order to ascertain how to make the upcoming initial loan payment.wells fargo informed them that it had no account in their name.debtors then called m m m required that debtors supply additional paperwork,which they apparently delivered on april,the due date for the first payment.according to debtors,m m represented that it would contact wells fargo to obtain the payment information for debtors,but did not do so.debtors,therefore,did not make their initial loan payment.
just days later,on may,debtors filed a chapter bankruptcy petition.that petition listed wells fargo as a secured creditor and m m as an unsecured creditor.the court sent out notice of debtor bankruptcy to all listed creditors.debtors erroneously listed m m physical address on the petition,rather than m m postal mailing address.accordingly,m m never received official notice of the bankruptcy proceeding.
on either may or may,m m repossessed the pickup truck.on may,debtor attorney contacted m m and spoke to its,informing him of the bankruptcy and demanding the vehicle immediate return.m m refused because the believed that the call was merely a ruse put on by debtors in an attempt to illegally recover the pickup truck.
a flurry of litigation followed.on may,debtors filed a complaint against m m alleging violation of the automatic stay under and seeking declaratory and compensatory relief.debtors also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order tro seeking to enjoin any potential sale of the vehicle and to obtain possession of the vehicle.the bankruptcy court granted debtor tro motion and ordered m m to deliver the vehicle to debtors.debtors moved to amend their complaint in order to request turnover of the vehicle title in addition to the previously requested relief.debtors also filed a separate motion requesting turnover of the vehicle title.
m m complied with the tro order.due to confusion over the vehicle location at the delivery site not attributable to m m,however,debtors were unable to retrieve the vehicle.as a result,debtors filed a motion for expedited impositions of sanctions and order directing marshall to collect property.the motion was rendered moot when,at an expedited hearing on the motion,m m explained that it had delivered the vehicle and its location at the delivery location became apparent.debtors nevertheless modified their motion to request turnover of the vehicle title.
the bankruptcy court then granted debtors motion to amend their complaint.following debtors filing of the amended complaint,m m moved to dismiss the action.thereafter,m m filed a motion to modify the automatic stay in order to repossess and sell the pickup truck or,in the alternative,to require debtors to assume or reject the sales contract.the bankruptcy court denied m m motion to dismiss and held an evidentiary hearing in order to address the outstanding motions.
the bankruptcy court subsequently granted debtors various motions requesting the vehicle title and denied m m request for relief from the automatic stay.in addition,the bankruptcy court ruled in favor of debtors on their amended complaint,finding that m m willfully violated.the bankruptcy court deferred assessing damages until it held an additional evidentiary hearing on that issue.
m m issued a new title reassignment pursuant to the bankruptcy court order.that title,however,listed m m as the lienholder rather than wells fargo as a result,debtors were unable to register and license the vehicle without providing the wyoming motor vehicle department with a lien release or a copy of the security agreement.although m m faxed the necessary materials to the proper state official,debtors refused to proceed with the registration and licensing.thus,the pickup truck sat unused.
the bankruptcy court then held the evidentiary hearing to determine the amount of damages stemming from m m willful violation of the stay.in its order on damages,the bankruptcy court required m m to provide debtors with a title clear of m m lien and awarded in damages.specifically,the bankruptcy court awarded debtors for loss of use of the pickup truck,in attorney fees,and in costs.
m m appealed the grant of the tro,the denial of the motion to dismiss,the order requiring turnover of the vehicle title,and the merits decision to the bap.the bap affirmed the bankruptcy court decision on the merits,but reversed the bankruptcy court damages award on loss of use due to insufficient evidence,vacated the attorney fees,and remanded that issue for further proceedings.those proceedings regarding attorney fees remain outstanding.
m m now appeals the merits portion of the bap decision.
jurisdiction 
on march,this court issued an order to show cause why this appeal should not be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.specifically,we questioned whether the bap decision was a final,appealable order when further proceedings were required to resolve damages.recognizing that the bap remanded only for a redetermination of attorney fees,we now hold that our jurisdiction is appropriate under d.see budinich becton dickinson,d promulgating uniform rule that an unresolved issue of attorney fees under,regardless of the characterization of those fees by the statute or decisional law that authorizes them,does not affect finality of lower court orders see also groetken davis in re davis,cir unpublished analogizing jurisdictional holding in budinich to d and finding jurisdiction despite outstanding attorney fee determination unified people fed.credit union yates in re yates,wl,at bap cir,unpublished examining various circuit court approaches to budinich in determining that remand for attorney fee determination does not nullify jurisdiction under d.this conclusion is consistent with that of several of our sister circuits that have had occasion to examine the finality of bankruptcy orders where only attorney fee calculations remain unresolved.see,united states rivera torres in re rivera torres,cir stating that t he fact that here we are operating under d rather than makes little difference given t he great similarity between an adversary proceeding in bankruptcy and an ordinary civil action quoting estancias la ponderosa dev.harrington in re harrington,cir alteration in original colon hart in re colon,cir analogizing to budinich in determining that decision on merits was final regardless of whether or not attorney fees had been quantified.
ii.automatic stay violation 
under a,a chapter petition triggers a stay against any act aimed at obtaining possession of property belonging to the debtor estate.section k provides in part that an individual injured by any willful violation of the automatic stay shall recover actual damages,including costs and attorneys fees.
although m m appeals the bap decision,we independently review the bankruptcy court decision,conducting de novo review of its legal determinations and clear error review of its factual determinations.alderete educ.credit mgmt.in re alderete,cir.
m m argues that the bankruptcy court failed to apply the proper burden of proof in analyzing whether m m repossession of the vehicle constituted a willful violation of the automatic stay.specifically,m m asserts that the evidence of its knowledge of debtors chapter petition should have been established by clear and convincing evidence,not by a preponderance of the evidence.as a consequence,m m contends that the bankruptcy court erroneously concluded that m m had sufficient knowledge of debtors chapter petition to willfully violate.
standard of proof 
the burden of proof needed to establish a willful violation under k is less than certain in this circuit.compare in re sullivan,employing preponderance of the evidence test,but noting difference of opinion among the courts regarding the proper standard of evidence to be used in an action to impose sanctions under h quoting clayton king in re clayton,with diviney nationsbank of texas in re diviney,aff bap cir applying clear and convincing standard.indeed,the bap decision at issue on appeal pointed out the divergent positions.unfortunately,its attempt to resolve the issue only further jumbled it.
the bap decision here correctly concluded that willful violations of the automatic stay provision must be established by a preponderance of the evidence.in arriving at this conclusion,the panel suggested that the diviney panel choice of the clear and convincing standard was merely applying,without considering,the standard employed by the district court in that case.a plain reading of diviney belies that assertion.in view of our affirmance of the bap correct application of the preponderance of the evidence standard,we make clear that diviney incorrectly applied the wrong standard of proof.
in grogan garner,d,the supreme court stated because the standard results in a roughly equal allocation of the risk of error between litigants,we presume that this standard is applicable in civil actions between private litigants unless particularly important individual interests or rights are at stake.id.at.quoting herman maclean huddleston,d citing cases concerning termination of parental rights,civil commitment,and deportation as examples of particularly important individual interests or rights.in grogan,fraud victims obtained a judgment in their favor,but were forced to file to have that judgment excepted from discharge under a when the debtor filed for bankruptcy in an attempt to discharge the judgment.resolving the matter required a determination as to the level of proof necessary to obtain an exception from discharge.the supreme court compared the purposes of the bankruptcy law policy with the need to dispense justice to perpetrators of fraud and concluded that the preponderance of the evidence standard achieved a fair balance between these conflicting interests.id.at.
no aspect of the instant circumstance suggests that a stricter standard should apply.the automatic stay is crucial to effecting the policy,see midlantic bank dep t of envtl,d,and no dishonest action by debtors warrants disciplining our application of the preponderance of the evidence standard to rebalance the competing interests.moreover,the competing interest of preserving creditor rights is constrained by d,which permits creditors to seek relief from the automatic stay.
further support for employing the preponderance standard is found in the text of k,which imposes a condition for recovery of punitive damages but not for actual damages,attorney fees,or costs.ramirez fuselier in re ramirez,bap cir the words shall recover indicate that congress intended that the award of actual damages,costs and attorney fees be mandatory upon a finding of a willful violation of the stay.the subsection allowance for punitive damages only in appropriate circumstances suggests that a stricter evidentiary standard should apply only to a determination on punitives.the courts addressing this issue observe that imposition of punitive damages harkens to the original civil contempt actions that were required prior to enactment of,and they draw a distinction between the standard used for assessing punitives as opposed to actual damages,attorney fees,and costs.see,green tree servicing,llc taylor,one point that seems clear from the different standards articulated is that punitive damages usually require more than mere willful violation of the automatic stay.quoting heghmann,at ford motor florio in re florio,it is well established that the clear and convincing standard applies only when there is an adjudication of contempt for the violation of an automatic stay if that is not the case,the clear and convincing standard of proof does not apply.mack.dep t of pub.welfare in re mack,in order to prevail on an action for contempt the moving party must prove his case by clear and convincing evidence rather than by the usual standard of a preponderance of the evidence.accordingly,we hold that willful violations of an automatic stay must be proven by a preponderance of the evidence.
meaning of willful 
this court has yet to define willful in the context.a number of courts in this circuit cite in re diviney definition of willful.although not incorrect,that definition is based in part on our decision in financial services,posta in re posta,cir,which defined willful in the context of a in re posta was abrogated,however,by kawaauhau geiger,d.geiger,in analyzing the impact of the word willful as a modifier in the phrase willful injury,held that in the a context,nondischargeability takes a deliberate or intentional injury,not merely a deliberate or intentional act that leads to injury.id.at.emphasis omitted.because m m questions the scope of what constitutes a willful violation of an automatic stay and at least one district court in this circuit has used geiger restrictive definition in the automatic stay context we believe it necessary to provide a comprehensive definition of willful applicable to.
we agree with the interpretation of willful provided by a large number of courts that have analyzed k.thus,we hold that in order to demonstrate a violation of k,the debtor bears the burden of establishing,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the creditor knew of the automatic stay and intended the actions that constituted the violation no specific intent is required.see,brown chesnut in re chesnut,cir fleet mortgage group,kaneb,cir cuffee atl.bus.cmty.dev.in re atl.bus.cmty,cir knaus concordia lumber in re knaus,cir goichman bloom in re bloom,cir.accordingly,a creditor good faith belief that it had a right to the property is irrelevant.see,in re chesnut,at kaneb,at tsafaroff taylor in re taylor,cir.notice of the bankruptcy filing need not be formal or official to put a creditor on notice.see,taylor,at collecting cases.
applying this definition to the facts of the instant action,we can not say that the bankruptcy court was clearly erroneous in finding that m m possessed sufficient knowledge of debtors bankruptcy to warrant a conclusion that m m refusal to return the pickup truck constituted a willful violation of the automatic stay.on may,debtors attorney telephoned m m and demanded the immediate return of the repossessed vehicle.this fact was established via an affidavit submitted by debtors attorney.the m m vice president testified that debtors attorney manner was abrupt and harsh app.at and,in his experience,unlike that of other debtors counsel.he also testified that debtors attorney failed to offer any documentation that might prove that debtors in fact had filed for bankruptcy.as a result,he believed the telephone call was a scam designed to trick m m into returning the otherwise lawfully repossessed vehicle.
the bankruptcy court determined that debtors counsel telephone call to m m placed m m on actual notice.we agree.first,the vice president testified that immediately after the telephone call with debtors counsel ended,he called several employees in to sound it off them because he was suspicious about the veracity of the attorney assertions.app.at.second,the vice president testified that,because debtors previously had filed for bankruptcy,he did not believe that enough time had passed since that filing to render them eligible to refile this belief about debtors eligibility to refile,coupled with m m suspicion following the telephone call,causes us to affirm the bankruptcy court conclusion that m m had a responsibility to investigate further if it seemed debtors counsel was making false representations,despite his demeanor.app.at order on damages at,hereinafter damages order.
the dissent overemphasizes the degree to which the bankruptcy court credited the testimony and the relevancy of m m beliefs,reasonable or otherwise.by blending testimony given by m m at two separate hearings some three months apart,the dissent attempts to paint a picture different from that necessarily credited by the bankruptcy court in reaching its decision that m m violated the automatic stay,a decision arrived at after lengthy and acrimonious litigation.while the finding of fact regarding the suspicion was listed in the bankruptcy court july order,it was not until the october hearing on damages,however,that the alluded to having been rebuffed in his requests for verifying documentation.this claimed attempt to make inquiry was not stated by the at the earlier hearing.rather,at the first hearing the bankruptcy court had before it debtors counsel affidavit stating that bankruptcy notice was mailed and faxed to m m prior to the telephone call.despite the dissent heavy reliance on the alleged attempted inquiry,it is notable that the bankruptcy court made no such finding in any of its orders.in addition,m m provided this testimony only after the bankruptcy court faced no less than three different excuses from m m for its failure to return the vehicle,all of which were rejected by the bankruptcy court.indeed,the apparently crucial testimony about being refused proof of the bankruptcy filing was provided nearly three months after the bankruptcy court concluded that m m had violated the automatic stay.
the dissent reliance on the reasonableness of m m excuses is irrelevant.willfulness is to be liberally construed to bolster the protections of the automatic stay,in re sharon,at,and is designed to ensure compliance with the stay by encouraging creditors to seek relief from the court whenever they are on notice of even a potential stay violation,commercial bank hundley in re hundley,wl,at.accordingly,m m beliefs,however reasonable,have no bearing on willfulness.see,in re chesnut,at kaneb,at in re taylor,at.moreover,the travails envisioned by the dissent in verifying debtors true bankruptcy status are fanciful m m is a sophisticated car dealership represented by counsel and admittedly quite familiar with repossession and bankruptcy procedure.m m knew debtors name and address and could easily have called the clerk for the single bankruptcy court covering the area in which debtors resided.
although debtors presented limited evidence about the nature of the phone call,they nevertheless proved the automatic stay violation by a preponderance of the evidence.that conclusion is consistent with the factual findings made by the bankruptcy court over the course of this protracted litigation,factual findings that we can not say are clearly erroneous.see coons city of siloam springs in re coons,observing that while vague indefinite statement by the debtors that they had filed bankruptcy,without giving the number of the case or where it was filed,would not be sufficient notice,fact that debtor attorney telephoned creditor to inform it of bankruptcy filing imposed duty upon creditor to inquire of the court clerk in re bragg,finding knowledge where facts are sufficient to cause a reasonably prudent person to make further inquiry and stating that simple telephone call to the clerk office would have resolved confusion sermersheim sermersheim in re sermersheim,finding uncontested affidavit of debtor attorney that he provided telephonic notice of debtor bankruptcy case sufficient to hold creditor in violation of h.
iii.nature of the sales contract 
m m argues on appeal that the sales contract is an executory contract that,in accordance with,debtors must either accept or reject.this argument,made in conjunction with m m contention that debtors breached the sales contract,constitutes a clever attempt to force debtors to cure their alleged breach while accepting the contract,as mandated under b.forcing debtors to accept the sales contract at this late date also gives m m a second chance to perfect its lien.obviously,rejecting the sales contract would cause debtors to lose the vehicle.
according to the widely adopted classic definition provided by professor countryman,an executory contract is a contract under which the obligation of both the bankrupt and other party to the contract are so far unperformed that the failure of either to complete performance would constitute a material breach excusing performance of the other.vern countryman,executory contracts in bankruptcy part i.m m contends that both parties substantial remaining obligations render the sales contract executory.according to m m,debtors were obligated to make payment in full,provide necessary residency and income verification documentation,and complete a financing interview with wells fargo.for its part,m m remained obligated to transfer the vehicle title to debtors after the final installment payment was tendered.
we disagree with m m characterization of the sales contract.as the bankruptcy court pointed out,debtors paid the entire down payment in accordance with the deferred payment schedule and delivered all requested,extracontractual documentation.nor do we disagree with the bankruptcy court determination that debtors failure to complete the financing interview was not attributable to them.debtors sole obligation to tender installment payments and m m sole obligation to release the lien when handing over the vehicle title are insufficient to warrant classifying the sales contract as executory.a host of courts have found similar automobile retail installment contracts nonexecutory in nature.see,in re steffen,w here as here the goods have already been delivered and the seller only remaining obligation is delivery of title on receipt of full payment,there is no executory contract.chrysler credit sparago in re sparago,finding inapplicable because a secured car loan is not an executory contract or lease in re shada truck leasing,finding retail installment sales contract for eight vehicles nonexecutory where debtor only obligation was pa
