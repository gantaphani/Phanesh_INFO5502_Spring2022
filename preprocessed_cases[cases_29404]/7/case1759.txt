background 
silver sage is a partnership organized to purchase and develop low income housing.after the city refused to authorize silver sage to build certain low income housing projects,silver sage sued the city for,inter alia,violations of the federal fair housing act.a trial was held in the federal district court for the central district of california.a jury found the city liable and awarded silver sage approximately three million dollars in damages.the city moved for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict or,in the alternative,for a new trial.shortly after the jury verdict but before the district court ruled on the city new trial motion,silver sage served a writ of execution on the city bank,thereby freezing funds the city used for basic city services,such as payroll,utilities and insurance premiums for worker compensation.the district court quashed the writ and ordered silver sage to show cause for why it should not be sanctioned.
the district court denied the city motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict.the district court,however,found the jury award of damages grossly excessive but denied the motion for a new trial on the condition that silver sage accept a remittitur to.silver sage rejected the remittitur and a new trial on damages was held.the second jury awarded silver sage one dollar.the district court denied both silver sage motion to amend the damages award and its motion for a new trial.
silver sage appealed to this court.because the district court abused its discretion by vacating the first jury award of damages,we reversed and reinstated the original award of damages.silver sage partners,city of desert hot springs,cir.around the time that our opinion was filed,the city began consulting with bankruptcy experts in contemplation of possibly filing for bankruptcy,under chapter of the bankruptcy act.
the mandate from this court issued about six months after our opinion was filed.upon issuance of the mandate,the city asked for assurances from silver sage that it would not again attempt to freeze the city bank accounts.silver sage responded by demanding that it be paid and refusing to give the city any assurances.the city then filed a motion in district court that would order silver sage not to take any illegal actions to collect its judgment.silver sage responded that if the city did not express its willingness to immediately pay the judgment within two days,it would begin the collection process.the city then sought ex parte relief in the district court,seeking an order that would temporarily restrain silver sage from levying on its bank accounts.silver sage then told the city that it would not seek to freeze the city bank accounts if the city agreed to several conditions.silver sage demanded that the city agree to an order from the district court that it immediately pay the judgment the city propose a plan within three weeks to pay the judgment and attorney fees the city agree to make no expenditure not in the regular course of business and the city agree that any payment that silver sage disputes is not in the regular course of business not be relied upon to justify the city not paying the judgment or interest on the judgment.the city decided it could not meet those demands.the district court denied the city motion for ex parte relief with no explanation.
the city apparently believed that silver sage was not interested in negotiating in good faith a plan to pay the judgment.before the hearing on the city original motion to stop silver sage from taking illegal action to enforce its judgment,the city filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under chapter of the bankruptcy code,et.as a result of the petition for bankruptcy,an automatic stay was placed on all efforts by silver sage to collect its judgment.
in a press release,the city stated that it commenced the bankruptcy because silver sage has threatened to seize the city bank accounts and levy on city assets.according to an article in the desert sun,the mayor of the city said that as a result of its filing for bankruptcy,it would likely only pay to cents for every dollar it owed.
in bankruptcy court,silver sage moved to dismiss the bankruptcy because it claimed that the city filed the bankruptcy in bad faith.the bankruptcy court denied the motion on february.silver sage filed a notice of appeal and made a motion in the bap for leave to appeal.the bap refused to hear the appeal,construing it to be from an interlocutory order.silver sage appealed to this court.silver sage does not ask us to rule on the merits of its claim that the city filed for bankruptcy in bad faith.rather,it asks that we remand the case to the bap and order the bap to consider the appeal on the merits.the city contends that this court is without jurisdiction.
standards of review 
we review our own jurisdiction de novo.miller commissioner,cir.whether a bankruptcy court decision is final,under d is a question of law reviewed de novo.alexander compton in re bonham,cir.
the city argues that silver sage waived the argument that the bankruptcy court denial of the motion to dismiss was a final decision.we reject the city argument.if a party fails to argue to the court below that a decision of the bankruptcy court is final,we will not consider such an argument.ryther lumber products in re ryther,cir.in ryther,we noted that if a litigant is unsure about the nature of an order,the litigant should file both a notice to appeal and a motion for leave to appeal before the bap or district court.id.silver sage did just that.moreover,in silver sage motion for leave to appeal before the bap,silver sage argued in part that the bap was obliged to hear the appeal because it was from a final decision of the bankruptcy court.silver sage therefore properly raised the issue before the bap and we consider it.
jurisdiction 
the courts of appeals do not have jurisdiction to hear interlocutory appeals in bankruptcy cases.whether we have jurisdiction therefore depends upon the nature of the bankruptcy court order denying silver sage motion to dismiss.parties may appeal decisions of a bankruptcy court to either the district court or to the bap.the district court or bap must hear appeals from final decisions of the bankruptcy courts.so must we.it is within the discretion of the district court and the bap,however,to hear interlocutory appeals.id.at a.we have no jurisdiction to consider whether such exercises of discretion are proper.the courts of appeals only have jurisdiction to review the final decisions,judgments,orders and decrees entered by the bap or district courts.id.at d silver sage argues that the bap erred by construing its appeal as interlocutory and should have construed it to be an appeal from a final decision.the city,on the other hand,argues that the bap correctly construed the nature of silver sage appeal and it therefore had discretion not to hear the appeal.the city furthermore argues that we are without jurisdiction because the bap exercise of discretion in this regard is not subject to our review.we agree with the bap had discretion to not hear silver sage appeal and this exercise
