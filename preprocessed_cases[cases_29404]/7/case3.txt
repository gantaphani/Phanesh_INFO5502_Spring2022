chrysalis manufacturing incurred a debt to petitioner husky international electronics,of nearly.respondent daniel lee ritz,chrysalis director and part owner at the time,drained chrysalis of assets available to pay the debt by transferring large sums of money to other entities ritz controlled.husky sued ritz to recover on the debt.ritz then filed for chapter bankruptcy,prompting husky to file a complaint in ritz bankruptcy case,seeking to hold him personally liable and contending that the debt was not dischargeable because ritz scheme constituted actual fraud under the bankruptcy code discharge exceptions.a a.
the district court held that ritz was personally liable under state law but also held that the debt was not obtained by actual fraud under a a and thus could be discharged in bankruptcy.the fifth circuit affirmed,holding that a misrepresentation from a debtor to a creditor is a necessary element of actual fraud and was lacking in this case,because ritz made no false representations to husky regarding the transfer of chrysalis assets.
held the term actual fraud in a a encompasses fraudulent conveyance schemes,even when those schemes do not involve a false representation.
a it is sensible to presume that when congress amended the bankruptcy code in and added to debts obtained by false pretenses or false representations an additional bankruptcy discharge exception for debts obtained by actual fraud,it did not intend the term actual fraud to mean the same thing as the term false representations.see united states quality stores.even stronger evidence that actual fraud encompasses the kind of conduct alleged to have occurred here is found in the phrase historical meaning.at common law,actual fraud meant fraud committed with wrongful intent,neal clark.and the term fraud has,since the beginnings of bankruptcy practice,been used to describe asset transfers that,like ritz scheme,impair a creditor ability to collect a debt.
one of the first bankruptcy acts,the fraudulent conveyances act of,ch,identified as fraud conveyances made with i ntent to delay hynder or defraude c reditors.the degree to which that statute remains embedded in laws today,see,bfp resolution trust corporation,clarifies that the term actual fraud is broad enough to incorporate fraudulent conveyances.the common law also indicates that fraudulent conveyances do not require a misrepresentation from a debtor to a creditor,see,at,as they lie not in dishonestly inducing a creditor to extend a debt but in the acts of concealment and hindrance.
b interpreting actual fraud in a a to encompass fraudulent conveyances would not,as ritz contends,render duplicative two of other discharge exceptions,a,given that actual fraud captures much conduct not covered by those other provisions.nor does this interpretation create a redundancy in a,which is meaningfully different from a a.it is also not incompatible with a a obtained by requirement.even though the transferor of a fraudulent conveyance does not obtain assets or debts through the fraudulent conveyance,the transferee who,with the requisite intent,also commits fraud does.at minimum,those debts would not be dischargeable under a a.finally,reading the phrase actual fraud to restrict,rather than expand,the discharge exception reach would untenably require reading the disjunctive or in the phrase false pretenses,a false representation,or actual fraud to mean by.

husky international electronics,petitioner daniel lee ritz.
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit 
justice sotomayor delivered the opinion of the court.
the bankruptcy code prohibits debtors from discharging debts obtained by false pretenses,a false representation,or actual fraud.a a.the fifth circuit held that a debt is obtained by actual fraud only if the debtor fraud involves a false representation to a creditor.that ruling deepened an existing split among the circuits over whether actual fraud requires a false representation or whether it encompasses other traditional forms of fraud that can be accomplished without a false representation,such as a fraudulent conveyance of property made to evade payment to creditors.we granted certiorari to resolve that split and now reverse.
husky international electronics,is a supplier of components used in electronic devices.between and,husky sold its products to chrysalis manufacturing,and chrysalis incurred a debt to husky of.during the same period,respondent daniel lee ritz,served as a director of chrysalis and owned at least of chrysalis common stock.
all parties agree that between and,ritz drained chrysalis of assets it could have used to pay its debts to creditors like husky by transferring large sums of chrysalis funds to other entities ritz controlled.for instance and ritz actions were by no means limited to these examples ritz transferred to capnet risk management,a company he owned in full to capnet securities,a company in which he owned an interest and to dynalyst manufacturing,a company in which he owned a interest.
in may,husky filed a lawsuit against ritz to hold him personally responsible for chrysalis debt.husky argued that ritz scheme was actual fraud for purposes of a texas law that allows creditors to hold shareholders responsible for corporate debt.see.bus.orgs.code ann.b west.in december,ritz filed for chapter bankruptcy in the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of texas.husky then initiated an adversarial proceeding in ritz bankruptcy case again seeking to hold ritz personally liable for chrysalis debt.husky also contended that ritz could not discharge that debt in bankruptcy because the same scheme constituted actual fraud under a a exemption to discharge 
the district court held that ritz was personally liable for the debt under texas law,but that the debt was not obtained by actual fraud under a a and could be discharged in his bankruptcy.
the fifth circuit affirmed.it did not address whether ritz was responsible for chrysalis debt under texas law because it agreed with the district court that ritz did not commit actual fraud under a a.before the fifth circuit,husky argued that ritz scheme was effectuated through a series of fraudulent conveyances or transfers intended to obstruct the collection of debt.and,husky said,such transfers are a recognizable form of actual fraud.the fifth circuit,holding that a necessary element of actual fraud is a misrepresentation from the debtor to the creditor,as when a person applying for credit adds an extra zero to her income or falsifies her employment history.in re ritz.in transferring chrysalis assets,ritz may have hindered husky ability to recover its debt,but the fifth circuit found that he did not make any false representations to husky regarding those assets or the transfers and therefore did not commit actual fraud.
we reverse.the term actual fraud in a a encompasses forms of fraud,like fraudulent conveyance schemes,that can be effected without a false representation.
before,the bankruptcy code prohibited debtors from discharging debts obtained by false pretenses or false representations.a ed.in the bankruptcy reform act of,congress added actual fraud to that list.stat.the prohibition now reads a discharge under chapters,or of this title does not discharge an individual debtor from any debt for money,property,services,or an extension,renewal,or refinancing of credit,to the extent obtained by false pretenses,a false representation,or actual fraud.a a ed.
when congress acts to amend a statute,we presume it intends its amendment to have real and substantial effect.united states quality stores,slip,at.it is therefore sensible to start with the presumption that congress did not intend actual fraud to mean the same thing as a false representation,as the fifth circuit holding suggests.but the historical meaning of actual fraud provides even stronger evidence that the phrase has long encompassed the kind of conduct alleged to have occurred here a transfer scheme designed to hinder the collection of debt.
this court has historically construed the terms in a a to contain the elements that the common law has defined them to include.field mans.actual fraud has two parts actual and fraud.the word actual has a simple meaning in the context of fraud it denotes any fraud that involv es moral turpitude or intentional wrong.neal clark.actual fraud stands in contrast to implied fraud or fraud in law,which describe acts of deception that may exist without the imputation of bad faith or immorality.ibid.thus,anything that counts as fraud and is done with wrongful intent is actual fraud.
although fraud connotes deception or trickery,the term is difficult to define more precisely.see story,commentaries on equity jurisprudence,ed.story fraud being so various in its nature,and so extensive in its application to human concerns,it would be difficult to enumerate all the instances in which courts of equity will grant relief under this head there is no need to adopt a definition for all times and all circumstances here because,from the beginning of english bankruptcy practice,courts and legislatures have used the term fraud to describe a debtor transfer of assets that,like ritz scheme,impairs a creditor ability to collect the debt.
one of the first bankruptcy acts,the statute of elizabeth,has long been relied upon as a restatement of the law of fraudulent conveyances also known as fraudulent transfers or fraudulent alienations see generally glenn,the law of fraudulent conveyances.that statute,also called the fraudulent conveyances act of,identified as fraud faigned covenous and fraudulent feoffmentes gyftes grauntes alienations and conveyaunces made with intent to delaye hynder or defraude creditors.eliz.ch.in modern terms,parliament made it fraudulent to hide assets from creditors by giving them to one family,friends,or associates.the principles of the statute of elizabeth and even some of its language continue to be in wide use today.see bfp resolution trust corporation,the modern law of fraudulent transfers had its origin in the statute of elizabeth at every american bankruptcy law has incorporated a fraudulent transfer provision story,at t he statute of elizabeth has been universally adopted in america,as the basis of our jurisprudence on the same subject boston trading group,burnazos,breyer,laws ch,is a uniform state law that codifies both common and statutory law stretching back at least to and the statute of elizabeth the degree to which this statute remains embedded in laws related to fraud today clarifies that the term actual fraud is broad enough to incorporate a fraudulent conveyance.
equally important,the common law also indicates that fraudulent conveyances,although a fraud,do not require a misrepresentation from a debtor to a creditor.as a basic point,fraudulent conveyances are not an fraud.fraudulent conveyances typically involve a transfer to a close relative,a secret transfer,a transfer of title without transfer of possession,or grossly inadequate consideration.bfp,at citing twyne case,eng.bump,fraudulent conveyances a treatise upon conveyances made by debtors to defraud creditors ed.in such cases,the fraudulent conduct is not in dishonestly inducing a creditor to extend a debt.it is in the acts of concealment and hindrance.in the context,therefore,the opportunities for a false representation from the debtor to the creditor are limited.the debtor may have the opportunity to put forward a false representation if the creditor inquires into the whereabouts of the debtor assets,but that could hardly be considered a defining feature of this kind of fraud.
relatedly,under the statute of elizabeth and the laws that followed,both the debtor and the recipient of the conveyed assets were liable for fraud even though the recipient of a fraudulent conveyance of course made no representation,true or false,to the debtor creditor.the famous twyne case,which this court relied upon in bfp,illustrates this point.see twyne case,eng,at convicting twyne of fraud under the statute of elizabeth,even though he was the recipient of a debtor conveyance.that principle underlies the understanding that a conveyance which hinders,delays or defrauds creditors shall be void as against the recipient unless th at party received it in good faith and for consideration.glenn,law of fraudulent conveyances,at.that principle also underscores the point that a false representation has never been a required element of actual fraud,and we decline to adopt it as one today.
ritz concedes that fraudulent conveyances are a form of actual fraud,but contends that a a particular use of the phrase means something else.ritz strained reading of the provision finds little support.
first,ritz contends that interpreting actual fraud in a a to encompass fraudulent conveyances would render duplicative two other exceptions to discharge in.section a exempts from discharge any debt for fraud or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity,embezzlement,or larceny.and a exempts any debt for willful and malicious injury by the debtor to another entity or to the property of another entity.
ritz makes the unremarkable point that the traditional definition of actual fraud will cover some of the same conduct as those exceptions for example,a trustee who fraudulently conveys away his trust assets.but ritz interpretation does not avoid duplication,nor does our interpretation fail to preserve a meaningful difference between a a and a.just as a fiduciary who engages in a fraudulent conveyance may find his debt exempted from discharge under either a a or a,so too would a fiduciary who engages in one of the fraudulent misrepresentations that form the core of ritz preferred interpretation of a a.the same is true for a.the debtors who commit fraudulent conveyances and the debtors who make false representations under a a could likewise also inflict willful and malicious injury under a.there is,in short,overlap,but that overlap appears inevitable.
and,of course,our interpretation of actual fraud in a a also preserves meaningful distinctions between that provision and a,a.section a,for instance,covers only debts for fraud while acting as a fiduciary,whereas a a has no similar limitation.nothing in our interpretation alters that distinction.and a covers debts for willful and malicious injury,whether or not that injury is the result of fraud,see kawaauhau geiger,discussing injuries resulting from intentional torts whereas a a covers only fraudulent acts.nothing in our interpretation alters that distinction either.thus,given the clear differences between these provisions,we see no reason to craft an artificial definition of actual fraud merely to avoid narrow redundancies in that appear unavoidable.
ritz also says that our interpretation creates with a separate section of the bankruptcy code,a,which prevents a debtor from discharging all of his debts if,within the year preceding the bankruptcy petition,he transferred,removed,destroyed,mutilated,or concealed property with intent to hinder,delay,or defraud a creditor or an officer of the estate charged with custody of property.although the two provisions could cover some of the same conduct,they are meaningfully different.section a is broader than a a in scope preventing an offending debtor from discharging all debt in bankruptcy.but it is narrower than a a in timing applying only if the debtor fraudulently conveys assets in the year preceding the filing.in short,while a is a blunt remedy for actions that hinder the entire bankruptcy process,a a is a tailored remedy for behavior connected to specific debts.
ritz next point of resistance rests on a a requirement that the relevant debt be for money,services,or credit obtained by actual fraud.emphasis ad
