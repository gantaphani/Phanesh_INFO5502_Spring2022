at the end of,when united air lines declared bankruptcy,its employees both active and retired owned more than half the airline common stock through an esop employee stock ownership plan.in re ual,cir.esops are subject to erisa,the federal pension law,a,b,d armstrong lasalle bank national ass n,cir,and this is a suit under erisa.the plaintiffs represent a class consisting of united employees.the principal defendant is state street bank trust,a cofiduciary of the ual corporation esop committee.the has six members,all appointed by the unions that represent united the only fiduciary named in the plan.a.the plan directs the committee to establish an investment policy and objective for the plan,except that it is understood that the plan is designed to invest exclusively in company stock.the committee accordingly established a policy and goal of owning united stock,and appointed state street to be the plan trustee,that is,to manage the esop assets,initially consisting of that stock.a.the class charges state street with imprudent with failing to sell united stock as its market price plummeted en route to the airline is appealing from the grant of summary judgment to state street,which has in turn on an unrelated issue that we discuss at the end of this opinion.
state street is what is called a directed trustee,because the committee the fiduciary named in the plan,in accordance with the plan language that we have quoted,directed state street to invest the esop assets exclusively in stock of united air lines.directed trustees are permitted by erisa if an erisa plan provides that the trustee or trustees are subject to the direction of a named fiduciary in this case it is the ual corporation esop committee who is not a trustee,the trustees shall be subject to proper directions of such fiduciary which are made in accordance with the terms of the plan and which are not contrary to erisa.a see maniace commerce bank,cir may stores federal ins,cir lalonde textron,cir.like other erisa trustees,a directed trustee has a statutory duty of prudence.a b.but as an esop fiduciary,he does not have the further really,the included duty to diversify the trust assets,a c we call it included in the duty of prudence because diversification is normally an essential element of prudent investing by a fiduciary.armstrong lasalle bank national ass n,supra,at.a directed trustee appointed under an erisa plan does not have that duty because the very purpose of an esop is to invest in a single stock,that of the employer of the esop participants.
we must first decide whether a directed trustee of an esop has any fiduciary duty with respect to the choice of trust assets,specifically any duty ever to replace the employer normal holding of an some other security.the maniace case that we cited,along with herman nationsbank trust,cir,says no,but firstier bank,zeller,cir,says yes,as does in re worldcom.erisa litigation,d.the split reflects a confusing statutory picture.one provision of erisa states that the directed trustee can not be liable for obeying the directions of the fiduciary named in the plan,b b,but other provisions impose liability on a fiduciary for breaches of fiduciary duty by a cofiduciary if he knows of the breach and takes no reasonable efforts to prevent it,or if by his own failure to exercise prudence he enables the breach.a.and recall that the directed trustee shall be subject to proper directions of the named fiduciary which are made in accordance with the terms of the plan and which are not contrary to erisa.a emphasis added.an imprudent direction can not be a proper direction since the trustee has an express statutory duty of prudence.
the tension among these provisions is reflected in a pamphlet published by the labor department employee benefits security administration,which affirms both that the directed trustee has a duty of prudence and that he has no direct obligation to determine the prudence of a transaction entrusted by the plan to another fiduciary.fiduciary responsibilities of directed trustees field assistance bulletin.d irect is the critical word,inviting us to resolve the tension by ruling that the trustee can disobey the named fiduciary directions when it is plain that they are imprudent.the labor department pamphlet,as we see,is actually consistent with this approach.the trustee physically controls the trust assets knowingly to invest them imprudently or let them remain invested imprudently is irresponsible behavior for a trustee,whose fundamental duty is to take as much care with the trust assets as he would take with his own property.he is an agent who is required to treat his principal with utmost loyalty and him,indeed,as if the principal were himself.pohl national benefits consultants,cir.and although the creator of an ordinary trust may be able to include a provision in the trust instrument excusing the trustee from complying with the rule,john langbein,the contractarian basis of the law of trusts,yale,erisa as we have seen expressly imposes the duty of prudence on directed trustees and forbids them to comply with directions of the fiduciary named in the plan that are not proper.that is why kuper iovenko,cir,holds that an erisa plan may not be interpreted to include a per se prohibition against diversifying an esop.
which brings us to the particulars of this case.the plaintiffs argue that state street violated its fiduciary duty by failing to sell united stock held by the esop until the eve of united bankruptcy.state street knew long before then,if the plaintiffs are to be believed,that the ual corporation esop committee,the named fiduciary,had unreasonably refused to deviate from the plan and diversify the esop holdings or take other measures to reduce the looming risk to the.the following chart traces the ups and downs mostly downs of united stock price between january,and december,when united declared bankruptcy 
the price of united stock,which on september,was already percent below the price at the beginning of the year,dropped almost percent more in the immediate aftermath of the september,terrorist attacks.the following month,united ceo sent a gloomy letter to all its employees which said that the company was in a struggle just to survive and was not yet in a financial position that will allow us to continue operating,that it was hemorrhaging money,and unless the bleeding was stopped united will perish sometime next year.the price of united stock fell another percent in the two days after the publication of the letter.
the price continued falling,though with occasional upticks,and the financial press began speculating on the possibility of bankruptcy.state street observed the decline with anxiety,but not until august,which time the price had fallen to it notify the ual corporation esop committee that it might be imprudent for the esop to continue holding united stock.in response to this warning the committee authorized state street to sell the stock,and it began doing so on september.by that time,however,the price had fallen to.the plaintiffs argue that state street should have started selling within days after the october letter of united and that had it done so the esop would have avoided million in losses.
the plaintiffs say the letter should have alerted state street that united was going into the tank.that is wrong.after the market read the letter,it valued united stock at a share.had the market thought that united would be bankrupt by the end of,it would not have priced its stock that high in october,implying a market capitalization for the company of more than million.a trustee is not imprudent to assume that a major stock market united was traded on the new york stock exchange provides the best estimate of the value of the stocks traded on it that is available to him.in re ual,supra,at see basic levinson,d in re hovis,cir feder electronic data systems,cir burton malkiel,reflections on the efficient market hypothesis years later,financial.at any price at which a sale takes place,the buyer thinks he getting a bargain,or at least a reasonable he would buy.some investors,it is true,consistently beat the market,but few of them are trustees it would be hubris for a trust company like state street to think it could predict united future more accurately than the market could,and preposterous for a committee of union officials the named fiduciary to challenge the market valuation.nor was state street to offer the committee members a tutorial on the obligations of an erisa trustee the committee had its own lawyers for that.
thus,at every point in the long slide of united stock price,that price was the best estimate available either to state street or to the committee of the company value,in re ual,supra,at,and so neither fiduciary was required to act on the assumption that the market was overvaluing united.see wright oregon metallurgical,cir kuper iovenko,supra,at in re worldcom.erisa litigation,supra,d at.what is true,however,though largely and fatally ignored by the plaintiffs and mistakenly denied by state street lawyers in this court state street itself we assume knows better,is that the fall in the market price of united was increasing the risk borne by the owners of the stock,the participants in the esop.there is always risk,in the sense of variance of returns,to owning common stock,because the fortunes of a company are uncertain and the stockholders,unlike bondholders and other owners of the company debt,do not have a fixed entitlement they are the residual risk bearers.some companies,however,are riskier than others.of particular relevance to this case,the higher the ratio of debt to equity is,the riskier is the position of the equity holders the common stockholders.if a company has no debt,a percent increase in the company value will increase shareholder equity by percent,and a percent decrease in the company value will decrease shareholder equity by percent.but if the company has a ratio,a percent increase in the company value will increase shareholder equity by percent and a percent decrease in the company value will decrease shareholder equity by percent.as the value of united,as reckoned by the stock market,plummeted,the airline ratio soared because its debt was decreasing,and this created an acute threat of bankruptcy.
such a threat would be of little moment to people who held united stock as part of a diversified portfolio,because the risks of the various components of such a portfolio tend to cancel out that is the meaning and objective of diversification.the modern theory of corporate finance clifford smith,ed.probably,however,shares of united stock were the principal financial assets of most of united least those who,unlike pilots,have modest hence their principal source of retirement income.and probably most of those were risk averse that is,they would prefer certain to a percent chance of obtaining million,even though these are actuarial equivalents.they would be especially risk averse with regard to provision for their retirement,where they would be more dependent on their financial assets since they would no longer have earned income.being risk averse,they would have preferred that the bulk of their financial assets not be invested in a single stock that,while worth as much as its market valuation as far as anyone not possessing inside information could know,was extremely risky.because the value of any single stock or bond is tied to the fortunes of one company,holding a single kind of stock or bond is very risky.by contrast,people who hold a diverse portfolio of stocks and bonds face less risk because they have only a small stake in each company.gregory mankiw,principles of economics.that is why erisa fiduciaries have a duty of diversification as part of their overall duty of as in this case they are directed pursuant to an esop to invest everything in stock of the participants employer.
the total wealth included not only their stake in the esop but for those not yet retired or approaching retirement this was probably more expected earnings and fringe benefits as employees of united.the financial distress that pushed united stock price down also jeopardized that expected wealth insofar as united employees could not expect to land equally good jobs at other companies and so depressed the overall wealth by more than the fall in the price of the stock.brett mcdonnell,esop failures fiduciary duties when managers of companies vote to entrench themselves,colum.bus.state street lawyers thus miss the point in arguing that american airlines was on the verge of bankruptcy too but managed to avoid it and so might united have done so.someone who owned american airlines stock,and would have wanted but was unable to diversify,would have been bearing unwanted risk during american period of peril.
but because an esop is at once a permissible form of erisa trust and nondiversified by definition,the trustee along with the named fiduciary is in an awkward position.if he diversifies he violates the plan,but if he does diversify he may be imposing unwanted risk on the it is unrealistic to suppose that the esop form was chosen because the employees wanted to bear unnecessary risk.the goal of an esop is to give employees not the thrills of gambling but a larger stake in the company fortunes,see,united states mccord,cir,in hopes of broadening ownership of capital within a capitalist system to the end of encouraging capital formation through an improved form of finance,improved relations,and increased productivity.mcdonnell,supra,at.why congress thought it appropriate to stimulate the adoption of this business form by giving companies tax breaks rather than allowing the free market to determine the merits of the form is a separate question but not one we need answer in order to decide this case,although it is pertinent to note that one of the goals not sought to be achieved by the esop form is the funding of pension benefits.michael conte jan svejnar,the performance effects of employee ownership plans,in paying for productivity,alan blinder ed.it is a goal that the form is ill suited to attain because of its underdiversification.
the tension between the goal of protection against risk and the goal of a portfolio dominated by a single stock is not acute if the participants in the esop have adequate sources of income or wealth that are not correlated with the risk of that stock,so that the esop is not their primary financial asset.but if they do have substantial other wealth the goals can not be reconciled,though they can be compromised by requiring fiduciaries to begin diversifying the esop assets at the point at which an increase in the riskiness of the assets,had it been foreseen,would have induced the creators of the esop either to have not created it at all or to have required at least partial diversification.we say begin diversifying because if the stock held by the esop is a very large fraction of the outstanding stock of the employer,as in this case,the would have to be gradual in order to avoid precipitating a sharp drop in price,louis chan josef lakonishok,the behavior of stock prices around institutional trades,finance,the market does not treat the stocks of different companies as being perfectly substitutable.thus,state street had a policy of limiting any day sales of a given stock to percent of the volume of sales that day.or,as kuper iovenko,supra,at,puts it,the plaintiff must show that the erisa fiduciary could not have reasonably believed that the plan drafters would have intended under the circumstances that he continue to comply with the esop direction that he invest exclusively in employer securities.see also moench robertson,cir.
in steinman hicks,cir,we noted a situation in which the duty of prudence could require diversification of an esop holdings if the esop was the employees principal retirement asset and was entirely invested in the stock of their employer,and their employer was bought in a that all the assets of the esop became stock in the acquirer by a company that had a much higher ratio than their former employer and as a result its stock price was much more volatile and its bankruptcy risk greater.then,even if the trustees did not predict the company impending collapse,they might be required in the interest of the participants either to di
