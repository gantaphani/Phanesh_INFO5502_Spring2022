background 
the debtor,a billing services technology company,is a limited liability business and its sole member is joli.joanne heverly owns percent of joli,and richard brammer,a former officer of the debtor,owns the remaining percent.appellant,a printing company,holds the single largest claim against the debtor and the debtor ceo,bruce heverly,husband of joanne heverly,for,which stems from a judgment entered in the district court for the eastern district of wisconsin the court of appeals for the seventh circuit has since affirmed that judgment.see,commc ns,llc,app x,cir.
the debtor filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the united state bankruptcy code,et the bankruptcy code,in the bankruptcy court for the district of new jersey the bankruptcy court.thereafter,the office of the united states trustee formed an official unsecured creditors committee the committee consisting of appellant,ricoh production print solutions,llc,and enterprise group.
between september and january,the debtor filed the first second,and third amended plans of reorganization.after the bankruptcy court denied confirmation of the first amended plan of reorganization,bela szigethy szigethy agreed to make an investment in the debtor the debtor filed a fourth amended plan of reorganization the plan on january,under which a,holdings,llc plan sponsor would acquire a membership interest in the debtor.the plan incorporated a plan support agreement which provided the plan sponsor with the exclusive right to purchase of the debtor equity for.neither the plan sponsor nor any was to contribute any additional capital to fund the plan.the plan also incorporated the terms of the committee agreement with respect to distributions and the waiver of preference actions against unsecured creditors.
on march,after holding a confirmation hearing,and over the objection of appellant,bankruptcy judge winfield entered an order the confirmation order confirming the plan the confirmation order was automatically stayed for fourteen days pursuant to federal rule of bankruptcy procedure e.appellant moved for a stay pending appeal,which was denied.the bankruptcy court also denied a request by the debtor to shorten the automatic stay the parties briefed the merits of the appeal,but the district court never reached those issues,as it granted the debtor motion to dismiss the appeal as equitably moot on june.

iii.analysis 
appellant challenge to the equitable mootness doctrine 
as an initial matter,appellant asserts that the equitable mootness doctrine is unconstitutional and contrary to the bankruptcy code.because we have already approved the doctrine of equitable mootness in continental only the court sitting en banc would have the authority to reevaluate our prior holding.see united states white,cir this court may only decline to follow a prior decision of our court without the necessity of an en banc decision when the prior decision conflicts with a supreme court decision.see chester ex rel.grane healthcare,cir see also morrow balaski,cir en banc smith,concurring e ven in constitutional cases,the doctrine of stare decisis carries such persuasive force that departing from it has always required some special justification.quoting arizona rumsey,d.
appellant argues that our equitable mootness jurisprudence should be reevaluated in light of the supreme court decision in stern marshall,d.appellant contends that after stern,a bankruptcy court ability to enter binding,final judgments in core bankruptcy proceedings like plan confirmations must be subject to district court review on appeal under traditional appellate standards.stern alone does not permit us to depart from continental.
in stern,the supreme court granted certiorari to resolve the question of whether b c is unconstitutional because it gives iii judges the power to render final judgments on common law compulsory counterclaims that are not necessarily resolved in the process of allowing or disallowing the defendant proof of claim.the court in stern found that the provision unconstitutionally delegated the judicial power of the united states to iii bankruptcy judges.justice roberts opinion relied heavily on murray lessee hoboken land improvement,how,which stated that with the exception of certain public rights,congress can not withdraw from judicial cognizance any matter which,from its nature,is the subject of a suit at common law,or in equity,or admiralty.because the counterclaim at issue in stern was a tort claim at common law,the court held that t he bankruptcy court below lacked the constitutional authority to enter a final judgment on this state law counterclaim.stern.at.
thus,the court in stern made clear that iii bankruptcy judges do not have the constitutional authority to adjudicate a claim that is exclusively based upon a legal right grounded in state law despite appellate review of the bankruptcy judge decision by an article iii judge.however,stern did not consider the authority of bankruptcy judges to make final determinations regarding other kinds of claims and counterclaims brought by debtors and creditors,nor did stern consider whether article iii requires appellate review of a bankruptcy judge decisions by an article iii judge.accordingly,we are obligated to apply this court equitable mootness doctrine notwithstanding stern.
equitable mootness analysis 
following confirmation of a reorganization plan by a bankruptcy court,an aggrieved party has the statutory right to appeal the court ruling.once a bankruptcy appeal has been filed,federal courts have a virtually unflagging obligation to exercise the jurisdiction conferred on them.in re semcrude,cir quoting.river water conservation dist.united states,d.before there is a basis to avoid deciding the merits of an appeal,we must first determine that granting the requested relief is almost certain to produce a perverse outcome significant injury to third parties chaos in the bankruptcy court from a plan in tatters.in re phila.newspapers,llc,cir.only in such circumstances is equitable mootness a valid consideration.
a court decides to dismiss an appeal as equitably moot through the consideration of the following prudential factors 
whether the reorganization plan has been substantially consummated,whether a stay has been obtained,whether the relief requested would affect the rights of parties not before the court,whether the relief requested would affect the success of the plan,and the public policy of affording finality to bankruptcy judgments.
id.citing continental,at.depending on the circumstances,each factor is given varying weight.id.citing in re pws holding,cir.
these factors are interconnected and overlapping.semcrude,at citing phila.newspapers,at.the second factor principally duplicates the first in the sense that a plan can not be substantially consummated if the appellant has successfully sought a stay.phila.newspapers,at internal quotation marks omitted.in analyzing the first factor,courts have considered whether allowing an appeal to go forward will undermine the plan,and not merely whether the plan has been substantially consummated under the bankruptcy code definition.id.at.this collapses the first and fourth factors.the third factor adds an additional consideration whether granting relief will undermine the reliance of third parties,in particular investors,on the finality of the transaction.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.finally,the fifth factor supports the other four by encouraging investors and others to rely on confirmation orders,thereby facilitating successful reorganizations by fostering confidence in the finality of confirmed plans.id.
taken together,these factors require that the equitable mootness doctrine be applied only to prevent a court from unscrambling complex bankruptcy reorganizations when the appealing party should have acted before the plan became extremely difficult to retract.nordhoff,zenith elecs,cir.the party seeking dismissal bears the burden to demonstrate that,weighing the relevant factors,dismissal is warranted.semcrude,at.
in practice,equitable mootness proceeds in two analytical steps whether a confirmed plan has been substantially consummated and if so,whether granting the relief requested in the appeal will a fatally scramble the plan b significantly harm third parties who have justifiably relied on the plan confirmation.id.satisfaction of the statutory standard indicates that implementation of the plan has progressed to the point that turning back may be imprudent.id.
if the confirmed plan has been substantially consummated,a court should next determine whether granting relief will require undoing the plan as opposed to modifying it in a manner that does not cause its collapse.see in re zenith elecs,cir appeal not equitably moot where disgorgement of professional fees would not unravel plan united artists theatre walton,cir appeal not equitably moot where striking indemnification provision would leave the plan otherwise intact pws,at appeal not equitably moot where plan could go forward even if certain releases were stricken.a court should also consider the extent a successful appeal,by altering the plan or otherwise,will harm third parties who have acted reasonably in reliance on the finality of plan confirmation.semcrude,at.
application of the equitable mootness doctrine 
since this court adoption of the equitable mootness doctrine in continental,we have emphasized that the doctrine must be construed narrowly and applied in limited circumstances.in philadelphia newspapers,this court emphasized that a court only should apply the equitable mootness doctrine in complex bankruptcy reorganizations when the appealing party should have acted before the plan became extremely difficult to retract.at quoting nordhoff,at.the doctrine is quite rightly limited in scope and cautiously applied.id.quoting continental,at.further,the doctrine origin,coupled with the responsibility of federal courts to exercise their jurisdictional mandate,obliges us to proceed most carefully before dismissing an appeal as equitably moot.semcrude,at.
our prior dismissals pursuant to the equitable mootness doctrine are inapposite here.those prior applications of the doctrine involved complex bankruptcy reorganizations that included multiple related debtors,hundreds of millions of dollars in assets,liabilities and claims,and hundreds or thousands of creditors.for example,continental involved the merger of debtors with continental,a million investment in the reorganized debtor,the transfer by foreign governments of route authorities,and the assumption of leases and executory contracts worth over five billion dollars.at.similarly,in nordhoff,the reorganization plan required eighteen months of preparation between several parties,the exchange of over million in bonds,the issuance of new stock,the extension of a sixty million dollar credit facility,and the exchange and cancellation of over million of debt.at.
in contrast here,the debtor reorganization involved a investment in the reorganized debtor and only one secured creditor that held a blanket lien on the debtor assets for less than.further,the debtor had only seventeen unsecured creditors,not including insiders.in addition,the plan did not provide for new financing,mergers or dissolutions of entities,issuance of stock or bonds,name change,change of business location,change in management or any other significant transactions.the record illustrates that this case did not involve a sufficiently complex bankruptcy reorganization such that dismissal on the basis of equitable mootness would be appropriate.
consideration of the prudential factors also demonstrates that the district court abused its discretion.the district court found that the plan was substantially consummated.the debtor transferred all property required to be transferred on or shortly after the effective date of the plan,and the reorganized debtor commenced distributions under the plan.see c requiring only the commencement of distribution under the plan.the district court observed that appellant failed to obtain a stay.we do not dispute those determinations.however,the district court also found that granting relief to appellant would lead to a perverse outcome by causing the plan to be fully unraveled,resulting in significant harm to third parties.we disagree.in our judgment,the proper application of the prudential factors does not permit dismissal on equitable mootness grounds.
as noted,the first and fourth prudential factors require that a court consider whether allowing an appeal to go forward will undermine the plan.semcrude,at.in finding that these factors weigh in favor of equitable mootness,the district court found that appellant offered no options which would allow the court to grant it relief without unscrambling the plan entirely.in re one one commc ns,llc,wl,at july.in reaching this conclusion,the district court erred in two fundamental respects it placed the burden on appellant to demonstrate that this factor weighed in its favor,and it concluded that because granting appellant requested relief would reverse the plan,this factor necessarily favored the debtor.
to the contrary,it was the debtor burden,as the party seeking dismissal,to demonstrate that the prudential factors weighed in its favor.see semcrude,at.further,courts are obligated to consider not only whether granting the requested relief would require reversal of the plan,but also whether the plan could be retracted without great difficulty and inequity.see nordhoff,at.we have noted in prior cases that reversal of a confirmation order is more likely to lead to an inequitable result where the reorganization involves intricate transactions or where outside investors have relied on the confirmation of the plan.continental,at citations omitted see also nordhoff,at finding that plan that involved hundreds of millions of dollars,the issuance of unretractable bonds,and restructuring the debt,assets,and management of a major corporation could not be reversed without great difficulty and inequity.we have most frequently found that a plan could not be retracted when the reorganized debtor issued publically traded debt or securities.see,nordhoff,at.
here,the plan did not involve intricate transactions and the debtor did not present sufficient evidence that the plan would be difficult to unravel.instead,the debtor identified various transactions entered into in the ordinary course of the reorganized debtor business.these routine transactions,including the investment by the plan sponsor,the commencement of distributions,the hiring of new employees and entering into various agreements with existing and new customers are likely to transpire in almost every bankruptcy reorganization where the appealing party is unsuccessful in obtaining or fails to seek a stay.further,the plan did not involve the issuance of any publicly traded securities,bonds,or other circumstances that would make it difficult to retract the plan.accordingly,the district court abused its discretion in finding that the first and fourth factors favored the debtor.
furthermore,under the third factor,the reliance by third parties,in particular investors,on the finality of the plan confirmation is minimal.continental,at.the district court articulated no specific harm that would inure to the detriment of third parties and instead stated that,argues that the relief appellant seeks would unravel the plan in its entirety and call into question the continued viability of to the detriment of third parties.one one commc ns,wl,at however,as the district court noted,t his is not a case where a debtor issued publicly traded securities or debt pursuant to a plan that third parties to the bankruptcy case could have purchased on the open market.id.at alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.nevertheless,the debtor now argues that allowing appellant appeal to be heard on the merits would inevitably affect the rights of parties not before the court such as creditors,employees,and workers.
this type of minimal reliance is present in nearly all bankruptcy reorganizations and can not be characterized as almost certain to cause significant injury to third parties.continental,at emphasizing that the record was replete with evidence that investing parties not before the court relied on the confirmation order in making decision to enter into a million investment agreement under a complex arrangement.in light of the limited evidence of potential injury,the district court also abused its discretion in determining that this factor favored the debtor.
finally,the prudential consideration of public policy weighs in favor of providing appellant with appellate review of its bankruptcy appeal.though the finality of the bankruptcy court decision necessarily will be disturbed,this court has recognized an appealing party statutory right to review of the bankruptcy court decision.phila.newspapers,at.further,t he presumptive position remains that federal courts should hear and decide on the merits cases properly before them.semcrude,at.
here,appellant has repeatedly advanced the contention that it is entitled to appellate review.appellant objected to the plan,applied for a stay,filed an appeal of the confirmation order and sought emergency appellate review.in light of the other prudential factors,denying appellant review now would be distinctly inequitable 
iv.conclusion 
absent en banc reconsideration,we can not entertain appellant challenge to equitable mootness,as continental remains the law of this circuit.because the district court abused its discretion under continental,we will reverse the district court dismissal and remand for its consideration of appellant bankruptcy appeal on its merits.
i agree wholeheartedly with the majority equitable mootness analysis,which we are compelled to undertake under our controlling precedent.i write separately,however,because i do not believe we should persist in our failed attempts to cabin this legally ungrounded and practically unadministrable abstention doctrine.in re semcrude,cir.rather,the time has come to reconsider whether it should exist at all,and,if we conclude it should,to reform it substantially.
although we adopted equitable mootness en banc in in re continental airlines,cir en banc,neither the constitutional nor the statutory basis for the doctrine were challenged in that case,and the court was still nearly evenly divided with alito leading the dissent.see id.at alito,dissenting.the doctrine was designed to be limited in scope and cautiously applied,specifically in highly complex cases where limited relief was not feasible and upsetting a reorganization would cause substantial harm to numerous third parties.id.at majority opinion.in the nearly twenty years since we launched that experiment,it has proved highly problematic,with district courts continuing to dismiss appeals in the simplest of bankruptcies.further,as courts and litigants including appellees have struggled to identify a statutory basis for the doctrine,it has become painfully apparent that there is none.moreover,a series of supreme court decisions since our adoption of the doctrine makes clear that,whatever doubts we set aside twenty years ago to embrace the doctrine,it can not survive constitutional scrutiny today.i therefore urge our court to consider eliminating,or at the very least,reforming,equitable mootness.
i begin with our experience with the doctrine.equitable mootness was intended to provide a vehicle whereby the court can prevent substantial harm to numerous parties,namely where the reorganization involves intricate transactions or where outside investors have relied on the confirmation of the plan.cont l airlines,at citations omitted.what continental airlines spawned is a different species altogether.we have repeatedly admonished that the doctrine applies only to attempts to unscrambl e complex bankruptcy reorganizations,nordhoff,zenith elecs,cir emphasis added and even then is limited in scope and should be cautiously applied,id.quoting in re pws holding,cir as well as that it is inapplicable when limited relief is available on appeal,semcrude,at yet district courts have continued to invoke the doctrine in modest,bankruptcies and where appellants have sought limited relief.
we have also rejected invitations to extend equitable mootness outside its intended context,appeals from confirmation orders.see in re diet drugs,cir declining to decide whether equitable mootness applied to class settlement id at ambro,dissenting cautioning that extending the controversial doctrine of equitable mootness,which applies only to attempts to unscrambl e complex bankruptcy reorganizations,to class settlement was inappropriate alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.but our district courts have not been so discriminating.see in re jevic holding,wl,at,applying equitable mootness to dismiss an appeal from an order approving a settlement and structured dismissal.in fact,the doctrine has even been invoked by bankruptcy courts to dismiss motions to revoke reorganization plans.see,in re innovative clinical solutions,in re machne menachem,applying equitable mootness factors but declining to dismiss on equitable mootness grounds.
since continental airlines,we have reversed findings of equitable mootness or declined to dismiss appeals as equitably moot no less than seven times.see in re sch,app x,cir not precedential reversing a finding of equitable mootness semcrude,at same phila.newspapers,at same zenith elecs.corp,at same united artists,at declining to dismiss as equitably moot an appeal from a district court exercising original jurisdiction over a bankruptcy case pws,at same in re cont l airlines continental ii,cir declining to dismiss appeal as equitably moot because the debtor had not preserved the issue,but noting that equitable mootness did not apply.
this case is only the most recent example,but it epitomizes the problem.as the majority explains,what we have is a small,bankruptcy.quad appeal did not implicate intricate transactions that would be difficult to unravel,nor did it pose a significant risk of injuring third parties.further,in the event the plan could not be undone,quad urged the district court to grant the limited relief of striking releases from the plan.the district court nonetheless dismissed quad timely and repeated requests for appellate review on equitable mootness grounds.that yet another thoughtful and diligent district judge has misconstrued our case law as permitting the abdication of jurisdiction in these circumstances reflects a doctrine adrift and in need of reconsideration by our court.
so what is the constitutional or statutory anchor for declining to exercise jurisdiction over bankruptcy appeals dubbed equitably moot simply put,there is none.
the mandate that federal courts hear cases within their statutory jurisdiction is a bedrock principle of our judiciary.as chief justice marshall wrote long ago,w e have no more right to decline the exercise of jurisdiction which is given,than to usurp that which is not given.the one or the other would be treason to the c onstitution.cohens virginia,wheat.dismissing appeals in the name of equitable mootness violates this virtually unflagging obligation of the federal courts to exercise the jurisdiction given them.river water conservation dist.united states,d.then judge alito recognized as much in continental airlines,rebuking the majority for throw ing the appellants out of court without reaching the merits of their arguments even though a th e case was clearly not moot in any proper sense of the term,b we unquestionably ha d statutory jurisdiction,and c we have a virtually unflagging obligation to exercise the jurisdiction that we have been given.cont l airlines,at alito,dissenting quoting.river,at.
while we have referred to equitable mootness as a abstention doctrine,semcrude,at,it is not among the handful of narrow and deeply rooted abstention doctrines recognized by the supreme court,namely,pullman,burford,younger,and colorado river those doctrines,much like the doctrine of forum non conveniens,proceed from the premise that i n rare circumstances,federal courts can relinquish their jurisdiction in favor of another forum.quackenbush allstate ins,d emphasis added moreover,the supreme court has on several occasions explicitly recognized that abstention does not,of course,involve the abdication of federal jurisdiction,but only the postponement of its exercise.england.state bd.of med.exam rs,d emphasis added quoting harrison naacp,d.but where there is no other forum and and no later exercise of jurisdiction,as in the case of equitable mootness,relinquishing jurisdiction is not abstention it abdication.in short,there is no analogue for equitable mootness among the abstention doctrines.
nor is there a likely prospect of the supreme court either taking an expansive view of an existing doctrine to encompass equitable mootness or recognizing equitable mootness as a wholly new abstention doctrine.on the contrary,the court has repeatedly endeavored to narrow the scope of the abstention doctrines,particularly within the past few years.in sprint communications,jacobs,d,for instance,the court refused to extend the three exceptional situations where younger abstention is appropriate,reaffirming chief justice marshall early and famous assertion of federal courts obligation to hear and decide cases within their jurisdiction.sprint commc ns.at citing cohens,wheat.at.the court relied on that assertion again when declining to expand the political question doctrine in zivotofsky ex rel.zivotofsky clinton,d,explaining that the judiciary has a responsibility to decide cases properly before it,even those it would gladly avoid.id.at quoting cohens,wheat.at.
and just last year,in lexmark international,static control components,d,the court confirmed its disapproval of doctrines that permit courts to decline to decide claims on prudential rather than statutory or constitutional grounds,admonishing that such doctrines conflict with the court recent reaffirmation in sprint communications of the principle that a federal court obligation to hear and decide cases within its jurisdiction is virtually unflagging.id.at quoting sprint commc ns.at internal quotation marks omitted.after concluding the plaintiff claim present ed a case or controversy that was properly within federal courts article iii jurisdiction,the court refused to frame the question before it,which was whether the plaintiff had a cause of action under a federal statute,as a question of prudential standing despite using that label in the past.id.at.the court reasoned 
we do not ask whether in our judgment congress should have authorized the plaintiff suit,but whether congress in fact did so.just as a court can not apply its independent policy judgment to recognize a cause of action that congress has denied,it can not limit a cause of action that congress has created merely because prudence dictates.
id.at citation omitted.
these recent decisions counsel that equitable mootness is not a logical extension of the narrow abstention doctrines recognized by the court and will not be viewed favorably as a relatively new prudential one.see new orleans pub,council of city of new orleans,d hereinafter nopsi explaining that the court cases have long supported the proposition that federal courts lack the authority to abstain from the exercise of jurisdiction that has been conferred.rather,this doctrine can survive only if grounded in the bankruptcy code or the federal statutes conferring bankruptcy jurisdiction the subject to which we now turn.
the majority opinion in continental airlines did not engage with any statutory arguments in favor of equitable mootness because none were raised.a review of the statutory language,however,reveals that the bankruptcy code and related jurisdictional statutes provide no support for equitable mootness and actually undermine it.
title outlines federal courts bankruptcy jurisdiction.section gives district courts original jurisdiction over bankruptcy cases,while allows them to refer cases to bankruptcy courts.a,a.the statute explicitly makes the bankruptcy court authority to enter orders,including confirmation orders,subject to review by the referring district court.id.b.in turn,provides that the district courts shall have jurisdiction to hear appeals from bankruptcy courts.id.a.neither nor states or implies that district courts may decline to exercise that jurisdiction by dismissing an appeal as equitably moot.
appellees point to c,which provides that nothing in this section prevents a district court in the interest of justice,or in the interest of comity with state courts or respect for state law,from abstaining from hearing a particular proceeding arising under title or arising in or related to a case under title.id.c.that provision,however,provides no support for equitable mootness.to begin,can not be read to authorize district courts to abstain from exercising their appellate jurisdiction when it refers to the original jurisdiction of the district courts,not to appellate jurisdiction at all.see id.a in re mystic tank lines,cir.
moreover,allows abstention in the interest of justice,or in the interest of comity with state courts or respect for state law.equitable mootness no doubt does not involve the latter.as to the former,it could be argued that preserving a reorganization plan may serve the interest of justice.but how is it just to bar a potentially meritorious appeal when an appellate court after hearing the merits of the appeal instead could use its equitable authority to fashion a limited remedy while still protecting third parties that may be harmed if a plan is undone see semcrude,at citing cont l airlines,at alito,dissenting t he feared consequences of a successful appeal are often more appropriately dealt with by fashioning limited relief at the remedial stage than by refusing to hear the merits of an appeal at its outset.see also nopsi,at noting that while federal courts lack the authority to abstain from the exercise of jurisdiction that has been conferred,they retain discretion in determining whether to grant certain types of relief.
additionally,if c were the basis for equitable mootness,our construction of the doctrine and every other circuit would violate d,which provides any decision to abstain or not to abstain made under subsection c is not reviewable by appeal or otherwise by the court of appeals under section d,or of this title or by the supreme court of the united states under section of this title.d emphasis added yet we have never interpreted to bar our review of district court orders dismissing bankruptcy appeals on equitable mootness grounds.on the contrary,dating back to continental airlines,we have not only reviewed such decisions,but have often reversed them.thus,interpreting c as the statutory basis for equitable mootness would be incompatible with our case law,as well as the language and structure of.
finally,the legislative history of c is devoid of any mention of equitable mootness.it indicates the provision was enacted to respond to the supreme court decision in northern pipeline construction marathon pipe line,d,and to avoid constitutional concerns with having state law claims resolved in federal courts.see,reprinted in,wl.the supreme court interpretation of in stern marshall,d,reinforces that congress intent was to authorize bankruptcy courts to abstain from hearing state law claims in certain circumstances not to allow district courts to abdicate their appellate jurisdiction 
t he framework congress adopted in the act contemplates that certain state law matters in bankruptcy cases will be resolved by judges other than those of the bankruptcy courts.section c,for example,requires that bankruptcy courts abstain from hearing specified,state law claims that can be timely adjudicated in a state forum of appropriate jurisdiction.section c similarly provides that bankruptcy courts may abstain from hearing any proceeding,including core matters,in the interest of comity with state courts or respect for state law.
id.at second alteration in original.thus,the language,structure,and legislative history of,as well as its interpretation by the supreme court,indicate that congress did not intend an equitable mootness exception to the federal courts appellate jurisdiction in bankruptcy cases.
appellees urge that the most plausible basis for the doctrine is that the bankruptcy code express es a policy favoring the finality of bankruptcy decisions through m e and b and equitable mootness fills a gap in the code created by the absence of a provision limiting appellate review of plan confirmation orders.semcrude,at.but alito aptly explained why we should reject this argument in his continental airlines dissent n arrow provisions such as m and e,which merely prevent the upsetting of certain specific transactions if stays are not obtained,can not support the broad doctrine of equitable mootness.at alito,dissenting emphasis added.by their terms,m and e do not prevent an appellate court from hearing an appeal,or even from granting a particular remedy they simply prevent the appellate court remedy from affecting certain transactions.see krebs chrysler plymouth,valley motors,cir.section b provides even less support for equitable mootness,as it only restricts a party ability to modify a plan before confirmation it says nothing about the powers of bankruptcy courts or appellate courts.
moreover,rather than establish a general policy supporting equitable mootness,these provisions weigh against the doctrine.because congress specified certain orders that can not be disturbed on appeal absent a stay,basic canons of statutory construction compel us to presume that congress did not intend for other orders to be immune from appeal.see russello united states,d andrus glover const,d.while the federal courts must fill statutory gaps in some exceptional circumstances,see,united states little lake misere land,d,we may not stretch a statute to create such gaps,and we generally acknowledge gaps to provide relief,not to deny relief which is the consequence of denying appellate review.
even if there were a reading of the statute that supported equitable mootness,we would be compelled to reject it because of the serious constitutional questions that reading would raise.see edward debartolo.gulf coast constr.trades council,d sandoval reno,cir.
article iii of the constitution imposes certain requirements on officials who exercise the judicial power of the united states,const.art.iii,but congress often charges officials who are not required to meet those criteria with ruling on certain kinds of claims.adjudication by such iii tribunals,including bankruptcy courts,raises two distinct constitutional concerns.the first is the infringement on a litigant entitlement to an article iii adjudicator,a personal right recently reaffirmed in wellness international network,sharif,d.while that right can be waived,bankruptcy appellants whose appeals are dismissed as equitably moot clearly do not do so.moreover,because they lack an alternative forum in which to pursue their claims against a debtor,most creditors do not truly consent to bankruptcy adjudication in the first place,see stern.at,let alone adjudication without any appellate review.
the second is a,structural concern that a congressional decision to authorize the adjudication of article iii business in a iii tribunal would impermissibly threaten the institutional integrity of the judicial branch.commodity futures trading comm schor,d see wellness int l.at.in determining whether such an intrusion occurs,the court scrutinizes among other things the extent to which the essential attributes of judicial power are reserved to article iii courts.schor,at.appellate review by an article iii judge is crucial to that determination.see,id.at 
accordingly,over eighty years ago in crowell benson,the supreme court upheld a system of adjudication by an administrative agency on the rationale that the reservation of full authority to an article iii court to deal with matters of law provide d for the appropriate exercise of the judicial function.id.at.the availability of article iii review was also essential to the court approvals of agency adjudications in thomas union carbide agricultural products,d,and commodity futures trading commission schor,d.similarly,in united states raddatz,d,the court upheld by magistrate judges only because the ultimate decision is made by the district court.id.at see also northern pipeline,at critical to the court decision to uphold the magistrates act was the fact that the ultimate decision was made by the district court.
applying these principles in the bankruptcy context,the supreme court held in northern pipeline and stern that because a bankruptcy court is not an article iii court,it may not enter final judgments regarding certain kinds of claims which have since been dubbed stern claims even when the bankruptcy judge decision will be reviewed on appeal by an article iii judge.see stern.at northern pipeline,at plurality opinion see also id.at rehnquist,concurring in the judgment.most recently,in wellness international,the court approved adjudication of stern claims by bankruptcy judges where the parties consent,but explicitly premised its decision on the existence of appellate review by article iii courts,reasoning that allowing article i adjudicators to decide claims submitted to them by consent does not offend the separation of powers so long as article iii courts retain supervisory authority over the process.at emphasis added.
equitable mootness drastically weakens that supervisory authority,and therefore threatens a far greater impermissibl e intru sion on the province of the judiciary,schor,at,than the court confronted in northern pipeline,stern,or wellness international.the doctrine not only prevents appellate review of a iii judge decision it effectively delegates the power to prevent that review to the very iii tribunal whose decision is at issue.although article iii judges decide whether an appeal is equitably moot,bankruptcy courts control nearly all of the variables in the equation,including whether a reorganization plan is initially approved,whether a stay of plan implementation is granted,whether settlements or releases crucial to a plan are approved and executed,whether property is transferred,whether new entities in which third parties may invest are formed,and whether distributions including to third parties under the plan begin all before plan challengers reach an article iii court.
put another way,whereas magistrate judges and administrative agencies decisions are at least subject to appellate review,equitable mootness not only allows bankruptcy court decisions to avoid review,but also enables bankruptcy judges to insulate their decisions from review at their discretion.in turn,opportunistic plan proponents can and as discussed below,regularly do use this to their advantage.as alito warned in nordhoff investments,our court equitable mootness doctrine can easily be used as a weapon to prevent any appellate review of bankruptcy court orders confirming reorganization plans.it thus places far too much power in the hands of bankruptcy judges.at alito,concurring in the judgment.
while historical precedent can justify a delegation of judicial power to a iii tribunal equitable mootness can not lay claim to such historical support.despite the doctrine recent acceptance by district courts and courts of appeals,the decisions of bankruptcy commissioners,referees,and,most recently,judges have always been subject to review in courts of law or equity abdicating that review is a modern trend not started by congress or the supreme court.
at the very least,equitable mootness raises serious constitutional concerns by failing to provide appellate review of bankruptcy judges decisions in an article iii court a protection that was present,yet ultimately insufficient to cure similar concerns in northern pipeline and stern.with no indication that congress or the supreme court has authorized an exception to our virtually unflagging obligation to exercise our jurisdiction that supports equitable mootness,it is not hard to see why the six dissenting members of our court in continental airlines were puzzled and troubled by our adoption of the doctrine without any analysis of its origins.at alito,dissenting.
beyond the issues with equitable mootness legitimacy,i also question its efficacy.the doctrine was intended to promote finality,but it has proven far more likely to promote uncertainty and delay.ironically,as chief judge mckee noted at oral argument in this case,a motion to dismiss an appeal as equitably moot has become part of the plan.proponents of reorganization plans now rush to implement them so they may avail themselves of an equitable mootness defense,much like appellees did here rather than litigate the merits of an appeal,parties then litigate equitable mootness.and even if an appeal is dismissed as equitably moot by a district court,that dismissal is appealed to our court,often resulting,in turn,in a remand and further proceedings.
this appeal proves the point.the bankruptcy court approved the plan on march.quad then made multiple unsuccessful attempts to obtain a stay from the bankruptcy court and the district court,eventually filing its brief on appeal in the district court on may,about two months after the plan took effect.filed its brief in response about two weeks later,and then filed its motion to dismiss the appeal as equitably moot the next day.all of the briefing on both the merits and the motion to dismiss was complete by june.because the appeal was dismissed on equitable mootness grounds,however,we find ourselves,nearly two years later and after the parties have expended considerable resources on full briefing and argument before this court,concluding that the district court improperly applied the equitable mootness factors and remanding for a ruling on the merits a ruling that itself eventually may be appealed.
how,then,does refusing to hear the merits of the appeal achieve finality even if we were affirming the district court finding of equitable mootness,there would not have been finality until this point,as the possibility of reversal has loomed all along.without the equitable mootness doctrine,on the other hand,the district court would have ruled on the merits long ago.
even if the doctrine worked as intended and consistently promoted finality,its deleterious effect on our system of bankruptcy adjudication presents an independent reason to reject it.by excising appellate review,equitable mootness not only tends to insulate errors by bankruptcy judges or district courts,but also stunts the development of uniformity in the law of bankruptcy moreover,the significant consequences of a confirmation order,as recently recited by the supreme court,necessitate appellate review 
p lan confirmation alters the status quo and fixes the rights and obligations of the parties.when the bankruptcy court confirms a plan,its terms become binding on debtor and creditor alike.confirmation has preclusive effect,foreclosing relitigation of any issue actually litigated by the parties and any issue necessarily determined by the confirmation order.subject to certain exceptions,confirmation vests all of the property of the bankruptcy estate in the debtor,and renders that property free and clear of any claim or interest of any creditor provided for by the plan.confirmation also triggers the chapter trustee duty to distribute to creditors those funds already received from the debtor.

particularly troubling are dismissals of appeals challenging plans that classify similar claims differently in order to gerrymander an affirmative vote on reorganization.in re pac.lumber,cir quoting in re greystone iii joint venture,cir internal quotation mark omitted.even if appellants challenging such violations can demonstrate apparent arbitrariness in the treatment of different creditors,courts are likely to find their appeals equitably moot,as often no remedy is practicable other than unwinding the plan.accord in re charter commc ns,cir.under such circumstances,equitable mootness merely serves as part of a blueprint for implementing a questionable plan that favors certain creditors over others without oversight by article iii judges in short,even equitable and prudential concerns weigh against equitable mootness.
we must consider whether to end or endure the mischief of equitable mootness.although the doctrine has been accepted de facto across the circuits,its legitimacy has rarely been scrutinized and this appeal appears to be the first in our circuit in which an appellant has properly preserved and disputed the validity of equitable mootness under the bankruptcy code,the federal statutes conferring bankruptcy jurisdiction,and the constitution.in fact,aside from numerous petitions for certiorari,the doctrine has gone virtually unchallenged this may be because litigants and bankruptcy attorneys wield the weapon of equitable mootness just as often as they suffer its blows.but it is time for the challenge,and i am not alone in urging it.a coalition of bankruptcy law professors and the united states government have both urged the supreme court to hear challenges to equitable mootness in any event,the doctrine widespread acceptance,standing alone,does not establish its validity.after all,the system of bankruptcy adjudication struck down in stern had been unanimously upheld by district courts and courts of appeals 
moreover,principles of stare decisis do not compel us to continue on this course.revisiting precedent is particularly appropriate where,as here,the precedent consists of a rule that was recently adopted to improve the operation of the courts,and experience has pointed up the precedent shortcomings,pearson callahan,d,and where subsequent legal developments have unmoored the case from its doctrinal anchors,morrow balaski,cir en banc smith,concurring see dickerson united states,d w e have overruled our precedents when subsequent cases have undermined their doctrinal underpinnings.see also leegin creative leather,psks,d quoting dickerson and collecting cases.considering that equitable mootness barely had doctrinal anchors to begin with,our dismal experience with it obliges us to reconsider continental airlines.
while proponents of the doctrine will emphasize its practical importance to the administration of bankruptcy estates,there are effective alternatives that do not suffer from the prudential,statutory,and constitutional defects of equitable mootness.for instance,in an appropriate case,parties can deploy the equitable defense of laches,which requires establish ing an inexcusable delay in bringing the action and prejudice.in re mushroom transp,cir quoting fire ins.asbestospray,cir internal quotation mark omitted.similarly,where an appellant bad faith delay prejudices other parties,courts have discretion to impose an appropriate remedy,including dismissal.see in re harris,cir sotomayor,j.in re spr,cir in re comer,cir see also fed.a an appellant failure to take any step other than the timely filing of a notice of appeal does not affect the validity of the appeal,but is ground only for the district court or bap to act as it considers appropriate,including dismissing the appeal.and,of course,appellate courts can expedite briefing schedules and issue orders with necessary instructions for the parties and bankruptcy courts in advance of full opinions.
