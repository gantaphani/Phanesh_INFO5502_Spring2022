unfortunately lacking a crystal ball,in august,defendant monarch air service,monarch entered into an agreement with midway airlines,midway to provide fueling services for midway aircraft.these services included,among other things,the management of midway fuel storage tank farm.by march,midway and two related entities,midway airlines midway and midway aircraft engineering,midway engineering collectively,the midway debtors filed for chapter bankruptcy.monarch was required by the bankruptcy court,together with other vendors,to continue providing services to the ailing midway airlines.alas,midway financial situation took a turn for the worse,and by november,midway unilaterally and without notice ejected monarch from the tank farm,converting to a chapter bankruptcy two weeks later.
in january,the bankruptcy court authorized the sale of the jet fuel stored in midway tank farm.monarch belatedly realized that this was a perfect opportunity to assert claims that both its and expenses were actually secured by a common law bailee or warehouseman lien on the jet fuel.the sale of the jet fuel went forward,and the disputed amount of the proceeds has been held in escrow ever since.
eventually,it came time to dispose of the remaining smaller claims against the midway debtors,including monarch claims.monarch consented to the disallowance of its claim for expenses.the amount in dispute at the present juncture is monarch claim for expenses of.the bankruptcy court found that monarch had consented to the treatment of its claim as an unsecured administrative expense,and,in the alternative,that monarch was not entitled to a lien on the jet fuel in the first place.the district court affirmed on the first ground,ignoring the second.monarch appeals both of the bankruptcy court findings,but for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
the facts in this case are essentially undisputed.monarch entered into an airport fueling services agreement with midway on august,contract,tab according to this agreement,monarch responsibilities were twofold supplying fueling services for midway aircraft at midway airport which included refueling and defueling the aircraft and transporting the fuel from midway tanks to its aircraft in monarch own tanker trucks,as well as managing midway fuel storage tanks which consisted of operating the fuel tanks in connection with providing fueling services and routine maintenance of the tanks.the agreement stated that all fuel would be ordered,purchased and owned by midway.it also provided that the fuel tank facilities in which midway fuel was stored were owned by the city of chicago and leased to and controlled by midway.midway has,however,admitted that monarch had sole physical possession and control over the fuel tank facilities pursuant to the contract.appendix,trustee rule n response.the agreement gave midway the option of assuming management of its storage facilities upon thirty days written notice to monarch.
on march,the three midway debtors filed voluntary chapter bankruptcy petitions.in accordance with these petitions,the midway debtors obtained an injunction barring key vendors,such as monarch,from suspending services under their contracts.the order imposing the injunction provided that each such defendant or party which otherwise provides goods or rendered services as requested by the plaintiffs pursuant to the industry agreements on or after march,shall be entitled to payment therefor in the ordinary course of business,as an administrative expense under b.loose pldgs,exhibit monarch filed an initial proof of an unsecured claim for services of on june,initial claim.trustee,supp,tab 
on november,without any notice,midway removed monarch from physical possession of and control over the fuel tank facilities.at this point,monarch was owed approximately an additional for its services.about two weeks later,midway and midway engineering converted their chapter petitions to chapter bankruptcies midway followed suit on march.
meanwhile,the bankruptcy court had entered an order on january,authorizing the sale of the fuel inventory in midway storage tanks,providing that liens,including warehousemen liens and possessory liens,shall attach to the proceeds.monarch did not receive actual notice of this order until march,at which time it informed the trustee of the midway debtors bankruptcy estate,plaintiff sheldon solow trustee,that it held a possessory lien in the proceeds of the sale.the disputed proceeds were placed in escrow pending determination of the validity of monarch claimed lien.more than years later,these proceeds continue to be held in escrow.
on april,monarch filed two proofs of claim.one claim purported to amend its initial claim by asserting that monarch expenses of were secured by a common law bailee or warehouseman possessory lien on the jet fuel in midway fuel storage tanks and monarch tanker trucks claim one.trustee,supp,tab the other claim was for expenses of,which included both monarch expenses of and its expenses of claim two.trustee,supp,tab like claim one,these expenses were also said to be secured by a common law bailee warehouseman possessory lien on the jet fuel in midway fuel storage tanks and monarch tanker trucks.however,on the same form,monarch also expressed an intent to claim in the alternative that the was a priority unsecured administrative expense as provided under the terms of the march,order.the bankruptcy court,in an order entered may,allowed monarch claim in full as an administrative expense under.trustee,supp,tab no mention was made of any secured status for this claim.
after nearly eight years had gone by,the bankruptcy court,upon the trustee motion,approved a claims resolution procedure authorizing the trustee to use a negative notice format to resolve the remaining or so claims by the creditors of the midway debtors.pursuant to this procedure,the trustee sent notices to the persons designated to receive notices on monarch claim one and claim two president and monarch general counsel,respectively.the trustee notice of objection to claim two,served on monarch general counsel in july,is the one at issue here.trustee,supp,tab this notice proposed to allow the amount of in full,with the caveat that your distribution will be a percentage of your allowed amount.the notice objected to the portion of the claim for services,stating that n o distribution will be made to claims because the estate lacks funds to pay all claims in full.no explicit mention was made whether the allowed amount was being treated as an administrative expense or as a secured expense.monarch president signed and returned a consent form agreeing to this treatment dated august.a second notice objecting to claim one as being both and duplicative was sent in may directly to monarch president trustee,supp,tab k,and no response was filed 
on february,the bankruptcy court issued an oral ruling that monarch had consented to the treatment of its proof of secured claim as an administrative expense and entered summary judgment in the trustee favor.monarch filed a motion for reconsideration the next day,which was denied on february,when the bankruptcy court confirmed its holding that monarch had waived its secured claim to expenses,and,in the alternative,that monarch did not,in any event,have a valid lien entitling it to secured status.
on march,monarch appealed to the district court,which by order dated july,affirmed the bankruptcy court grant of summary judgment to the trustee on the ground that monarch had waived its alleged secured claim.monarch subsequently appealed to this court.
a court of appeals applies the same standard of review to bankruptcy court decisions as does a district court.a bankruptcy court findings of fact are reviewed for clear error,and its conclusions of law are reviewed de novo.in re smith,cir internal citations omitted.as a conclusion of law,a grant of summary judgment by the bankruptcy court is therefore reviewed de novo.a grant of summary judgment will be affirmed if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.summary judgment may be affirmed on any ground supported by the record,even if it was not relied upon by the court below.johnson gudmundsson,cir.
the issues in this case boil down to two questions did the bankruptcy court and the district court properly find that monarch had waived its secured claim for expenses against midway and,did the bankruptcy court properly find that monarch had failed to establish the existence of a valid lien 
in the proceedings,both the bankruptcy court and the district court found that monarch had impliedly waived its secured claim by consenting to the trustee treatment of claim two.the bankruptcy court found that monarch had consented to the treatment of its claim as a straight unsecured administrative claim,which was indicated by the bankruptcy court may,order and by the language of the trustee objection to claim two,served in july.see monarch short,tab,at.the bankruptcy court additionally pointed out that the consent form,signed by monarch president and dated august,stated that monarch would receive a percentage of the allowed amount,which is typical of regular unsecured administrative expenses when the bankruptcy estate is administratively insolvent.see id.at.
the district court agreed that the language of the objection indicated that the expense was being treated as an unsecured administrative expense and that the lack of any mention of a lien in the trustee objection form indicated that the trustee was not proposing to allow the claim as a secured expense.see monarch short,tab,at.the district court also agreed with the bankruptcy court that monarch unreasonably continued to rely on its proof of claim,filed more than eight years earlier,to maintain a secured claim in the face of the negative notice procedure being used and the language of the objection notice referring to recovery of a percentage of the allowed amount.
monarch argues on appeal that it asserted a secured claim to administrative expenses in claim two,and that a and the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure f provide that the proof of claim is prima facie valid and the claim is deemed allowed unless the trustee objects in writing.the bankruptcy court may,order is said not to have addressed the secured status of monarch administrative expense claim.moreover,monarch argues,the trustee did not address the secured status of its claim in its objection to claim two,and the percentage language in a footnote to the objection notice should not be considered to be a written objection that placed monarch on notice that its secured claim was being treated as an unsecured administrative expense.on this point,monarch further argues that being told it would receive a percentage did not necessarily indicate that its claim was being treated as unsecured rather than secured,since it is possible for secured claimants to receive a percentage of their claims in certain circumstances.
let us begin with a brief explanation of the types and priorities of claims,which may be helpful here.secured claims are paid or the collateral returned before any distribution is made to priority claimants or to unsecured general creditors.the bankruptcy code defines several categories of priority claims in,all of which are paid out after secured creditors have received their funds.id.at.general unsecured creditors receive a distribution from the bankruptcy estate only if any funds remain after all priority claims have been paid.
among priority claims,administrative expenses receive the top priority.id.at a.typically,administrative expenses are unsecured,due perhaps to the operation of a automatic stay,which bars any entity from any act to create,perfect,or enforce any lien against property of the estate.there are a few possible exceptions,such as in the case of extensions of credit in accordance with d,or,as some courts have found,in the case of ad valorem real estate taxes.see city of new york of finance macy.these are usually classified as superpriority administrative expenses and are paid out before regular administrative expenses although the bankruptcy court here found a automatic stay inapplicable to liens created by operation of law,a finding with respect to which we render no opinion,this does not change the fact that a reference to administrative expenses without any indication of superpriority or secured status will typically refer to unsecured administrative expenses.
turning to monarch claims,claim two the claim at issue here asserted a secured claim for monarch pre and expenses of.in the as a position if its lien were found asserted an unsecured claim to priority administrative expenses of pursuant to the bankruptcy court march,order.trustee,supp,tab the march,order did not indicate that a creditor entitlement to administrative expenses under b for provision of goods or services would or could entitle it to anything other than regular unsecured administrative expenses.loose pldgs,exhibit given,as we have discussed,that administrative expenses generally refer to unsecured expenses,when the bankruptcy court allowed monarch claim in as an administrative expense pursuant to b without any mention of secured status or of monarch purported lien,this action served to allow the claim as a typical unsecured administrative expense.implicit in this decision was the bankruptcy court of monarch secured claim to expenses.
moreover,the bankruptcy and district courts correctly held that the trustee objection to claim two clearly implied that monarch claim would be treated as an unsecured administrative expense.first,there is the footnote on the objection notice indicating that monarch would receive a percentage of its claim for expenses,a comment that the bankruptcy court observed to be typical of unsecured administrative expenses.second,there is the trustee statement that n o distribution will be made to claims because the estate lacks funds to pay all claims in full.this language indicates that monarch claim was of a lower priority than claims for administrative expenses.if the trustee had accepted monarch claimed lien as valid,monarch expenses would have been allowed in full because they were secured,rather than being given a lower priority than administrative expenses 
in light of the aforementioned circumstances and the eight long years that passed without any indication from monarch that it was continuing to assert a secured claim for its expenses,the trustee was entitled to assume that monarch secured claim was no longer viable and that the bankruptcy code dual presumptions of validity and allowability with respect to this claim had been overcome.moreover,the trustee objection to claim two clearly implied that monarch and claims were being treated as unsecured.thus,the bankruptcy and district courts correctly held that the onus was on monarch to reassert the secured status of its claim for expenses in the face of the trustee objection,and monarch failed to do so.monarch consent to the trustee objection to claim two was a consent to the treatment of its claim as regular unsecured administrative expenses.
monarch contention that a hearing is necessary to determine whether its consent to the trustee objection was an intentional relinquishment of its claimed lien is without merit.monarch designated recipient of bankruptcy notices relating to claim two was not akin to a corporation registered agent or some other unaffiliated entity monarch br.at,but rather was monarch own general counsel.and monarch general counsel would have been remiss in his obligation to the corporation if he had merely received important legal notices such as the trustee objection to claim two and forwarded them to monarch president without advice or comment.this is true even if the advice consisted of simply advising monarch president to consult with specialized bankruptcy counsel before signing the consent form.it is true that a waiver is an intentional relinquishment of a known right.see kontrick ryan,d.but we have held that the trustee written objection was a clear treatment,even if by implication,of monarch claim as an unsecured administrative expense.
