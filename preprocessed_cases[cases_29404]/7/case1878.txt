the question presented in this appeal is whether tonda ford,a debtor in chapter bankruptcy,is entitled to keep a personal injury settlement arising from a claim she failed to disclose in her bankruptcy proceedings.the bankruptcy court concluded that ford acted in bad faith in delaying disclosure of her interest in the personal injury suit,and thus denied an exemption that ordinarily applies to personal injury settlements under utah law.ford appealed to the tenth circuit bankruptcy appellate panel,which reversed.
two issues are raised by the parties on appeal.one,what is the proper burden of proof in assessing whether a debtor has concealed assets in bad faith and,two,was the bankruptcy court finding of bad faith clearly erroneous on this record we conclude that the applicable burden of proof is the preponderance of the evidence standard and that sufficient evidence supported the bankruptcy court finding of bad faith.
taking jurisdiction pursuant to d,we therefore affirm the bankruptcy court denial of ford exemption.
background 
factual background 
tonda ford was seriously injured in a car accident in december.as a result of the accident,ford was treated for extensive head injuries which caused her to miss work as a paralegal and required followup therapy.shortly after the accident,ford retained a law firm to represent her in bringing a claim against the driver of the other vehicle.the firm filed a complaint on ford behalf in february seeking general damages for pain and suffering,past and future medical expenses,lost earnings,loss of earning capacity,and loss of property.
encountering financial difficulties after the accident,ford and her husband filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code in may.for her bankruptcy matter,ford retained different lawyers from a different firm than those working on her accident case.at that time,she was working as a project assistant for a law firm specializing in medical malpractice.
along with her petition for bankruptcy,ford and her husband completed schedules listing their assets and debts.on the schedule requiring the fords to disclose all of their legal claims they might have against did not disclose her damages claim in the pending accident case during the pendency of her bankruptcy case,moreover,ford never informed her bankruptcy counsel of the accident litigation.the bankruptcy case was closed in august,when the trustee filed a report the personal injury suit was still pending at this time.
ford says she did not become aware of her obligation to disclose the personal injury suit until shortly after her bankruptcy case closed.according to ford,she was meeting at the office of her personal injury lawyer in late august when a paralegal asked if she had filed for bankruptcy.when ford answered in the affirmative,the paralegal asked if she had listed the accident claim in her schedules.ford said no,and the paralegal notified her of her duty to do so.ford claims that she immediately called her bankruptcy attorney to disclose her interest in the suit.nevertheless,the record reflects that ford did not move to reopen her bankruptcy case until october.at,and did not file amended schedules until december.at.
in september,ford personal injury suit settled for.at this time,ford moved to reopen the bankruptcy proceedings in order to list her interest in the civil suit.after the bankruptcy court agreed to reopen the case on december,ford filed amended schedules listing the settlement and seeking an exemption for the proceeds under utah code ann.the bankruptcy trustee objected to the exemption,however,claiming that ford had intentionally concealed her interest in the suit in bad faith and had disclosed it only after learning she could not access the settlement proceeds otherwise.
b.the bankruptcy court proceedings 
the bankruptcy court held an evidentiary hearing on the trustee objection to the exemption claim.ford was the only witness to testify.after considering the admitted evidence,hearing ford testimony,and assessing her credibility,the court concluded that ford intentionally concealed the personal injury claim in order to benefit herself and prejudice creditors.
at the hearing,ford maintained her initial failure to disclose was based on her innocent misapprehension of the law and that she moved to disclose as soon as she became aware of her obligation to do so.she provided two explanations for her failure to disclose.first,she explained that based on her paralegal training she intentionally failed to disclose the claim because she believed personal injury awards were exempt from creditors under state law second,she claimed that she failed to schedule the suit because she thought she was only required to list claims brought against her,and not claims she was asserting against others.
in a terse ruling from the bench,the bankruptcy court made the following findings ford had knowledge of the undisclosed claim,and had a motive for its concealment because of her paralegal training ford knew that the claim was exempt and therefore made a conscious decision not to disclose it ford falsely failed to schedule the claim on her schedules and ford failure to disclose the claim was a blatant dishonesty resulting in her intent to hinder the trustee administration of the estate which would prejudice sic.at.
concluding that ford sought the exemption in bad faith,the bankruptcy court denied the exemption.
c.the bankruptcy appellate panel proceedings 
ford appealed to the tenth circuit bankruptcy appellate panel bap.the bap reversed,concluding the bankruptcy court findings of bad faith were clearly erroneous and that its denial of the exemption was an abuse of discretion.specifically,the bap found there was insufficient evidence in the record to support a finding of bad faith and that ford delayed disclosure could just as easily be attributed to inadvertence as to intentional concealment.it reached this conclusion for three reasons ford minimal legal training could not be used to support an inference of bad faith the trustee failed to articulate a motive for concealment in light of the fact that the settlement proceeds would be exempt anyway and there was an absence of a showing of prejudice to creditors arising from ford.bap decision at.
finally,while the bap agreed that debtors have a duty to schedule exempt assets so that the trustee can investigate the legitimacy of the exemption,id.at,it nevertheless concluded a debtor ought not to be penalized for inadvertent or innocent.in the absence of evidence to support a finding of bad faith,illicit motive,or an intent to conceal an asset from the trustee and the creditors,the bap held that denying an exemption was an abuse of discretion and reversed the bankruptcy court.id.
