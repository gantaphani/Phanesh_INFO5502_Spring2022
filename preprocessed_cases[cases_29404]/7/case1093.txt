background 
during the,health management operated doctors hospital in springfield,illinois.to cover its operating costs,health management borrowed money from national city bank national city in exchange for a first mortgage on health management hospital facility and a first priority lien on its other business assets,including its accounts receivable.eventually,national city assigned its security interest to universal guarantee life insurance company universal,which assumed national city position in this litigation.
in,marine bank of springfield marine bank extended health management a million line of credit.as security,marine bank received a second mortgage on the hospital and other health management assets,including its accounts receivable.marine bank then negotiated with national city to acquire the first priority lien on the accounts receivable.
the most recent version of marine bank security agreement with health management became effective on april,and stated that a first priority security interest in health management accounts receivable secured all of health management obligations.the term obligations was defined as follows 
any and all of the borrower indebtedness liabilities to the bank of any kind,nature and description,direct or indirect,secured or unsecured,joint,several,joint and several,absolute or contingent,due or to become due,now existing or hereafter arising,regardless of how such indebtedness or liabilities arise or by what agreement or instrument they may be evidenced or whether evidenced by any agreement or instrument 
this type of contract provision is known as a dragnet clause because it secures current as well as future debt.the april,security agreement also provided that it could not be modified,amended,or terminated orally or by any course of dealing,or in any manner other than by an agreement in writing,signed by the borrower to be charged.the parties signed security agreements that were consistent with the language of the april security agreement.
between and february,health management executed a number of promissory notes the parties do not specify how many payable to marine bank.each loan agreement stated that health management accounts receivable secured the loan.additionally,when health management submitted each loan to its loan committee,the loan presentation documents recited that its accounts receivable secured the loan.
on january,health management was overdrawn on its marine bank account and had maxed out its revolving line of credit.it convinced marine bank to lend it an additional,but marine bank insisted that the loan be secured by the personal guarantees of a number of health management partners and by health management accounts receivable.marine bank promised that it would satisfy the debt using health management accounts receivable ahead of the personal guarantees.eventually,the january note became overdue,and,as promised,marine bank used health management accounts receivable to pay the loan.
on march,health management sought a second note to cover the hospital payroll.marine bank said that it would make the loan if it was collateralized fully by cash.health management convinced william coughlin,a staff physician and a former limited partner of doctors hospital,to provide the requested collateral.coughlin thought the loan involved little risk because the hospital accounts receivable amounted to approximately times the value of the hospital revolving line of credit.the loan documents were signed in a hurry,and coughlin did not read them.coughlin signed an assignment agreement that allowed marine bank to keep coughlin until health management repaid the loan.he also signed a hypothecation agreement,in which the parties agreed to make a loan secured by the.none of the documents discussed a security interest in health management accounts receivable.
on april or,marine bank discovered that health management was depositing receipts in an account at another bank.marine bank became concerned about health management continuing viability,so it took possession of coughlin collateral.on april,health management filed for bankruptcy.
within one or two days of the bankruptcy filing,the bankruptcy court entered an order authorizing use of certain cash collateral,to which national city,marine bank,and universal stipulated in open court.the order stated that health management owed marine bank approximately and that any party had until july,to challenge the amount of this debt.coughlin maintains that the march,loan was part of the million debt discussed in the order.he also notes that universal did not challenge the amount of debt before july.
doctors hospital closed within a month of the bankruptcy filing,and marine bank collected the hospital accounts receivable until its debt was paid in full.at that point,universal began collecting the remaining accounts,though it recovered only a fraction of the million it was owed.when,in the fall of,coughlin maintained that he was entitled to of the accounts receivable,universal filed the current adversary proceeding,alleging that health management accounts receivable did not secure marine bank march loan.coughlin,as the subrogee of marine bank under,responded that the bankruptcy court had already ruled that health management accounts receivable secured the loan and that the april,dragnet clause secured all of health management future debts to marine bank.
on august,the bankruptcy court presided over a short bench trial.on may,the court ruled in universal favor,concluding that the court cash collateral order did not preclude it from considering how the march loan was secured.on the merits,the court held that health management accounts receivable did not secure the march loan the court said that marine bank knew how to create a security interest in accounts receivable and that the march loan did not create such an interest.
the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court.it observed that the march loan,unlike the previous loans between marine bank and health management did not mention a security interest in accounts receivable.the district court did not address whether the dragnet clause in the april,security agreement covered the march loan.
ii.analysis 
cash collateral order 
coughlin first argues that the bankruptcy court cash collateral order barred it from reconsidering whether health management accounts receivable secured the march loan.coughlin maintains that the ruling has collateral estoppel effect and is the law of the case.the court reviews the question de novo.see adair sherman,cir collateral estoppel moore anderson,cir law of the case.
for a ruling to have collateral estoppel effect,four elements must be met the issue sought to be precluded must be the same as that involved in the prior litigation,the issue must have been actually litigated,the determination of the issue must have been essential to the final judgment,and the party against whom estoppel is invoked must be fully represented in the prior action.meyer rigdon,cir quoting la preferida cerveceria modelo,de,cir.like the collateral estoppel doctrine,law of the case only applies where a court actually decided the issue in question.see wright,miller cooper federal practice procedure.in this case,neither doctrine applies because the cash collateral order did not resolve whether health management accounts receivable secured the march loan.though the order said that health management owed approximately million to marine bank a
