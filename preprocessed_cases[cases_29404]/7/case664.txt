in this chapter bankruptcy of urban broadcasting corporation ubc,univision of virginia,univision,a owner of ubc stock,filed a claim to require ubc to buy its equity interest in accordance with a agreement between it and ubc.because the bankruptcy estate had approximately million in it after all creditors,except univision,had been paid,univision shares were worth about million.allowing univision claim as a creditor under the agreement therefore would yield univision the same amount that it would receive if its claim were disallowed and it were paid as a equity owner of ubc.
the bankruptcy court conducted a hearing on univision claim on july.theodore white,the owner of the remaining of the shares of ubc,did not attend the hearing,nor did he submit any objection,despite the bankruptcy court order that he file any objection by july,or be forever barred.following the hearing,the court allowed univision claim as a creditor under the agreement and authorized distribution of million to univision and the remaining distributable amount of million net of administrative expenses to white.
white appealed the bankruptcy court july allowance order,as well as two procedural orders relating to the july allowance order,to the district court.with respect to the allowance order,white contended that univision should have received the million not as a creditor,but rather as a shareholder of ubc.even though there would be no difference in the amount of distribution,white argued that a distribution to univision as a creditor would have a greater res judicata effect in any subsequent court proceeding and thus would affect him adversely.white expressly told the court that he was intending to file a separate suit against univision after the bankruptcy proceedings were completed.
on univision motion,the district court dismissed white appeal on the ground that he had no standing to challenge the bankruptcy court order because he failed to file an objection to the claim despite the bankruptcy court order to do so by july or be forever barred and also because he failed to appear and object at the july bankruptcy court hearing regarding univision claim.the court ruled alternatively 
even assuming arguendo that white had standing to appeal,however,white failure to object despite specific direction by the bankruptcy court to do so is a voluntary and intentional relinquishment of his objection and hence a waiver.as a consequence,white is barred from attacking univision claim and allowance order.
although our reasoning differs somewhat from that advanced by the district court,we affirm the district court judgment on the grounds that white was not a person aggrieved by the bankruptcy court order,as the term person aggrieved is used to justify standing to appeal a bankruptcy order,and in any event,white waived or forfeited the right to challenge the bankruptcy court july order by failing to comply with the bankruptcy court june,order to file such a claim or be forever barred from doing so.in view of these conclusions,we also conclude that the bankruptcy court procedural orders were interlocutory and therefore not appealable to the district court.
theodore white and silver king broadcasting of virginia,silver king formed ubc in to operate a home shopping television station in the washington,area.in exchange for financing the initial construction of the station,silver king received a equity stake in ubc,and white,who was to serve as ubc ceo and general manager,received the remaining.white and silver king also entered into a right of first refusal and put and call agreement.under the terms of that agreement,silver king had a right to require ubc to purchase its shares on the occurrence of certain triggering events a put,including ubc default on any loan agreements,ubc failure to affiliate with the home shopping network,and ubc failure to perform its obligations under such an affiliation agreement.white had a call option on silver king shares,which gave him the right to purchase silver king stock in the event that home shopping network defaulted on its compensation payments to ubc under an affiliation agreement.
shortly after signing the agreement,silver king changed its name to hsn broadcasting of virginia,and the agreement was amended accordingly.later,hsn broadcasting of virginia,became,by another name change,usa station group of virginia.yet later,usa station group of virginia,was among the entities purchased by univision communications,and became univision of virginia,univision,the claimant in this case.
almost from the beginning,ubc was marred by fighting between its equity owners and by problems with its affiliation agreement with home shopping network.disputes between the owners of ubc led ubc to file its first chapter bankruptcy in,and shortly after ubc emerged from bankruptcy in,litigation ensued in virginia state court between ubc and home shopping network when home shopping network discontinued its affiliation payments to ubc.both ubc and home shopping network asserted that the other was in breach of their affiliation agreement,but home shopping network ultimately prevailed,obtaining a declaratory judgment that it had not breached the agreement.
because ubc was no longer receiving affiliation payments from home shopping network,it was forced to file a second chapter bankruptcy proceeding in august bankruptcy that is at issue in this appeal.usa station group of virginia formerly silver king filed a motion to appoint a chapter trustee.to avoid the appointment of a trustee,however,ubc agreed to sell substantially all of its assets.the bankruptcy court conducted an auction in april,and univision communications,was the highest bidder for the assets at million.about that same time,univision communications,also completed its acquisition of usa networks,broadcast television subsidiaries,and usa station group of virginia,thereby became univision of virginia,univision.thus,univision became the presumptive to silver king equity stake in ubc and the agreement that white and ubc originally entered into with silver king.
during the course of ubc chapter proceeding,univision,as owner of ubc,filed a proof of claim based on the agreement,contending that triggering events had occurred and that ubc was therefore required to buy its interest in ubc.ubc objected to the claim,primarily disputing univision asserted status as a successor in interest to the agreement.
concerned with white control of the bankruptcy estate,the bankruptcy court appointed stanley salus as chapter trustee on december.the court concluded that given the debtor failure to propose a confirmable plan,the best way at this point of getting creditors paid is to appoint a chapter trustee in this case.salus thereafter proceeded to pay all claims against univision claim based on the the million in proceeds from the asset sale.on august,the case was converted into a chapter proceeding.
after the trustee paid the claims against ubc,approximately million remained in the bankruptcy estate for distribution to ubc equity and univision.accordingly,the trustee filed a motion for interim distribution of these funds in april,proposing to distribute to white and to univision.univision,however,objected,contending that it had an unresolved claim as a creditor under the terms of the agreement.even though univision would receive the identical amount as a creditor under the agreement in payment of its equity interest as it would receive directly as a equity holder,univision was motivated by a desire to avoid any additional litigation with white.univision apparently expected that payment to it as a creditor would have a stronger res judicata effect in anticipated litigation with white than would payment to it as a shareholder.
the bankruptcy court held a hearing on the trustee motion for interim distribution on june,and concluded that univision proof of claim had to be resolved prior to any distribution to equity holders.the bankruptcy court accordingly entered an order dated june,in which it substituted the trustee for the with respect to ubc objection to univision claim,but clarified that n othing in this order,however,requires the trustee to prosecute the objection if there would be no economic benefit to the bankruptcy estate in doing so.the order also scheduled a hearing for july,and explicitly warned white that any objection by him to the allowance of univision claim must be filed by july,or be forever barred.even though white elected not to be present at the june hearing,he was served with a copy of the june order both by univision and by the bankruptcy court clerk.
in response to the bankruptcy court june order,white filed a motion on june,to extend the deadline for objecting to univision claim to postpone the hearing date and to authorize the trustee to make a partial distribution to him to retain counsel for prosecuting an objection to univision claim.white also requested expedited hearing of his motion.the next day,july,the bankruptcy court denied the motion for extension of time to file an objection and to postpone the hearing,denied white motion for expedited hearing,and stated that white motion seeking authority for the trustee to make a partial distribution could be scheduled on any regularly scheduled motions day providing adequate notice.the court explained its denial of white procedural motions as follows 
the simple fact of the matter is that this case has been before the court for an inordinately long period of time and that most of the delay in the administration of the case has been the fault of white.for him to wait until the last moment to attempt to bring new counsel on board and then to cite his own procrastination as the basis for a continuance is unacceptable.
white then filed a motion on july,for reconsideration of the bankruptcy court order,which he characterized as an order denying application to employ bean,kenney korman as counsel.this motion focused on white claimed lack of funds to retain proper counsel to represent his interests before the bankruptcy court.white appellate counsel acknowledged during oral argument that bean,kenney korman had refused white further representation after not having been paid.
on july,four days before the scheduled july hearing,the trustee filed a memorandum informing the bankruptcy court and the parties that he did not intend to object to univision claim at the hearing.he explained that since univision would be compensated the identical amount whether as a creditor or as a shareholder and since prosecution of ubc objection on any viable basis would necessarily entail potentially lengthy discovery regarding the underlying facts,as well as research,briefing and trial on the facts and related legal issues,with the estate incurring concomitant fees and expenses,there would be no purpose nor any economic benefit to be gained by prosecution of the objection.
on july,the hearing proceeded as scheduled,but white elected not to attend.the court began the hearing by denying white motion for reconsideration,noting that white did not need the approval of this court to employ counsel to represent his interest as a shareholder and that the motion was never noticed for a hearing.following the hearing,the bankruptcy court entered three orders,one formally denying white motion for reconsideration one allowing univision claim in the amount of and one authorizing an interim distribution of to ubc,which was now owned by white in view of univision put of its shares to ubc.
after white appealed the bankruptcy court orders to the district court,univision filed a motion to dismiss,which the district court granted.see white univision of in re urban broadcasting.noting that white was appealing three july order denying his motion to extend the objection deadline,postpone the hearing,and authorize partial distribution the july order denying his motion for reconsideration and the july order allowing univision district court held that the july order and the first july order were interlocutory.id.at.only if white had standing to appeal the july order allowing univision claim,the final order into which the two interlocutory orders merged,could the interlocutory orders properly be considered on appeal.id.at.the district court then concluded that white was not a person aggrieved and therefore had no standing to appeal the bankruptcy court july order allowing univision claim because white failed to file an objection after being warned that failure to do so would result in any objections being forever barred,and white failed to appear and object to the claim at the july,hearing.id.at.the court held alternatively that white failure to object despite specific direction by the bankruptcy court to do so is a voluntary and intentional relinquishment of his objection and hence a waiver.as a consequence,white is barred from attacking univision claim and the allowance order.id.at.
from the district court order,dated january,white appealed,making two arguments.first,he contends that he does have standing to appeal from the order allowing univision claim and authorizing an interim distribution because he is a person aggrieved,a status that does not require him to have appeared and objected at the july hearing.second,he contends that,in any event,he has standing to appeal the bankruptcy court interlocutory july order and the first july he has timely appealed from these final orders.
white principal argument on appeal is that the district court erred in concluding that he was not a person aggrieved by the bankruptcy court order allowing univision claim on the ground that he did not file an objection to or attend the hearing on the claim.he argues that his standing to appeal is not related to whether he objected to the claim or attended the hearing,but rather on whether the bankruptcy court order directly and adversely affected his pecuniary interests.and to fulfill this requirement for standing,he asserts in his brief on appeal 
if univision claim were denied in its entirety,then white would have been entitled to of the surplus proceeds in the chapter estate.similarly,if the bankruptcy court determined that white had exercised call and acquired all of silver stock in ubc,then univision put claim would have been rendered a nullity and white would have held of ubc stock even if all the surplus proceeds were returned to ubc,white would have been the beneficial recipient of all of the million being disbursed because he would then be the sole shareholder of the company.
thus,while white and the district court both recognize that white right to appeal depends on whether he was a person aggrieved by the bankruptcy court order,they disagree on the relevance of whether white filed an objection to the claim or attended the hearing.
the district court concluded that white was not a person aggrieved on two distinct bases.first,it stated that given white failure to object to univision claim and the clarity of the bankruptcy court june order,white objection has been forever barred,and thus he is not a person aggrieved with regard to the july allowance order and does not meet the standard governing standing to appeal.white,at footnote omitted.a contrary conclusion,the district court continued,would render bankruptcy court orders meaningless and imperil the integrity of the bankruptcy process.id.at.second,the district court relied on cases from other circuits and concluded that the fourth circuit would likely conclude,consistent with the seventh,ninth,and tenth circuits,that attendance and objection at the bankruptcy court hearing are to appellate standing under the person aggrieved test.id.at.see,weston mann in re weston,cir in re schultz fabricating,cir brady andrew in re comm.fin,cir.but see,int l trade administration rensselaer polytechnic,cir holding that a person aggrieved has standing to appeal whether or not that person sought intervention maynard savs.bank michels in re michels,cir concluding that a creditor had standing to appeal a confirmation order even though it failed to file a timely proof of claim johnson ernst,in re ernst,recognizing that the bankruptcy act provision that originated the person aggrieved standard did not include any appearance requirement.the district court in this case reasoned in light of these cases that,because white failed to appear
