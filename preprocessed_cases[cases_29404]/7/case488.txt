opinion of the court 
this case presents the question of whether timothy laher retirement annuity is excluded from the bankruptcy estate pursuant to c.we hold that it is,and will reverse the decision of the district court and order that the case be remanded to the bankruptcy court for entry of an order excluding the annuity from the bankruptcy estate.
factual and procedural history 
while employed by gannon university,timothy laher participated in a retirement plan.contributions were taken from his paycheck and accumulated into a sum that would be used to purchase a contract that would pay him an annuity over time after retirement salary contributions and employer contributions were fixed as a percentage of the employee salary under the plan,of an employee compensation was withheld from his paychecks,and gannon contributed an amount equal to of the employee compensation.participation in the plan was mandatory.see gannon plan,app.an eligible employee is required to begin participation in the plan no later than the plan entry date following the completion of five years of service at the institution or the attainment of age,whichever occurs later.under the particular plan chosen by laher,the contributions would be used to pay for premiums on an annuity contract.the manager for his plan was,the teacher insurance and annuity retirement equities fund.offer ed fixed dollar guaranteed annuities through the teachers insurance and annuity association tiaa or several variable investment accounts through the college retirement equities fund cref.app.each premium paid for an accumulation unit in the tiaa or cref accounts,and the sum of such units would eventually provide the annuity benefits for laher 
the terms of the summary plan description informed laher that the accumulations resulting from your participation in one or more of the investment contracts or accounts offered by the fund managers such as will be the source of your retirement benefits,which can be paid out under a variety of methods available under this plan.app.you can begin to receive plan benefits only after you have retired or terminated employment with the university.app.the cref and tiaa certificates explained how the money would be managed,and each stated that the benefits would be protected from the claims of creditors to the fullest extent permissible by law.cref certificate,app.tiaa certificate,app.both stated that they were governed by new york law.
on may,laher and his wife deborah debtors filed a chapter bankruptcy petition in the western district of pennsylvania bankruptcy court.on schedule b of their petition,debtors listed the retirement account with.the account had a value of.records indicate that roughly of that amount was held in a tiaa traditional account,which guarantees the principal and a specified interest rate.app.portfolio summary.the other was held in funds listed as cref stock and cref money market.id.a pie chart in the summary stated that of laher monies was in equities,was guaranteed,and was in a money market account.id.
on september,the chapter trustee,gary skiba,filed an adversary proceeding alleging that laher annuity was property of the bankruptcy estate under either patterson shumate,d,or c because it is not a trust.skiba compl.app.section states,in relevant part 
the commencement of a case under section,or of this title uscs,or creates an estate.such estate is comprised of all the following property,wherever located and by whomever held 
except as provided in subsections b and c of this section,all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.
a emphasis added.
section c states 
except as provided in paragraph of this subsection,an interest of the debtor in property becomes property of the estate under subsection a,a,or a of this section notwithstanding any provision in an agreement,transfer instrument,or applicable nonbankruptcy law 
a that restricts or conditions transfer of such interest by the debtor or 
b that is conditioned on the insolvency or financial condition of the debtor,on the commencement of a case under this title,or on the appointment of or taking possession by a trustee in a case under this title or a custodian before such commencement,and that effects or gives an option to effect a forfeiture,modification,or termination of the debtor interest in property.
a restriction on the transfer of a beneficial interest of the debtor in a trust that is enforceable under applicable nonbankruptcy law is enforceable in a case under this title.
c emphasis added.
skiba argued that the annuity restriction on creditors access to the account did not apply to laher annuity because the annuity did not qualify as a trust under c.on april,judge bentz rejected this argument and ruled that the plan was excluded from the bankruptcy estate.in a order,judge bentz wrote that it is ordered that,in accordance with the separate opinion issued this date in the case of in re gould,bankruptcy,document related to document,the complaint is dismissed and the debtor retirement plan through is excluded from the bankruptcy estate.app.
judge bentz opinion in in re gould explained his reasoning.similar to the instant case,the case involved a debtor whose pension plan was a tax sheltered annuity plan qualified under section b of the internal revenue code,b.skiba gould in re gould.the trustee gary skiba,the same trustee as in the instant case argued that the pension plan is an annuity by definition and not a trust that only an interest in a trust can be a subject of an enforceable transfer restriction within the meaning of c and therefore,the debtor pension plan can not be excluded from the bankruptcy estate.id.at 
judge bentz began by citing c,id.at,and then took issue with the decision of the bankruptcy appellate panel in the case of in re adams,cir.bap,noting that he agreed with the dissenting opinion in that case.specifically,judge bentz believed that the adams majority erroneously read the statute literally to require a trust.id.judge bentz held that a literal trust was not required,but,rather,a plan which functioned like a trust would satisfy the trust requirement,relying on the following language of judge latta dissent in adams 
i find no functional distinction between the protections afforded to beneficiaries of pension plans in which assets are held in trust and those in which assets are used to purchase annuity contracts.outside of bankruptcy,no creditor of the adams would be able to reach the debtors beneficial interests in their pension plans to satisfy claims,and this is true not because these interests are exempt from execution pursuant to state law,but because they are exempt from execution pursuant to federal law.
id.quoting in re adams,cir.bap latta,dissenting.
judge bentz agreed 
my view is aligned with the view of the dissenting opinion in adams.i see no reason to treat a corporate pension plan differently than a b annuity pension plan.both are set up by a third party,utilize the tax vehicles provided by the internal revenue code to accumulate funds on a basis and contain clauses to prevent creditors from reaching a debtor interests in the plan.i further conclude that this broader view of c is supported by the congressional goal of protecting pension benefits.
the clause set forth in debtor pension plan sufficiently restricts debtor use of funds such that outside of bankruptcy,no creditor would be able to reach debtor interests,and therefore,the pension plan must be excluded from the bankruptcy estate by the provisions of c.
id.at citation omitted.
the trustee appealed and on august,the district court for the western district of pennsylvania reversed the decision of the bankruptcy court.the district court first stated that the lone issue before us is whether the pension plan falls within the c exception.skiba gould.it stated that the debtors,citing patterson shumate,d,urge me to affirm the bankruptcy court conclusion that any interest in an employer pension plan can be excluded from the bankruptcy estate if the plan is subject to an enforceable transfer restriction under applicable nonbankruptcy law.id.at.it noted that i n the wake of patterson,several courts have held that a broad range of retirement plans other than trusts are excludable from the bankruptcy estate as long as the instrument contains a qualifying transfer restriction provision.id.
in the district court view,however,such an approach was incorrect the third circuit has since rejected this broader inquiry,albeit implicitly.in orr yuhas in re yuhas,cir,the third circuit,interpreting patterson,announced five requirements that must be satisfied before a pension plan can be excluded from the bankruptcy estate.id.the first was that the ira must constitute a trust within the meaning of c.in re yuhas,at.accordingly,the district court concluded that only a debtor beneficial interest in a trust may be excluded from the bankruptcy estate pursuant to that subsection.skiba gould,at.in short,in light of the previously described case law and the clarity of the statutorily described language,we reject the bankruptcy court conclusion that c encompasses pension plans other than trusts.id.at.a motion for reconsideration was filed in skiba gould but it was denied.debtors timely appealed 
at the same time as the district court was rendering its decision,the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of,stat,was passed.the act made certain changes to how annuities are treated with respect to the bankruptcy estate.while c itself was not amended,a new section,b,was added.that section stated,in relevant part,that property of the estate does not include 
any amount 
a withheld by an employer from the wages of employees for payment as contributions 
i an employee benefit plan that is subject to title i of the employee retirement income security act of uscs et or under an employee benefit plan which is a governmental plan under section d of the internal revenue code of uscs d 
ii a deferred compensation plan under section of the internal revenue code of uscs or 
iii a annuity under section b of the internal revenue code of uscs b except that such amount under this subparagraph shall not constitute disposable income as defined in section b uscs b or 
ii to a health insurance plan regulated by state law whether or not subject to such title or 
b received by an employer from employees for payment as contributions 
i an employee benefit plan that is subject to title i of the employee retirement income security act of uscs et or under an employee benefit plan which is a governmental plan under section d of the internal revenue code of uscs d 
ii a deferred compensation plan under section of the internal revenue code of uscs or 
iii a annuity under section b of the internal revenue code of uscs b 
except that such amount under this subparagraph shall not constitute disposable income,as defined in section b uscs b or 
ii to a health insurance plan regulated by state law whether or not subject to such title 
b emphasis added.
collier on bankruptcy notes that u nder prior law the question of whether a debtor interest in funds held in a pension plan was frequently litigated as an issue arising under section c,the section which excludes from property of the estate funds held in trusts where under applicable nonbankruptcy law the debtor interest was inalienable.collier on edition p c footnotes omitted.collier notes that the amendments probably will eliminate much of the need for litigation about some portions of the funds held in pension and other plans,amounts withheld from wages by employers for,and amounts received by employers from employees for payment as,contributions to,enumerated types of plans.id.footnotes omitted.
discussion 
debtors argue that the annuity is treated as an express trust under new york law and should be excluded from the bankruptcy estate.they cite the contract new york state law and various court cases they argue in the alternative that even if their annuity is not a trust,that c applies to accounts tantamount to,or analogous to,trusts.
debtors argue that the district court applied an unduly restrictive reading of patterson and the word trust.they urge that supreme court has given a natural reading to c in patterson wherein the court had referred to a plan or trust,and that courts should interpret c to further congress policy of protecting retirement plans with enforceable transfer restrictions.specifically,debtors argue that the supreme court in patterson placed greater emphasis upon spendthrift trusts attributes,rather than traditional trust concepts of equitable and legal title,settlor,beneficiary,trustee,and so forth.appellants br.
debtors also argue that the aims of a and are aligned such that it does not make sense to refuse to treat annuities as trusts section b annuities are not subject to the trust requirements of a,nor does f require their treatment as qualified trusts but the transfer restrictions imposed on such annuities by g reach the same result appellants br.
they also argue that affirming the district court would jeopardize the thousands of annuities that are not before this honorable court whose recipients depend on same for their retirement.appellants br.
in response,skiba contends that c requires a trust and that the annuity at issue is not a trust an annuity creates the relationship of debtor to creditor where certain property is owed under an annuity contract under certain terms and conditions and later times it is not a trust and can not meet the requirement for exclusion under section c.this court decision in in re yuhas leaves no doubt that a trust is required.appellee br.
both sides argue that the addition of paragraph b to bolsters their position.skiba asks rhetorically,why would c ongress add this provision if exclusion were already mandated by section c,which was not changed appellee br.debtors,on the other hand,urge that it was not congress intent to change the law but to make c harmonious with what it had originally intended and was codifying how the supreme court naturally read in patterson.appellants reply br.it is further argued that the additional section was added to eliminate the ambiguity in the code section as was previously written.appellants reply br.the parties agree that the new provisions do not apply retroactively to cover the instant case.
thus,this case presents a question of statutory interpretation namely,the meaning of the term trust,in c of the bankruptcy code.as this term is not defined in the code,and its meaning is not plainly discernible from the statutory context,we will examine relevant caselaw and statutory changes in interpreting its meaning.
patterson and yuhas 
we first retrace the trajectory of how c has been interpreted by the supreme court in patterson and by our court in yuhas.
in patterson,the supreme court was faced with an issue involving c and specifically addressed the question of whether an antialienation provision contained in an pension plan constitutes a restriction on transfer enforceable under applicable nonbankruptcy law,and whether,accordingly,a debtor may exclude his interest in such a plan from the property of the bankruptcy estate.patterson,at.patterson had participated in his company pension plan,a plan which satisfied all applicable requirements of the employee retirement income security act of erisa and qualified for favorable tax treatment under the internal revenue code.in particular,article of the plan contained the antialienation provision required for qualification under d of erisa,d.id.at.
justice blackmun,writing for a unanimous court,held that t he natural reading of c entitles a debtor to exclude from property of the estate any interest in a plan or trust that contains a transfer restriction enforceable under any relevant nonbankruptcy law.id.at.emphasis added.after concluding that applicable nonbankruptcy law was not merely limited to state law,the court next addressed the issue of whether the antialienation provision contained in the plan met the requirements of c.it wrote 
section d of erisa,which states that each pension plan shall provide that benefits provided under the plan may not be assigned or alienated,d,clearly imposes a restriction on the transfer of a debtor beneficial interest in the trust.the coordinate section of the internal revenue code,a,states as a general rule that a trust shall not constitute a qualified trust under this section unless the plan of which such trust is a part provides that benefits provided under the plan may not be assigned or alienated,and thus contains similar restrictions.
the court concluded that the provisions in question satisfied c in that the pension plan complied with these requirements.id.the court did not discuss whether the pension plan at issue constituted a trust under the terms of c,and seems to have expanded the type of legal instruments protected by c by referring to any interest in a plan or trust.id.at emphasis added 
the court noted that p etitioner first contends that contemporaneous legislative materials demonstrate that c exclusion of property from the bankruptcy estate should not extend to a debtor interest in an pension plan.id.at.the court wrote that in his brief petitioner quotes from house and senate reports accompanying the bankruptcy reform act of that purportedly reflect unmistakable congressional intent to limit c exclusion to pension plans that qualify under state law as spendthrift trusts these meager excerpts reflect at best congressional intent to include state spendthrift trust law within the meaning of applicable nonbankruptcy law.id.at.
thus,patterson does not opine as to the meaning of trust,but it does employ language that could be interpreted to mean that c is not limited to literal trusts or trusts formed explicitly.curiously absent from the supreme court decision is any discussion of c trust requirement.and on occasion the court seems unaware of the requirement.in re barnes.
in yuhas we addressed the applicability of c to an individual retirement account ira formed under new jersey law,and,in deciding the case,we parsed the requirements of c set forth in patterson.at.as we stated,t he issue in this appeal is whether a new jersey statute,b,that protects a qualified individual retirement account ira from claims of creditors constitutes a restriction on the transfer of a beneficial interest of the debtor in a trust within the meaning of c and thus results in the exclusion of the ira from a bankruptcy estate.id.at.we found that if the debtor ira meets all of the requirements of c,we must hold that it is completely excluded from the bankruptcy estate.id.at.
we stated that the requirements of c were the ira must constitute a trust within the meaning of c the funds in the ira must represent the debtor beneficial interest in that trust the ira must be qualified under section of the internal revenue code the provision of stating that property held in a qualifying ira is exempt from all claims of creditors must be a restriction on the transfer of the ira funds and this restriction must be enforceable under nonbankruptcy law.id.
yuhas turned solely on prong four the parties conceded that prong one was met and thus while yuhas provides the overall framework for applying c it did not address what constituted a trust for purposes of the statute contrary to skiba position before us in this case,we did not decide in yuhas what satisfied c trust requirement.in short,neither the bankruptcy code nor our applicable federal jurisprudence specifically defines trust for the purposes of c.
the debtors urge that accordingly we should look to state,new york law.in discussing prong five of the test in the new jersey law at issue was a restriction enforceable under applicable nonbankruptcy law,c we stated that a pplicable nonbankruptcy law includes both federal law such as erisa,and state law.in re yuhas,at citation omitted.moreover,trusts are by nature created and defined by state law.see barnes,at the code does not contain a definition of the term trust.but its traditional and common meaning is neither controversial nor mysterious.in light of the inclusion of state law under applicable nonbankruptcy law and the fact that trusts are creatures of state law,we look to new york law in this case in determining whether the annuity is a trust.
b.a trust under new york law 
to create a valid trust under the law of new york state four essential elements must be proved a designated beneficiary,a designated trustee,who is not the same person as the beneficiary,a clearly identifiable res,and the delivery of the res by the settlor to the trustee with the intent of vesting legal title in the trustee.agudas chasidei chabad of gourary,cir.a trust may be created orally or in writing,and no particular form of words is necessary.id.at.with respect to those requirements,debtors claim 
gannon university is the settlor of a trust that funds its basic retirement plan through the purchase of a retirement annuity,with its employees,such as the debtor,the designated beneficiaries tiaa cref serves as the trustee by accepting premium payments that it invests within the parameters of the annuity plan the funds contributed by gannon university and its employees,including the debtor,are the trust res and gannon university delivers the contributions to to hold,invest,manage and distribute pursuant to the terms of the annuity contract.
appellants br.
the parties do not cite,and we have not found,a case by a new york court which states explicitly whether an annuity of this kind would be treated as a trust under new york law.debtors rely on alexandre chase manhattan bank,a case in which an sought recovery of the accumulated premiums paid for the purchase of the annuity contracts,or in the alternative appointment as receiver and to have the annuity immediately paid over to her.id.at.debtors cite alexandre because it held that the monies paid under the annuity contract are neither conditional nor refundable and the judgment debtor has no interest in them.id.thus,debtors imply,the annuitant interest was a trust because the annuitant had only an equitable interest in the trust estate.
despite the fact that alexandre and a subsequent case,aurora harold,misc d,fam.court did not state explicitly that annuities were spendthrift trusts,some courts have referred to those cases and new york restrictions on annuity alienability in holding that annuities are trusts for purposes of c.see,in re montgomery,alexandre and aurora do not appear to actually use the term spendthrift trust anywhere in the opinions.the substance of the decisions,however,leads the court to conclude that the new york courts considered the plans to be spendthrift trusts.
a variety of other courts have followed this approach.see,morter farm credit,cir i n every decision we could find that addressed the very pointed question whether tiaa is a spendthrift trust under new york law,the answer was a resounding yes.in re reynolds,wl,at,at this court,as did the new york courts in aurora and alexandre and the bankruptcy courts in montgomery and braden,holds that the cref certificate,because of the language in the new york statute,is a spendthrift trust.in re woodward,wl,at,at under new york law,the provisions of the documents effectively restrict the ability to transfer his interest in the accounts and also preclude the beneficiary creditors from reaching the funds.this court finds that the contracts are valid spendthrift trusts for purposes of section c.
we join these courts in holding that under new york law an retirement plan such as this one constitutes a trust.gannon has parted with the res,intending that it be held by for laher benefit.has been entrusted with the res,is managing it for laher benefit,and laher will receive the funds upon retirement.the requirements of new york law have been met here and the operation of the account as an annuity does not take the account out of the definition of a trust or c.
while skiba contends that the annuity is best understood not as a trust but as the subject of a relationship,appellee br,we find that argument unpersuasive.the fact that the relationship between laher,gannon,and can be cast,in part,as or as a contractual relationship has no bearing on the trust analysis under new york law.as noted,that analysis looks to the presence of a designated beneficiary,a trustee different from the beneficiary,a cl
