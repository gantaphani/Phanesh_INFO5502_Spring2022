this bankruptcy appeal presents the question whether a wrongful death claimant who had not yet filed suit,but whose identity as a potential claimant was known to the debtor,was a known creditor of the debtor,and thus entitled to specific notice of the bankruptcy proceeding and applicable filing dates.both the bankruptcy court and district court answered this question in the affirmative.we affirm because the claimant identity and potential claim were either actually known or reasonably ascertainable to the debtor.
the pertinent facts,which were found by the bankruptcy court,are fully supported by the record and essentially undisputed by the parties.appellee,laura tessler,is the administrator of the estate of her deceased daughter,laura elizabeth dunnagan the dunnagan estate.dunnagan died on january,as a result of injuries sustained in an automobile accident that occurred on november,in a construction zone on interstate highway in charlotte,north carolina,where rea construction company rea one of the debtors in this as the general contractor the dunnagan accident.
the dunnagan accident involved nine vehicles,some of which were engulfed in flames,including the vehicle driven by dunnagan.one of the three occupants in dunnagan evacuated from the scene by helicopter and transported to the university of north carolina unc hospital in chapel hill,where he died that evening as a result of the serious injuries and burns suffered in the dunnagan accident.dunnagan likewise suffered extensive burns over of her body and was transported to the burn unit at unc hospital.after spending days undergoing treatment in the burn unit,dunnagan,too,ultimately succumbed to her serious injuries and died on january.
rea,the general contractor for the million construction project,was aware of the dunnagan accident shortly after it occurred.specifically,kipp cheek,the rea project manager assigned to the construction project,was out of town on november,but was called by another rea employee who informed him of the dunnagan accident on the day it occurred.steven hubbard,the safety and loss control manager for rea,was also promptly notified of the dunnagan accident and traveled with another member of the rea safety department to the accident site on the evening of november,after the scene had been cleared by law enforcement.
shortly after the dunnagan accident,rea reported the incident to its liability insurer,zurich american insurance company zurich the appellant in this accordance with a policy provision requiring rea as the insured to report to zurich an occurrence or an offense which may result in a claim.joint appendix at.rea also provided notice to zurich of four or five additional vehicle accidents that had occurred in the construction zone in the week preceding the dunnagan accident.zurich promptly assigned each of the reported accidents a claim number and referred the matters to its major claims unit.tamara woolard,the zurich claims representative assigned to handle the rea accident file,hired multiple accident reconstruction experts to investigate the various vehicle accidents that had occurred in the construction zone,including the dunnagan accident.woolard also retained legal counsel to represent zurich in these matters and to create a legal privilege to shield the investigation and its results from discovery in the event of any future litigation arising out of any of the reported accidents.
cheek,the rea project manager,was personally involved on behalf of rea in investigating the reported accidents,including the dunnagan accident,and in assisting the investigation conducted by zurich counsel.to this end,cheek and others in his office and in the rea claims department obtained copies of various documents relevant to the accidents,including,in particular,the dunnagan accident.among the documents rea assembled were accident reports prepared by the state highway patrol disclosing dunnagan name,address and date of birth newspaper articles regarding the accidents press releases regarding the construction project photographs roadway diagrams project diaries project supervisor diaries and other documents concerning rea potential liability for the construction zone accidents,including specifically the dunnagan accident.cheek also prepared a timeline of critical events pertaining to the accidents.a copy of this timeline,together with approximately pages of assembled relevant documents,was sent by cheek to the rea claims department,as well as to zurich.
there was also extensive coverage of the construction zone accidents in a local newspaper,the charlotte observer,including several articles containing quotes from cheek regarding the construction project as well as a description of certain remedial measures taken by rea to reduce the risk of future vehicle accidents in the construction zone cheek was familiar with,and read these articles because he served as rea designated media contact person with respect to the construction project and rea sought to stay abreast of any stories or news reports concerning the ongoing project.one newspaper article,in particular,contained a photograph of dunnagan and reported the details of the dunnagan accident,as well dunnagan death on january.cheek cut this article out of the newspaper and kept it in his office in a location where it could readily be observed as a continuing reminder of the importance of safety in rea work.
cheek knew there was a possibility that rea could be sued as a result of the construction zone accidents,including the dunnagan accident.although he personally believed that the construction zone was safe for the driving public and that rea had done nothing wrong with respect to the accidents,he nonetheless understood that rea could still be sued.indeed,cheek testified that he anticipated a lawsuit in this instance,particularly given that two fatalities were involved.at.cheek therefore discussed the possibility of litigation arising out of the construction zone accidents with members of the rea claims department.
safety and loss control did not personally believe that rea was responsible for any of the accidents in the construction zone,including the dunnagan accident.yet,he,too,was aware of the possibility that rea might be sued as a result of the accidents.he also acknowledged that the likelihood of a lawsuit was greater where one or more deaths resulted,as occurred in the dunnagan accident.
like cheek and hubbard,zurich claims not believe that rea would ultimately be held liable for any of the construction zone accidents,including the dunnagan accident.she based this conclusion on the internal investigation conducted by zurich and its retained counsel and accident reconstruction experts.woolard nonetheless kept the claim files pertaining to this series of accidents open until march.she did so,she said,because she expected activity on these files,such as a letter of representation advising zurich of a claim against rea.at.
approximately one year after the dunnagan accident,between september and november,jones,and its various subsidiaries,including rea,filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code the bankruptcy court fixed february,as the last day for creditors to file any claims they sought to assert against the debtors estate the bar date.notice of the bankruptcy filing and the claims bar date was served on certain known creditors of the debtors,but not on the dunnagan estate.for the benefit of unknown creditors of the debtors,notice of the bankruptcy filing and the claims bar date was also published in one national and one local newspaper,specifically the wall street journal and the charlotte observer.
on june,the bankruptcy court approved the debtors second amended and restated joint chapter plan of liquidation the plan.notice of the plan confirmation hearing,scheduled for august,as well as the deadline for filing any objections to confirmation of the proposed liquidation plan,was again mailed to certain known creditors of the debtors,but not to the dunnagan estate.and again,notice of the scheduled confirmation hearing and objections filing deadline was also published in the wall street journal and the charlotte observer for the benefit of unknown creditors of the debtors.eventually,on august,the day after the scheduled confirmation hearing,the bankruptcy court confirmed the debtors liquidation plan,specifically the debtors third amended and restated joint chapter plan of liquidation.
neither appellee tessler nor counsel for the dunnagan estate saw the notices published in the wall street journal and the charlotte observer pertaining to the debtors bankruptcy proceedings at the time of publication.nor did they have actual knowledge of the debtors bankruptcy case or applicable filing deadlines until late october,well after expiration of the bar date for filing claims against the debtors and confirmation of the debtors liquidation plan.thus,on december,tessler,as administrator for the dunnagan estate,filed a motion in the bankruptcy court seeking an extension of the bar date to allow for the late filing of a claim against rea,as well as an order declaring that she was not bound by the terms of the confirmed liquidation plan,on the ground that the dunnagan estate was a known creditor of rea that did not receive actual notice of the debtors bankruptcy proceedings and applicable filing and hearing dates.on december,zurich opposed tessler motion and a series of hearings on the motion then ensued.in the course of the initial hearing on january,the bankruptcy court,with zurich consent,granted tessler relief from the automatic stay for the limited purpose of allowing tessler to initiate a wrongful death action against rea in state court prior to expiration of the applicable north carolina statute of limitations at.additional hearings on tessler motion for an extension of the bar date were held on february and october,and final arguments were heard on november.thereafter,on december,the bankruptcy court issued a final order granting tessler motion.at.specifically,the bankruptcy court december,order i authorized the late filing of a claim by tessler against rea on the ground that the dunnagan estate was a known creditor of rea who did not receive actual notice of the filing of the debtors bankruptcy petition,the bar date,the confirmation hearing date or the deadline for filing objections to confirmation of the liquidation plan,and thus was not bound by the terms of the confirmed liquidation plan,ii granted additional relief from the automatic stay to allow the dunnagan estate to pursue the wrongful death action against rea in state court,and iii declined to consider zurich potential financial obligations under the terms of its liability policies with rea with respect to the pending state wrongful death action.zurich promptly appealed the december,order to the district court,which subsequently affirmed on june.at.the instant appeal by zurich followed.

under the bankruptcy code,a debtor is generally discharged from any debt that arose prior to the bankruptcy court confirmation of the debtor proposed liquidation or reorganization plan.see d.yet,before a or claim can be discharged under the applicable provisions of the bankruptcy code,a debtor creditors must be afforded notice of the debtor bankruptcy case,as well as the deadline for asserting any claims against the debtor,so as to provide the creditors an adequate opportunity to assert any claims they may have against the debtor estate.see chemetron jones,cir.the supreme court made clear in mullane central hanover bank trust.that 
a n elementary and fundamental requirement of due process in any proceeding which is to be accorded finality is notice reasonably calculated,under all the circumstances,to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.
id.at.citations omitted.in other words,a claim asserted by a creditor against a debtor estate can not constitutionally be discharged in accordance with the bankruptcy code unless the debtor provides constitutionally adequate notice to the creditor of the debtor bankruptcy proceeding,as well as the applicable filing deadlines and hearing dates 
the type of notice that is reasonable or adequate for purposes of satisfying the due process requirement in this context depends on whether a particular creditor is known or unknown to the debtor.in this regard,to achieve a constitutionally permissible discharge of a known creditor claim against a debtor,actual notice of the bankruptcy filing and applicable bar date is required by contrast,where a creditor is unknown to the debtor,constructive in the form of generally sufficient to pass constitutional muster 
an unknown creditor,one who is not entitled to actual notice of the debtor bankruptcy filing,is a claimant whose identity or claim is wholly conjectural or whose interests or whereabouts could not with due diligence be ascertained by the debtor known creditors,in contrast,include claimants whose identities are actually known to the debtor,as well as claimants whose identities are reasonably ascertainable to the debtor.tulsa,at.see also chemetron,at.and,in this regard,the supreme court has made clear that a creditor is reasonably ascertainable if the debtor can uncover the identity of that creditor through reasonably diligent efforts.mennonite bd.of missions adams,d.in this regard,reasonable diligence by the debtor in attempting to ascertain the identity of its creditors does not require impracticable and extended searches in the name of due process.mullane,at.put differently,what is required is not a vast,investigation.chemetron,at.instead,
t he requisite search focuses on the debtor own books and records.efforts beyond a careful examination of these documents are generally not required.only those claimants who are identifiable through a diligent search are reasonably ascertainable and hence known creditors.
it is important to note that there is no rule to be applied in determining whether a particular creditor is known or unknown to a debtor for constitutional notice purposes.rather,the known creditor analysis must properly focus on the totality of the circumstances in each case indeed,as one bankruptcy court correctly summarized,
r easonable diligence in ferreting out known creditors will,of course,vary in different contexts and may depend on the nature of the property interest held by the debtor.applying mullane reasonable under the circumstances standard,due process requires a reasonable search for contingent or unmatured claims so that ascertainable creditors can receive adequate notice of the bar date.what is reasonable depends on the particular facts of each case.a debtor need not be omnipotent or clairvoyant.a debtor is obligated,however,to undertake more than a cursory review of its records and files to ascertain its known creditors.
in re drexel burnham lambert group.thus,stated succinctly,a known creditor or claim arises from facts that would alert a reasonable debtor,based on a careful examination of its own books and records,to the possibility that a claim might reasonably be filed against it by a particular individual or entity 
these principles,applied here,compel the conclusion that the bankruptcy court,and thereafter the district court,correctly determined that the dunnagan estate was a known creditor of rea at the time of the bankruptcy filing.indeed,a de novo review of the detailed findings of fact made by the bankruptcy of which are fully supported by the record,and thus not clearly that rea either actually knew or with reasonably diligent efforts could have ascertained the identity of the dunnagan estate as a creditor.see mennonite,at.the dunnagan estate was therefore entitled to actual notice of the debtors bankruptcy filing,as well as the a
