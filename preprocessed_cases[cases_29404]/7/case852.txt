ii.background 
a.the reliance judgment at issue 
the following is an abbreviated summary of the facts which gave rise to the entry of the judgment,the dischargeability vel non of which,is the subject of this appeal.
in december,felt purchased all of the issued and outstanding stock of bowie county savings and loan association bowie,in new boston,texas.bowie was a,federally insured thrift regulated by the federal home loan bank board fhlbb,the federal agency which preceded ots as the federal thrift regulator.felt borrowed nearly million for the purchase of bowie,part from texas investment bank and the remainder from american guaranty,agi,which was felt corporation.
almost immediately after acquiring bowie,felt became the president,ceo,chairman of the board,a director,and sole stockholder of the institution.felt also moved the thrift home office to houston and changed its name to reliance.based upon felt and harm to reliance through the indirect sale of two loans by agi felt company,to a subsidiary of reliance,the fhlbb enforcement office sought felt consent to entry of an order removing him as a reliance director and officer and prohibiting him from further involvement in the thrift affairs.the fhlbb also sought a consent cease and desist order against reliance itself based on regulatory violations.
though felt claims he did it just to avoid spending millions defending against the fhlbb,he consented to sell his interest in reliance,and reliance itself consented to a cease and desist order.these agreements were memorialized in a letter of agreement felt executed on august,and a related memorandum of clarification.felt specifically agreed to either sell his reliance stock within six months,subject to fhlbb approval of the transaction and offering materials,or to transfer his shares to a trustee.the fhllb agreed to keep the terms of the agreement confidential,but felt was not required to do so.
in the meantime,both reliance and agi were becoming financially distressed.reliance audited financial statements from showed a net worth of only,far below regulatory requirements.similarly,agi was insolvent by as of october.felt personally owed agi over million.
in september,as president of agi,felt wrote to several hundred agi noteholders describing agi financial health as poor.without disclosing his own personal debt to agi,the letter implied that agi could not repay the investors notes.but felt offered these noteholders an opportunity to exchange their notes for reliance stock.specifically,felt letter stated 
t o try to solve agi problems by reducing its debt i will be preparing an offering circular for my stock in reliance savings association for review by the federal home loan bank board.once the review is completed,i plan to offer you the option of exchanging your agi note for reliance savings stock.
felt included with the letter a preliminary offering circular,which portrayed reliance condition as healthy.that circular relied upon reliance unaudited financial statements and announced that as of june,reliance stakeholder equity exceeded million.the circular also noted that the exchange sale of stock would qualify for accounting treatment,so that stockholder equity in reliance would rise to million 
felt admitted that he acted as the coordinator for the offering circular and that he reviewed the preliminary circular before causing it to be sent out.however,that circular failed to disclose the following that reliance was subject to a cease and desist order that federal regulators were requiring felt to dispose of all of his stock and disassociate himself from reliance and that specialty finance company,another entity,would finance approximately of the reliance stock purchases on favorable terms.felt attorney advised him to make the fullest disclosure possible in the circular and to obtain fhlbb approval of the offering circular as a hedge against claims of failure to disclose material information or the making of misleading statements,but his lawyer never knew about the letter of agreement and memorandum of clarification requiring felt to sell and disassociate from reliance.felt claims that he did disclose these matters because of the confidentiality clause.
on september,felt attorney sent a form oc offering circular for the sale of reliance stock to the fhllb for its review and approval.fhllb legal staff responded to felt attorney that the circular was materially deficient and that it could not even be reviewed without audited financial statements with the auditors opinions.felt lawyer informed felt of the fhlbb response.felt contacted reliance outside auditors the firm of peat,marwick et and requested an opinion for the offering documents.the auditors,however,refused to be associated with the circular at all.peat marwick had been auditing reliance june consolidated financial statements and issued a report explaining that it could not opine that the statements were in accord with generally accepted accounting principles because it had not been provided adequate information from reliance.
felt continued with efforts to and did produce a final offering circular,and that circular was never submitted to the fhlbb for approval.on december,felt mailed the unapproved final offering circular to potential investors.the final circular contained a disclosure statement to highlight changes from the preliminary circular,and it informed potential investors that felt had now determined that the offering is not required to be approved by the fhlbb.felt informed the investors that audited financial reports had been prepared but were not included.felt also stated in his circular that accounting was appropriate and that reliance would have a positive capital balance of million after the sale.
on december,felt sold all shares of his reliance stock at per share.approximately agi investors exchanged their notes for about of the reliance stock.a second group of five investors paid cash,and the remaining eight investors purchased roughly of the remaining stock for no money down with financing from felt specialty finance company,which held the stock as collateral for the loans.
as promised,reliance initial financial statements after the sale reflected a net worth of million using accounting to account for the sale of the stock.peat marwick later determined that accounting was not appropriate in this case under generally accepted accounting principles because more than of the stock was financed by specialty finance,the seller entity,and thus was not at arm length.fhlbb analysts also concluded that the transaction was not at arm length because the noteholders already had a business relationship with felt and it appeared they were coerced into swapping debt for stock,and agi was an affiliate of the seller.felt conceded in his deposition that he probably knew that and that he definitely knew that a high percentage of his reliance stock had to be sold at arm length to qualify for accounting.the fhlbb ordered reliance to reverse the accounting entries thus,reliance showed a negative net worth of million.suffice it to say,reliance was never able to recover from such a huge insolvency,and in,the fhlbb placed the thrift into receivership.
in april,the fhlbb enforcement office commenced a rescission action against felt,seeking an injunction and an o
