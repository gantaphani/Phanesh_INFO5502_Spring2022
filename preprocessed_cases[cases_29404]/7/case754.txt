this bankruptcy appeal raises the novel issue of whether the use of undisclosed,bankruptcy funds to make the first premium payment on a term life insurance policy renders all or some of the policy proceeds part of the bankruptcy estate.the bankruptcy court held that the use of such funds in this case does not render the policy proceeds part of the bankruptcy estate.on appeal the district court did not address this issue.instead,the district court held that the bankruptcy trustee failed to set forth any authenticated evidence establishing the existence of undisclosed,bankruptcy funds in this case.thus,the district court affirmed the decision of the bankruptcy court,albeit on other grounds.for the reasons stated herein,we reverse the decisions of the district and bankruptcy courts and remand this matter for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
the appellant in this case is robert newhouse,trustee for the bankruptcy estate of michael mclain newhouse.the appellees are michael mclain,the debtor mclain,and his siblings,lori fuentes and gil mclain.
from january,through april,brandi mclain,the wife of michael mclain,received her paychecks by direct deposit from her employer.sometime between april,and may,the mclains cancelled direct deposit,began closing their bank accounts,and decided to operate solely on a cash basis for the admitted purpose of concealing their cash in anticipation of filing for bankruptcy.to that end,from april,through april,they withdrew by atm the sum of from their checking account and closed the account.on may,according to newhouse,brandi mclain received a paycheck in the amount of.thus,as of may,according to newhouse,the mclains had approximately cash on hand,which was not disclosed on their sworn schedules when they filed for chapter bankruptcy two days later on may.mclain disputes this factual scenario.according to him,there is no evidence that his wife received a paycheck on may.moreover,according to him,he paid his bankruptcy attorney in cash on april,as compensation for filing and handling the bankruptcy petition.accordingly,mclain maintains,there was no meaningful cash on hand at the time the bankruptcy petition was filed and thus,nothing to disclose.
on may,mclain father,gill mclain,applied for a million life insurance policy the policy naming his son,mclain,as the sole owner and beneficiary.on june,west coast life insurance wcl issued the policy.on june,the mclains appeared at their creditors meeting but did not disclose that mclain was now the owner and beneficiary of a term life insurance policy.on july,mclain paid the first premium payment on the policy in the amount of via two money orders.on august,the mclains were discharged from bankruptcy.mclain continued to make four quarterly premium payments on the policy,each in the amount of.on july,the death benefit became immediately payable upon the shooting death of his father.mclain was a suspect in his father death and thus,wcl and mclain siblings challenged his entitlement to the proceeds under the texas slayer statute.see.d.c on january,wcl filed a complaint asking the district court to accept the policy proceeds on its behalf and release it from the underlying case.the litigation between mclain and his siblings eventually settled,the terms of which are confidential.
on december,newhouse filed a motion to reopen the mclains bankruptcy case,which was officially reopened on january.at issue was whether mclain alleged use of undisclosed cash,funds that belong to the bankruptcy estate,to make the first premium payment on the policy renders the policy proceeds part of the bankruptcy estate.on november,mclain filed a motion for summary judgment,to dismiss,to close the bankruptcy case,and for the distribution of funds held by the clerk of court.in his motion,mclain argued that the first premium payment of the policy was made solely with cash from his wife paychecks,funds that did not belong to the bankruptcy estate.on december,the bankruptcy court granted summary judgment in mclain favor.the bankruptcy court agreed that there was an issue of material fact as to whether mclain used undisclosed cash to make the first premium payment on the policy.nonetheless,the bankruptcy court held that the use of such funds did not,as a matter of law,render the policy proceeds part of the bankruptcy estate.on december,newhouse filed a timely notice of appeal to the district court.
on july,the district court affirmed the decision of the bankruptcy court,albeit on other grounds.the district court reasoned that newhouse failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether mclain used undisclosed funds to make the first premium payment on the policy.specifically,the district court held that newhouse failed to set forth any authenticated evidence that the mclains had any meaningful cash on hand as of the petition date.according to the district court,the only piece of evidence to support the fact that the mclains had any meaningful cash as of that date,a disputed ledger sheet that purports to detail various financial transactions by the mclains during the months of may,june,and july of,was never authenticated as a complete financial record for these months and thus,inadmissible.thus,the district court never addressed the legal issue of whether the use of undisclosed funds to make the first premium payment on a life insurance policy renders the policy proceeds part of the bankruptcy estate.newhouse filed this timely notice of appeal.
ii.legal standard 
we review the bankruptcy court decision under the same standards as the district court conclusions of law and mixed law and fact questions are reviewed de novo,while findings of fact are reviewed for clear error.see plunk yaquinto in re plunk,cir of dallas.faulkner in re stonebridge,cir.a party is entitled to summary judgment only if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.on a motion for summary judgment,the court must view the facts in the light most favorable to the party and draw all reasonable inferences in its favor.see hockman westward commc ns,cir.in reviewing the evidence,the court must therefore refrain from making credibility determinations or weighing the evidence.turner baylor richardson med,cir.
iii.analysis 
evidentiary issue 
the district court concluded that newhouse failed to raise an issue of material fact as to whether the mclains had any meaningful cash on hand as of the petition date.in doing so,the district court held that the only piece of evidence supporting newhouse argument,a ledger sheet,was unauthenticated and thus,inadmissible.the district court agreed that there was an issue of material fact as to whether brandi mclain received a paycheck on may,two days before the mclains filed bankruptcy.nonetheless,mclain continues to maintain that there is no evidence that his wife received a paycheck on may.the evidence,however,when construed in a light most favorable to newhouse suggests otherwise.first,it is undisputed that brandi mclain was paid on a basis and according to a spreadsheet prepared by mclain himself,she was usually paid on the first and fifteenth of each month moreover,mclain specifically testified that his wife received three paychecks in may of.according to the spreadsheet,whenever brandi mclain received three paychecks in a single month,she always received the first paycheck on the first day of the month in fact,over the course of two years,she almost always received a paycheck on either the first day of the month or the day before.given this evidence,a reasonable jury could easily infer that brandi mclain received a paycheck on may,especially in the absence of any evidence to the contrary.thus,a reasonable jury could easily infer that the mclains had at least cash on hand as of may,
nonetheless,the district court concluded that because newhouse failed to provide any evidence of the mclains complete financial record between may,and the petition date,may,newhouse failed to raise an issue of material fact as to whether the mclains had any meaningful cash on hand as of the petition date.in response,newhouse points to a ledger sheet that was originally attached to mclain motion for summary judgment in the bankruptcy court.the sole issue with respect to the ledger sheet is whether it is authenticated.rule a of the federal rules of evidence provides that the requirement of authentication or identification as a condition precedent is satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.a proponent may authenticate a document with circumstantial evidence,including the document own distinctive characteristics and the circumstances surrounding its discovery.united states arce,cir quoting united states smith,cir this court has stated 
t his court does not require conclusive proof of authenticity before allowing the admission of disputed evidence rule does not limit the type of evidence allowed to authenticate a document.it merely requires some evidence which is sufficient to support a finding that the evidence in question is what its proponent claims it to be.
id.quoting united states,cir.
the district court agreed that the ledger sheet is an authenticated record with respect to the financial transactions listed on it and we agree that circumstantial evidence supports this conclusion.first,the ledger sheet was attached to mclain own motion for summary judgment,along with various other banking records.mclain does not present any additional evidence to qualify it or explain why it is inaccurate thus,it constitutes an evidentiary admission with respect to the financial transactions listed on it,though mclain remains free to controvert or explain it.see martinez bally,cir defining evidentiary admission as a statement of assertion or concession made for some independent purpose,which may be controverted or explained by the party medcom holding baxter travenol,cir holding that defendant financial statements containing information adverse to its defense does not constitute judicial admission,but does constitute evidentiary admission to be considered united states goldstein,cir financial statements can be considered as evidentiary admissions.such admissions are received as substantive evidence of the facts admitted and no foundation is mandated.mccormick on evidence,at ed see also.excluding admissions from hearsay rule.second,the ledger sheet is consistent with other pieces of admissible evidence.for example,bank records indicate that between april,and april,the mclains withdrew from their checking account in order to conceal it from the bankruptcy court.the ledger sheet begins with an entry for.the separate spreadsheet prepared by mclain and admitted as an exhibit to his deposition indicates that brandi mclain was paid on a basis generally every fifteen days.the ledger sheet indicates that brandi mclain received a paycheck on may,may,and may.third,mclain stated that his wife received three paychecks during may of.the ledger sheet confirms this fact.in fact,the ledger sheet mirrors the spreadsheet in many ways same font,same font size,same syntax,and even the same misspelling of the word billing as billling.the ledger sheet also includes a list of expenditures that is consistent with dates and amounts listed on the refutes any notion that the ledger sheet is simply a list of fabricated transactions.finally,the dates on the ledger sheet correspond precisely with the dates upon which the mclains admittedly concealed money from the bankruptcy court and decided to operate solely with cash on hand 
nonetheless,the district court concluded that there is no evidence that the ledger sheet is an authenticated record of all financial transactions between april,and july.thus,according to the district court,although a reasonable jury could infer that the mclains had at least on may,there is no authenticated evidence that they did not spend all of that money as of the petition date,may.in short,according to the district court,newhouse failed to provide any evidence to rebut the assertion that mclain and his wife had no meaningful cash as of may.
we disagree.first,the district court based its conclusion largely on the fact that the ledger sheet has less entries per month in comparison to the spreadsheet,which,according to the district court,lends doubt to its authenticity.it is true that several months on the spreadsheet have well over entries per month and yet the ledger sheet only shows entries for the month of may,entries for the month of june,and entries for the month of july.however,by the time june and july approached,the mclains were no longer existing solely with cash on hand they had since reopened their bank accounts,reactivated direct deposit,and started paying bills through their checking account.with respect to may,mclain specifically testified that he and his wife attempted to limit our expenditures and preserve our cash.these facts easily explain why the ledger sheet has less entries per month in comparison to the number of entries on the spreadsheet for other months.in short,the fact that the ledger sheet allegedly shows less activity does not conclusively establish its lack of authenticity.
second,the district court ignored the titles of the columns on the ledger sheet.the final column is entitled,running balance.according to the ledger sheet,there was an opening balance of.this is consistent with bank records that indicate that between april,through april,the mclains withdrew from their bank account.the ledger sheet next indicates that brandi mclain received her paycheck on may,for.the running balance on the ledger sheet as of that date is.the ledger sheet does not indicate any expenditures between may,and the petition date,may.the next expenditure appears on may,for,which,according to the ledger sheet,leaves a running balance of.thus,a reasonable jury could infer based on the absence of entries between may,the date brandi mclain received her paycheck,and may,the petition with the fact that the next expenditure on may,shows a running balance of the mclains had cash on hand as of the petition date,may.this evidence,when construed in a light most favorable to newhouse,purports to show what financially occurred with this particular pool of cash and rebuts mclain argument that he did not have any meaningful cash on hand as of the petition date.
in short,the ledger sheet is not just a random collection of transactions created by newhouse out of thin air it is a document filed by mclain himself as an exhibit that carefully traces a running balance of cash on hand from may through july of,the precise dates when the mclains decided to conceal funds from the bankruptcy court and operate solely in cash.moreover,the ledger sheet in many respects mirrors the spreadsheet,which was admittedly drafted by mclain to keep track of his finances and admitted into evidence.because t his court does not require conclusive proof of authenticity before allowing the admission of disputed evidence,arce,at quoting,at,we conclude that the ledger sheet is both authenticated and admissible.we also conclude that this evidence,when construed in a light most favorable to newhouse,indicates that brandi mclain received a paycheck on may,and two paychecks on may and may.thus,as of may,the mclains were commingling cash,which is part of the bankruptcy estate,with cash,which is not.see in re clark,cir stating that income is not part of the bankruptcy estate under a.mclain concedes that the first premium payment was made from this pool of cash when construing this evidence in a light most favorable to newhouse,a reasonable jury could infer that at least some portion of the first premium payment came from undisclosed funds.in fact,the ledger sheet actually has an entry for an expenditure dated july,to wlc,which is the precise date mclain made the first premium payment.thus,we conclude that the ledger sheet is authenticated and creates an issue of material fact as to whether mclain used undisclosed funds to make the first premium payment on the policy.
accordingly,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case to the bankruptcy court to determine whether undisclosed,funds were used to make the first premium payment on the policy.
bankruptcy issue 
if the bankruptcy court,upon remand,determines that undisclosed,funds were used to make the first premium payment,that court must then determine how that usage affects the outcome of this case.previously,the bankruptcy court indicated,basing its opinion on houston edgeworth matter of edgeworth,cir,and first fid.bank mcateer,cir,that such use of undisclosed,funds could not have the effect of making any of the life insurance policy proceeds part of the bankruptcy estate or of depriving mclain of relief herein we disagree.under some circumstances,the usage of undisclosed,funds could have that effect.we will discuss those circumstances,but in doing so we intimate no decision with respect to the use of funds or affect upon the insurance proceeds in this case,which initially must be decided by the bankruptcy court.
the bankruptcy estate includes all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.a.the interest of the debtor as beneficiary of a life insurance policy is distinct from his ownership interest each interest has certain rights and privileges.it is entirely within the contemplation of the statutory language that differing interests in the same property will accrue to an individual at different points in time.in re poynor,citation omitted.thus,we must analyze what interest,if any,the bankruptcy trustee acquired by virtue of the various beneficiary and ownership interests at issue.
with respect to beneficiary interests,the bankruptcy estate includes 
any interest in property that would have been property of the estate if such interest had been an interest of the debtor on the date of the filing of the petition,and that the debtor acquires or becomes entitled to acquire within days after such date as a beneficiary of a life insurance policy or of a death benefit plan.
a c.here,it is undisputed that mclain did not have a beneficiary interest in the policy as of the petition date and that the policy proceeds were not acquired until well over a year thereafter.thus,the policy proceeds did not become part of the bankruptcy estate by virtue of mclain beneficiary interest under section a c.also,because the policy was acquired,the proceeds could not become part of the bankruptcy estate by virtue of mclain ownership interest under section a.see in re ballard,section a excepts from the estate all or almost all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property obtained or received,by including in the estate all legal and equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.see also in re clark,at stating that income is not part of the bankruptcy estate under a.
however,our inquiry does not end there.the bankruptcy estate also includes p roceeds,product,offspring,rents,or profits of or from property of the estate.a.this generous provision sweeps into the bankruptcy estate all interests held by the future,contingent,speculative,and derivative interests.in re dibiase.congress intended this provision to be quite broad,not limited to the definition of proceeds set forth in the uniform commercial code,but encompassing any conversion in the form of property of the estate,and anything of value generated by property of the estate.in re hanley,quoting,at,at,as reprinted in.the bankruptcy estate also includes a ny interest in property that the estate acquires after the commencement of the case.a.congress enacted a to clarify its intention that be an definition and to ensure that property interests created with or by property of the estate are themselves property of the estate.in re hanley,at quoting cong.rec.daily ed,statements of edwards cong.rec.daily ed,statements of deconcini.thus,by virtue of these two provisions,if undisclosed funds,property of the bankruptcy estate,were used to generate some type of property interest,that subsequent property interest is part of the bankruptcy estate and reachable by mclain creditors.
state law governs the question of whether the use of funds to make the first payment on a term life insurance policy creates some type of property interest on the part of the bankruptcy estate.see travelers cas.sur.of am,d internal quotations and citation omitted indeed,we have long recognized that the basic federal rule in bankruptcy is that state law governs the substance of claims,congress having generally left the determination of property rights in the assets of a bankrupt estate to state law.see also peoples state bank ge capital in re timber,cir in re louisiana world exposition,at in re dibiase.
texas law,which is applicable in this case,follows the majority of jurisdictions in holding that a person who wrongfully uses stolen or fraudulently obtained funds to purchase an insurance policy shall hold that policy and its proceeds in trust for the benefit of the one from whom the funds were stolen or taken.marineau american life ins,see also paschal great drilling.this may be true even where a statute protects the proceeds of insurance policies from actions by creditors.id.at.thus,under texas law,the use of funds wrongfully obtained to make premium payments on an insurance policy creates a property interest in the proceeds of that policy on behalf of the owner of the funds wrongfully obtained.brown lee,t he right to receive insurance proceeds payable at a future but uncertain date is property.see also marineau,at.
in marineau,the court also adopted the holding of the oklahoma supreme court that the owner of the funds wrongfully obtained is entitled to a pro rata share of the life insurance policy proceeds where the wrongfully acquired funds were partially used to pay the premiums.id.at citing g m motor thompson.the test relied upon by the oklahoma supreme court and adopted in marineau is derived from section of the restatement on restitution,which states 
where a person wrongfully mingles money of another with money of his own and with the mingled fund acquires property,the other is entitled to an equitable lien upon the property to secure his claim for reimbursement.
if the wrongdoer knew that he was acting wrongfully,the other is entitled at his option to a share of the property in such proportion as his money bore to the whole amount of the fund.
restatement of the law restitution.the drafters of this provision and an analogous provision explained the rationale behind this rule 
where a person by the consciously wrongful disposition of the property of another acquires other property,the person whose property is so used is not only entitled to hold the wrongdoer personally liable for the value of the property wrongfully disposed of but he is entitled as an alternative to the property so acquired.if the property so acquired is or becomes more valuable than the property used in acquiring it,the profit thus made by the wrongdoer can not be retained by him the person whose property was used in making the profit is entitled to it.the result,it is true,is that the claimant obtains more than the amount of which he was deprived,more than restitution for his loss he is put in a better position than that in which he would have been if no wrong had been done to him.nevertheless,since the profit is made from his property,it is just that he should have the profit rather than that the wrongdoer should keep it.it is true that if there had been a loss instead of a profit,the wrongdoer would have had to bear the loss,since the wrongdoer would be personally liable to the claimant for the value of the claimant property wrongfully used by the wrongdoer.if,however,the wrongdoer were permitted to keep the profit,there would be an incentive to wrongdoing,which is removed if he is compelled to surrender the profit.the rule which compels the wrongdoer to bear any losses and to surrender any profits operates as a deterrent upon the wrongful disposition of the property of others.accordingly,the person whose property is wrongfully used in acquiring other property can by a proceeding in equity reach the other property and compel the wrongdoer to convey it to him.th
