background 
middlebrook was president and owner of federal telecom,a telecommunications products manufacturer that operated out of hebron,illinois.middlebrook resided in florida and conducted his federal telecom work from home.
during his tenure at federal telecom,middlebrook took personal loans from the company.over time,middlebrook repaid portions of these loans,but he also took out additional loans from the company.that debt was reflected on federal telecom financial documents in various ways,including shareholder note receivable,officers shareholders,notes receivable,stockholders,and officer notes.as late as june,the debt was listed as a asset on a federal telecom financial statement.middlebrook also listed that debt as a liability on his personal financial statements,and he paid interest on the debt to federal telecom.middlebrook personal financial statement as of march,stated he had a net worth of after taking into account his liability for the shareholder note.
on august,federal telecom filed for chapter bankruptcy protection in the northern district of illinois,western division.on motion of its largest creditor,the bankruptcy court converted federal telecom chapter reorganization to a chapter liquidation on october.
on october,federal telecom filed in bankruptcy court its original schedules of assets and liabilities and its statement of financial affairs.middlebrook verified these documents under penalty of perjury.yet neither the schedules nor the statement of financial affairs listed any information about the debt that middlebrook owed to federal telecom.
a bankruptcy hearing took place on october.middlebrook swore at that hearing that he had prepared the schedules of assets and liabilities and the statement of financial affairs that were filed in the bankruptcy case.at the hearing,middlebrook was questioned extensively about the shareholder note receivable.he denied he owed anything to federal telecom.he asserted that the receivables were,in fact,shareholder equity but were listed as assets because they represented deferred income.middlebrook asserted that his handling of the shareholder note receivable had been consistent with the advice of federal telecom accountants.he further asserted that the accountants had told him that he could retire the loans either by repayment to federal telecom or by reporting the loan amount as income on his tax return.he indicated he would be reporting the amount of the federal telecom shareholder note receivable on his income tax return,but he never did so.
question on the statement of financial affairs required federal telecom to list all withdrawals or distributions credited or given to an insider,including compensation in any form,bonuses,loans,stock redemptions,options exercised and any other perquisite during the one year immediately preceding the commencement of this case.as to middlebrook,federal telecom answer stated that he had received in distributions during the twelve months preceding the bankruptcy filing.in fact,the financial records of federal telecom show that federal telecom distributed about to middlebrook during that period.
in early,middlebrook received a transfer of as a refund on an insurance premium that federal telecom had prepaid.rather than turning these funds over to the bankruptcy trustee,middlebrook deposited them in his own account.he made this transfer to himself despite having twice testified in bankruptcy proceedings that he expected the refund to go to federal telecom.
on april,the chapter bankruptcy trustee filed an adversary action against middlebrook,his wife,and federal telecom.the basis for the proceeding was to avoid fraudulent transfers and to obtain a judgment for indebtedness.the trustee obtained a default judgment for.that figure represented the amount of the note and the amount of distributions that middlebrook disclosed.the judgment did not include the roughly of additional distributions that middlebrook concealed by omitting them from the statement of financial affairs.the bankruptcy trustee made no recovery on the judgment.
federal prosecutors subsequently brought a criminal case against middlebrook.they originally charged middlebrook with ten counts relating to bankruptcy fraud.on defendant motion,the district court consolidated the case into seven counts four counts of bankruptcy fraud,two in violation of and two in violation of one count of making a false declaration in bankruptcy in violation of one count of making a false oath in bankruptcy in violation of and one count of fraudulent concealment of property in violation of.the case went to trial on september.the jury found middlebrook guilty on all seven counts.
the case proceeded to sentencing.the report psr concluded that middlebrook total offense level was.the base offense level was.section b b required a level upward adjustment because the offense occurred in a bankruptcy proceeding.the psr included another level upward adjustment under b b because there were or more victims the creditors.finally,the psr included an enhancement of levels for the approximately million loss comprised of the unpaid note and the excessive distributions under b i.since middlebrook had no criminal history,his sentencing range would be to months.the government recommended the same loss amount in restitution.the psr also indicated that,at that time,middlebrook had a negative net worth in excess of million.
prior to middlebrook december,sentencing,he objected to the psr sentencing and restitution recommendations.middlebrook argued that,for sentencing purposes,the loss amount should not include the amount of the shareholder note because he had not sought to discharge the shareholder note in federal telecom bankruptcy.he cited united states mutuc,cir and united states holland,cir to argue that in the seventh circuit the proper loss calculation in bankruptcy fraud cases is the amount of the debt that the defendant sought to discharge in bankruptcy.mutuc,at.middlebrook argued that the proper loss amount was more than but less than million.with that loss amount,a level enhancement would be appropriate rather than the level enhancement recommended in the psr,for an adjusted total offense level of.that calculation would reduce the advisory sentencing range.
middlebrook objection to the psr also included a request for a downward variance from the advisory sentencing range.he sought a sentence of months.he argued that he deserved this downward variance because his goal of reorganizing federal telecom through chapter was laudable,and because he lacked a criminal history and represented a low risk for recidivism.
at sentencing,the district court heard middlebrook arguments,but it decided to include the amount of the note with the undisclosed executive compensation in making the guideline calculations.the district court described the amount of the note as the harm that middlebrook intended by his of the note.the district court agreed with the offense level calculations in the psr and determined that the offense level was and the guideline range was to months.but the district court expressed a belief that the loss was not as great a factor as it could have been 
s imilar sentences ought to be imposed for defendants convicted of similar offenses with similar criminal histories.financial crimes,on the other hand are pretty diverse.and so,looking at the loss,which is really what generates the greater amount of points here,and try to impose a uniform sentence,it just is as great a factor
