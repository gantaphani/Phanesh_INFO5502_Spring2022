the principal issue on this appeal is whether a debtor who has received a claim on a debt that has been discharged in a bankruptcy proceeding can sue the claimant in a district court under the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa or must seek relief in the bankruptcy court.the issue arises on an appeal by plaintiff appellant donna garfield from the january,judgment of the united states district court for the western district of new york elizabeth wolford,district judge,in favor of defendant appellee ocwen loan servicing,llc ocwen.the judgment dismissed garfield complaint alleging various causes of action under the fdcpa.
we conclude that garfield may pursue her fdcpa claims in a district court and therefore reverse and remand.
background 
the complaint alleges the following facts,which are assumed to be true on this appeal from dismissal for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted.see bell atlantic twombly.garfield obtained a mortgage from ocwen,litton loan servicing and became personally obligated on a mortgage loan.garfield failed to make payments on the mortgage loan and filed for chapter bankruptcy in the united states bankruptcy court for the western district of new york.during the bankruptcy proceedings,ocwen acquired garfield mortgage loan.
under her bankruptcy plan,garfield paid the arrears on her mortgage loan through monthly payments made during the bankruptcy proceeding.critical to the pending appeal,in august she obtained a discharge of her entire personal obligation for the mortgage loan however,garfield agreed to pay per month to prevent foreclosure of the mortgaged property 
garfield concedes that she made only one monthly payment after her bankruptcy discharge and that by march the arrears on her monthly obligation totaled.in february ocwen contacted garfield and demanded that she pay or face foreclosure on her home.ocwen sent a delinquency notice in april for.these amounts reflected both garfield conceded arrears for monthly payments and the mortgage loan arrears that had been discharged.ocwen also reported to equifax that garfield owed the discharged amount.
in july,garfield filed her fdcpa complaint against ocwen in the united states district court for the western district of new york.she alleged that ocwen attempt to collect the arrears on her mortgage loan,which had been discharged violated several provisions of the fdcpa,u,and a.
garfield also alleged that ocwen violated the fdcpa in the manner it attempted to collect the monthly mortgage payments that she concedes she owes.specifically,she alleges that ocwen violated subsection,which requires a warning,during conversations with a debtor,and that ocwen failed to send within five days of its initial communications a day notice of a debtor right to dispute a debt,as required by subsection a.
the district court dismissed garfield complaint.the court held that the bankruptcy code provides the exclusive remedy for garfield claim that ocwen attempted to collect an allegedly discharged debt the court also stated that,even if the code does not broadly preclude all fdcpa claims for conduct that violates the discharge injunction,garfield particular fdcpa claims conflict with the code remedies and were therefore precluded.
discussion 
implied repeal of all fdcpa provisions invoked for claims after discharge 
the district court held that the bankruptcy code precludes all claims under the fdcpa for conduct that violates a discharge injunction.acknowledging garfield argument that the supreme court should only rarely infer statutory repeal,the district court ruled that many of plaintiff allegations directly conflict with the bankruptcy code discharge injunction provisions.
when it is claimed that a later enacted statute creates an irreconcilable conflict with an earlier statute,the question is whether the later statute,by implication,has repealed all or,more typically,part of the earlier statute.see national ass of home builders defenders of wildlife.repeal by implication is disfavored.in the absence of some affirmative showing of an intention to repeal,the only permissible justification for a repeal by implication is when the earlier and later statutes are irreconcilable.morton mancari.
where,as in this case,the later statute is the bankruptcy code a distinction must be made between claims brought under the earlier statute during the pendency of a bankruptcy proceeding and those brought after a discharge.four circuits have considered fdcpa claims brought during the pendency of a bankruptcy proceeding.
our court has ruled that the fdcpa does not authorize suit during the pendency of bankruptcy proceedings.see simmons roundup funding,llc,cir.this ruling appears to construe fdcpa provisions to be inapplicable when invoked for claims made during bankruptcy,rather than determine that such provisions have been impliedly repealed by the provision of the bankruptcy code authorizing a discharge injunction.see id.at.our court opinion does not include the word repeal.
in simmons,the debtors,while engaged in a bankruptcy proceeding,objected to the amount of a creditor proof of claim,which the bankruptcy court reduced.the debtors then brought a putative class action,contending that the creditor filing of an inflated proof of claim violated the fdcpa.see id.the creditor moved to dismiss,arguing that the bankruptcy code exclusively provides whatever remedies exist for filing an inflated proof of claim.see id.
affirming dismissal of the complaint,we said,the fdcpa is designed to protect defenseless debtors and t here is no need to protect debtors who are already under the protection of the bankruptcy court.id.at emphasis added.noting that some courts had broadly rejected all fdcpa claims even claims filed after discharge predicated on acts alleged to have violated the bankruptcy code,we observed that t his broader rule has not been universally accepted,and we are not compelled to consider it in this case.id.at citation omitted 
the ninth circuit has ruled that the bankruptcy code precludes fdcpa claims brought during the pendency of bankruptcy proceedings.see walls wells fargo bank,cir.this court,like the district court in the pending appeal,appears to have said precludes fdcpa claims to reflect that the fdcpa provisions invoked for such claims have been repealed by implication with respect to conduct that violates the discharge injunction.
two circuits have ruled to the contrary.in randolph imbs,cir,the debtors brought fdcpa claims against creditors for seeking to collect debts in violation of the automatic stay.the creditors asserted that the bankruptcy code remedies for violations of the automatic stay,see.h now k,precluded relief under the fdcpa.
the seventh circuit acknowledged that there were some operational differences between the statutes,but stated that these differences constituted overlap between the statutes rather than irreconcilable conflict,id.at,and that o verlapping statutes do not repeal one another by implication,id.at.the bankruptcy code of does not work an implied repeal of the fdcpa,any more than the latter act implicitly repeals itself.id.at.
judge easterbrook helpfully assembled a chart comparing the statutes differing treatment of conduct that violates both the automatic stay and the fdcpa 
the seventh circuit concluded,it is easy to enforce both statutes,and any debt collector can comply with both simultaneously.id.
the third circuit has also ruled against implied repeal of fdcpa provisions invoked for claims brought during the pendency of bankruptcy proceedings,see simon fia card services,cir,concluding that the bankruptcy code effected no broad preclusion of fdcpa claims,id.at.
the pending appeal concerns fdcpa claims brought after discharge,the context we explicitly distinguished in simmons.now facing the issue of implied repeal of fdcpa provisions invoked for claims in the context,we conclude that the bankruptcy code does not broadly repeal the fdcpa for purposes of fdcpa claims based on conduct that would constitute alleged violations of the discharge injunction.no irreconcilable conflict exists between the remedies of the bankruptcy code and
