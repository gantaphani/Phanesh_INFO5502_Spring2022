ann miles,melinda miles,and kelly cunningham collectively appellants appeal from a decision of the united states bankruptcy appellate panel of the ninth circuit bap affirming the removal and dismissal of their state law causes of action for damages resulting from the filing of involuntary bankruptcy petitions against their relatives.we hold that because i completely preempts state law tort causes of action for damages predicated upon the filing of an involuntary bankruptcy petition,the bankruptcy court had arising under jurisdiction over the proceedings,and thus did not err in denying appellants motions to remand.further,because appellants lack standing to seek damages under i,the bankruptcy court properly dismissed their complaints.
background 
david okun,sheila,and several entities owned by or affiliated with the okuns filed ten involuntary bankruptcy petitions against rodney miles,ann miles,and related businesses owned by or affiliated with the miles.the bankruptcy court dismissed rodney case on the ground that he was generally paying his undisputed debts as they became due.it dismissed the remaining nine involuntary bankruptcy cases,including the one filed against ann,on multiple grounds,one of which was that the petitions were filed in bad faith the bankruptcy court retained jurisdiction to determine the alleged debtors rights to attorneys fees,costs,and damages under i.
after the bankruptcy court dismissed the involuntary bankruptcy cases,ann and the miles daughters,melinda miles and kelly cunningham,filed three substantially identical tort actions in california state court seeking damages for the filing and prosecution of the involuntary petitions.the complaints alleged state law causes of action for negligence,defamation,false light,abuse of process,intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress,and negligent misrepresentation.no appellant sought damages arising from an involuntary petition filed against her.rather,each appellant sought damages arising solely from an involuntary petition filed against one or two of her relatives.the causes of action asserted by melinda and kelly were based on the bankruptcy court finding that the involuntary petition against their mother,ann,was filed in bad faith,and the bankruptcy court dismissal of the involuntary petition against their father,rodney,on the basis that he was generally paying his undisputed debts as they became due.the causes of action asserted by ann were based solely on the bankruptcy court dismissal of the involuntary petition against her husband,rodney.the named defendants included the petitioning creditors in the involuntary bankruptcy actions,their lawyers,and the law firm paralegals and secretaries who worked on the cases collectively appellees.
appellees removed the three actions from state court to bankruptcy court pursuant to a.they then filed motions to dismiss the removed complaints,contending that federal law preempted all of the state law causes of action pleaded in the complaints.while these motions were pending,appellants moved for remand under b on the premises that the removal was untimely and that there was no federal jurisdiction over damages claims by third parties resulting from the filing of an involuntary bankruptcy petition.
the bankruptcy court refused to remand the state law causes of action,holding that it had arising under jurisdiction over those causes of action because they were completely preempted by i.it then dismissed the complaints on the basis that i does not authorize damages for third parties who claim to be harmed by the filing of an involuntary bankruptcy petition.the bap affirmed the reasoning and ultimate decision of the bankruptcy court in a published opinion,miles okun in re miles,cir,and this appeal ensued.because appeals from the bap are subject to de novo review,we independently review the bankruptcy court decision.liberty tool,vortex fishing,in re vortex fishing,cir.
removal jurisdiction 
appellants challenge the bankruptcy court exercise of removal jurisdiction.to analyze this issue,we must determine whether jurisdiction over appellants state law tort actions existed in the district court to support the bankruptcy court derivative jurisdiction.see dunmore united states,cir.
jurisdiction was premised on a,which provides for removal of a state action to the district court for the district where such civil action is pending,if such district court has jurisdiction of such claim or cause of action under section of this title.a.section b,in turn,provides that the district courts shall have original but not exclusive jurisdiction of all civil proceedings arising under title,or arising in or related to cases under title.b.
the bankruptcy court and the bap held that because i completely preempts state law tort actions for damages resulting from the filing of an involuntary bankruptcy petition,appellants complaints necessarily arise under title,and thus were removable under a.see in re miles,at.appellants contend that their claims are not preempted and that,in any event,removal based on complete preemption was improper.we review de novo the denial of a motion to remand an action to state court for want of removal jurisdiction.young anthony fish grottos,cir.
general principles of arising under jurisdiction 
the arising under language of b is analogous to the arising under language of.see new england power marine,town of tyngsborough in re middlesex power equip.marine,cir collier on bankruptcy c i king et,ed.therefore,we draw freely from authorities discussing the circumstances under which a case arises under federal law within the meaning of.see hunter united van lines,cir,cert.denied,d.
in general,a cause of action arises under federal law only when the plaintiff complaint raises issues of federal law.metro.life ins.taylor,d.a defense is not part of a plaintiff properly pleaded statement of his claim.see gully first bank in meridian.therefore,a case may not be removed to federal court on the basis of a federal defense,including the defense of,even if the defense is anticipated in the plaintiff complaint,and even if both parties concede that the federal defense is the only question truly at issue.caterpillar williams,d emphasis in original see also franchise tax bd.constr.laborers vacation trust,d.
the complete preemption doctrine provides an exception to this general proposition.the supreme court has concluded that the preemptive force of some federal statutes is so strong that they completely preempt an area of state law.taylor,at.in such instances,any claim purportedly based on that preempted state law is considered,from its inception,a federal claim,and therefore arises under federal law.balcorta twentieth film,cir.
the supreme court has construed only three federal statutes to so preempt their respective fields as to authorize removal of actions seeking relief exclusively under state law section of the labor and management relations act lmra,section of the employee retirement income security act of erisa,and sections and of the national bank act.see avco machinists,d taylor,at.beneficial bank anderson,d.most recently,in beneficial national bank,the court clarified that removal is proper under the complete preemption doctrine only when congress intended the federal cause of action to be exclusive.beneficial bank,at.finding that sections and of the national bank act provided the exclusive cause of action for usury claims against national banks,the court held that the plaintiffs cause of action arose under federal law,and therefore could be removed to federal court.id.at.
appellants properly pleaded complaints allege only california state law causes of action and seek relief exclusively under those laws.therefore,the dispositive question is whether congress intended i to provide the exclusive cause of action for damages resulting from the filing of an involuntary bankruptcy petition.see id.at.see also lippitt raymond james fin,cir analyzing whether plaintiff state law cause of action was completely preempted by section of the securities and exchange act.if so,then appellants causes of action necessarily arise under title,and their claims are removable under a.if not,then appellants complaints do not arise under title and are not removable under a pursuant to the arising under provision of b.
congress intent with respect to i 
the bankruptcy code and its legislative history are silent on whether congress intended i to provide the exclusive basis for awarding damages predicated upon the filing of an involuntary bankruptcy petition.therefore,we look to the structure and purpose of the bankruptcy code to determine whether congress did indeed intend for i to provide the exclusive cause of action.see air conditioning refrigeration inst.energy res.conservation dev.comm n,cir.although we have not addressed this precise issue,we have previously held that state law malicious prosecution actions are completely preempted by the structure and purpose of the bankruptcy code.see msr exploration,meridian oil,cir.
in msr exploration,plaintiffs brought a state law action for malicious prosecution against defendants in federal district court,claiming that the defendants had maliciously filed and pursued creditors claims in the plaintiffs chapter bankruptcy proceeding.id.at.the district court dismissed for lack of jurisdiction,finding the action completely preempted by the bankruptcy code.id.we agreed that state malicious prosecution actions for events taking place within bankruptcy court proceedings are completely preempted by the bankruptcy code.id.at.our reasoning was based on congress placement of bankruptcy jurisdiction exclusively in the federal district courts as an initial matter,id.at the complex,detailed,and comprehensive provisions of the lengthy bankruptcy code,which create a whole system under federal control which is designed to bring together and adjust all of the rights and duties of creditors and embarrassed debtors alike,and which needs to be jealously guard ed from even slight incursions and disruptions from state malicious prosecution actions,id.at the founders grant of power to congress to establish uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies throughout the united states,art.i,cl,for the purpose of uniform administration and regulation of the parties before the bankruptcy court and the extensive federal remedies for improper conduct in bankruptcy proceedings provided by the bankruptcy code,which suggests that congress has considered the need to deter misuse of the process and has not merely overlooked the creation of additional deterrents.msr exploration,at.
we are compelled by the logic of our decision in msr exploration to hold that congress intended i to provide the exclusive basis for awarding damages predicated upon the filing of an involuntary bankruptcy petition.see id.at see also gonzales parks,cir holding that state courts lack jurisdiction over a claim that the filing of a bankruptcy petition constitutes an abuse of process.as we noted in msr exploration,congress provided a number of remedies in the bankruptcy code to deter misuse of the bankruptcy process,including i.see msr exploration,at.the revision notes and legislative reports to the bankruptcy reform act of indicate that congress utilized both the bonding requirements of e and the damages provision of i as means of regulating abuse of the involuntary bankruptcy process it created 
the court may,under subsection e,require the petitioners to file a bond to indemnify the debtor for such amounts as the court may later allow under subsection i.subsection i provides for costs,attorneys fees,and damages in certain circumstances.the bonding requirement will discourage frivolous petitions as well as spiteful petitions based on a desire to embarrass the debtor who may be a competitor of a petitioning creditor or to put the debtor out of business without good cause.an involuntary petition may put a debtor out of business even if it is without foundation and is later dismissed.
historical and statutory notes,revision notes and legislative reports,acts.moreover,as the bap noted,i remedial scheme is comprehensive in that it specifically addresses the full range of remedies,from costs and attorneys fees for dismissed involuntary petitions to compensatory and punitive damages for involuntary petitions filed in bad faith.see i.
congress authorization of certain sanctions under i for involuntary bankruptcy petitions filed in bad faith suggests that congress rejected other penalties,including the kind of substantial damage awards that might be available in state court tort actions.see gonzales,at.a debtor who believes an involuntary petition was filed in bad faith has a comprehensive scheme of remedies available in the federal courts.the existence of this comprehensive scheme precludes collateral attacks on such filings in state courts.glannon garrett.
furthermore,as a policy matter,the potential costs of filing an involuntary bankruptcy petition should not be governed by state law.i t is for congress and the federal courts,not the state courts,to decide what incentives and penalties are appropriate for use in connection with the bankruptcy process and when those incentives and penalties shall be utilized.gonzales,at.congress created involuntary bankruptcy proceedings to enable creditors who are unable to extract preferences or unequal transfers from distressed debtors to achieve equitable treatment.see in re miles,at.allowing state court remedies for wrongful filings may well interfere with the filings of involuntary bankruptcy petitions by creditors and with other necessary actions that they,and others,must or might take within the confines of the bankruptcy process.see msr exploration,at.
finally,here,as in msr exploration,the threat exists that the exclusive jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court will be invaded and that uniformity will be undercut.congress has expressed its intent that bankruptcy matters be handled in a federal forum by placing bankruptcy jurisdiction exclusively in the district courts as an initial matter.id.at citing a.furthermore,the need for uniformity in the administration of the bankruptcy laws persuaded the framers to expressly grant congress the power to establish uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies throughout the united states.art.i,cl.permitting state courts to decide whether the filing of an involuntary bankruptcy petition was appropriate would subvert the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts and undermine uniformity in bankruptcy law by allowing state courts to create their own standards as to when a creditor may properly file an involuntary petition.see msr exploration,at.
therefore,we hold that i provides the exclusive cause of action for damages predicated upon the filing of an involuntary bankruptcy petition.the highly complex nature of the bankruptcy code,id.at,and the unique,historical,and even constitutional need for uniformity in the administration of bankruptcy laws,id.at,undermine the argument that we can infer from congress failure to create a federal remedy for third parties that it intended to allow such parties to pursue state court litigation as a form of collateral attack on involuntary bankruptcy proceedings.when congress enacted the comprehensive bankruptcy reform act of after a debate,it could not have gone unrecognized that debtors immediate family members might also suffer the same types of harm or emotional distress as their family members who are subject to involuntary bankruptcy proceedings.yet congress determined that bankruptcy courts could award damages predicated on the bad faith filing of involuntary petitions only to the debtors participants in involuntary bankruptcy proceedings who suffer most directly the harm from frivolous or spiteful filings.the relevant senate and house reports state 
i f a petitioning creditor filed the petition in bad faith,the court may award the debtor any damages proximately caused by the filing of the petition.these damages may include such items as loss of business during and after the pendency of the case,and so on.
