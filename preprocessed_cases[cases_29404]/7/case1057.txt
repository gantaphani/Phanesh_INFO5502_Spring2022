this case involves an all too common occurrence that bankruptcy courts must deal with a buyer defaults on his car payments,a secured creditor seizes the asset,the buyer files for chapter bankruptcy,and the big question that ensues is whether the creditor must return the car to the bankruptcy estate.in this case,we are asked to consider a procedural conflict between many bankruptcy courts within this circuit,and those in the sixth,eighth,ninth,and tenth circuits.
we must decide whether an asset that a secured creditor lawfully seizes must be returned to the buyer estate after he files for chapter bankruptcy,and,if so,whether the creditor must immediately return the asset even in the absence of a showing that the debtor can adequately protect the creditor interest in the asset.in the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of illinois,it has been an accepted standard procedure for a creditor to retain possession of a seized asset until the creditor subjectively determines that the debtor has shown the creditor that it can provide adequate protection of the creditor interests.if a dispute ensues,it is the debtor obligation to litigate the adequate protection issue in turnover proceedings before the bankruptcy court.in the sixth,eighth,ninth,and tenth circuits,the procedure is just the opposite.upon the debtor filing for chapter,the creditor must immediately return the asset to the bankruptcy estate,and,if the debtor and creditor can not achieve accord on the issue of adequate protection,it is the creditor obligation to file a motion before the bankruptcy court.
here,a creditor refused to relinquish possession of an asset because it felt that the debtor could not adequately protect its interests.the debtor claimed that this refusal violated the bankruptcy code stay provisions and moved for sanctions against the creditor.the bankruptcy court denied this motion.because we find that a plain reading of the bankruptcy code provisions,the supreme court decision in united states whiting pools,d,and various practical considerations require that a creditor immediately return a seized asset in which a debtor has an equity interest to the debtor estate upon his filing of chapter bankruptcy,we reverse.
background 
on april,theodore thompson entered into an installment contract with general motors acceptance corporation gmac for the purchase of a chevy impala.thompson defaulted on his installment payments,and,on january,gmac repossessed the vehicle.
on february,thompson filed for chapter bankruptcy in the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of illinois.needing his car to commute to work,on february,thompson requested that gmac return the vehicle to his bankruptcy estate.when gmac refused to return the vehicle to the estate absent what it deemed adequate protection of its interests,thompson moved for sanctions pursuant to k,claiming that gmac willfully violated the automatic stay provision in a.
the bankruptcy court denied the motion for sanctions because it found the in re nash,and in re spears,decisions,which held that a creditor need not return seized property to a debtor estate absent adequate protection of its interests,dispositive on the issue.thompson sought direct appeal.
the bankruptcy court certified this case as one appropriate for direct appeal under d b i.on june,we found that it met the statutory requirements and accepted the appeal.as a result,we have jurisdiction under d a 
ii.analysis 
introduction 
we review a bankruptcy court underlying factual findings for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.union planters bank,na connors,cir.a debtor is entitled to actual damages and attorneys fees if he is injured by any willful violation of a stay provided by this section committed by a creditor.k.under the bankruptcy code stay provision,no creditor may commit any act to obtain possession of property of the estate or of property from the estate or to exercise control over property of the estate after a debtor has filed for bankruptcy.a emphasis added.in order to determine whether gmac violated section a,we must resolve two questions.first,we must determine whether gmac exercised control over property belonging to thompson bankruptcy estate simply because it refused to return it to the estate after thompson filed for bankruptcy.if so,we must decide whether gmac,or a creditor,is required to return the asset prior to the bankruptcy court establishing that the debtor can provide adequate protection of the creditor interest in the asset.
gmac exercised control over thompson vehicle 
there is no debate that thompson has an equitable interest in the chevy,and,as such,it is property of his bankruptcy estate.see united states whiting pools,d section a defines the estate as comprised of all the following property,wherever located all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.although these statutes could be read to limit the estate to those interests of the debtor in property at the time of the filing of the petition,we view them as a definition of what is included in the estate,rather than as a limitation.gmac contends,however,that it did not exercise control over the chevy within the meaning of a.rather,gmac argues that it passively held the asset and that further action,such as selling the car,is required to satisfy the code definition of exercising control over the asset.in support of this proposition,gmac relies solely on in re spears,which simply reiterates the rationale expressed in in re young.these courts find that a creditor that retains possession of a lawfully seized vehicle does not take any action instead,these courts reason that the creditor simply maintains the status quo creditor in possession of the asset,which is the purpose of the code automatic stay provision.they hold that the code restricts only obtaining possession of the property,rather than the passive act of simply continuing to possess it.in re young,at.
this interpretation is at odds with the plain meaning of exercising control.webster dictionary defines control as,among other things,to exercise restraining or directing influence over or to have power over.collegiate dictionary ed.holding onto an asset,refusing to return it,and otherwise prohibiting a debtor beneficial use of an asset all fit within this definition,as well as within the commonsense meaning of the word.
moreover,to hold that exercising control over an asset encompasses only selling or otherwise destroying the asset would not be logical given the central purpose of reorganization bankruptcy.the primary goal of reorganization bankruptcy is to group all of the debtor property together in his estate such that he may rehabilitate his credit and pay off his debts this necessarily extends to all property,even property lawfully seized.see whiting pools,at.see also in re yates,cir.bap as a practical matter,there is little difference between a creditor who obtains property of the estate before bankruptcy is filed,or after bankruptcy is filed.the ultimate result is the estate will be deprived of possession of that property.this is precisely the result seeks to avoid.an asset actively used by a debtor serves a greater purpose to both the debtor and his creditors than an asset sitting idle on a creditor lot.
further,congress decision to amend section evinces its intent to expand the prohibited conduct beyond mere possession.prior to,the code stay provision only prohibited any act to obtain possession of property belonging to a bankruptcy estate.subsequently,congress amended section a when it passed the bankruptcy amendments and federal judgeship act of to include as prohibited conduct exercising control over any asset belonging to the bankruptcy estate,stat.although congress did not provide an explanation of that amendment,in re young,at,the mere fact that congress expanded the provision to prohibit conduct above and beyond obtaining possession of an asset suggests that it intended to include conduct by creditors who seized an asset.see in re del mission,cir in re javens,cir.in fact,one court has gone as far as saying that w ithholding possession of property from a bankruptcy estate is the essence of exercising control over possession because it prevents the debtor from achieving beneficial use of the estate property.in re sharon,cir.bap.
for these reasons,we find that the act of passively holding onto an asset constitutes exercising control over it,and such action violates section a of the bankruptcy code.accord in re yates,at in re sharon,at in re abrams,cir.bap in re knaus,cir.here,gmac exercised control over thompson vehicle when it refused to return it to the bankruptcy estate upon request.
c.the issue of adequate protection does not stay a creditor obligation to return the seized asset to the bankruptcy estate 
there is no debate that a debtor must provide a secured creditor with adequate protection of its interests in the seized asset if the creditor requests such protection.under e,on request of an entity that has an interest in property used,sold,or leased,or proposed to be used,sold,or leased,by the trustee,the court,with or without a hearing,shall prohibit or condition such use,sale,or lease as is necessary to provide adequate protection of the creditor interest.the issue in controversy is whether the creditor must return the asset to the bankruptcy estate and then seek adequate protection in court or,whether the creditor may retain possession of the asset placing the onus on the debtor to bring an action for turnover before the bankruptcy court in a separately filed adversary proceeding 
the majority of district courts in illinois,as well as several district courts in other jurisdictions,have followed the precedent set forth in in re nash,and in re spears,which hold that a creditor need not return seized property to a debtor estate absent adequate protection of its interests.these decisions reason that requiring immediate turnover would force the creditor into an untenable to turn over an asset in which the creditor has an interest without being adequately assured that its value will be retained.they further reason that since the purpose of the bankruptcy code stay provision is to maintain the status quo,the car should be kept by the party that had possession immediately prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition.
although our circuit has not ruled on this issue,several circuits have held that the creditor must first return the asset to the bankruptcy estate and then move to have its interests adequately protected.see in re yates,at in re sharon,at in re abrams,in re knaus.
a plain reading of e and a,the supreme court decision in whiting pools,d,and a myriad of policy considerations,support our sister circuits view.at oral argument,gmac argued that all a creditor must do to comply with the stay provision is place the adequate protection issue before the bankruptcy court.gmac is correct that it has the burden of requesting adequate protection for its interest either directly under e or by moving for relief from the stay under d see in re yates,at in re sharon,at.however,if a creditor is allowed to retain possession,then this burden is rendered creditor has no incentive to seek protection of an asset of which it already has possession.thus,in order for the language of e to have meaning,congress must have intended for the asset to be returned to the bankruptcy estate before the creditor seeks protection of its interest.
a reading of a also indicates that turnover of a seized asset is compulsory.this provision states that a creditor in possession of an asset belonging to the bankruptcy estate shall deliver to the trustee,and account for,such property or the value of such property,unless such property is of inconsequential value or benefit to the estate.a emphasis added.the majority of appellate courts have found that section a works with the stay provision in section a to draw back into the estate a right of possession that is claimed by a lien creditor pursuant to a seizure the code then substitutes adequate protection for possession as one of the lien creditor rights in the bankruptcy case.in re sharon,at.the right of possession is incident to the automatic stay.a subjectively perceived lack of adequate protection is not an exception to the stay provision and does not defeat this right.id.at.instead,section d works in tandem with a to provide creditors with what amounts to an affirmative defense to the automatic stay.in re yates,at.first,the creditor must return the asset to the bankruptcy estate.then,if the debtor fails to show that he can adequately protect the creditor interest,the bankruptcy court is empowered to condition the right of the estate to keep possession of the asset on the provision of certain specified adequate protections to the creditor see see also in re colortran,cir.bap a creditor who requires possession in order to achieve or maintain perfection has the right to file a motion for relief from the stay and request adequate protection such that its lien rights are preserved.however,the creditor must tender the goods or face sanctions for violation of the stay.the creditor has a right to and may request terms of adequate protection while simultaneously returning the goods.however,while the creditor may suggest terms of adequate protection,it may not unilaterally condition the return of the property on its own determination of adequate protection,rev on other grounds,cir.
the supreme court,in whiting pools,d,adopted this interpretation of section a in the context of a chapter corporate reorganization bankruptcy.in whiting pools,a debtor corporation asked the court to determine whether the,which had seized some of the debtor assets prior to its bankruptcy filing,was subject to the stay provisions of section a.id.at.the supreme court unanimously held that the is subject to these provisions.id.at.
the court further held,after analyzing the relevant legislative history,that section a requires an entity other than a custodian holding any property of the debtor that the trustee can use under to turn that property over to the trustee.id.at.the court stated that when a creditor seizes property before a debtor files for chapter,the creditor lien does not dissolve nor is its status as a secured creditor destroyed.id.a creditor is entitled to adequate protection for its interests,but it is required to seek protection of these interests according to congressionally established bankruptcy procedures rather than by withholding seized property from a debtor efforts to reorganize.id.a creditor must look to section e for protection rather than to the nonbankruptcy remedy of possession.id.at.
gmac only argument against whiting pools direct applicability to this case is that,in a footnote,the court commented that it was not expressing an opinion as to how section a functioned in chapter or proceedings.id.at.section a also governs turnovers in liquidation and individual adjustment of debt proceedings under chapters and of the bankruptcy code.our analysis in this case depends in part on the reorganization context in which the turnover order is sought.we express no view on the issue whether a has the same broad effect in liquidation or adjustment of debt proceedings.citations omitted.our sister circuits have resoundly rejected gmac argument and found that whiting pools analysis applies equally to chapter cases.see,in re yates,at although the court specifically narrowed the holding of whiting pools to govern only chapter cases,we see no reason why it should not apply with equal force to proceedings under another rehabilitation chapter,chapter.we agree.the principle behind chapter and chapter is the the debtor to reorganize and repay the majority of his debts without having to liquidate his assets.the need to retain the beneficial use of productive assets to effectuate this purpose is the same in each case.gmac fails to proffer any reason why section a does or should function differently under chapter than it does under chapter.
the contrary view,most vociferously expressed in in re young,focuses on the decades old code procedure,which the young court said required that a debtor obtain an order of the court and some proof of adequate protection by the deb
