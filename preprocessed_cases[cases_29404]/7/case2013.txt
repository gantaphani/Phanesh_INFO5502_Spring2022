this appeal requires us,as a matter of first impression in this circuit,to resolve two related issues under b,a bankruptcy code provision that entitles oversecured creditors to reasonable attorney fees,as part of their allowed secured claim,if the fees were provided for in the loan contract under which the claim arose.the first issue concerns whether the bankruptcy court should apply the b reasonableness standard to contractually set attorney fees that vest and that are enforceable under state law.if b does so apply,the second issue concerns whether a claim for fees should be bifurcated between secured and unsecured claims based on the amount of fees deemed reasonable,or whether collection of such fees should be limited to an amount considered reasonable,with the balance disallowed.the district court ruled that b applies to attorney fees that vest and that are enforceable under state law.the court rejected the bifurcation framework and held that fees deemed unreasonable under b should be disallowed.we agree with the district court that b is applicable,but we conclude that bifurcation is the correct result.we therefore affirm in part and reverse in part.
background 
darby bank and trust company loaned over million to daniel welzel.to effectuate the loan,welzel executed several promissory notes that were secured by mortgages on properties he owned in the historic district of savannah,georgia.in the event of default,each note provided that subject to any limits under applicable law,the lender would be entitled to its costs of collection,including fifteen percent of the principal plus accrued interest as attorneys fees.exh.advocate realty investments,llc later purchased these notes.shortly before this purchase,darby bank notified welzel in writing that his indebtedness was in default and that,as a result,the notes were immediately due and payable.in the written notice,darby bank also informed welzel of its intention to invoke the attorney fees provisions contained in the notes in accordance with.section provides that from the date of such written notice,a debtor has ten days to pay the principal and interest due without incurring liability for the contractually set attorney fees.welzel did not pay the principal and interest within the ten day period.upon expiration of the ten days,welzel filed a petition for chapter relief,which subsequently was converted into a chapter liquidation.
after welzel filed for relief,advocate filed a secured claim for.the claim included in contractually set attorney fees,which represented an amount equal to of principal plus accrued interest,as stipulated to in the notes.approximately of these fees were actually incurred by advocate.although advocate had complied with with regard to the fees,the bankruptcy code,b,provides that an oversecured creditor is entitled to reasonable attorney fees as part of its allowed secured claim if the underlying loan contract provides for such fees.it is undisputed that advocate is an oversecured creditor and that the in attorney fees were provided for in the notes.welzel did dispute the inclusion of the contractually set attorney fees as part of advocate secured claim because,he argued,the fees were unreasonable under b.
in response to welzel objection to advocate filed claim,the bankruptcy court addressed the relationship between and b.the court found that,by virtue of,advocate claim for contractually set attorney fees had vested and was an allowed claim under.the court ruled,however,that the fees were subject to the reasonableness standard contained in b.fees determined to be reasonable under b would be treated as a secured claim,the court concluded,with the balance of fees treated as an unsecured claim under.the fees thus would be bifurcated into secured and unsecured portions.
both parties appealed the bankruptcy court order to district court,and the appeals were consolidated.in reviewing the order,the district court agreed that advocate contractually set attorney fees were subject to the b reasonableness standard.in contrast,the court disagreed with the bankruptcy court ruling that the fees should be bifurcated into a secured claim for the portion of fees deemed reasonable and an unsecured claim for the portion deemed unreasonable.reversing the bankruptcy court,the district court held that the portion of contractual attorney fees found unreasonable under b were not to be treated as unsecured claims under,but were to be disallowed entirely.
advocate then appealed,and a panel of our court,concluding that b applied to the attorney fees and that any fees deemed unreasonable should be disallowed,affirmed the district court decision.welzel advocate realty investments,llc in re welzel,cir.on advocate request for rehearing en banc,we voted to rehear the case and vacated the panel decision.welzel advocate realty investments,llc in re welzel,cir 
throughout this litigation,advocate position has been that because its contractually set attorney fees vested prior to welzel filing his petition,the fees merged into its allowed secured claim on the savannah properties and are allowed for that reason.as such,advocate contends that the reasonableness standard of b does not apply to fees that vest.advocate instead argues that b is meant to widen creditor protections by permitting a creditor to collect contractually set attorney fees deemed reasonable by the bankruptcy court,even if such fees arise or are unenforceable under state law.
alternatively,advocate has argued that if b is held to apply to contractually set attorney fees that vest,its claim should be bifurcated such that any portion of fees deemed reasonable constitutes part of its secured claim under b,with the balance treated as an unsecured claim under.advocate contention is that b,at most,addresses whether a claim should be treated as secured or unsecured,while determines whether a claim should be allowed or disallowed.because its claim for fees is allowable under,advocate asserts that,even under the worst case scenario,it is entitled to any portion of fees considered unreasonable as an unsecured claim.
in contrast,welzel position throughout this case has been that b completely preempts state laws like.welzel contends that b requires that the bankruptcy court subject all contractually set attorney fees owed to an oversecured of whether they vest pre or or whether they are enforceable under state the reasonableness standard.he further argues that b limits the collection of fees to those deemed reasonable,with any portion of fees deemed unreasonable disallowed.that is,welzel asserts that bifurcation between and b is unwarranted because addresses allowability in general,while as b addresses allowability in the particular context of contractually set attorney fees.equitable considerations,he elaborates,also support this reading of b.consequently,welzel asserts that the district court properly decided the b issue and that the panel decision correctly affirmed.
ii.discussion 
in reviewing the contentions of the parties,we note that,because only issues of law are contested,we review de novo the district court conclusions concerning b.charles hall motors,lewis in re lewis,cir.we first address in section whether the b reasonableness standard applies to advocate claim for attorney fees,which vested and are enforceable under state law.concluding that b does apply,we turn in section to whether the bankruptcy court should bifurcate a claim for fees between secured and unsecured claims under b and according to the reasonableness of the fees,or whether the court should limit the collection of fees to those that are reasonable,with the balance disallowed.
applicability of the b reasonableness standard to advocate claim for attorney fees 
historically,the amount and validity of claims made in bankruptcy proceedings were determined through reference to state law.see mills east side investors in re east side investors,cir per curiam.in,congress passed the bankruptcy reform act,thereby altering the traditional relation between federal and state law in bankruptcy proceedings.the provision of the act at issue here,now codified at b,provides 
to the extent that an allowed secured claim is secured by property the value of which is greater than the amount of such claim,there shall be allowed to the holder of such claim,interest on such claim,and any reasonable fees,costs,or charges provided for under the agreement under which such claim arose.
with regard to this provision,welzel concedes that advocate has an allowed secured claim based on its promissory notes collateralized by the savannah properties.he also acknowledges that advocate is an oversecured creditor and that the attorney fees arrangement was stipulated to in the loan contracts.the point at issue concerns whether the bankruptcy court must determine if advocate contractually set fees constitute reasonable fees under b,or whether advocate automatically has a right to the entire fees because they vested and were enforceable under state law,here 
our interpretation of the bankruptcy code must begin with its plain language.yates,old kings interchange,in re yates,cir.in interpreting a bankruptcy code section,we turn to the natural meaning of the terms employed therein except in the rare circumstance where to do so would produce an absurd result.id.we turn now to the language of b,which is not ambiguous.
section b clearly articulates that the attorney fees arrangement must be spelled out in the loan contract between debtor and oversecured creditor,but the subsection does not draw a distinction between fees vested pre or,as advocate would have us conclude.instead,the subsection refers blanketly to reasonable fees,without differentiation based on the time the fees vested.nor does the language of b indicate that just because a given fee arrangement is enforceable under state law,it should be exempt from the reasonableness standard.the literal language refers to whether the loan contract specifies the attorney fees arrangement,not to whether the arrangement is enforceable under state law.
furthermore,congress has shown that when it wants to exempt a particular set of items from the reasonableness standard,it does so explicitly.with regard to interest payments on oversecured claims,b conspicuously leaves out the adjective reasonable,in contrast to the explicit reference to reasonable fees,costs or charges.this indicates that congress,by using reasonable with respect to one set of items but not another,acted purposefully in deciding whether to include or exclude the reasonableness standard.russello united states,d citation omitted w here congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposefully in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.had congress intended to exclude a particular set of contractual attorney fees from the reasonableness the fees either had vested or were enforceable under state laws like would have spelled this out.accordingly,we conclude that in the oversecured creditor context,b applies a reasonableness standard to all contractually set attorney fees.
our conclusion based on the plain language of b is buttressed by several additional factors.first,state statutes like focus on the enforceability of contractually set attorney fees.b,in contrast,focuses on the reasonableness of such fees.enforceability and reasonableness are not the same fee is not necessarily reasonable just because it is enforceable.see joseph sanson inv.in re,cir.therefore,even if contractually set attorney fees owed to oversecured creditors are enforceable under state law because they are vested and comply with state notice procedures,it does not follow that the fees are per se reasonable under the bankruptcy code.this demonstrates,in turn,that b adds a new level of scrutiny to fee arrangements that goes beyond state law requirements.
second,when congress intended for state law to control in the bankruptcy context,it said so with candor.see patterson shumate,d discussing bankruptcy code provisions in which congress explicitly referenced state law.but d makes no such reference to state law.this further suggests that had congress intended for state law to control whether b comes into play,it would have articulated this intent explicitly in the subsection.
third,although only persuasive in nature,the four circuits that have addressed the relation between state law and b following the passage of the act have concluded that the plain language of that subsection requires that contractually set attorney fees be assessed for reasonableness,irrespective of their status under state law.see first bank trust drewes in re schriock,cir trust hudson shipbuilders,in re hudson shipbuilders,cir in re,cir unsecured creditors comm.walter heller,in re stephenson supply,cir.such consistent conclusions among the circuits indicates that our statutory interpretation of b does not stray from the mark.
fourth and finally,we note that our interpretation of the b statutory language accords with the legislative history surrounding the provision.other circuits have undertaken an exhaustive review of both the legislative history and the evolution in statutory language of b,which,for the sake of brevity,we do not reproduce here.see in re,at in re stephenson supply,at.based on our own review of that history,we are convinced that it evidences a congressional intent for b to preempt state laws like such that all contractually set attorney fees owed to an oversecured creditor now must be assessed for reasonableness.
despite all of these factors in support of our position,we do recognize that in in re east side investors,we held that compliance with georgia contractual attorney fees provision entitled a secured creditor to treat the fees as part of the principal indebtedness.at east side investors would seem to suggest that b is not applicable to the present case.both parties agree that was complied with here.based on this compliance,advocate has argued that east side investors indicates that by the time welzel filed his petition,advocate contractually set attorney fees already had dissolved into the principal indebtedness related to the savannah properties.in essence,advocate contends that b had no bearing because under east side investors,there were no longer any fees separate from the principal that could be assessed for reasonableness as of the filing date.east side investors,however,applied the law as it stood prior to passage of the bankruptcy reform act of,of which b was a part.given that act changed the legal landscape,east side investors no longer constitutes binding precedent.furthermore,as we have explained,the plain language of b blanketly applies the reasonableness standard to contractually set attorney fees,irrespective of how state law might treat such fees.section b,then,displaces east side investors.
for the foregoing reasons,we conclude,as did the district court and the panel,that congress intended for contractually set attorney fees in the oversecured creditor context to be governed by b,even if otherwise vested and enforceable under state laws like.we therefore rule that the contractually set attorney fees owed to advocate must be assessed for reasonableness under b.
effect of on the allowability of advocate claim 
having determined that the b reasonableness standard applies to the attorney fees owed to advocate,we now address whether the bankruptcy court should bifurcate a claim for fees between secured and unsecured claims under b and based on the reasonableness of the fees,or whether the court should limit the collection of fees to those that are reasonable,with the portion deemed unreasonable disallowed.the district court rejected the bifurcation approach and ruled that unreasonable fees should be disallowed,and the panel affirmed.the language and structure of and b,however,lead us to conclude that bifurcation is the proper approach.in addition,we conclude that,despite welzel assertions to the contrary,equitable considerations do not supply a rationale for rejecting the bifurcation result.
the language and structure of and b 
we begin with the basic language and structure of the bankruptcy code regarding the allowance or disallowance of cl
