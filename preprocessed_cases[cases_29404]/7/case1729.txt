in this appeal,we consider whether a chapter bankruptcy plan may provide for dividing a loan into secured and unsecured claims,commonly referred to as lien stripping,with the debtor satisfying the secured claim beyond the life of the chapter plan.we conclude that this type of plan is not permitted under chapter of the bankruptcy code,and we affirm the judgment of the district court.
in,ikechukwu and uzoamaka enewally filed a joint voluntary petition for chapter bankruptcy and an accompanying chapter plan.in their schedules,the enewallys listed a fee interest in three properties their residence in norwalk,california,and two rental properties in long beach,california.the property at issue in this case is located at andy street in long beach the andy property.the enewallys bankruptcy schedules stated that the andy property had a value of,encumbered by a first deed of trust held by washington mutual bank bank.thus,according to the bankruptcy schedules,of the enewallys debt to the bank was unsecured.
under the debtors initial and first amended chapter plans,the bank was to receive regular payments pursuant to the loan terms.prior to confirmation of their amended chapter plan,the debtors filed an adversary complaint against the bank seeking a judgment valuing the andy property at.the complaint also sought to bifurcate the loan into secured and unsecured claims pursuant to a,b,with of the bank debt deemed unsecured.before entering judgment on the adversary complaint,the bankruptcy court confirmed the amended plan.
in the adversary proceeding,the debtors sought to maintain the contractual monthly payments on the reduced secured balance with interest,while disposing of the unsecured balance through their confirmed chapter plan.to achieve that end,the debtors filed a motion to modify the confirmed plan.the motion sought to insert a provision advising creditors of the proposed loan modifications asserted in the adversary proceeding.the motion also explicitly noted that no financial changes to the confirmed plan were desired.the bankruptcy court granted the enewallys motion to modify their chapter plan on the condition that they prevailed in the adversary proceeding.
the debtors filed a motion for summary judgment in the adversary proceeding,supported by an affidavit signed by ikechukwu enewally expressing his opinion that the fair market value of the andy property was.no other evidence was tendered to the bankruptcy court on valuation by any party.
after holding three hearings,the bankruptcy court granted summary judgment to the debtors.the bankruptcy court valued the andy property at because it was the stipulated value of the property.the court required the debtors to make monthly payments on the secured portion of the loan,pursuant to the original loan terms,and to pay of the unsecured claim throughout the life of the plan,the remainder to be discharged upon successful completion of the chapter plan.final judgment was entered,and the bank timely appealed to the district court.the district court reversed the determination that the debtors could repay the bifurcated loan over a term in excess of five years,holding that the bankruptcy court opinion was inconsistent with nobelman am.sav.bank,d.the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court valuation of the andy property at,based on the undisputed valuation affidavit.the debtors timely appealed the judgment of the district court,and the bank timely.
the bankruptcy reform act of bankruptcy code,stat,effected important changes in the treatment of secured creditors in bankruptcy proceedings.one of the most significant changes,codified in,describes how secured status is to be determined.this section effectively abolishes the use of the terms secured creditor and unsecured creditor and substitutes in their places the terms secured claim and unsecured claim,sess.at reprinted in under the bankruptcy code,a secured loan may be separated into two distinct claims a secured claim for an amount equal to the value of the security,and an unsecured claim for the difference,if any,between the amount of the loan and the value of the security.as the supreme court explained in dewsnup timm,d,one possible interpretation is that 
under a,a claim is secured only to the extent of the judicially determined value of the real property on which the lien is fixed,a debtor can void a lien on the property pursuant to d to the extent the claim is no longer secured and thus is not an allowed secured claim.in other words,a bifurcates classes of claims allowed under into secured claims and unsecured claims any portion of an allowed claim deemed to be unsecured under a is not an allowed secured claim within the scope of d.
indeed,a number of courts have acknowledged that the plain language of d indicates that an undersecured lien is void to the extent that it exceeds the value of the collateral.see,crain psb lending in re crain.however,the supreme court in dewsnup held that a lien was not void to the extent that the loan was undersecured,but rather the lien securing the entire amount of the loan survived a chapter bankruptcy undisturbed.the court explained stating 
therefore,we hold that d does not allow petitioner to strip down respondents lien,because respondents claim is secured by a lien and has been fully allowed pursuant to.
thus,after dewsnup,courts have refused to allow lien stripping in chapter cases.see,talbert city mortgage servs.in re talbert,cir ryan homecomings fin.network,cir collier on bankruptcy b at lawrence king et,ed.however,the extent to which lien stripping would be allowed under other chapters of the bankruptcy code remained an open question after dewsnup,as the fifth circuit explained 
the rationales advanced in the dewsnup opinion for prohibiting lien stripping in chapter bankruptcies,however,have little relevance in the context of rehabilitative bankruptcy proceedings under chapters,and,where lien stripping is expressly and broadly permitted,subject only to very minor qualifications.the legislative history of the code makes clear that lien stripping is permitted in the reorganization chapters.

lien stripping can occur in a number of different ways under the bankruptcy code thus,each circumstance must be separately examined in its own statutory context.for example,following dewsnup,a number of circuit the use of lien stripping in residential loans in chapter cases.see bellamy federal home loan mortgage in re bellamy,cir lomas mortgage usa wiese,cir.however,the supreme court rejected this approach in nobelman am.sav.bank,d,holding that b prohibits a chapter debtor from relying on a to reduce an undersecured homestead mortgage to the fair market value of the mortgaged residence.id.at.
this appeal requires us to consider the question in a slightly different context from the one at issue in nobelman.specifically,the question in this case is whether a chapter debtor may bifurcate a secured real estate loan under a,but maintain payments on the claim pursuant to b beyond the life of a chapter plan as circumscribed by d in a very thorough and scholarly opinion,the bankruptcy court in this case concluded that the bankruptcy code allowed the debtor to do so.the bankruptcy court explained that 
a chapter plan may treat a secured debt under two statutory alternatives.first,the plan may modify the rights of a holder of a secured claim pursuant to b.second,the plan may cure any default and maintain payments on the secured claim pursuant to b.
as to lien stripping under b,the bankruptcy court noted that the debtors in this case propose to do precisely what the supreme court disallowed in nobelman however,the bankruptcy court distinguished nobelman,reasoning that,because of the special treatment given by congress to primary residences,nobelman applies only where the collateral is exclusively the debtor principal residence.thus,the bankruptcy court concluded that the andy property was not protected by the antimodification exception in b.
