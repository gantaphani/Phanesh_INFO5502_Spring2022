the bankruptcy trustee of southern air transport,sat,a debtor in a chapter proceeding,seeks to recover a payment made to defendant triad international maintenance corporation timco as an avoidable preference under the bankruptcy code.b.timco advances two theories in response that it was a fully secured creditor at the time of the payment alternatively,that the payment represented a contemporaneous exchange for new value,an exception to the usual rule prohibiting transfers of interest in the debtor property made within days of the filing of the bankruptcy petition.c.
the bankruptcy court ruled in favor of the trustee in bankruptcy,and the district court affirmed.because we hold that the trustee in bankruptcy failed to meet his burden of proving the elements necessary to establish that the payment to timco was preferential,and thus avoidable under b,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case to the bankruptcy court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

preliminary mattersstandard of review 
we review the bankruptcy court decision directly,according no deference to the district court.the bankruptcy court findings of fact are reviewed for clear error,and questions of law are reviewed de novo.in re,at citations omitted.
the statutory framework 
sections b and a of the bankruptcy code provide that the bankruptcy trustee may recover the value of property transferred by the debtor to a creditor within days before the date of the filing of the bankruptcy petition if certain conditions are met.of central importance to this appeal is the provision that the disputed transfer is avoidable if the creditor receives more than it would have received had no transfer been made,and the case had been filed under chapter of the bankruptcy code.b.this avoidance provision is designed to accomplish proportionate distribution of the debtor assets among its creditors,and therefore to prevent a transfer to one creditor that would diminish the estate of the debtor that otherwise would be available for distribution to all.in re shelton harrison chevrolet,cir quoting in re nucorp energy,cir.

t he relevant determinations that remain for this court are whether the last element of the avoidable preference set forth under section b has been met,whether the transfer enabled timco to receive more than timco would received if a debtor bankruptcy case were a proceeding under chapter of the bankruptcy code,b the transfer had not been made,and c timco received payment of such debt to the extent provided by the bankruptcy code and whether timco release of its purported and asserted statutory lien rights against the aircraft constitute new value for purposes of section c.
in re southern air,slip op.at.
as it does before this court,timco took the position below that it was a fully secured creditor at the time of the payment by virtue of an artisan lien against the aircraft.because north carolina,the state in which the work was performed,does not require a formal written filing to perfect such a lien,timco asserts that it need not have filed notice of its interest in the aircraft with the federal aviation administration faa,which maintains a national registry in oklahoma city of encumbrances against aircraft.as summarized by the bankruptcy court,sat countered by noting that it did not own the aircraft,but was a mere lessee arguing that an artisan lien can not attach to a leasehold interest and contending that notice of a lien must be fil
