in david stinnett was diagnosed as suffering from depression and as a result has been collecting substantial monthly benefits from two different policies of disability insurance.in,and again in,the internal revenue service made assessments against stinnett for unpaid federal income taxes.in may stinnett filed for bankruptcy under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code,and a dispute soon erupted between stinnett,the bankruptcy trustee,and the irs as to entitlement to the disability insurance payments.in several appeals taken from rulings by the bankruptcy court,the district court concluded that the disability payments are property of the bankruptcy estate,that the government tax lien attached to these payments,and that stinnett is entitled to an exemption of per month under indiana law.stinnett has filed two separate appeals from the orders of the district court,which we have consolidated for decision.we agree with the district court conclusion that the disability payments are property of the bankruptcy estate and also that stinnett is entitled to exempt only of the disability payments.because the disability payments are property of the bankruptcy estate,stinnett lacks standing to raise the tax lien issue on appeal.
background 
david stinnett worked for northwestern mutual life insurance company northwestern for years and was covered by disability insurance issued by that company.in stinnett employment with northwestern was terminated.shortly thereafter,on november,he commenced employment as a salesman for guardian life insurance guardian.at that time,he became covered by a policy of disability insurance issued by guardian.in september stinnett sought treatment for and was diagnosed as suffering from depression.he applied for benefits under the northwestern disability insurance and began receiving monthly payments of approximately from northwestern beginning in september.
despite receiving these payments from northwestern,stinnett continued his employment and received a salary from guardian for approximately the next five years.he did not seek disability benefits under the guardian policy during this period because he was financially better off remaining an employee and receiving a salary.
during the period stinnett was employed by guardian,the irs made two assessments for unpaid income tax relating to the and tax years when the assessments went unpaid,the irs filed notices of federal tax liens regarding these liabilities pursuant to on may,stinnett filed a petition in bankruptcy court under chapter.four days later he stopped working for guardian.the irs filed a proof of claim with the bankruptcy court for stinnett unpaid federal income tax liability.
in july,over a year after his employment ceased and his bankruptcy petition was filed,stinnett submitted a disability claim to guardian seeking benefits retroactive to september,apparently the date he was deemed disabled by depression for purposes of the northwestern policy.guardian denied his claim for the period during which he had been receiving a salary from the company,relying on a provision in the policy providing that an insured is not entitled to benefits for any day of disability during which the employee performs work for remuneration or profit guardian did,however,honor stinnett claim going forward from the date of his termination of employment.in october guardian granted stinnett disability benefits of approximately per month,backdated to june,the date on which he ceased receiving a salary from guardian.accordingly,since october stinnett has been receiving payments from both northwestern and guardian in a combined monthly total of approximately.
in the course of the bankruptcy action,the trustee commenced an adversary proceeding seeking to establish that the guardian disability payments were assets includable in the bankruptcy estate and that the payments should consequently be turned over to the trustee.the irs intervened,seeking to establish that its federal tax lien attached to the payments.in the main bankruptcy case,stinnett and the trustee litigated the extent to which stinnett was entitled to an exemption from the bankruptcy estate for the disability payments from both guardian and northwestern.
on appeal of several orders of the bankruptcy court,the district court held that the bankruptcy court properly concluded that the guardian disability payments are property of the bankruptcy estate,despite the fact that stinnett did not begin receiving them until after his bankruptcy petition was filed the government tax lien attached to these payments because the timing of their receipt prepetition or postpetition was within stinnett control and the bankruptcy court properly concluded that stinnett was entitled to exempt per month of his combined disability,as he the bankruptcy estate under indiana law.
ii.discussion 
property of the bankruptcy estate 
the threshold issue is whether the guardian disability payments,for which stinnett did not file a claim until after the petition was filed,are includable as property of the bankruptcy estate.the applicable statutory definition provides in pertinent part that property of the estate includes all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case,plus p roceeds or profits of or from property of the estate,except such as are earnings from services performed by an individual debtor after the commencement of the case,and a ny interest in property that the estate acquires after the commencement of the case.a.
as a general matter,insurance contracts in which the debtor has an interest at the time the petition is filed constitute property of the estate for purposes of a.home ins.cooper cooper,cir a policy of insurance is an asset of the bankruptcy estate see also am.bankers ins.maness,cir d ebtors insurance policies clearly constitute interests under a of the bankruptcy code.robins piccinin,cir ford motor credit stevens in re stevens,cir houston edgeworth in re edgeworth,cir courts are generally in agreement that an insurance policy will be considered property of the estate.
further,payments from insurance policies in which the debtor had a prepetition interest,to the extent that the debtor has or would have a right to receive and keep those payments when the insurer paid on a claim,are proceeds of estate property and thus also property of the estate.in re edgeworth,at am.bankers ins,at in re stevens,at.as explained by the fifth circuit 
the overriding question when determining whether insurance proceeds are property of the estate is whether the debtor would have a right to receive and keep those proceeds when the insurer paid on a claim.when a payment by the insurer can not inure to the debtor pecuniary benefit,then that payment should neither enhance nor decrease the bankruptcy estate.in other words,when the debtor has no legally cognizable claim to the insurance proceeds,those proceeds are not property of the estate.
proceeds of such insurance policies,if made payable to the debtor rather than a third party such as a creditor,are property of the estate and may inure to all bankruptcy creditors.
in re edgeworth,at footnotes omitted.therefore,because stinnett held a prepetition interest in the guardian policy,and also had the right to receive and keep the proceeds of the policy at the time the insurer paid on the claim,the guardian payments are property of the bankruptcy estate under a.
on appeal,stinnett does not raise a serious objection to this analysis and instead argues that his disability payments should fall within the exception contained in a,which provides that earnings from services performed by an individual debtor after the commencement of the case are not property of the bankruptcy estate.stinnett contends that his payments fall within this exception because his entitlement to disability payments is predicated on his inability to obtain earnings from services performed,and disability payments,by their very nature,are intended to be a substitute for earned wages.so,the argument goes,the disability insurance payments are the equivalent of earnings from services performed and are thus e
