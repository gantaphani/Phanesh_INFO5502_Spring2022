opinion of the court 
this appeal from an order of the district court affirming the bankruptcy court dismissal of a fraudulent conveyance claim brought against premium finance specialists pfs on behalf of the debtor,the personal business insurance agency pbi,by the bankruptcy trustee,james mcnamara the trustee,poses the question whether a court may consider petition events,in this case the appointment of the trustee,in evaluating a claim brought under of the bankruptcy code.
pbi was used as a pawn in an illegal scheme perpetrated by its ceo and sole owner,emil kesselring,who caused pbi to make payments totaling to pfs in putative repayment for loans that kesselring had fraudulently obtained from pfs.the trustee now seeks to recover those funds,arguing that the payments were a fraudulent conveyance under of the code.the district court determined that despite the fact that kesselring actions were adverse to pbi interests,under the sole actor exception detailed in official committee of unsecured creditors lafferty,cir,kesselring fraud must be imputed to pbi because he was its sole representative.on this basis,the district court reasoned that pbi owed pfs a debt,that the payments made to pfs were made in partial satisfaction of that debt,and therefore that pbi received a reasonably equivalent value for these payments,meaning that the transfers to pfs were neither constructively nor actually fraudulent.
the trustee responds that even if kesselring fraud was properly imputed to pbi,it can not be imputed to the trustee,who is bringing this claim on behalf of innocent creditors.he asserts that we must consider his claim in light of a event,namely his appointment as trustee in place of the bad actor kesselring,in determining whether the transfers were fraudulent under.the trustee urges that when we take his appointment into account,the imputation of kesselring fraud to pbi would lead to an inequitable to innocent creditors.he cites persuasive caselaw which holds that the invocation of the doctrine of imputation against a trustee should not be allowed when a bad actor has been removed and the defense is serving only to bar the claims of an innocent successor.
we find nothing in the language of that prevents a court from considering events,and so we may consider pbi claim in light of the appointment of the trustee.because we agree that imputing kesselring fraud and his debt to the trustee would lead to an inequitable result,we conclude that kesselring fraudulent acts and the debts he incurred can not be imputed to the trustee,and therefore that the district court erred in affirming the bankruptcy court dismissal of the trustee fraudulent conveyance claim.we will therefore reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the matter for further proceedings.
the debtor,pbi,was an insurance brokerage firm in the business of obtaining coverage for trucking companies and their cargo by placing such coverage with various insurers.between march and november,kesselring,the sole owner and chief executive officer of pbi,took advantage of pbi operating procedures to use the company in an illegal scheme.as a standard part of its business,pbi would sometimes obtain for its clients financing for the insurance premium payments necessary to secure coverage.pfs was one of two financing companies that pbi used for this purpose.usually,when a client requested financing,pbi would prepare an application and kesselring would either sign the application on behalf of the client,or obtain the client signature by delivering it a copy of the application.pbi would then send the application to pfs or the other finance company for approval.upon such approval,pfs would arrange to bill the borrower.pfs would transmit the loan monies to pbi by wire transfer or check and,normally,pbi would then transfer the funds,less its commission,to the insurer.
beginning in march,kesselring began to take advantage of this established procedure as a way to illegally obtain funds for himself.he prepared false applications for finance company loans in the name of actual pbi clients or fictitious entities,either forging the borrower signature or signing as the borrower.he then submitted the applications to pfs and obtained the loan proceeds.rather than paying for insurance coverage with these funds,however,kesselring pocketed the money.to avoid detection,kesselring caused pbi to make payments on the fraudulent loans using pbi funds.kesselring made a total of in such payments to pfs.
kesselring malfeasance was nonetheless uncovered and he was indicted by a grand jury for mail and wire fraud.in august,pbi chapter bankruptcy trustee,james mcnamara,filed a complaint against pfs,seeking to recover the funds kesselring had transferred to pfs pursuant to his illegal scheme.the trustee then filed an amended complaint,alleging a claim for fraudulent conveyance under and the pennsylvania uniform fraudulent conveyance act.et,and a second amended complaint,which added a claim of preference.pfs filed an answer to the second amended complaint and then moved to dismiss the fraudulent conveyance count of the second amended complaint.the bankruptcy court granted this motion on october.the trustee voluntarily dismissed the preference count of the second amended complaint,resulting in a dismissal of the action.the trustee appealed the bankruptcy court decision to the district court,which affirmed,and he now appeals to this court.

under of the bankruptcy code,a conveyance is fraudulent,and therefore avoidable,if it involved either actual or constructive fraud actual fraud occurs when the debtor makes the transfer with the intent to hinder,delay,or defraud creditors,and constructive fraud occurs when the debtor receives less than a reasonably equivalent value for a transfer and either is insolvent at the time of transfer,or becomes insolvent because of it.the bankruptcy court determined that the transfers in question in this case were neither actually nor constructively fraudulent because they were made in repayment of a debt owed to pfs.the district court agreed and rejected the trustee argument that kesselring fraudulent conduct can not be imputed to the corporation and that the debt was kesselring alone.in rejecting this argument,the district court was guided by the analysis laid out in waslow grant thornton in re jack greenberg,in which the court held that 
the fraud of an officer of a corporation is imputed to the corporation when the officer fraudulent conduct was in the course of his employment,and for the benefit of the corporation.this is true even if the officer conduct was unauthorized,effected for his own benefit but clothed with apparent authority of the corporation,or contrary to instructions.the underlying reason is that a corporation can speak and act only through its agents and so must be accountable for any acts committed by one of its agents within his actual or apparent scope of authority and while transacting corporate business.
quoting rochez,rhoades,cir.
the district court correctly found that the first prong of this test was satisfied because kesselring committed the fraud in the course of his employment applying for loans from pfs was part of kesselring standard work at pbi.the second prong proved more difficult,however.under what is known as the adverse interest exception,fraudulent conduct will not be imputed if the officer interests were adverse to the corporation and not for the benefit of the corporation.lafferty,at citations omitted.this exception applied to the situation at hand,as kesselring illegal actions redounded only to his own benefit,not to the corporation.there is however,an exception to this exception,whic
